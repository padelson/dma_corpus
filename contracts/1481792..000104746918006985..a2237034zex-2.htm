AGREEMENT 

  

 The parties to this Agreement, intending to be legally bound, agree as follows: 

  

    
Article I 

THE MERGER 

  

    Section 1.1 _ Merger of Merger Sub into the Company. _ 

  

 (a) Upon the terms and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in this Agreement and in accordance with the DGCL, at the Effective Time, (i) Merger Sub shall be merged      

with and into the Company, and the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub
shall cease thereupon and (ii) the Company shall be the surviving entity in
the Merger (the "Surviving Company") and shall continue its existence under
the DGCL. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in this Agreement and
the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, at the Effective Time, (A) all rights, privileges and powers,
property, real, personal and mixed, and all debts due to Merger Sub and the
Company, as well as all causes of action belonging to Merger Sub and the
Company, shall be vested in the Surviving Company and shall thereafter be the
property of the Surviving Company and (B) all debts, liabilities and duties
of Merger Sub and the Company shall attach to the Surviving Company and may be
enforced against it to the same extent as if such debts, liabilities and
duties had been incurred or contracted by it.

  

 (b) The consummation of the Merger (the "Closing") shall occur at 7:00 a.m. Central time on the second (2nd) business day following the day on which the last to be satisfied of the conditions set forth in _Article VII_ (other than those conditions that by their nature must be satisfied or, to the extent permitted hereunder, waived at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions) shall be satisfied or waived in accordance with this Agreement, or at such other place, time and date as Parent and the Company shall agree in writing. The date on which the Closing occurs is hereinafter referred to as the "Closing Date". The parties intend that the Closing shall be effected, to the extent practicable, by conference call, the electronic delivery of documents and the prior physical exchange of certain other documents to be held in trust by outside counsel to the recipient party pending authorization by the delivering party (or its outside counsel) of their release at the Closing. To the extent necessary, the Closing shall be held at the offices of Foley and Lardner LLP, 777 East Wisconsin Avenue, Milwaukee, Wisconsin 53202 or such other place as Parent and the Company shall agree in writing. 

  

 (c) At or promptly following the Closing, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing a certificate of merger (the "Certificate of Merger"), with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in such form as required by, and executed in accordance with, the provisions of Section 251 of the DGCL, and make any other filings, recordings or publications required to be made. The Merger shall become effective at the time that the Certificate of Merger is duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, or such later time as is agreed upon in writing by the parties hereto and specified in the Certificate of Merger. The time when the Merger becomes effective is hereinafter referred to as the "Effective Time." 

  

    
 Section 1.2 _ Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws; Directors and Officers. _ Unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Company and Parent prior to the Effective Time: 

   

 (a) at the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Company shall be amended and restated in its entirety to read as set forth in _Exhibit B_, until thereafter duly amended, restated or amended and restated as provided therein or by applicable Law; 

  

 (b) the parties shall take all necessary actions so that, at the Effective Time, the bylaws of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Company until thereafter duly amended, restated or amended and restated as provided therein or by applicable Law, except with such name as Parent designates; and 

   

 (c) the parties shall take all necessary actions so that from and after the Effective Time, until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified, or until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the certificate of incorporation, bylaws and applicable Law, (i) the directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Company and (ii) the officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Company. 

        

    
 Section 1.3 _ Proxy Statement/Prospectus; Information Supplied; Company Stockholders Meeting; Parent Shareholders Meeting. _ 

  

 (a) As soon as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement, Parent and the Company shall prepare and file with the SEC the joint proxy statement to be sent to the holders of Shares relating to the Company Stockholders Meeting and the holders of the Parent Shares relating to the Parent Shareholders Meeting (as amended or supplemented from time to time, the "Proxy Statement/Prospectus"), and Parent shall prepare and file with the SEC a Registration Statement on Form S-4 (as amended or supplemented from time to time, the "S-4 Registration Statement", with the Proxy Statement/Prospectus constituting a part thereof), in connection with the issuance of shares of Parent Class A Common Stock constituting the Merger Consideration (the "Parent Share Issuance"). Parent and the Company each shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i) have the S-4 Registration Statement declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as reasonably practicable after such filing, (ii) clear the preliminary Proxy Statement/Prospectus with the SEC as promptly as reasonably practicable after the filing thereof, (iii) mail the definitive Proxy Statement/Prospectus to the holders of Shares and Parent Shares as promptly as reasonably practicable after the S-4 Registration Statement has been declared effective under the Securities Act and (iv) maintain the effectiveness of the S-4 Registration Statement for as long as necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

 (b) The Company and Parent each agrees, as to itself and its Subsidiaries, that none of the information supplied or to be supplied by it or its Subsidiaries for inclusion or incorporation by reference in (i) the S-4 Registration Statement will, at the time the S-4 Registration Statement becomes effective under the Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading and (ii) the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and any amendment or supplement thereto will, at the date of mailing to holders of Shares and Parent Shares and at the time of each of the Company Stockholders Meeting and the Parent Shareholders Meeting, or any adjournment or postponement thereof, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (A) the Company assumes no responsibility with respect to information supplied in writing by or on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and (B) Parent assumes no responsibility with respect to information supplied in writing by or on behalf of the Company for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the S-4 Registration Statement or the Proxy Statement/Prospectus. The Company and Parent each agrees that all documents that each is responsible for filing with the SEC in connection with the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement will comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable provisions of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations thereunder. 

  

 (c) The Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall cooperate with each other in the preparation of the S-4 Registration Statement, including the Proxy Statement/Prospectus required thereunder. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company and their respective counsels shall (i) be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, the S-4 Registration Statement, and any other documents related to the Company Stockholders Meeting, the Parent Shareholders Meeting or the Parent Share Issuance, prior to mailing or the filing thereof with the SEC, as applicable, (ii) provide any comments thereon as promptly as reasonably practicable and (iii) consider such comments in good faith in connection with any such document. Parent shall promptly notify the Company and its counsel of the time when the S-4 Registration Statement has become effective and of the issuance of any stop order or suspension of the qualification of the shares of Parent Class A Common Stock issuable in the Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction. Further, each party shall promptly notify the other parties and their counsel of the receipt of any written 

        

comments or other material communications such party or its counsel receives
from time to time from the SEC or its staff with respect to the S-4
Registration Statement or the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and shall provide
the other party with copies of any written responses to and telephonic
notification of any material oral responses received from the SEC or its staff
by such party or its counsel with respect to the S-4 Registration Statement
or the Proxy Statement/Prospectus. If, at any time prior to the time the
Company Stockholder Approval or the Parent Shareholder Approval is obtained,
any party shall become aware of the occurrence of any event or other
circumstance that requires an amendment or supplement to the S-4 Registration
Statement or the Proxy Statement/Prospectus so that the S-4 Registration
Statement or the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, as applicable, does not contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading, then such party shall notify the other party as promptly as
reasonably practicable thereafter, and Parent and the Company each shall use
its reasonable best efforts to, as promptly as reasonably practicable
thereafter, (i) prepare and file with the SEC such amendment or supplement
and (ii) mail such amendment or supplement to the holders of Shares and Parent
Shares, in each case, to the extent legally required.

  

 (d) As promptly as reasonably practicable after the SEC advises that it has no further comments to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and the S-4 Registration Statement is declared effective, the Company shall duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a special meeting of the holders of Shares (the "Company Stockholders Meeting") to consider and vote upon the adoption of this Agreement, including the Merger. Subject to _Section 5.3(e)_ and _Section 5.4_, the Company Board shall include the Company Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and, unless there has been a Company Adverse Change Recommendation permitted by and in accordance with _Section 5.3(e)_ and _Section 5.4_, shall use reasonable best efforts to solicit adoption of this Agreement by the holders of Shares and take all other actions necessary or advisable to secure the vote or consent of the holders of Shares required by applicable Law to obtain such approval. The Company shall keep Parent updated with respect to proxy solicitation results as reasonably requested by Parent. Once the Company Stockholders Meeting has been called and noticed, the Company shall not postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholders Meeting without the prior written consent of Parent, other than: (i) if as of the time for which the Company Stockholders Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy/Prospectus), the Company believes in good faith that there are insufficient Shares represented (either in person or by proxy) and voting to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval or to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the Company Stockholders Meeting, (ii) to ensure that any required supplement or amendment to the Proxy/Prospectus is provided to holders of Shares within a reasonable amount of time in advance of the Company Stockholders Meeting or (iii) as reasonably determined by the Company to comply with applicable Law. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cooperate with Parent to hold the Company Stockholders Meeting on the same day and at the same time as the Parent Shareholders Meeting as soon as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement and to set the same record date for each such meeting. If the Company Board makes a Company Adverse Change Recommendation, it will not alter the obligation of the Company to submit this Agreement to the holders of Shares at the Company Stockholders Meeting to consider and vote upon the adoption of this Agreement, unless this Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its terms prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting. 

  

 (e) As promptly as reasonably practicable after the SEC advises that it has no further comments to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and the S-4 Registration Statement is declared effective, Parent shall duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a special meeting of holders of Parent Shares (the "Parent Shareholders Meeting") to consider and vote upon the Parent Share Issuance. The Parent Board shall include the Parent Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and shall use reasonable best efforts to solicit approval of the Parent Share Issuance by the holders of Parent Shares and take all other actions necessary or advisable to secure the vote or consent of the holders of Parent Shares 

        

required by applicable Law to obtain such approval. Parent shall keep the
Company updated with respect to proxy solicitation results as reasonably
requested by the Company. Once the Parent Shareholders Meeting has been
called and noticed, Parent shall not postpone or adjourn the Parent
Shareholders Meeting without the prior written consent of the Company, other
than: (i) if as of the time for which the Parent Shareholders Meeting is
originally scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy/Prospectus), Parent believes
in good faith that there are insufficient Parent Shares represented (either
in person or by proxy) and voting to approve the Parent Share Issuance or to
constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the Parent
Shareholders Meeting, (ii) to ensure that any required supplement or
amendment to the Proxy/Prospectus is provided to holders of Parent Shares
within a reasonable amount of time in advance of the Parent Shareholders
Meeting or (iii) as reasonably determined by Parent to comply with applicable
Law. Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cooperate with the
Company to hold the Parent Shareholders Meeting on the same day and at the
same time as the Company Stockholders Meeting and to set the same record date
for each such meeting. If the Parent Board withholds, fails to include in (or
removes from) the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, withdraws, adversely qualifies
or modifies (or resolves, determines or proposes publicly to take any of the
foregoing) the Parent Board Recommendation to holders of Parent Shares to

The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. 

  

    
 Section 2.3 _ Delivery of Merger Consideration. _

 _Section 2.3(h)_ and _plus_ any dividends or distributions to which such
Holder is entitled pursuant to _Section 2.3(e) _.

  

 (b) With respect to the Certificate(s), after the Effective Time upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of its Certificate(s), accompanied by a properly completed Letter of Transmittal and such other documents as reasonably required by the Exchange Agent, a Holder of Certificate(s) will be entitled to receive, and Parent shall deliver, or cause the Exchange Agent to deliver, the Merger Consideration to be issued or paid in consideration therefor in accordance with this _Article II_, _plus_ , as applicable, any cash in lieu of fractional shares which the Holder has the right to receive pursuant to _Section 2.3(h)_ and _plus_ any dividends or distributions to which such Holder is entitled pursuant to _Section 2.3(e)_, in respect of the Shares formerly represented by its, his or her Certificate(s). Until so surrendered, each such Certificate shall represent after the Effective Time, for all purposes, only the right to receive, without interest, the Merger Consideration to be issued or paid in consideration therefor upon surrender of such Certificate and related documents in accordance with, and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Class A Common Stock and any dividends or distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to, this _Article II_. 

  

 (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, any holder of a Book-Entry Share shall not be required to deliver a Certificate or an executed Letter of Transmittal to the Exchange Agent to receive the Merger Consideration that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to this _Article II_, any cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to _Section 2.3(h)_ or any dividends or distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section 2.3(e) _, in respect of such Book-Entry Share. With respect to Book-Entry Shares not held through DTC (each, a "Non-DTC Book-Entry Share"), as promptly as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (and in any event within three (3) business days thereafter), Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Non-DTC Book-Entry Share (i) a statement reflecting the number of whole shares of Parent Class A Common Stock, if any, that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to this _Article II_ in the name of such record holder and (ii) a check in the amount of, as applicable, any cash in lieu of fractional shares which the Holder has the right to receive pursuant to _Section 2.3(h)_ and _plus_ any dividends or distributions to which such Holder is entitled pursuant to _Section 2.3(e)_.

 (e) No dividends or other distributions with respect to shares of Parent Class A Common Stock shall be paid to a Holder whose Shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration unless and until such Holder has surrendered or transferred (as applicable) its, his or her Certificate or Book-Entry Share, as applicable, and related instruments in accordance with this _Article II_. Subject to the effect of applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws, following surrender or transfer (as applicable) of any such Certificate or Book-Entry Share and related instruments in accordance with this _Article II_, such Holder shall be entitled to receive, without interest, (i) the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore payable with respect to the whole shares of Parent Class A Common Stock into which the Shares formerly represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share were converted in accordance with this _Article II_ and not paid and/or (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions payable with respect to shares of Parent Class A Common Stock into which the Shares formerly represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share were converted in accordance 

        

with this _Article II_ with a record date after the Effective Time (but
before such surrender date) and with a payment date subsequent to
the issuance of the Parent Class A Common Stock issuable with respect to such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share.

   

 (f) With respect to Certificate(s), in the event of a transfer of ownership of any Certificate that is not registered in the transfer books of the Company as of the Effective Time, the proper number of shares of Parent Class A Common Stock, together with a check for cash in lieu of fractional shares, if any (after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings) to be paid upon due surrender of the Certificate and any dividends or distributions in respect thereof, may be issued or paid to such a transferee if the Certificate is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer Taxes have been paid or are not applicable, in each case, in form and substance, reasonably satisfactory to the Exchange Agent. The Exchange Agent, Parent and the Surviving Company shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any cash in lieu of shares any Holder has the right to receive pursuant to this _Section 2.3(f)_, cash dividends or distributions payable pursuant to _Section 2.3(e)_ and any other cash amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any Holder such amounts as the Exchange Agent or Parent, as the case may be, is required to deduct and withhold under the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law, with respect to the making of such payment. To the extent the amounts are so withheld by the Exchange Agent, Parent or the Surviving Company, as the case may be, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of shares of Company Common Stock in respect of whom such deduction and withholding was made by the Exchange Agent, Parent or the Surviving Company, as the case may be. With respect to Book-Entry Shares, payment of the Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of fractional shares, if any, and any unpaid non-stock dividends and any other dividends or other distributions, in each case, payable or issuable pursuant to this _Article II_, shall only be made to the Person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares are registered in the stock transfer books of the Company as of the Effective Time. 

  

 (g) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of any Shares that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time other than to settle transfers of Shares that occurred prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any Certificate or Book-Entry Share is presented for transfer on the stock transfer records of the Company, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration to be issued or paid in consideration therefor in accordance with the procedures set forth in this _Article II_. 

  

 (h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Parent Class A Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender of Certificates for exchange, transfer of Book-Entry Shares or conversion of any Company Equity Awards, as applicable, no dividend or distribution with respect to Parent Class A Common Stock shall be payable on or with respect to any fractional share, and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a shareholder of Parent. In lieu of the issuance of any such fractional share, Parent shall pay to each Holder who otherwise would be entitled to receive such fractional share an amount in cash, without interest and rounded to the nearest whole cent, determined by _multiplying_ (i) the average of the volume weighted average price per share of Parent Class A Common Stock on the NYSE on each of the twenty (20) consecutive trading days ending with the second complete trading day prior to the Closing Date (the "Average Price") by (ii) the fraction of a share (after taking into account all shares of Company Common Stock held by such holder at the Effective Time and rounded to the nearest one thousandth when expressed in decimal form) of Parent Class A Common Stock to which such Holder would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to _Section 2.1(d) _ or _Section 6.2_. 

  

 (i) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by Holders nine (9) months after the Effective Time shall be promptly paid to Parent upon the request of Parent. Any Holders who have not theretofore complied with this _Article II_ shall thereafter look only to Parent with respect to the 

        

Merger Consideration, including any cash in lieu of fractional shares and any
unpaid dividends and distributions on the Parent Class A Common Stock,
deliverable in respect of each Share that such Holder holds as determined
pursuant to this Agreement, in each case, without any interest thereon.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, the Company, the Exchange Agent
or any other Person shall be liable to any Holder for any amount delivered in
good faith to any Governmental Body pursuant to applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Laws. To the fullest extent permitted by Law, immediately
prior to the date any Merger Consideration would otherwise escheat to or
become the property of any Governmental Body, such Merger Consideration shall
become the property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of
any Person previously entitled thereto.

  

 (j) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if reasonably required by Parent or the Exchange Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond in such amount as Parent may determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares and any dividends or distributions deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

 (iv) (A) the Company shall have provided to Parent in writing the material terms and conditions of the Superior Proposal and copies of all material documents relating to the Superior Proposal; (B) the Company shall have negotiated in good faith with Parent (and caused its Representatives to negotiate in good faith with Parent) during the five (5) business day period provided in the foregoing clause (iii) of this _Section 5.4(b)_ with respect to any proposed revisions to this Agreement or other proposals made by Parent, if any, so that the Superior Proposal would no longer constitute a Superior Proposal, if Parent, in its discretion, proposes to make such adjustments and (C) after considering the results of negotiations with Parent and taking into account the proposals made by Parent, if any, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and 

  

      

  

the Company Financial Advisor, the Company Board shall have determined in
good faith that the Superior Proposal remains a Superior Proposal, and after
consultation with the Company\'s outside legal counsel, that the failure to
approve or recommend or enter into a definitive agreement with respect to the
Superior Proposal would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the
Company Board under applicable Law.

  

  

Notwithstanding the foregoing, any material amendment to the Superior
Proposal shall be deemed to be a new Acquisition Proposal that is a Superior
Proposal for purposes of this _Section 5.4(b)_ and the Company shall again
comply with the provisions of this _Section 5.4(b)_ (except that any
reference to five (5) business days shall instead be three (3) business days).

same terms and conditions (subject to the adjustments required by this
_Section 6.2_ after giving effect to the Merger and the terms of the Company

 Section 6.3 _ Employee Benefits. _ 

  

 (a) Parent agrees that each employee of the Acquired Corporations at the Effective Time who continues to remain employed with the Acquired Corporations (a "Continuing Employee") shall be provided with (i) during the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on first anniversary of the Effective Time, (x) base salary or base wages that are no less favorable than the base salary or base wages provided by the Acquired Corporations to each such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time and (y) severance benefits that are no less favorable than the severance benefits provided by the Acquired Corporations to each such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) during the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the earlier of six (6) months after the Effective Time and the last day of the fiscal year in which the Effective Time occurs, retirement (excluding defined benefit pension benefits) and welfare benefits that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to those provided by the Acquired Corporations to such Continuing Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that the requirements of this sentence shall not apply to Continuing Employees who are covered by a collective bargaining agreement or to any Continuing Employee who voluntarily transfers to another position of employment with Parent or an Affiliate after the Effective Time or who voluntarily elects a reduced work schedule if, as a result of such change in status, the Continuing Employee\'s base salary will be modified or the Continuing Employee does not meet the eligibility requirements under which the employee benefits described above are provided. 

  

 (b) Parent shall use reasonable efforts to (i) cause any pre-existing conditions on limitations and eligibility waiting periods under any group health plans of Parent or its Affiliates to be waived with respect to the Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents, (ii) give each Continuing Employee credit for the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs towards applicable deductibles and annual out-of-pocket limits for medical expenses incurred prior to the Effective Time for which payment has been made and (iii) give each Continuing Employee service credit for such Continuing Employee\'s employment with the Acquired Corporations (to the extent such service was recognized under the Employee Plans) for purposes of vesting, allowances (including paid time off) and eligibility to participate under each applicable Parent benefit plan, as if such service had been performed with Parent, but not for purposes of benefit accrual under defined benefit pension plans, for purposes of qualifying for subsidized early retirement benefits or to the extent it would result in a duplication of benefits. 

   

 (c) Prior to the Effective Time, if requested by Parent in writing, to the extent permitted by applicable Law and the terms of the applicable plan or arrangement, the Company shall cause the Company\'s Savings Plan (the "Company 401(k) Plan") to be terminated effective immediately prior to the Effective Time. In the event that Parent requests that the Company 401(k) Plan be terminated, the Company shall provide Parent with evidence that such Plan has been terminated (the form and substance of which shall be subject to review and approval by Parent) not later than the day immediately preceding the Effective Time. The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to take such other actions in furtherance of terminating the Company 401(k) Plan as Parent may reasonably request. 

   

 (d) Prior to the Effective Time and thereafter (as applicable), the Company and Parent shall take any and all actions as may be required, including amendments to the Company 401(k) Plan and/or the tax-qualified defined contribution retirement plan designated by Parent (the "Parent 401(k) Plan") to (i) permit each Continuing Employee to make rollover contributions of "eligible rollover distributions" (within the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code, including of loans) in the form of cash, shares 

        

of Parent Class A Common Stock, notes (in the case of loans) or a combination
thereof, in an amount equal to the full account balance distributed or
distributable to such Continuing Employee from the Company 401(k) Plan to the
Parent 401(k) Plan and (ii) obtain from the IRS a favorable determination
letter on termination for the Company 401(k) Plan. Each Continuing Employee
shall be eligible (to the extent such Continuing Employee meets the generally
applicable eligibility requirements of the Parent 401(k) Plan after giving
effect to the service crediting provisions of _Section 6.3(b) _) to become
a participant in the Parent 401(k) Plan on the Closing Date or as soon as
administratively practicable thereafter.

  

 (e) Nothing contained in this Agreement is intended to (i) be treated as an amendment of any particular Employee Plan, (ii) prevent Parent, the Surviving Company or any of their Affiliates from amending or terminating any of their benefit plans in accordance their terms, (iii) create a right in any person to employment with Parent, the Surviving Company or any Subsidiary of the Surviving Company, it being understood that the employment of each Continuing Employee shall be "at will" employment, or otherwise prevent Parent, the Surviving Company or any of their Affiliates, after the Effective Time, from terminating the employment of any Continuing Employee or (iv) create any third-party beneficiary rights in any employee of the Acquired Corporations, any beneficiary or dependent thereof, or any collective bargaining representative thereof, with respect to the compensation, terms and conditions of employment and/or benefits that may be provided to any Continuing Employee by Parent, the Surviving Company or any of their Affiliates or under any benefit plan which Parent, the Surviving Company or any of their Affiliates may maintain. 

  

    
 Section 6.4 _ Plan of Reorganization. _ The parties intend the Merger to be a reorganization as defined in Section 368(a)(1) of the Code. The parties will file all Tax Returns consistently with such intention, and no party will take a position that is inconsistent with that intention (whether in audits, Tax Returns or otherwise). This Agreement is intended to constitute a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning of Section 1.368-2(g) of the income tax regulations promulgated under the Code. From and after the date of this Agreement and until the Effective Time, each party hereto will not knowingly take any action, or cause any action to be taken, which action would prevent the Merger from qualifying, as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. Following the Effective Time, none of Parent, the Surviving Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries shall knowingly take any action, or cause any action to be taken, which action would cause the Merger to fail to qualify as reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. 

  

    
 Section 6.5 _ Indemnification of Officers and Directors. _ 

  

 (a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent will, and will cause the Surviving Company to, (including by Parent providing sufficient funds to the Surviving Company or the applicable Subsidiary) indemnify and hold harmless each present and former director and officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and each other Person who, at the request or for the benefit of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, is or was previously serving as a director or officer, or is or was serving as a director, officer, member, trustee or fiduciary of another entity or enterprise (in each case, when acting in such capacity), determined as of the Effective Time (the "Indemnified Parties"), from and against any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys\' fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, penalties, amounts paid in settlement (including all interest, assessments and other charges) or liabilities incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent that the Company or the applicable Subsidiary of the Company would have been permitted under Delaware law and under its certificate of incorporation or by-laws or other governing documents in effect on the date of this Agreement to indemnify such Person (and Parent or the Surviving Company shall also advance fees, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorney\'s fees and disbursements) as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, provided the Person to whom expenses are advanced 

        

provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined
by a final and nonappealable judicial determination that such Person is not
entitled to indemnification hereunder or thereunder).

  

 (b) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under paragraph (a) of this _Section 6.5_, upon learning of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, shall promptly notify Parent thereof, but the failure to so notify shall not relieve Parent or the Surviving Company of any liability it may have to such Indemnified Party except to the extent such failure materially prejudices the indemnifying party. 

  

 (c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall, and if the Company is unable to, Parent shall cause the Surviving Company as of the Effective Time to, obtain and fully pay for "tail" insurance policies with a claims period of at least six (6) years from and after the Effective Time with respect to any claim related to any period of time at or prior to the Effective Time from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Company\'s current insurance carrier with respect to directors\' and officers\' liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance (collectively, "DandO Insurance") with benefits and levels of coverage no less favorable in any material respect to the Indemnified Parties than the Company\'s existing policies with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including in connection with this Agreement or the transactions or actions contemplated hereby); _provided_ , _however_ , that in satisfying its obligation under this _Section 6.5(c)_, neither Parent nor the Surviving Company shall be obligated to pay annual premiums in excess of 300% of the annual premiums currently paid by the Company for such insurance (the "Current Premium"), and if such premiums for such insurance would at any time exceed 300% of the Current Premium, then the Surviving Company shall obtain a policy that, in the Surviving Company\'s good faith judgment, will provide the maximum coverage available at an annual premium equal to 300% of the Current Premium. The provisions of the immediately preceding sentence shall be deemed to have been satisfied if prepaid "tail" or "runoff" policies have been obtained by the Company prior to the Effective Time, which policies provide such directors and officers with coverage for an aggregate period of six (6) years with respect to claims arising from acts or omissions that occurred at or before the Effective Time, including in respect of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that the amount paid for such prepaid policies does not exceed 300% of the Current Premium. If such prepaid policies have been obtained prior to the Effective Time, the Surviving Company shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to) maintain such policies in full force and effect for their full term, and continue to honor the obligations thereunder. 

  

 (d) Parent shall cause to be maintained in effect in the charter and organizational documents (or in such documents of any successor to the business of the Surviving Company) of the Surviving Company, as applicable, provisions no less favorable with respect to elimination of liability of directors, indemnification of the Indemnified Parties and advancement of fees, costs and expenses than are set forth in the Company Charter Documents as in effect on the date of this Agreement, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six (6) years following the Effective Time in any manner that would affect adversely the rights of the Indemnified Parties, unless such modification shall be required by Law. From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries to honor and comply with their respective obligations under any indemnification agreement with any Indemnified Party in effect as of (and disclosed to Parent prior to) the date hereof. 

  

 (e) If Parent, the Surviving Company or any of its respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving company or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Company, as the case may be, shall assume the applicable obligations set forth in this _Section 6.5_. 

        

 (f) The provisions of this _Section 6.5_ are (i) intended to be for the benefit of, and from and after Effective Time shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and (ii) in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such Indemnified Party may have under any certificate of incorporation or bylaws, by contract or otherwise. After the Effective Time, the obligations of Parent, and the Surviving Company under this _Section 6.5_ shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect the rights of any Indemnified Party to whom this _Section 6.5_ applies unless the affected Indemnified Party shall have consented in writing to such termination or modification (it being expressly agreed that the Indemnified Parties to whom this _Section 6.5_ applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this _Section 6.5_). 

  

    
 Section 6.6 _ Stockholder Litigation. _ Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall as promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any event within two (2) business days) notify Parent in writing of, and shall give Parent the opportunity to participate (at its own expense) in the defense and settlement of, any Stockholder Litigation; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall in any event control such defense or settlement; _provided, further_ , that neither the Company nor any Subsidiary of the Company shall settle or offer to settle any such Stockholder Litigation without the prior written consent of Parent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed (other than settlements of Stockholder Litigation that are solely for the payment of cash in an amount that does not exceed $1,000,000 in the aggregate). 

  

    
 Section 6.7 _ Disclosure. _ The initial press release regarding the Merger shall be a joint press release mutually agreed to by the Company and Parent. After the initial press release, Parent and the Company shall consult with each other, and provide reasonable time for review and comment, before issuing any press release or making any other public statement, scheduling a press conference or conference call with investors or analysts, or making any filings with any third party or any Governmental Body (including any national securities exchange) with respect to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and shall not issue any such press release or make any such other public statement without the consent of the other party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, except as such release or announcement may be required by applicable Law or the rules of a national securities exchange or trading market, in which case the party required to make the release or announcement shall consult with the other party about, and allow the other party reasonable time (taking into account the circumstances) to comment on, such release or announcement in advance of such issuance, and the party will consider such comments in good faith; _provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be required to consult with Parent before issuing any press release or making any other public statement (i) in connection with _Section 5.3_ or _5.4_ (to the extent expressly permitted pursuant to _Section 5.3_ or _5.4_ ) or (ii) with respect to a Company Adverse Change Recommendation effected in accordance with _Section 5.4(b)_. 

  

    
 Section 6.8 _ Takeover Laws; Advice of Changes. _ 

   

 (a) If any Takeover Law is or may become applicable to the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement or the Voting Agreement, then each of the Company and the Company Board shall grant such approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that the transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and the Voting Agreement and otherwise act to eliminate (or to the extent elimination is not possible, minimize) the effects of such Takeover Law on the foregoing.

 (a) Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to arrange financing on terms and conditions no less favorable to Parent than those described or otherwise contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letter (the "Debt Financing"), including using its commercially reasonable efforts to (i) negotiate definitive agreements with respect thereto on terms and conditions set forth therein and (ii) satisfy all conditions applicable to Parent in such definitive agreements that are reasonably within its control. Parent shall not permit any amendment or modification to be made to, or any waiver of any provision or remedy under, the Debt Commitment Letter without the Company\'s prior written consent if such amendment, modification or waiver would reasonably be expected to (i) reduce the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing (including by increasing the amount of fees to be paid or original issue discount as compared to the fees and original issue discount contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter on the date hereof) to a level that would be insufficient to enable Parent to complete the Merger and to satisfy the obligations of Parent under this Agreement, including refinancing the outstanding debt of the Company required in connection with the Merger or as otherwise contemplated by this Agreement and the paying fees and expenses in connection therewith, (ii) impose any new or additional material conditions precedent to the Debt Financing, (iii) adversely impact the conditionality, enforceability or availability of the Debt Financing in any material way or (iv) prevent, impair or delay the consummation of the Debt Financing; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent may amend or restate the Debt Commitment Letter or any other documentation in respect of the Debt Financing to (1) add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities as parties thereto who had not executed the Debt Commitment Letter as of the date hereof, (2) implement or exercise any "market flex" provisions contained in the Debt Commitment Letter as of the date hereof and (3) otherwise amend, modify or restate the Debt Commitment Letter in any manner not inconsistent with this sentence. Parent shall promptly deliver to the Company copies of any such amendment, modification or waiver. Parent shall provide the Company with prompt written notice (and, in any event, within two business days) of (i) any termination, repudiation, cancellation or expiration of the Debt Commitment Letter or any definitive agreement related to the Debt Financing, (ii) any material breach or default (or any event or circumstance that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would reasonably be expected to give rise to any material breach or default) under the Debt Commitment Letter or any definitive document related to the Debt Financing by any party to the Debt 

        

Commitment Letter or such definitive document related to the Debt Financing,
(iii) the receipt of any written notice or other written communication from a
financing source for the Debt Financing with respect to any actual,
threatened or potential material breach, default, termination or repudiation
by any party to the Debt Commitment Letter or any definitive document related
to the Debt Financing of any provisions of the Debt Commitment Letter or any
definitive document related to the Debt Financing; and (iv) of the occurrence
of an event or development that would reasonably be expected to adversely
impact the ability of Parent to obtain all or any portion of the Debt
Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter on the terms, in the
manner or from the sources contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter or the
definitive documents related to the Debt Financing, except with respect to any
portion of the Debt Financing that would not cause the Debt Financing to be
insufficient to enable Parent to complete the Merger and to satisfy the
obligations of Parent under this Agreement, including refinancing the
outstanding debt of the Company required in connection with the Merger or as
otherwise contemplated by this Agreement and paying the fees and expenses in
connection therewith. Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
(i) maintain in full force and effect the Debt Commitment Letter until the
funding of the Debt Financing at or prior to Closing and negotiate and enter
into definitive agreements with respect to the Debt Commitment Letter on
the terms and conditions contained in the Debt Commitment Letter (which may
reflect "market flex" provisions), (ii) satisfy on a timely basis all
conditions applicable to it in such definitive agreements that are within its
control (or, if deemed advisable by Parent, seek the waiver of such
conditions), (iii) upon satisfaction or waiver of such conditions, consummate
the Debt Financing and cause the lenders and other Persons committing to fund
the Debt Financing to fund such Debt Financing no later than the Closing, (iv)
enforce its rights under the Debt Commitment Letter (including by instituting
appropriate litigation in respect thereof) and (v) otherwise comply with its
obligations under the Debt Commitment Letter. Parent shall not release or
consent to the termination of obligations of the financing sources party to
the Debt Commitment Letter to the extent that such release or termination
would reduce the Debt Financing to a level that would be insufficient to
enable Parent to complete the Merger and to satisfy the obligations of Parent
under this Agreement, including refinancing the outstanding debt of the
Company required in connection with the Merger or as otherwise contemplated
by this Agreement and paying the fees and expenses in connection therewith
except to the extent contemplated thereby. In the event any portion of the
Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated
in the Debt Commitment Letter, (i) Parent shall promptly notify the Company
and (ii) Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable to arrange to obtain any such portion from the
same or alternative sources in an amount sufficient to enable Parent to
refinance any outstanding Indebtedness of the Company as contemplated by this
Agreement and the Debt Commitment Letter and any fees and expenses in
connection thereof on terms and conditions no less favorable to Parent (as
determined in the reasonable judgment of Parent) as promptly as reasonably
practicable following the occurrence of such event (the "Alternative Debt
Financing"); _provided_ that such Alternative Debt Financing shall not (i)
include any conditions to funding of the Debt Financing that are not contained
in the Debt Commitment Letter or (ii) reasonably be expected to prevent,
impair or delay the consummation of the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement. Parent shall promptly provide a true,
correct and complete copy of each alternative financing commitment in respect
of such Alternative Debt Financing ("New Debt Commitment Letter") to the
Company. In the event any New Debt Commitment Letter is obtained, (i) any
reference in this Agreement to the "Debt Financing" shall include the debt
financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter as such term is modified
pursuant to the immediately succeeding clause (ii), (ii) any reference in
this Agreement to the "Debt Commitment Letter" shall be deemed to include the
Debt Commitment Letter to the extent not superseded by a New Debt Commitment
Letter at the time in question, and any New Debt Commitment Letters to the
extent then in effect and (iii) any reference in this Agreement to any
"fee letter" shall be deemed to include the fee letters relating to the Debt
Commitment Letter to the extent not superseded by a or New Debt Commitment
Letter at the time in

        

question and any New Debt Commitment Letters to the extent then in effect.
The parties agree that Parent\'s execution of any amendment to or amendment
and restatement of the Debt Commitment Letter or a New Debt Commitment Letter
shall not materially expand the scope of the assistance required under
_Section 6.12(b)_ as compared to the assistance that would be required in
connection with the Debt Commitment Letter in effect on the date of this
Agreement and the related Debt Financing. Upon request of the Company, Parent
shall keep the Company reasonably informed on a reasonably current basis in
reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to arrange the Debt Financing
or any Alternative Debt Financing, and provide to the Company copies of the
material definitive documents (redacted to the extent necessary) for the Debt
Financing or any Alternative Debt Financing.

  

 (b) The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide, and to cause its Subsidiaries and Representatives to provide, at the sole expense of Parent, all cooperation reasonably requested by Parent in connection with the Debt Financing ( _provided_ that such requested cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries), including using its commercially reasonable efforts to (i) provide financial and other information relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the entities that have committed to provide or otherwise entered into agreements in connection with the Debt Financing in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby (the "Financing Parties") (including information to be used in the preparation of an information package regarding the business, operations, financial projections and prospects of Parent and the Company customary for such financing or reasonably necessary for the completion of the Debt Financing by the Financing Parties to the extent reasonably requested by Parent (including prior real estate title commitments, surveys, environmental reports and similar information)) to assist in the preparation of customary information documents to be used for the completion of the Debt Financing, (ii) participate in a reasonable number of meetings (including customary one-on-one meetings with the parties acting as lead arrangers for the Debt Financing and senior management and other Representatives, with appropriate seniority and expertise, of the Company), presentations, road shows, drafting sessions, due diligence sessions (including accounting due diligence sessions) and sessions with the rating agencies, subject to customary confidentiality provisions, (iii) assist in the preparation of (A) bank information memoranda and similar documents (including historical financial statements and information, and information necessary for Parent to prepare pro forma financial statements) for the Debt Financing and (B) materials for rating agency presentations, (iv) cooperate with the marketing efforts for the Debt Financing (including consenting to the use of the Company\'s and its Subsidiaries\' logos; _provided_ that such logos are used solely in a manner that is not intended to, nor reasonably likely to, harm or disparage the Company or its Subsidiaries), (v) execute and deliver (and use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain from its advisors), and cause its Subsidiaries to execute and deliver (or use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain from its advisors), customary certificates (including a certificate of the principal financial officer of the Company or any Subsidiary with respect to solvency matters), legal opinions or other documents and instruments relating to guarantees and other matters ancillary to the Debt Financing as may be reasonably requested by Parent, contingent upon the consummation of the Merger or any later time; _provided_ that no such bank information memorandum, rating agency presentation or other document shall be issued by the Company or its Subsidiaries, (vi) assist in (A) the preparation of, entering into and syndication of one or more credit agreements, security agreements, currency or interest hedging agreements or other agreements, including by (1) refraining from entering into any competing financing transactions (except to the extent permitted by _Section 5.2_) and (2) entering into, or causing its Subsidiaries to enter into collateral and guarantee, restricted subsidiary, or similar agreements in connection with Parent\'s debt documents, _provided_ that the Company may authorize and designate an officer of Parent to execute such agreements and (B) the amendment, termination or redemption of any of the Company\'s or its Subsidiaries\' existing credit agreements or senior notes, in each case, on terms satisfactory to Parent and that are reasonably requested by Parent in connection with the Debt Financing, _provided_ that no obligation of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under any such 

        

agreements or amendments shall be effective until the consummation of the
Merger or any later time, (vii) have the Company\'s independent accountants
provide their reasonable cooperation and assistance, (viii) provide
authorization letters to the Financing Parties authorizing the distribution of
information to prospective private side and public side lenders and containing
a representation to the Financing Parties that the public side versions of
such documents, if any, do not include material non-public information about
the Company or its Subsidiaries or their securities, (ix) cooperate
reasonably with Parent\'s financing sources\' due diligence, to the extent
customary and reasonable and to the extent not unreasonably interfering with
the business of the Company, (x) refrain from pursuing any financing
transactions that may delay, impede or otherwise adversely affect the Debt
Financing and other financings in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby (except to the extent permitted by _Section 5.2(a)(vii)_)
and (xi) assist the Financing Parties to benefit from the existing lending
relationships of the Company and its Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement, (1) nothing in this _Section 6.12(b)_ shall
require cooperation to the extent it would (i) subject the Company\'s or any

any actual or potential personal liability that is not covered by the
indemnities set forth herein, (ii) unreasonably interfere with the business or
operations of the Company or its Subsidiaries, (iii) reasonably be expected

as in effect on the date hereof, (iv) cause any representation, warranty,
covenant or other obligation in this Agreement to be breached or any closing
condition to fail to be satisfied, (v) require disclosure of information that,

Subsidiaries, acting in such capacity, shall be required to execute, deliver
or enter into or perform any agreement, document or instrument relating to any
financing, or adopt any resolutions or take any other actions approving any
such agreements, documents or instruments, unless such resolutions are

Subsidiaries and their respective Affiliates and Representatives shall not

statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. The parties acknowledge and agree that the provisions
contained in this _Section 6.12(b)_, represent the sole obligation of the
Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective Affiliates and Representatives
with respect to cooperation in connection with the arrangement of any
financing and no other provision of this Agreement shall be deemed to expand

letters of credit or release of liens and other security shall be conditioned
on the occurrence of the Closing and (B) Parent or one of its Subsidiaries
shall provide, or cause to be provided, all funds required to effect all such
repayment or cash collateralization of letters of credit.

 (i) by the Company by written notice to Parent in the event of a breach by Parent or Merger Sub of any representation or warranty or failure to perform or comply with any covenant or obligation contained in this Agreement that would result in any condition set forth in _Section 7.3_ not being satisfied and such breach or failure is not curable, or if curable, not cured by Parent or Merger Sub within the earlier of the second business day prior to the End Date and thirty (30) days after the Company gives Parent written notice of such breach or failure; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not be entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1(i)_ if the Company is in breach of its obligations under this Agreement such that Parent would be entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(h)_. 

  

    
 Section 8.2 _ Effect of Termination. _ If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 8.1_, this Agreement shall be of no further force or effect without liability of any party (or any Representative of such party) to each other party hereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that the provisions of this  _Section 8.2_, the penultimate sentence of _Section 5.1(a)_, _Section 6.12(c)_, _Section 6.13(c)_, _Section 8.3_, _Section 8.4_, _Article IX_ and the applicable definitions in _Exhibit A_ or elsewhere in this Agreement shall survive any termination hereof pursuant to _Section 8.1_. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, none of Parent, Merger Sub, or the Company shall be relieved or released from any liabilities or damages arising out of its intentional material breach of any provision of this Agreement, or any fraud; _provided_ , _however_ , that the failure of any party hereto to consummate the Merger on the date specified in _Section 1.1(b)_ shall constitute an intentional material breach by such party, and such party shall be liable to the other parties for such breach as provided herein notwithstanding any termination of this Agreement. The Confidentiality Agreement shall survive the termination of this Agreement and shall remain in full force and effect in accordance with its terms. 

  

    
 Section 8.3 _ Company Termination Fee. _ 

  

 (a) Except as otherwise set forth in this _Section 8.3_ and _Section 8.4_, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring such fees or expenses, whether or not the Merger is consummated.

 (ii) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 8.1(g)_; or 

  

      

  

 (iii) (A) this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the Company pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)_ or by Parent pursuant to _Section 8.1(h)_ (as a result of any material breach of _Section 5.3_ or _Section 5.4_), (B) after the date of this Agreement and at or prior to the time of the termination of this Agreement, a Third Party shall have publicly announced an Acquisition Proposal and such Acquisition Proposal shall not have been publicly withdrawn without qualification and (C) the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company consummates an Acquisition Proposal within twelve (12) months after such termination or the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company enters into a definitive agreement within twelve (12) months after such termination to effect an Acquisition Proposal ( _provided_ that, for purposes of this _Section 8.3(b)(iii)_, all percentages in the definition of Acquisition Proposal shall be replaced with 50%), _provided_ that no Termination Fee shall be payable pursuant to this _Section 8.3(b)(iii)_ if Parent would be or is required to pay the Regulatory Approval Reverse Termination Fee pursuant to _Section 8.4(a)_, 

  

  

then the Company shall pay to Parent a fee in an amount equal to $12,500,000
(the "Termination Fee") by wire transfer of immediately available
federal funds, free of costs and charges, to an account designated in writing
by Parent, and in each case, shall also pay all of the reasonable and
documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Parent or Merger Sub in

Acquisition Proposal or the consummation of an Acquisition Proposal. For the
avoidance of doubt, any payment made by the Company under this _Section
8.3(b)_ shall be payable only once with respect to this _Section 8.3(b)_ and
not in duplication even though such payment may be payable under one or more
provisions hereof.

   

 (c) The Company acknowledges and agrees that the agreements contained in this _Section 8.3_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, Parent and Merger Sub would not enter into this Agreement. If the Company shall fail to pay the Termination Fee when due, such fee shall also be deemed to include the costs and expenses incurred by Parent and Merger Sub (including fees and expenses of counsel) in connection with the collection under and enforcement of this _Section 8.3_, together with interest on such unpaid fee, commencing on the date that such fee became due, at a rate equal to the rate of interest published in the "Money Rates" section of _The Wall Street Journal_ in effect on the date such fee became due. 

  

    
 Section 8.4 _ Parent Termination Fee. _ 

  

 (a) If (i) the Company or Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)_ (due to an Order being in effect with respect to any of the Regulatory Approvals) or _Section 8.1(f)_ or (ii) the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(i)_ (as a result of any material breach by Parent of _Section 6.1_), and, in each of (i) and (ii), at the time of such termination, any of the conditions set forth in _Section 7.1(b)_ and _Section 7.1(d)_ shall not have been satisfied, and in addition, in the case of a termination under _Section 8.1(b)_, at the time of termination a Governmental Body shall have enacted such Order with respect to the Regulatory Approvals, then Parent shall pay to the Company a fee in an amount equal to $45,000,000 (the "Regulatory Approval Reverse Termination Fee") by wire transfer of immediately available federal funds, free of costs and charges, to an account designated in writing by the Company (x) in the case of a termination by the Company pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)_,  _Section 8.1(f)_ or _Section 8.1(i)_, within five (5) business days after such termination and (y) in the case of a termination by Parent pursuant to  _Section 8.1(b)_ or _Section 8.1(f)_, concurrently with termination of this Agreement. 

  

 (b) Parent acknowledges and agrees that the agreements contained in this _Section 8.4_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, 

        

the Company would not enter into this Agreement. If Parent shall fail to pay
the Regulatory Approval Reverse Termination Fee when due, such fee shall also
be deemed to include the costs and expenses incurred by the Company
(including fees and expenses of counsel) in connection with the collection
under and enforcement of this _Section 8.4_, together with interest on such
unpaid fee, commencing on the date that such fee became due, at a rate equal
to the rate of interest published in the "Money Rates" section of _The Wall
Street Journal_ in effect on the date such fee became due.

INDIRECTLY, IN CONNECTION WITH, ARISING OUT OF OR OTHERWISE RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT, ANY INSTRUMENT OR OTHER DOCUMENT DELIVERED PURSUANT TO THIS
AGREEMENT OR THE MERGER. EACH PARTY HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGES AND CERTIFIES (i)

 Section 9.9 _ Cooperation. _ The parties agree to reasonably cooperate with each other and to execute and deliver such further documents, certificates, agreements and instruments and to take such other actions as may be reasonably requested by the parties to evidence or reflect the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to carry out the intent and purposes of this Agreement, in each case, to the extent not inconsistent with any other provision of this Agreement. 

  

    
 Section 9.10 _ Severability. _ If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is not affected in any manner adverse to any party, and the remainder of this Agreement and the application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances shall not be affected by such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability, nor shall such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability affect the validity, legality or enforceability of such provision, or the application of such provision, in any other jurisdiction. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are fulfilled to the extent possible. 

   

    
 Section 9.11 _ Construction. _ 

  

 (a) For purposes of this Agreement, whenever the context requires: the singular number shall include the plural, and vice versa; the masculine gender shall include the feminine and neuter genders; the feminine gender shall include the masculine and neuter genders; and the neuter gender shall include masculine and feminine genders. 

  

 (b) The parties hereto agree that any rule of construction to the effect that ambiguities are to be resolved against the drafting party shall not be applied in the construction or interpretation of this Agreement. The defined terms contained in this Agreement are applicable to the singular, as well as to the plural forms of such terms. References to any statute, rule, regulation or Law shall be deemed to 

        

refer to all applicable Laws as amended or supplemented from time to time and
to any rules, regulations and interpretations promulgated thereunder. All
references to "dollars" or "$" in this Agreement are to United States
dollars. References to any agreement or Contract are to that agreement or
Contract as amended, modified or supplemented from time to time, in accordance
with its terms. References to any Person include the successors and permitted
assigns of that Person. The word "extent" in the phrase "to the extent" means
the degree to which a subject or other thing extends, and such phrase does
not simply mean "if."

  

 (c) As used in this Agreement, the words "include" and "including," and variations thereof, shall not be deemed to be terms of limitation, but rather shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation."
