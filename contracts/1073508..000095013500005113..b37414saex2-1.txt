result in a material breach by such Party of, or a failure by such Party to

person or entity (other than the Buyer or an affiliate, associate,
representative or agent of the Buyer) concerning any merger, consolidation,
sale of material assets, tender offer, recapitalization, accumulation of
shares of stock of any Seller, proxy solicitation or other business
combination involving Seller or any Subsidiary or any division of any Seller
or any Subsidiary or any of their respective businesses relating to the

the Bankruptcy Court pursuant to the Section 363 sale process contemplated by
this Agreement or (b) provide any non-public information concerning the
business, properties or assets of any Seller to any person or entity (other

from giving notice or providing information, including non-
public information, to any persons who may seek to make a proposal as part of
the Section 363 sale process contemplated by this Agreement (the
"Exclusivity Provision"); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Sellers shall be entitled to give such notice of whatever
buyer protections and/or bidding procedures order as the Bankruptcy Court
requires to respond to and discuss any Alternative Proposal, to provide
information, including due diligence materials and negotiate and discuss any
Alternative Proposal. The Sellers shall immediately notify the Buyer   - 23

Buyer with copies of any written proposals and a description of any verbal

least $200,000 in excess of the prior offer (in any event, the Buyer
shall have the right to match any competitive offers and any and all
increases thereof) (collectively, the "Overbid Provisions").   4.9 BREAKUP
FEE PROVISIONS. In the event that the Sellers sell or otherwise transfer all
or any substantial portion of the Acquired Assets as part of a sale approved

otherwise to any party other than the Buyer, then the Sellers shall pay to
the Buyer, within two business days after the closing of such sale

incurred by the Buyer in pursuing and negotiating this Agreement and the

ASSERTING CLAIMS.   (a) All claims for indemnification by any indemnified
party pursuant to this Article VIII shall be made in accordance with the
provisions of this Section 8.2.   (b) If a third party asserts that an
indemnified party is liable to such third party for a monetary or other
obligation which may constitute or result in Damages for which the
indemnified party may be entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Article
VIII, and the indemnified party reasonably determines that it has a valid
business reason to fulfill such obligation, then (i) the indemnified party
shall be entitled to satisfy such obligation, without prior notice to or
consent from the indemnifying party, (ii) the indemnified party may make a
claim for indemnification pursuant to this Article V, and (iii) the
indemnified party shall be reimbursed for any such Damages for which it is
entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Article VIII.   - 31 - 
33   (c) The indemnified party shall give prompt written notification
to the indemnifying party of the commencement of any action, suit or
proceeding relating to a third party claim for which indemnification pursuant
to this Article VIII may be sought. Within 20 days after delivery of such
notification, the indemnifying party may, upon written notice thereof to the
indemnified party, assume control of the defense of such action, suit or
proceeding with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party,
provided each indemnifying party acknowledges in writing to the indemnified
party that any damages, fines, costs or other liabilities that may be
assessed against the indemnified party in connection with such action, suit
or proceeding constitute Damages for which the indemnified party shall be
entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Article VIII. If no indemnifying
party so assumes control of such defense, the indemnified party shall control
such defense. The party not controlling such defense may participate therein
at its own expense; provided that if the indemnifying party assumes control
of such defense and the indemnified party reasonably concludes that the
indemnifying party and the indemnified party have conflicting interests or
different defenses available with respect to such action, suit or proceeding,
the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel to the indemnified party shall be
considered "Damages" for purposes of this Agreement. The party controlling
such defense shall keep the other party advised of the status of such action,
suit or proceeding and the defense thereof and shall consider in good faith
recommendations made by the other party with respect thereto. The indemnified
party shall not agree to any settlement of such action, suit or proceeding
without the prior written consent of each indemnifying party, which shall not
be unreasonably withheld. No indemnifying party shall agree to any settlement
of such action, suit or proceeding without the prior written consent of each
indemnified party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld.   8.3

of the Shares received from the Buyer ("Indemnification Termination Date").

stock of the Buyer, with United States Trust Company, as escrow agent, or
such other escrow agent as may be mutually agreed upon between the Parties,
who will keep the escrowed funds in an escrow account subject to Buyer rights
of indemnification pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement. Among other
things, the Escrow Agreement shall provide that any distribution of the
shares to the Buyer to satisfy any indemnification obligation shall be made
by releasing to the Buyer the number of shares held under the Escrow
Agreement which when multiplied by a share price of $8.571 per share
(regardless of the actual market valuation at that time), equals or exceeds
the amount of the indemnification obligation. If no claim is pending or been
asserted on the Indemnity    - 32 -  34  Termination Date, the escrow
shall be turned over to the Sellers in accordance with the terms of the
Escrow Agreement.   8.6 LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, the Buyer will not be entitled to any

excess of $50,000. In no event shall the indemnification obligations of the
Sellers or the Buyer under this Article VIII exceed the Purchase Price.  
8.7 EFFECT OF INSURANCE PROCEEDS. The liability of the Sellers with
respect to any indemnification claim will be reduced by any insurance
proceeds actually realized by the Buyer as a result of Damages upon which
such indemnification claim is based. The liability of the Buyer with respect
to any indemnification claim will be reduced by any insurance proceeds
