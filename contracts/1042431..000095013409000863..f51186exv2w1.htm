transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor a cash amount in immediately available funds (after giving effect to any required tax
withholdings as provided in Section&nbsp;2.2(f)) equal to (x)&nbsp;the number of Shares represented by such
Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu of the Certificate as provided in Section&nbsp;2.2(e))
multiplied by (y)&nbsp;the Per Share Merger Consideration, and the Certificate so surrendered shall
forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due
surrender of the Certificates. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that is not

surrender of the Certificate may be issued to such transferee if the Certificate formerly
representing such Shares is presented to the Paying Agent, accompanied by all documents required to

been paid or are not applicable.

shall be cancelled and exchanged for the cash amount in

Company for 365&nbsp;days after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Entity. Any
holder of Shares (other than Excluded Shares) who has not theretofore complied with this Article&nbsp;II
shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Entity and Parent for payment of the Per Share Merger

other applicable state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by
the Surviving Entity or Parent, as the case may be, such withheld amounts (i)&nbsp;shall be remitted by
Parent or the Surviving Entity, as applicable, to the applicable Governmental Authority, and (ii)
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Shares in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving Entity or Parent, as the
case may be.
