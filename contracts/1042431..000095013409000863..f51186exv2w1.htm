W I T N E S S E T H: 

   

 WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company have each approved, adopted and declared advisable this Agreement and the merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement; 

   

 WHEREAS, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company desire to make certain representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe various conditions to the Merger;

 WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, as a condition and inducement to Parents willingness to enter into this Agreement, certain stockholders of the Company have entered into a Voting Agreement (the " _Voting Agreement_ ") pursuant to which such stockholders are, among other things, covenanting to vote in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and otherwise to support the transactions contemplated hereby;

    #####

   ##### 

  

   

of the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Entity shall read as
follows: "The name of this corporation is Interwoven, Inc.". As so amended
and restated, the Certificate of Incorporation of the Company shall be
the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Entity until thereafter
changed or amended as provided therein or by the DGCL or other applicable

 (b) The By-laws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the By-laws of the Surviving Entity until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that the By-laws of the Surviving Entity shall be amended as necessary to comply with the obligations of the Surviving Entity set forth in Section 6.4 hereof. 

   

 1.6. _Directors_. The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Entity at the Effective Time until the earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly designated, as the case may be. 

   

 1.7. _Officers_. The officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Entity at the Effective Time until the earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, as the case may be. 

   

 _ARTICLE II_  

   

 _Effect of the Merger on the Capital Stock of the Constituent Entities;_ 
  _Exchange of Certificates; Company Stock Options_   

  

 2.1. _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, as a result of the Merger and without any action on the part of Merger Sub or the Company or the holder of any capital stock of Merger Sub or the Company or any other person: 

   

 (a) _Merger Consideration_. Each share (a " _Share_ " or, collectively, the " _Shares_ ") of the common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Company (" _Company Common Stock_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time other than (i) Shares owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any other direct or indirect subsidiary of Parent, and (ii) Shares owned by the Company or any direct or indirect subsidiary of the Company, and in each case not held on behalf of third parties (each, an " _Excluded Share_ " and collectively, " _Excluded Shares_ ") shall be converted into the right to receive $16.20 in cash from Merger Sub (the " _Per Share Merger Consideration_ "). At the Effective Time, all of the Shares shall cease to be outstanding, shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each certificate (a " _Certificate_ ") formerly representing any of the Shares (other than Excluded Shares) shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration, without interest. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (b) _Cancellation of Excluded Shares_. Each Excluded Share shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of the Excluded Share, cease to be outstanding, be cancelled without payment of any consideration therefor and shall cease to exist. 

   

 (c) _Merger Sub_. At the Effective Time, each share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into one share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Surviving Entity. 

   

 (d) _Dissenting Shares_. 

   

 (i) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, Shares that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by stockholders of the Company who have demanded and perfected appraisal rights for such shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (collectively, the " _Dissenting Shares_ " ) shall not be converted into or represent the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration. Such stockholders shall be entitled to receive payment of the appraised value of such shares of Company Common Stock held by them in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL, unless and until such stockholders fail to perfect or effectively withdraw or otherwise lose their appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL. All Shares held by Company stockholders who shall have failed to perfect or who shall have effectively withdrawn or lost their right to appraisal of such shares under Section 262 of the DGCL shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted into and to have become exchangeable for, as of the Effective Time, the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration in cash, without any interest thereon (subject to any applicable withholding taxes), upon the surrender or transfer, in the manner provided in Section 2.1(a), of the corresponding Certificate. 

   

 (ii) The Company shall give Parent (A) prompt notice of any demands for appraisal received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands, and any other related instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company and (B) the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the DGCL. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal or offer to settle or settle any such demands. 

   

 2.2. _Exchange of Certificates_. 

   

 (a) _Paying Agent_. On or promptly following the Closing Date, Parent shall deliver or cause to be delivered to a paying agent selected prior to the Closing Date by Parent with the Companys prior approval, which shall not be unreasonably withheld (the " _Paying Agent_ "), amounts sufficient in the aggregate to make all payments of the Per Share Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1(a) (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The Exchange Fund will be held in trust for the benefit of the holders of record of Shares (other than Excluded Shares). Any interest and 

   ##### 

  

   

other income resulting from such investment shall become a part of the
Exchange Fund, and any amounts in excess of the amounts payable under Section
2.1(a) shall be promptly returned to Parent. 

   

 (b) _Exchange Procedures_. As promptly as practicable (and in any event within two Business Days) after the Effective Time, the Surviving Entity shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of Shares (other than Excluded Shares) (i) a letter of transmittal in customary form specifying that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the Certificates as provided in Section 2.2(e)) to the Paying Agent, such letter of transmittal to be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent and the Company may reasonably agree, and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the Certificates as provided in Section 2.2(e)) in exchange for the Per Share Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu of the Certificate as provided in Section 2.2(e)) to the Paying Agent in accordance with the terms of such letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a cash amount in immediately available funds (after giving effect to any required tax withholdings as provided in Section 2.2(f)) equal to (x) the number of Shares represented by such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu of the Certificate as provided in Section 2.2(e)) multiplied by (y) the Per Share Merger Consideration, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of the Certificates. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, a check for any cash to be exchanged upon due surrender of the Certificate may be issued to such transferee if the Certificate formerly representing such Shares is presented to the Paying Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid or are not applicable. 

   

 (c) _Transfers_. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of the Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any Certificate is presented to the Paying Agent, it shall be cancelled and exchanged for the cash amount in immediately available funds to which the holder of the Certificate is entitled pursuant to this Article II. 

   

 (d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including the proceeds of any investments of the Exchange Fund) that remains unclaimed by the stockholders of the Company for 365 days after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Entity. Any holder of Shares (other than Excluded Shares) who has not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Entity and Parent for payment of the Per Share Merger Consideration (after giving effect to any required tax withholdings as provided in Section 2.2(f)) upon due surrender of such holders Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the Certificates), 

   ##### 

  

   

without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the
Surviving Entity, Parent, the Paying Agent or any other person shall be
liable to any former holder of Shares for any amount properly delivered to a
public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
Laws. 

   

 (e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such person of a bond in customary and reasonable amount and upon such customary and reasonable terms as may be required by Parent as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it or the Surviving Entity with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue a check in the amount (after giving effect to any required tax withholdings) equal to the number of Shares represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate multiplied by the Per Share Merger Consideration. 

   

 (f) _Withholding Rights_. Parent and the Surviving Entity shall each be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Shares such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), or any other applicable state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Surviving Entity or Parent, as the case may be, such withheld amounts (i) shall be remitted by Parent or the Surviving Entity, as applicable, to the applicable Governmental Authority, and (ii) shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Shares in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving Entity or Parent, as the case may be. 

   

 2.3. _Company Equity Awards; ESPP_. 

   

 (a) _Options_. At the Effective Time, all Company Stock Options outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time with an exercise price at or below $40.00 per share of Company Common Stock (a " _Lower Priced Option_ ") shall be assumed by Parent in accordance with, and to the extent provided in, Section 6.10. At the Effective Time, all Company Stock Options outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time with an exercise price in excess of $40.00 per share of Company Common Stock (a " _Higher Priced Option_ ") shall not be assumed by Parent and shall accordingly be cancelled with no cash or other consideration to be paid to the holders of such cancelled Company Stock Options. At the Effective Time, all of such Higher Priced Options shall cease to be outstanding, shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist. 

   

 (b) _Contingent Option Exercises_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or the Company Stock Plans, the Company shall be permitted to take such actions as it may deem necessary or appropriate to permit the exercise of all vested Company Stock Options (including Company Stock Options that will vest upon the consummation of the Merger) on a cashless basis contingent upon the Closing. With 

   ##### 

  

    

respect to each current or former employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries
who exercises one or more Company Stock Options on such a cashless basis, the
Company shall at the time of such exercise collect, either in the form of
cash or through the withholding of a portion of the shares of Company Common
Stock otherwise issuable upon such exercise, all federal, state and local
income, employment and other payroll withholding taxes at the
applicable rates and shall pay all such withholding taxes in cash to the
appropriate taxing authorities promptly when due. The holders of Company
Stock Options exercised on the foregoing basis shall be entitled to receive,
promptly following the Effective Time, cash in respect of each share
of Company Common Stock issued in connection with such cashless exercise, net
of any shares withheld to satisfy the applicable withholding taxes, in an
amount equal to the excess, if any, of (i) the Per Share Merger
Consideration, over (ii) the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock
at which such Company Stock Option was exercisable immediately prior to the
Effective Time. 

  

 (c) _Treatment of Company RSUs_. At the Effective Time, each Company RSU outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be assumed by Parent in accordance with Section 6.11.

Employee, including severance pay or any increase in severance pay upon
termination of employment after the date hereof, (ii) increase any benefits
otherwise payable under any Company Plan, (iii) result in the acceleration of
the time of payment or vesting of any such benefits under any Company

 (c) _Advice of Changes; Filings_. Each of the Company and Parent shall as promptly as practicable advise the other party orally and in writing upon obtaining Knowledge of (i) any representation or warranty made by it (and, in the case of Parent, made by Merger Sub) contained in this Agreement that is qualified as to materiality or Material Adverse Effect, as the case may be, becoming untrue or inaccurate in any respect or any representation or warranty that is not so qualified becoming untrue or inaccurate in any material respect or (ii) the failure of it (and, in the case of Parent, of Merger Sub) to comply with or satisfy in any respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that no such notification shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties (or remedies with respect thereto) or the conditions to the obligations of the parties under this Agreement. The Company and Parent shall promptly provide the other copies of all filings made by such party with any Governmental Authority in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. 

   

 5.2. _No Solicitation by the Company_. 

   

 (a) The Company agrees that neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries shall, nor shall it authorize or permit any of its or their respective directors, officers, employees or any investment banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other advisor, agent or representative of the Company or any Subsidiary (collectively, " _Representatives_ ") to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate, cause, or knowingly encourage or facilitate, any inquiries or the making of any proposal or offer that constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a Company Takeover Proposal or (ii) participate in any negotiations or substantive discussions regarding any Company Takeover Proposal, or furnish to any person any non-public information in connection with or in furtherance of, or otherwise cooperate with or knowingly assist any person in connection with, any Company Takeover Proposal. Without limiting the foregoing, it is 

   ##### 

  

   

agreed that any violation of the restrictions set forth in the preceding
sentence by any Representative of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
shall be a breach of this Section 5.2(a) by the Company. The Company shall,
and shall cause its Subsidiaries and instruct its Representatives to,
immediately cease and cause to be terminated all existing discussions
or negotiations with any person conducted heretofore with respect to any
Company Takeover Proposal and request the prompt return or destruction of all
confidential information previously furnished. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
at any time prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval (and in no
event after obtaining such Company Stockholder Approval), in response to an
unsolicited _bona fide_ written Company Takeover Proposal made after the date
hereof that the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation
with its financial advisor and its outside counsel) constitutes or could
reasonably be expected to lead to a Company Superior Proposal, the Company
may, if the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with
its outside counsel) that failure to take such action would be reasonably
likely to result in a breach of its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of
the Company under applicable Law, and subject to compliance with Section
5.2(c) and after giving Parent one Business Day written notice of such
determination, (A) furnish information with respect to the Company and its
Subsidiaries to the person making such Company Takeover Proposal (and its
Representatives) pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement not
less restrictive of such person than the Confidentiality Agreement;
_provided_ that all such information (to the extent that such information has
not been previously provided or Made Available to Parent) is provided or Made
Available to Parent, as the case may be, prior to or substantially concurrent
with the time it is provided or Made Available to such person, as the case may
be, and (B) participate in discussions or negotiations with the person making
such Company Takeover Proposal (and its Representatives) regarding such
Company Takeover Proposal, and otherwise cooperate with and assist the person
making such Company Takeover Proposal with respect to such Company Takeover
Proposal. 

   

 For purposes of this Agreement, " _Company Takeover Proposal_ " shall mean any inquiry, proposal or offer, whether or not conditional, with respect to a proposed or potential Acquisition Transaction from a person other than Parent or its Affiliates or their respective Representatives (in their capacities as such). An " _Acquisition Transaction_ " means (a) a merger, consolidation, dissolution, recapitalization or other business combination involving the Company or its Subsidiaries, (b) for the issuance of, in a single transaction or series of related transactions, 15% or more of the equity securities of the Company as consideration for the assets or securities of another person or (c) to acquire in any manner, directly or indirectly, in a single transaction or series of related transactions, 15% or more of the equity securities of the Company or assets (including equity securities of any Subsidiary of the Company) that represent 15% or more of the total consolidated assets of the Company, other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

   

 For purposes of this Agreement, " _Company Superior Proposal_ " shall mean any _bona fide_  written offer made by a third party, that if consummated would result in 

   ##### 

  

   

such person (or its stockholders) owning, directly or indirectly, greater than
50% of the Shares then outstanding (or of the surviving entity in a merger or
the direct or indirect parent of the surviving entity in a merger) or all or
substantially all of the total consolidated assets of the Company on terms
that the Company Board determines in good faith (following consultation
with its financial advisor and its outside counsel and in light of all
relevant circumstances, including all the terms and conditions of such
proposal and this Agreement) to (i) be more favorable to the stockholders of
the Company from a financial point of view than the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and (ii) be reasonably likely to be completed, taking into
account any financing and approval requirements and all other financing,
legal, regulatory and other aspects of such proposal. 

   

 (b) Neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) (A) withdraw (or modify in a manner adverse to Parent), or resolve to withdraw (or modify in a manner adverse to Parent), the approval, recommendation or declaration of advisability by such Company Board or any such committee thereof of this Agreement or the Merger (it being understood that taking a neutral position or no position with respect to a Company Takeover Proposal (other than in connection with a "stop, look and listen" or similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act) shall be considered an adverse modification), or (B) recommend, adopt or approve, or propose publicly to recommend, adopt or approve, any Acquisition Transaction (any action described in this clause (i) being referred to as a " _Company Adverse Recommendation Change_ ") or (ii) approve or recommend, or resolve to approve or recommend, or allow the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to execute or enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or other similar agreement constituting or related to, any Acquisition Transaction (other than a confidentiality agreement pursuant to Section 5.2(a)); _provided_ , that the foregoing shall not prohibit accurate disclosure (and such disclosure shall not be deemed a Company Adverse Recommendation Change for any purpose under this Agreement) of the fact that a Company Takeover Proposal has been made. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company Board may make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change if the Company Board determines in good faith (following consultation with its financial advisor and its outside counsel) that failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to result in a breach of its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that no Company Adverse Recommendation Change may be made in response to a Company Takeover Proposal until after 72 hours following Parents receipt of written notice from the Company (an " _Adverse Recommendation Notice_ ") advising Parent that the Company Board has determined that such Company Takeover Proposal is a Company Superior Proposal, that the Company Board intends to make such Company Adverse Recommendation Change and containing all information required by Section 5.2(c), together with copies of any written offer or proposal in respect of such Company Superior Proposal (it being understood and agreed that any amendment to the financial terms or other material terms of such Company Superior Proposal shall require a new Adverse Recommendation Notice and a new 72-hour period). During such 72 hour 

   ##### 

  

   

period, the Company shall, if so requested by Parent, negotiate in good faith
with Parent with respect to any revised proposal from Parent in respect of
the terms of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In making the
determination that a Company Takeover Proposal constitutes a Company Superior
Proposal, the Company Board shall take into account any changes to the terms
of this Agreement proposed by Parent (in response to an Adverse Recommendation
Notice or otherwise). 

   

 (c) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this Section 5.2, the Company shall promptly, and in no event later than 24 hours after any officer of the Company becomes aware of the receipt thereof by the Company, advise Parent orally and in writing of any request for information or other inquiry that the Company reasonably believes could lead to any Company Takeover Proposal, the terms and conditions of any such request, Company Takeover Proposal or inquiry (including any changes thereto) and the identity of the person making any such request, Company Takeover Proposal or inquiry. The Company shall (i) promptly keep Parent informed in all material respects of any material change in the status of, or any material modification or material amendment of any such request, Company Takeover Proposal or inquiry and (ii) provide Parent as soon as practicable copies of any written offer, all correspondence and any other written material sent or provided to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries from any person that describes any of the terms or conditions of any such request, Company Takeover Proposal or inquiry. 

   

 (d) Nothing contained in this Section 5.2 shall prohibit the Company from (i) taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii) making any required disclosure to the stockholders of the Company if, in the good faith judgment of the Company Board (after consultation with its outside counsel), failure to so disclose would be reasonably likely to result in a breach of its fiduciary duties or other obligations to the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law. 

   

 (e) Without limiting any other rights of Parent under this Agreement, neither any Company Adverse Recommendation Change nor any termination of this Agreement shall have any effect on any of the approvals or other actions referred to herein for the purpose of causing the Takeover Laws to be inapplicable to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, which approvals and actions are irrevocable.

it will: 

   

 (i) respond promptly to any comments from the Financial Services Authority (the " _FSA_ ") on the draft UK Class 1 Circular, provide copies of such comments promptly to the Company and its advisors, and consult with the Company in a reasonably timely manner as to the form and content of the UK Class 1 Circular;

 (c) Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent the Parent Directors from withdrawing or modifying or proposing to withdraw or modify their recommendation in favor the Parent Shareholder Approval (a " _Change of Parent Recommendation_ ") if, in the exercise of their fiduciary obligations as Parent Directors (as determined in good faith by the Parent Directors after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel) the failure to take such actions would be reasonably likely to result in a breach of the Parent Directors fiduciary obligations to Parent.

The UK Class 1 Circular and any Supplement will comply as to form with the requirements of the Listing Rules of the United Kingdom Listing Authority made pursuant to the Financial Services and Markets Act.

   ##### 

  

   

the reasonable judgment of the Company, such action would (a) result in the
disclosure of any trade secrets of third parties, (b) violate any contractual
obligation of the Company with respect to confidentiality, (c) jeopardize
protections afforded the Company under the attorney-client privilege or the
attorney work product doctrine, or (d) violate any Law. Except for
disclosures expressly permitted by the terms of the confidentiality
agreement, dated as of September 16, 2008, between Parent and the Company (as
it may be amended from time to time, the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "),
each party shall hold, and shall cause its Representatives to hold,

confidence in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement.

 6.4. _Reasonable Best Efforts_. 

   

 (a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of the parties agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including using reasonable best efforts to accomplish the following: (i) the taking of all acts necessary to cause the conditions to Closing to be satisfied as promptly as practicable, (ii) the obtaining of all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents and approvals from Governmental Authorities and the making of all necessary registrations and filings (including filings with Governmental Authorities) and the taking of all steps as may be necessary to obtain an approval or waiver from, or to avoid an action or proceeding by any Governmental Authority, (iii) the obtaining of all necessary consents, approvals or waivers from third parties and (iv) the execution and delivery of any additional instruments necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by, and to fully carry out the purposes of, this Agreement. In connection with and without limiting the first sentence of this Section 6.4, 

   ##### 

  

   

each of the Company and the Company Board and Parent and the Parent Board
shall (A) take all action reasonably necessary to ensure that no state
takeover statute or similar statute or regulation is or becomes applicable to
this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and (B) if any state takeover statute or similar statute
becomes applicable to this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, take all action reasonably
necessary to ensure that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such
statute or regulation on this Agreement, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing or
anything else to the contrary in this Agreement, nothing shall be deemed to
require Parent to (1) agree to, or proffer to, divest or hold separate any
assets or any portion of any business of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
or, assuming the consummation of the Merger, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, (2) not compete in any geographic area or line of business, (3)
restrict the manner in which, or whether, Parent, the Company, the Surviving
Entity or any of their respective Affiliates may carry on business in any
part of the world or restrict the exercise of the full rights of ownership,
(4) agree to any terms or conditions that would impose any obligations on
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or, assuming the consummation of
the Merger, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, to maintain facilities,
operations, places of business, employment levels, products or businesses or
any other restriction, limitation or qualification or (5) make any payments
that, in the case of any of clauses (1) through (5), would, or would
reasonably be likely to, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company and its Subsidiaries or on Parent and its
Subsidiaries (each, a " _Negative Regulatory Action_ "). 

   

 (b) Each of the parties hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i) cooperate in all respects with each other in connection with any filing or submission with a Governmental Authority in connection with the Merger and in connection with any investigation, approval process or other inquiry by or before a Governmental Authority relating to the Merger, including any proceeding initiated by a private party, and (ii) keep the other party informed in all material respects and on a reasonably timely basis of any communication received by such party from, or given by such party to, the Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ "), the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (the " _DOJ_ ")or any other Governmental Authority and of any material communication received or given in connection with any proceeding by a private party, in each case regarding the Merger. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (i) Parent and the Company each agree to file a premerger notification under the HSR Act within seven days after the date of this Agreement, and (ii) each of Parent and the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain promptly any clearance required under the HSR Act for the consummation of the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby, and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to comply promptly with any inquiries or requests for additional information from the FTC and the DOJ. No Party hereto shall independently participate in any meeting or discussion with any Governmental Authority in respect of any filings, applications, investigations, or other 

   ##### 

  

   

inquiry without giving the other Parties hereto prior notice of the meeting
and, to the extent permitted by the relevant Governmental Authority, the
opportunity to attend and participate (which shall be limited to outside
antitrust counsel only). Each party will consult with the other party in
connection with the preparation of all written presentations, memoranda,
briefs, arguments, opinions, proposals, or other written submissions to any
Governmental Authority that are prepared in connection with obtaining the
clearance required under the HSR Act for the consummation of the Merger and
the transactions contemplated hereby. 

   

 6.5. _Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance_. 

   

 (a) All rights to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts, omissions or other matters occurring or existing at or prior to the Effective Time now existing in favor of the current or former directors, officers and employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries (the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") as provided in the Company Certificate, the Company By-laws or any agreement between the Company and any Indemnified Parties (in each case, as in effect on the date hereof) shall be assumed by the Surviving Entity in the Merger, without further action, as of the Effective Time and shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms. Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless, and provide advancement of expenses to the Indemnified Parties to the same extent such persons have the right to be indemnified and held harmless, or have the right to advancement of expenses, by the Company pursuant to the Company Certificate, the Company By-laws or any agreement between the Company and any Indemnified Parties, in each case to the extent permitted by applicable Law. 

   

 (b) For six years after the Effective Time, the Surviving Entity shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Entity to) maintain in effect the Companys current directors and officers liability insurance in respect of acts, omissions or other matters occurring or existing at or prior to the Effective Time (including for acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby) covering the Indemnified Parties currently covered by the Companys directors and officers liability insurance policy (a correct and complete copy of which has been heretofore Made Available to Parent) on terms with respect to such coverage and amount no less favorable than those of such policy in effect on the date hereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent may substitute therefor policies of Parent containing terms with respect to coverage and amount no less favorable to such Indemnified Parties; _provided_ , _further_ , _however_ , that in satisfying its obligation under this Section 6.4(b), Parent shall not be obligated to pay aggregate premiums in excess of 250% of the amount paid by the Company in its last full fiscal year (the " _Maximum Premium_ "), it being understood and agreed that Parent shall nevertheless be obligated to provide such coverage as may be obtained for the Maximum Premium. In lieu of the foregoing, Parent or the Company shall be entitled to purchase an extended reporting period endorsement with respect to the Companys current directors and officers liability insurance (a " _Reporting Tail Endorsement_ ") providing the same coverage and 

   ##### 

  

   

amounts and containing substantially the same terms and conditions as the
current policies of directors and officers liability insurance maintained
by the Company, covering the period of six years after the Effective Time,
and maintain such endorsement in full force and effect for its full term. If
the Companys existing insurance expires, is terminated or canceled during
such six-year period or exceeds the Maximum Premium, the Surviving Entity
shall obtain, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Entity to obtain, as much
directors and officers liability insurance as can be obtained for the
remainder of such period for an annualized premium not in excess of the
Maximum Premium, on terms and conditions no less advantageous to the
Indemnified Parties than the Companys existing directors and officers
liability insurance. 

   

 (c) The covenants contained in this Section 6.5 are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties and their respective heirs and legal representatives, and shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which an Indemnified Party is entitled, whether pursuant to Law, contract or otherwise. Parent shall pay all expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees, that may be incurred by Indemnified Parties and their respective heirs and legal representatives in connection with their enforcement of their rights provided in this Section 6.5. 

   

 6.6. _Fees and Expenses_. All fees and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring such fees or expenses, whether or not the Merger is consummated, except that each of the Company and Parent shall bear and pay one-half of the fees and expenses (other than the fees and expenses of attorneys and accountants) incurred in connection with the printing and filing of the Proxy Statement with the SEC and any amendments or supplements thereto and the premerger notification and report forms under the HSR Act. 

   

 6.7. _Public Announcements_. Parent and the Company shall consult with each other before issuing, and give each other the opportunity to review and comment upon, any press release or other public statements with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger, and shall not issue any such press release or make any such public statement prior to such consultation, except as may be required by applicable Law, court process or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with, or regulations of, any national securities exchange or national securities quotation system (including the FSA/UKLAs Listing Rules and Disclosure and Transparency Rules), _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company need not consult with Parent in connection with any press release or public statement to be issued or made solely with respect to any Company Adverse Recommendation Change, any Acquisition Transaction or any Company Takeover Proposal. The parties agree that the initial press releases to be issued with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be in the forms heretofore agreed to by the parties. 

   

 6.8. _Stockholder Litigation_. The Company shall promptly advise Parent orally and in writing of any stockholder litigation against the Company and/or its 

   ##### 

  

   

directors relating to this Agreement, the Merger and/or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and shall keep Parent fully informed regarding
any such stockholder litigation. The Company shall give Parent the
opportunity to consult with the Company regarding the defense or settlement
of any such stockholder litigation, shall give due consideration to Parents
advice with respect to such stockholder litigation and shall not settle any
such litigation prior to such consultation and consideration. 

   

 6.9. _Employee Matters_. 

   

 (a) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall, if requested to do so by Parent with not less than five Business Days written notice, terminate its defined contribution 401(k) plans. Parent shall provide, or cause the Surviving Entity to provide, that the Employees are eligible to participate in a defined contribution 401(k) plan immediately following the Effective Time and that such defined contribution plan shall accept "eligible rollover distributions" for Employees from a terminated Company defined contribution 401(k) plan. 

   

 (b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall provide the employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries who remain employed after the Effective Time (" _Continuing Employees_ ") with substantially similar types and levels of benefits as those provided to similarly situated employees of Parent. With regard to any Company Plans for which service with Parent or any affiliate of Parent is relevant for purposes of eligibility to participate and vesting, including applicability of minimum waiting periods for participation, but not for benefit accrual or accrual rates, Parent shall treat and cause its corresponding benefit and equity compensation plans to treat the service of the Continuing Employees with the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company prior to the Effective Time as service rendered to Parent or any affiliate of Parent for purposes of eligibility to participate and vesting, including applicability of minimum waiting periods for participation, but not for benefit accrual or accrual rates. Following the date of this Agreement, the Company shall deliver to Parent a true and correct schedule setting forth such service for each employee of the Company. Parent shall ensure that (i) no Continuing Employee, nor any eligible dependents of a Continuing Employee who, at the Effective Time, are participating in the Company group health plans, shall be excluded from Parents group health plans, or limited in coverage thereunder, by reason of any waiting period restriction or pre-existing condition limitation and (ii) Continuing Employees are given credit for amounts paid under a Company Plan during the plan year that includes the Effective Time for purposes of applying deductibles, co-payments, and out-of-pocket maximums, as though such amounts had been paid in accordance with the terms and conditions of a similar benefit plan maintained by Parent for the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs; _provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall not be required to provide any coverage, benefits, or credit under clause (i) or (ii) above that is not permitted under the terms of Parents corresponding benefit plans. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (c) Parent or the Surviving Entity shall assume and honor in accordance with their terms all written employment, severance, retention and termination agreements (including any change in control provisions therein) applicable to Continuing Employees. 

   

 (d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained herein shall (1) be treated as an amendment of any particular Company Plan, (2) give any third party any right to enforce the provisions of this Section 6.9 or (3) obligate Parent, the Surviving Entity or any of their Affiliates to (i) maintain any particular Company Plan or (ii) retain the employment of any particular employee. 

   

 6.10. _Company Stock Options_. At the Effective Time, each Lower Priced Option outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (whether or not then vested or exercisable), together with each of the Company Stock Plans under which such Lower Priced Options are outstanding, shall be assumed by Parent subject to and in accordance with the following provisions: 

   

 (a) Each such Lower Priced Option so assumed by Parent under this Agreement (an " _Assumed Option_ ") shall continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms and conditions (including the terms and conditions set forth in the Company Stock Plan under which it was granted and the applicable stock option agreement) as are in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that (i) such Assumed Option shall be exercisable for that number of whole Parent Ordinary Shares equal to the product of the number of shares of Company Common Stock that were issuable upon exercise of such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio and rounded down to the nearest whole number of Parent Ordinary Shares, and (ii) the per share exercise price for the Parent Ordinary Shares issuable upon exercise of such Assumed Option will be equal to the quotient determined by dividing the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock at which such Assumed Option was exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole cent (or, if greater, the nominal value of Parent Ordinary Shares). It is the intention of the parties that the Company Stock Options assumed by Parent hereunder qualify, to the maximum extent permissible, following the Effective Time as "incentive stock options" as defined in Section 422 of the Code to the extent those Assumed Options qualified as incentive stock options prior to the Effective Time. 

   

 (b) None of the Higher Priced Options outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be assumed by Parent. Accordingly, the Company shall take all requisite or appropriate action, including appropriate action by the Board of Directors or Compensation Committee of the Board, to assure that each such Higher Priced Option, whether or not then vested or exercisable, shall terminate or expire at the Effective Time without any required consent or approval of the holder of the terminated or expired Company Stock Option and without any cash or other consideration payable to the holder of the Company Stock Option in connection with the termination or expiration of that Company Stock Option (subject to any right of the holder of such Company Stock Option 

    

-56- 

      

* * *

 

##### 

 

  

to exercise such Company Stock Option prior to the Effective Time), and the
holder shall as of the Effective Time cease to have any further right to
acquire any shares of Company Common Stock (and shall not obtain any right to
acquire any Parent Ordinary Shares) under such terminated or expired Company
Stock Option. 

   

 (c) For purposes of this Agreement, (i) " _Exchange Ratio_ " shall be equal to the quotient obtained by dividing the Per Share Merger Consideration by the Parent Fair Market Value, and (ii) " _Parent Fair Market Value_ " means the average of the volume weighted average selling price per share of Parent Ordinary Shares as quoted on the London Stock Exchange on the five consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day preceding the Closing Date (as converted to U.S. Dollars at the currency exchange rate as quoted in the New York edition of _The Wall Street Journal_ on the Effective Time). 

  

 (d) For so long as Parent Ordinary Shares are listed for trading on the London Stock Exchange or any other listing exchange, Parent shall cause all Parent Ordinary Shares issued with respect to each Company Stock Option so assumed to be admitted to the Official List of the United Kingdom Listing Authority and to trading on the London Stock Exchange or such other listing exchange prior to or upon issuance of any such Parent Ordinary Shares. 

  

 (e) No consent or approval of the holders of the Lower-Priced Options is required in connection with Parents assumption of those options in accordance with Sections 2.3(a) and 6.10. The Company Stock Plans and the agreement or agreements evidencing each outstanding Company Stock Option permit each of the actions contemplated by this Section 6.10. 

  

 (f) In the case of Lower Price Options granted under (i) the Interwoven Inc. 1999 Equity Incentive Plan, Inland Revenue Approved Rules for UK Employees, and (ii) the UK Subplan under the iManage, Inc. 1997 Stock Option Plan, Parent shall offer the grant of new stock options in consideration of the surrender of some or all of such Lower Priced Options on terms agreed with Her Majestys Revenue and Customs (an " _Approved Rollover Offer_ ") (unless such terms agreed with Her Majestys Revenue and Customs require the use of an exchange ratio materially more generous than the Exchange Ratio provided in Section 6.10(c) hereof), _provided_ , that if and to the extent that either no Approved Rollover Offer is made, or an Approved Rollover Offer is made but is not accepted by all or any of the holders of the relevant Lower Priced Options, the provisions of sub-paragraphs (a)  (e) above shall apply to such Lower Priced Options. 

  

 6.11. _Company RSUs_. At the Effective Time, each Company RSU outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not vested, shall be assumed by Parent in accordance with the following provisions: 

  

 (a) Each such Company RSU so assumed by Parent under this Agreement (an " _Assumed RSU_ ") shall continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms and conditions (including the terms and conditions set forth in the Company Stock 

   ##### 

  

 

Plan under which it was granted and the applicable restricted stock
unit agreement) as are in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time,
except that each Assumed RSU that vests shall be settled for that number of
whole Parent Ordinary Shares equal to the product of the number of shares of
Company Common Stock that were issuable upon settlement of such Company
RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio
and rounded down to the nearest whole number of Parent Ordinary Shares. 

   

 (b) For so long as Parent Ordinary Shares are listed for trading on the London Stock Exchange or any other listing exchange, Parent shall cause all Parent Ordinary Shares issued with respect to each Company RSU so assumed to be admitted to the Official List of the United Kingdom Listing Authority and to trading on the London Stock Exchange or such other listing exchange prior to or upon issuance of any such Parent Ordinary Shares. 

  

 (c) No consent or approval of the holders of the Company RSUs is required in connection with Parents assumption of the Assumed RSUs in accordance with this Section 6.11. The Company Stock Plans and the agreement or agreements evidencing each outstanding Company RSU permit each of the actions contemplated by this Section 6.11. 

  

 6.12. _Cooperation_. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries will, and will cause each of its Representatives to, use its reasonable efforts, subject to applicable Laws, to cooperate with and assist Parent and Merger Sub in connection with planning the integration of the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective employees with the business operations of Parent and its Subsidiaries. 

  

 6.13. _Operations of Merger Sub_. Prior to the Closing, Merger Sub shall not, and Parent shall not permit Merger Sub to, engage in any other business activities other than in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and the obtaining of financing for the consideration payable pursuant to Section 2.1(a). 

  

 6.14. _Financing Agreements_. 

  

 (a) Without the prior written consent of the Company, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed in situations where the matter for which consent is sought would not reasonably be expected to preclude or materially impede the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Parent shall not terminate the Placing Agreement or amend or modify any term of the Placing Agreement or agree to or permit any termination of the Placing Agreement or any amendment or modification to any term of the Placing Agreement, waive any provision or remedy under the Placing Agreement, or fail to enforce any of its rights or remedies under the Placing Agreement. Without the prior written consent of the Company, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed in situations where the matter for which consent is sought would not reasonably be expected to preclude or materially impede the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Parent shall not 

   ##### 

  

 

terminate the Loan Agreement or amend or modify any term of the Loan Agreement
or agree to or permit any termination of the Loan Agreement or any amendment
or modification to any term of the Loan Agreement, waive any provision or
remedy under the Loan Agreement, or fail to enforce any of its rights or
remedies under the Loan Agreement if any such action or failure to take action
would preclude or materially impede the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Parent shall keep the Company informed in all
material respects on a timely basis of any material modification or material
amendment to either of the Financing Agreements. Parent shall notify
the Company promptly (and in any event within two Business Days) of Parent
having Knowledge of (i) any inaccuracy in any representation or warranty in
the Financing Agreements of Parent or any other party to the Financing
Agreements, (ii) any breach of any covenant or agreement in either of
the Financing Agreements by Parent or any other party to either of the
Financing Agreements, (iii) the expiration, termination, modification or
amendment of the Financing Agreements, (iv) the existence of any fact, event
or circumstance that, individually or in the aggregate with all other
facts, events or circumstances, has had or would reasonably be expected to
have an adverse effect on Parents ability to obtain the financing
contemplated by the Financing Agreements, and (v) any proposal by any party
to a Financing Agreement to terminate, modify or amend such
Financing Agreement in any material respect. Parent shall use its reasonable
best efforts to (i) satisfy all conditions set forth in the Financing
Agreements, (ii) consummate the financings contemplated by the Financing
Agreements, including by complying with all reasonable requests or
requirements of the other parties to the Financing Agreements, (iii) perform
all of its obligations under the Financing Agreements, (iv) take any and all
other actions necessary or appropriate to consummate the transactions
contemplated by the Financing Agreements, and (v) not commit any breach of
or otherwise cause or permit any default under the Financing Agreements. 

   

 (b) If any portion of the financing contemplated by the Financing Agreements becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated in the Financing Agreements as in effect on the date hereof, or if any of the Financing Agreements shall be terminated or modified in a manner materially adverse to Parent for any reason, Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to arrange to obtain alternative financing from alternative sources in an amount sufficient to consummate the Merger (" _Alternate Financing_ "). Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all things necessary, proper or advisable to arrange promptly and consummate the Alternate Financing, including (i) using commercially reasonable efforts to (x) enter into definitive agreements with respect thereto; and (z) consummate the Alternate Financing at or prior to the Closing and (ii) seeking to enforce its rights under such agreements. In the event Alternate Financing is obtained and Parent enters into definitive agreements with respect thereto, references in this Agreement to the Financing Agreements shall be deemed to include such definitive agreements, as applicable. 

  

 (c) Parent and Merger Sub agree and acknowledge that, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement or the Financing Agreements to the contrary, 

   ##### 

  

 

(a) the respective obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to effect the Merger
will not be subject to the consummation of any of the
transactions contemplated by either of the Financing Agreements or to Parent
obtaining any of the financing contemplated thereby, (b) neither Parent nor
Merger Sub shall have any right to terminate this Agreement on account of the
termination of either of the Financing Agreements or the failure of Parent to
obtain any of the financing contemplated thereby or any other financing
necessary to enable Parent to pay the consideration payable pursuant to
Section 2.1(a), and (c) for the avoidance of doubt, the respective
obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to effect the Merger shall not be
affected or excused by the performance by Parent of its obligations under
Section 6.14(a) and (b), or by any failure of Parent to obtain the financing
contemplated by either of the Financing Agreements or by the Alternate
Financing.

Agreement. 

  

 (c) by Parent, if the Company shall have breached or failed to perform any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (A) would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in Section 7.2(a) or (b) and (B) is incapable of being cured, or is not cured, by the Company within 20 calendar days following receipt of written notice from Parent of such breach or failure to perform (a " _Company Material Breach_ ") ( _provided_ , that there is not then pending any Parent Material Breach);

   ##### 

  

 

amount that may be paid without violating the Laws of England and Wales, the
rules of the FSA/UKLA or the London Stock Exchange plc, then the amount of
the Parent Termination Fee shall be reduced to be equal to the maximum amount
that may be paid without violating the Laws of England and Wales, the rules
of the FSA/UKLA or the London Stock Exchange plc (in each case, such maximum
being that which may be paid without shareholder approval). 

   

 (e) The Company acknowledges and agrees that the agreements contained in Section 8.2 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, Parent would not enter into this Agreement.

 (g) Each of the parties hereto further acknowledges that neither the payment of the Termination Fee or the fee described in Section 8.2(b) by the Company nor the payment of the Parent Termination Fee by Parent is a penalty, but in each case is liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent or the Company, as the case may be, in the circumstances in which such fees are payable and which do not involve fraud for the efforts and resources expended and the opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision. 

  

 8.3. _Effect of Termination_.

 8.4. _Amendment_.
