AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION

 

THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION is made and entered into as of May
20, 2019, by and among Pivotal Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation ("
_Parent_ "), Pivotal Merger Sub Corp., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned
subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "), LD Topco, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (" _Company_ "), and Carlyle Equity Opportunity GP, L.P., a
Delaware limited partnership, solely in its capacity as the initial
Representative hereunder. The term " _Agreement_ " as used herein refers to
this Agreement and Plan of Reorganization, as the same may be amended from
time to time, and all schedules hereto (including the Company Schedule and the
Parent Schedule, as defined in the preambles to _Articles II_ and _III_
hereof, respectively). Each of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company and
the Representative shall be referred to herein, individually, as a " _Party_
" and, collectively, as the " _Parties_ ". Except as otherwise indicated,
capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined shall have
the meanings ascribed to them in _Section_ __ _ 8.2_.

RECITALS

 

A. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement and in
accordance with the Delaware General Corporation Law (the " _DGCL_ "), the
Parties intend to enter into a business combination transaction by which
Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company (with the Company being the
surviving entity of the Merger (" _Surviving Corporation_ ")) in exchange for
the Companys stockholders receiving shares of Class A common stock, par value
$0.0001 per share, of the Parent (" _Parent Common Stock_ ") as provided by
this Agreement (the " _Merger_ ").

B. The boards of directors of each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company have
determined that the Merger is fair to, and in the best interests of, their
respective companies and their respective stockholders.

C. The parties intend, by executing this Agreement, to adopt a plan of
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368 of the Internal Revenue Code
of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ ").

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the covenants, promises and
representations set forth herein, and for other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged, the parties agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

 

 _THE MERGER_

1.1 _The Merger_. At the Effective Time and subject to and upon the terms and
conditions of this Agreement and the applicable provisions of the DGCL, Merger
Sub shall be merged with and into the Company, the separate corporate
existence of Merger Sub shall cease and the Company shall continue as the
Surviving Corporation after the Merger and as a wholly owned subsidiary of
Parent.

 



1

    

1.2 _Effective Time; Closing_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, as soon as practicable on or after the Closing Date (defined
below), the parties hereto shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing
a Certificate of Merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") with the Secretary
of State of the State of Delaware, in accordance with the applicable
provisions of the DGCL (the time of such filing, or such later time as may be
agreed in writing by Company and Parent and specified in the Certificate of
Merger, being the " _Effective Time_ "). Unless this Agreement shall have
been terminated pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.1_, the consummation of the
Merger (the " _Closing_ "), other than the filing of the Certificate of
Merger, shall take place at the offices of Graubard Miller, counsel to
Parent, The Chrysler Building, 405 Lexington Avenue, New York, New York
10174-1901 at a time and date to be specified by the parties, which shall be
no later than the fifth (5 _th_ ) Business Day after the satisfaction or
waiver of the conditions set forth in _Article VI_ , or at such other time,
date and location as the parties hereto agree in writing (the " _Closing
Date_ "). Closing signatures may be transmitted by facsimile or by email pdf
files.

1.3 _Effect of the Merger_. At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger
shall be as provided in this Agreement and the DGCL. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time all
the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of each of the
Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts,
liabilities and duties of each of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the
debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

1.4 _Governing Documents_. At the Effective Time,

 

(a) the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be
amended and restated to be identical to the Certificate of Incorporation of
Merger Sub except that the name of the Surviving Corporation shall be that of
the Company; and

(b) the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated to
be identical to the Bylaws of Merger Sub except that the name of the Surviving
Corporation shall be that of the Company.

 

1.5 _Effect on Securities_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and this Agreement
and without any further action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub or the
Company or the holders of any of the securities of Parent or the Company, the
following shall occur:

 

(a) _Conversion of Company Stock_. Other than any shares to be canceled
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.5(d)_, each share of common stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of the Company (" _Company Stock_ ") issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time will be automatically converted, at
the Effective Time, into the right to receive that number of shares of Parent
Common Stock equal to the Exchange Ratio (the " _Per Share Merger
Consideration_ "). The aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration shall be paid
to the holders of Company Stock (the " _Company Stockholders_ ") in the
respective amounts set forth on _Schedule 1.5(a)_ hereto; provided that the
portion of the Per Share Merger Consideration comprised of Contingent Shares
shall only become issuable in accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 1.12_.

 



2

    

(b) _Adjustments to Merger Consideration_. The Per Share Merger Consideration
issuable pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 1.5_ shall be equitably adjusted to
reflect appropriately the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split,
stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities
convertible into shares of Parent Common Stock), extraordinary cash
dividends, reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination,
exchange of shares or other like change with respect to shares of Parent
Common Stock occurring on or after the date hereof but at or prior to the
Effective Time (or, as it relates to the Contingent Shares, prior to the date
of issuance of such shares in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 1.12_).

 

(c) _Fractional Shares_. No fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock will be
issued by virtue of the Merger, and each holder of shares of Company Stock
who would otherwise be entitled to a fraction of a share of Parent Common
Stock any time shares of Parent Common Stock are distributed to any such
Person pursuant to this Agreement (after aggregating all fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock that otherwise would be received by such holder in
connection with such distribution) shall, upon compliance with _Section_ __ _
1.6,_ receive from Parent, in lieu of such fractional share, one (1) share of
Parent Common Stock.

(d) _Cancellation of Treasury and Parent-Owned Stock_. Each share of Company
Stock held by the Company or Parent or any direct or indirect wholly-owned
subsidiary of Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled
and extinguished without any conversion or payment in respect thereof.

 

1.6 _Merger Consideration_ _Exchange Procedures_.

 

(a) _Exchange Procedures_. At the Closing, the Company Stockholders shall
deliver the certificates evidencing their shares of Company Stock (the "
_Company Certificates_ ") to Parent for cancellation, or in the case of a
lost, stolen or destroyed Company Certificate, will deliver to Parent an
affidavit (and indemnity if required) in the manner provided in  _Section_ __
_ 1.7_ below), together with a letter of transmittal in substantially the
form attached hereto as _Exhibit A_ (" _Letter of Transmittal_ "), and receive
in exchange therefor the Per Share Merger Consideration (other than the
Contingent Shares, which shall only become issuable in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 1.12_) and the certificates representing the Company Stock
shall forthwith be cancelled. Until so surrendered, outstanding Company
Certificates will be deemed, from and after the Effective Time, to evidence
only the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration as prescribed by
this Agreement.

 

(b) _Distributions With Respect to_ _Unexchanged_ _Shares_. No dividends or
other distributions declared or made after the date of this Agreement with
respect to Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time
will be paid to the holders of any unsurrendered Company Certificates with
respect to the Per Share Merger Consideration (including any
Contingent Shares, if and when issued) to be issued upon surrender thereof
until the holders of record of such Company Certificates shall surrender such
certificates. Subject to applicable law, following surrender of any such
Company Certificates, Parent shall promptly deliver to the record holders
thereof, without interest, the certificates representing the Per Share Merger
Consideration (including any Contingent Shares, if and when issued) issued in
exchange therefor and the amount of any such dividends or other distributions
with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to
such Merger Shares (including any Contingent Shares, if and when issued).

 



3

    

(c) _Transfers of Ownership_. If certificates representing Merger Shares are
to be issued in a name other than that in which the Company Certificates
surrendered in exchange therefor are registered, it will be a condition of the
issuance thereof that the Company Certificates so surrendered will be properly
endorsed and otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the persons
requesting such exchange will have paid to Parent or any agent designated by
it any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the issuance of
certificates representing the Per Share Merger Consideration (including any
Contingent Shares, if and when issued) in any name other than that of the
registered holder of the Company Certificates surrendered, or established to
the satisfaction of Parent or any agent designated by it that such tax has
been paid or is not payable.

(d) _Required Withholding_. Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
(or cause to be deducted and withheld) from any consideration payable or
otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as are required
to be deducted or withheld therefrom under the Code or under any provision of
state, local or foreign tax law or under any other applicable legal
requirement. Parent shall provide notice of any withholding that it intends to
make (or cause to be made) in connection with consideration payable or
otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement (other than any withholding
required in connection with amounts properly treated as compensation for
applicable Tax purposes) at least fifteen (15) days prior to the date of the
relevant payment, and the Parties shall (and shall cause their Affiliates
to) cooperate to minimize or eliminate any potential withholding. To the
extent such amounts are so deducted or withheld consistent with the terms of
this _Section_ __ _ 1.6(d)_, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes
under this Agreement as having been paid to the person to whom such amounts
would otherwise have been paid.

(e) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Stock_. All shares of Parent
Common Stock issued in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to
have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Company
Stock and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the records
of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Stock that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, Company Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for
any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this _Article
I_.

1.7 _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any Company
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, Parent shall issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Company Certificates, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the aggregate Per
Share Merger Consideration into which the shares of Company Stock formerly
represented by such Company Certificates was converted into and any dividends
or distributions payable pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.6(b)_; provided,
however, that, as a condition precedent to the delivery of such Per Share
Merger Consideration, the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Company
Certificates shall indemnify Parent against any claim that may be made against
Parent or Surviving Corporation with respect to the Company Certificates
alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed and deliver any Letter of
Transmittal reasonably required by Parent.

 



4

    

1.8 _Tax Consequences_. It is intended by the parties hereto that the Merger
shall constitute reorganization within the meaning of Section 368 of the
Code. The parties hereto adopt this Agreement as a "plan of reorganization"
within the meaning of Sections 1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3(a) of the United States
Income Tax Regulations.

1.9 _Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action_. If, at any time after the
Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the
purposes of this Agreement and to vest Surviving Corporation with full right,
title and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and
franchises of the Company and Merger Sub, the officers and directors of the
Company and Merger Sub will take all such lawful and necessary action.

1.10 _Representative_. The Company has designated Carlyle Equity Opportunity
GP, L.P. as the initial representative (the " _Representative_ ") to represent
the interests of the Persons entitled to receive Per Share Merger
Consideration as a result of the Merger, giving consents and approvals
hereunder (including amendments of this Agreement) and making those
determinations hereunder that are specifically reserved to the Representative
by the terms hereof. If such Person ceases to serve in such capacity, for
any reason, the Company (or, following the Closing, those members of the
board of directors of Parent who were members of the board of directors of the
Company prior to the Closing) shall appoint its successor. The Representative
shall (a) have no liability to Parent, the Company, any Subsidiary or
Affiliate of the foregoing or any equityholder of any of the foregoing
(including any Stockholder) with respect to actions taken or omitted to be
taken in its capacity as the Representative, except as agreed to by the
Stockholders in the Letter of Transmittal, and (b) be entitled to
indemnification by the Company against any loss, liability or expenses arising
out of actions taken or omitted to be taken in its capacity as
the Representative (except as agreed to by the Stockholders in the Letter of
Transmittal).

1.11 _Outstanding Company Derivative Securities_. The holders of all
outstanding options, warrants and other derivative securities of the Company
have executed agreements to exercise such securities prior to the Effective
Time without the payment of any consideration therefor by the Company other
than the issuance of Company Stock, it being the intention of the parties that
the only securities of the Company outstanding on the Closing Date shall be
Company Stock. Such exercises may be made contingent upon the occurrence of
the Closing. Effective as of the Effective Time, each Company Stock Option,
to the extent then outstanding and unexercised will be automatically cancelled
without consideration and without any liability to the Company.

 

1.12 _Contingent Shares_. The Company Stockholders shall be issued their pro
rata portion of an aggregate of 2,200,000 Contingent Shares if the reported
closing sale price of the Parent Common Stock equals or exceeds $13.50 per
share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations,
recapitalizations or other similar actions) for any consecutive twenty (20)
trading days during the five (5) year period following the Closing Date.
Contingent Shares shall be issued within ten days after such condition has
been satisfied with no action being required on the part of the Company
Stockholders (and the Parties hereby agree that the rights to receive the
Contingent Shares shall not be evidenced by negotiable certificates, and the
Parties will not take any action to make such rights "readily marketable" (as
such term is used in Revenue Procedure 84-42)). Any Contingent Shares payable
hereunder shall be treated as

 



5

    

 comprised of two components, respectively a principal component and an
interest component, the amounts of which shall be determined as provided in
Treasury Regulation Section 1.483-4(b) example (2) using the 3-month test rate
of interest provided for in Treasury Regulation Section 1.1274-4(a)(1)(ii)
employing the semi-annual compounding period. As to any such payment of
Contingent Shares to each former holder of Company stock, shares representing
the principal component (with a value equal to the principal component) and
shares representing the interest component (with a value equal to the interest
component) shall be represented by separate share certificates.

 

1.13 _Payment of Expenses_.

 

(a) At least three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company
shall provide to Parent a written report setting forth a list of all third
party fees and expenses incurred by the Company or the Stockholders in
connection with or in relation to the preparation, negotiation and execution
of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
(together with written invoices and wire transfer instructions for the
payment thereof), solely to the extent such fees and expenses will be unpaid
as of the close of business on the Business Day immediately preceding the
Closing Date, including, but not limited to, the: (i) fees and disbursements
of outside counsel to the Company, the Representative and Company management
incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and (ii) fees
and expenses of any other agents, advisors, consultants, experts, financial
advisors, brokers, finders or investment bankers employed by the Company or

lease and operate the properties it purports to own, operate or lease and to

currently in effect, have been heretofore made available to Parent or Parents
counsel.

 

(b) The Company is duly qualified or licensed to do business as a foreign
corporation and is in good standing in each jurisdiction where the character
of the properties owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of its

Company.

Subsidiaries supplied by the Company, or by any other Person acting on behalf
of the Company at its direction, in writing specifically for inclusion in the

(or any amendment or supplement thereto) is first mailed to the Parent
Stockholders, at the time of the Special Meeting or at the Effective Time,

Transmittal (with regard to the Stockholder delivering it), it is not relying
on any representations and warranties from any Person in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby.

shall not: (i) conflict with or violate Parents or Merger Subs Charter
Documents, (ii) conflict with or violate any Legal Requirements, or (iii)
result in any breach of or constitute a default (or an event that with notice

Merger Sub.

 

(b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub do
not, and the performance of their respective obligations hereunder will not,
require any consent, approval, authorization or permit of, or filing with or
notification to, any Governmental Entity, except (i) for applicable
requirements, if any, of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, state
securities laws, and the rules and regulations thereunder, and appropriate
documents with the relevant authorities of other jurisdictions in which Parent
is qualified to do business, (ii) for the filing of any notifications required
under the HSR Act and the expiration of the required waiting period
thereunder, (iii) the qualification of Parent as a foreign corporation in
those jurisdictions in which the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries
makes such qualification necessary, and (iv) where the failure to obtain such
consents, approvals, authorizations or permits, or to make such filings or
notifications, would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to (x) have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent or Merger Sub, or

Merger Sub from performing their material obligations under this Agreement on
a timely basis.

 

3.6 _Compliance_. During the past year and as of the date of this Agreement,
each of Parent and Merger Sub has complied with all, and is not in violation
of any, Legal Requirements with respect to the conduct of its business, or the

violations which, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and would
not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent or
Merger Sub. During the past year and as of the date of this Agreement, the
businesses and activities of Parent and Merger Sub have not been and are not
being conducted in violation of any Legal Requirements, except for violations
which, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent or Merger Sub. Neither
Parent nor Merger Sub is in default or violation in any material respect of
any term, condition or provision of any applicable Charter Documents. Except
as set forth in _Schedule_ _3.6_ ,

 



24

    

 within the past year, no written notice of non-compliance with any Legal
Requirements has been received by Parent or Merger Sub (and Parent has
no knowledge of any such notice delivered to any other Person).

3.7 _Parent SEC Reports and Financial Statements_.

 

(a) The Parent has timely filed all required registration statements, reports,
schedules, forms, statements and other documents filed by Parent with the SEC
since its formation (collectively, as they have been amended since the time of
their filing and including all exhibits thereto, the " _Parent SEC Reports_
"). None of the Parent SEC Reports, as of their respective dates (or, if
amended or superseded by a filing prior to the date of this Agreement or the
Closing Date, then on the date of such filing), contained any untrue statement
of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The audited
financial statements of Parent (" _Parent Audited Financial Statements_ ") and
unaudited interim financial statements of Parent (" _Parent Unaudited
Financial Statements_ " and, together with the Parent Audited Financial
Statements, the " _Parent Financial Statements_ ") (including, in each case,
the notes and schedules thereto) included in the Parent SEC Reports complied
as to form in all material respects with the published rules and regulations
of the SEC with respect thereto, were prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP
applied on a consistent basis in accordance with past practice during the
periods involved (except as may be indicated therein or in the notes thereto
and except with respect to unaudited statements as permitted by Form 10-Q of
the SEC) and fairly present (subject, in the case of the unaudited interim
financial statements included therein, to normal year-end adjustments and the
absence of complete footnotes) in all material respects the
financial position of Parent and Merger Sub as of the respective dates
thereof and the results of their operations and cash flows for the respective
periods then ended.

 

(b) Parent has established and maintains disclosure controls and procedures
(as defined in Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act). Such disclosure controls
and procedures are designed to ensure that material information relating to
Parent is made known to Parents principal executive officer and its
principal financial officer, particularly during the periods in which the
periodic reports required under the Exchange Act are being prepared. To
Parents knowledge, such disclosure controls and procedures are effective in
timely alerting Parents principal executive officer and principal financial
officer to material information required to be included in Parents periodic
reports required under the Exchange Act.

 

(c) Parent has established and maintained a system of internal controls. To
Parents knowledge, such internal controls are effective and sufficient to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of Parents financial
reporting and the preparation of the Parents financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

 

(d) There are no outstanding loans or other extensions of credit made by
Parent to any executive officer (as defined in Rule 3b-7 under the Exchange
Act) or director of Parent. Parent has not taken any action prohibited by
Section 402 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

 



25

Financial Statements: (i) arose from bona fide sales transactions in the
ordinary course of business and are payable on ordinary trade terms, (ii) are

accordance with their terms, except as such may be limited by bankruptcy,

generally, and by general equitable principles, (iii) are not subject to any
valid set-off or counterclaim to which Parent has been notified in writing as

contained therein, and (iv) are not the subject of any actions or proceedings
brought by or on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub as of the date hereof.

 

(f) To the knowledge of Parent, as of the date hereof, there are no
outstanding SEC comments from the SEC with respect to the Parent SEC Reports.
To the knowledge of Parent, none of the Parent SEC Reports filed on or prior
to the date hereof is subject to ongoing SEC review or investigation as of the
date hereof.

pursuant to Parents Charter Documents shall terminate, and as of the
Effective Time, Parent shall have no obligation whatsoever pursuant to

upon such Reviewable Document and give its consent to the form thereof, such

collect from the Trust Fund any monies that may be owed to them by Parent for
any reason whatsoever, including but not limited to a breach of this Agreement
by Parent or any negotiations, agreements or understandings with Parent
(whether in the past, present or future), and will not seek recourse against

addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.
Each Party agrees that it will not oppose the granting of specific performance
and other equitable relief on the basis that the other parties have an
adequate remedy at law or that an award of specific performance is not
an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity. The Parties
acknowledge and agree that any Party seeking an injunction to prevent breaches
of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 8.6_ shall not be required
to provide any bond or other security in connection with any such injunction.

 

8.7 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the internal law of the State of Delaware regardless of the
law that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of
law thereof.

8.8 _Consent to Jurisdiction; WAIVER OF TRIAL BY JURY_. Each of the parties
hereto irrevocably consents to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the
Delaware Chancery Court (or, if the Delaware Chancery Court shall be
unavailable, any other court in the State of Delaware or, in the case of
claims to which the federal courts have exclusive subject matter jurisdiction,
any federal courts of the United States of America sitting in the State of
Delaware) in connection with any matter based upon or arising out of
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, agrees that process
may be served upon them in any manner authorized by the laws of the State of
Delaware for such persons and waives and covenants not to assert or plead any
objection which they might otherwise have to such jurisdiction, venue and
manner of service of process. Each party hereto hereby agrees not to commence
any legal proceedings relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby in any jurisdiction or courts other than as
provided herein. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND
ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION BASED UPON, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED
TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

8.9 _Rules of Construction_. The parties hereto agree that they have been
represented by counsel during the negotiation and execution of this Agreement
and, therefore, waive the application of any law, regulation, holding or rule
of construction providing that ambiguities in an agreement or other document
will be construed against the party drafting such agreement or document.

8.10 _Assignment_. No Party may assign either this Agreement or any of its
rights, interests, or obligations hereunder without the prior written
approval of the other parties; provided, however, that the Company and its
Subsidiaries may collaterally assign any of its or their rights hereunder to
any of its debt financing sources. Subject to the first sentence of this
_Section_ __ _ 8.10_, this Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to
the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and
permitted assigns.

 

8.11 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto at any
time only by execution of an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each
of the parties. The

 



57

    

 approval of this Agreement by the stockholders of any Party shall not
restrict the ability of the board of directors of such Party to terminate this
Agreement in accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 7.1_ or to cause such Party to
enter into an amendment to this Agreement pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
8.11_.

 

8.12 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Closing, any party hereto
may, to the extent legally allowed, (i) extend the time for the performance
of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties hereto, (ii)
waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties made to such
party contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (iii)
waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions for the benefit of
such party contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a Party to any such
extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of such Party. Delay in exercising any right under
this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right.

8.13  _Currency_. All references to currency amounts in this Agreement shall
mean United States dollars.

8.14 _Schedules_. The information furnished in the Schedules is arranged in
sections corresponding to the Sections of this Agreement, and the disclosures
in any section of the Schedules shall qualify (a) the corresponding Section of
this Agreement and (b) other Sections of this Agreement to the extent
(notwithstanding the absence of a specific cross-reference), that it is
reasonably apparent on its face that such disclosure is also applicable to
such other Sections of this Agreement. The Schedules and the information and
disclosures contained in such Schedules are intended only to qualify and limit
the representations and warranties of the parties contained in this Agreement
and shall not be deemed to expand in any way the scope of any
such representation or warranty. The inclusion of any information in the
Schedules shall not be deemed to be an admission or acknowledgment that such
information is material or outside the ordinary course of business. The
inclusion of any fact or information in a Schedule is not intended to be
construed as an admission or concession as to the legal effect of any such
fact or information in any proceeding between any party and any Person who is
not a party.

 

8.15 _Nonsurvival_ _of Representations, Warranties and Covenants_. None of the
representations, warranties, covenants, obligations or other agreements in
this Agreement or in any certificate, statement or instrument delivered
pursuant to this Agreement, including any rights arising out of any breach of
such representations, warranties, covenants, obligations, agreements and
other provisions, shall survive the Closing, and they shall terminate and
expire upon the occurrence of the Effective Time (and there shall be no
liability after the Closing in respect thereof), except for (a) those
covenants and agreements contained herein (or in instruments executed
pursuant to this Agreement) that by their terms expressly apply in whole or in
part after the Closing and then only with respect to any breaches to the
extent occurring after the Closing and (b) this  _Article VIII_.

8.16 _Non-Recourse_. This Agreement may only be enforced against, and any
claim or cause of action based upon, arising out of, or related to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby may only be brought against,
the entities that are expressly named as parties hereto and then only with
respect to the specific obligations set forth herein with respect to such
party. Except to the extent a Party hereto (and then only to the extent of the
specific obligations undertaken by such party hereto), no past, present or
future director, officer, 

 



58

    

 employee, incorporator, member, partner, stockholder, Affiliate, agent,
attorney, advisor or representative of any Party hereto, any Affiliate of any
Party hereto or any of the foregoing shall have any liability (whether in
contract, tort, equity or otherwise) for any one or more of the
representations, warranties, covenants, agreements or other obligations or
liabilities of any one or more of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or
other party under this Agreement of or for any claim based on, arising out
of, or related to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.
