 2.12 _Tax Treatment_. The Integrated Merger is intended to constitute a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

The Company has delivered or made available to Parent complete and correct copies of (a) the certificates of incorporation and bylaws of the Company, in each case as in effect on the date hereof, and (b) all actions taken by written consent and all minutes (or, in the case of draft minutes or written consents, the most recent drafts thereof) of all meetings of the stockholders, the Company Board and each committee of the Company Board since January 1, 2006.

   ##### 

  

  

 (a) using its reasonable best efforts to cause the conditions to the Merger set forth in  _Article VII_ to be satisfied or fulfilled, including by filing as promptly as practicable after the date hereof with the SEC all annual, quarterly and current reports required to be filed by it under the Exchange Act for any and all periods ending prior to the Effective Time;

   ##### 

  

   

submit all applications, notices, petitions and filings, file or submit all
documentation, and use their respective reasonable best efforts to obtain as
promptly as practicable all clearances, permits, consents, approvals
and authorizations of all third parties and Governmental Authorities, in each
case which are necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as practicable and to comply with
the terms and conditions of all such clearances, permits, consents, approvals
and authorizations of all such third parties and Governmental Authorities. The
Company and Parent shall have the right to review in advance, and to the
extent practicable each will consult the other on, in each case subject to
applicable Laws and Orders, all the documentation and information relating to
the other party and any of its respective Subsidiaries, that appears in
any application, notice, petition, filing and documentation made with, or
written materials submitted to, any third party or any Governmental Authority
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In
exercising the foregoing right, each of the parties hereto shall act
reasonably and as promptly as practicable. Parent and the Company shall
promptly advise each other upon receiving any communication from any
Governmental Authority whose clearance, consent or approval is required to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement which causes such
party to believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that any clearance,
consent or approval required in order to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not be obtained or that the
receipt of any such clearance, consent or approval will be materially delayed
or conditioned. 

   

 (b) Each of Parent and the Company shall promptly (i) cooperate and coordinate with the other in the making and submitting the applications, notices, petitions and filings contemplated by this  _Section 6.3_, (ii) subject to applicable Laws and Orders, supply the other with any information that may be required in order to effectuate such applications, notices, petitions and filings, and (iii) supply any additional information that may be required or reasonably requested by any Governmental Authority in connection with such applications, notices, petitions and filings.

Each party hereto shall promptly inform the other party or parties hereto, as the case may be, of any communication from any Governmental Authority regarding any of the transactions 

   ##### 

  

   

contemplated by this Agreement. If any party hereto or Affiliate thereof
receives a request for additional information or documentary material from
any such Governmental Authority with respect to the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, then such party shall use its reasonable best efforts to
make, or cause to be made, as soon as reasonably practicable and after
consultation with the other party, an appropriate response in compliance with
such request. 

   

 6.4 _Anti-Takeover Laws_. In the event that any state anti-takeover or other similar statute or regulation is or becomes applicable to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Company, at the direction of the Company Board, shall use its reasonable best efforts to ensure that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and otherwise to minimize the effect of such statute or regulation on this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. 

  

 6.5 _Registration Statement; Proxy Statement/Prospectus_. 

   

 (a) As promptly as practicable after the execution and delivery of this Agreement, Parent and the Company shall prepare, and Parent shall file with the SEC, a Registration Statement on Form S-4 in connection with the issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock in the Merger (as may be amended or supplemented from time to time, the " _Registration Statement_ "). The Registration Statement shall include (i) a prospectus for the issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock in the Merger, and (ii) a proxy statement of the Company for use in connection with the solicitation of proxies for the Merger Proposal to be considered at the Company Stockholder Meeting (as may be amended or supplemented from time to time, the " _Proxy Statement/Prospectus_ "). Each of Parent and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to have the Registration Statement declared effective by the SEC under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after such filing with the SEC. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of the Company and Parent shall, and shall cause its respective representatives to, fully cooperate with the other party hereto and its respective representatives in the preparation of the Registration Statement and the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, and shall furnish the other party hereto with all information concerning it and its Affiliates as the other party hereto may deem reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with the preparation of the Registration Statement and the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, and any amendment or supplement thereto, and each of Parent and the Company shall provide the other party hereto with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon. As promptly as practicable after the Registration Statement is declared effective by the SEC, Parent and the Company shall cause the Proxy Statement/Prospectus to be disseminated to the stockholders of the Company. 

   

 (b) Unless the Company Board shall have effected a Company Board Recommendation Change in compliance with the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, the Proxy Statement/Prospectus shall include the Company Board Recommendation. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (c) Except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement or as may be required by applicable Law or Order, neither Parent nor the Company shall effect any amendment or supplement (including by incorporation by reference) to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Registration Statement without the prior consent of the other party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned); _provided, however_ , that the Company, in connection with a Company Board Recommendation Change, may amend or supplement the proxy statement for the Company pursuant to a Qualifying Amendment to effect such change, and in such event, the right of approval set forth in this _Section 6.5(c)_ shall apply only with respect to such information relating to the other party or its business, financial condition or results of operations, and shall be subject to the Companys right to have the deliberations and conclusions of the Company Board accurately described. A " _Qualifying Amendment_ " means an amendment or supplement to the proxy statement for the Company if and solely to the extent that it contains (i) a Company Board Recommendation Change, (ii) a statement of the reasons of the Company Board for making such Company Board Recommendation Change, and (iii) additional information reasonably related to the foregoing. 

   

 (d) The Registration Statement and the Proxy Statement/Prospectus shall comply in all material respects as to form and substance with the requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the information supplied or to be supplied by any party hereto for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Registration Statement shall not, at the time the Registration Statement is filed with the SEC or declared effective by the SEC or at the Effective Time, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The information supplied or to be supplied by any party hereto for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus shall not, at the time the Registration Statement is declared effective, on the date the Proxy Statement/Prospectus (or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto) is first mailed to stockholders, or at the time of the Company Stockholder Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The information supplied or to be supplied by or on behalf of either party hereto for inclusion in any filing pursuant to Rule 165 and Rule 425 under the Securities Act or Rule 14a-12 under the Exchange Act (each, a " _Regulation M-A Filing_") shall not, at the time any such Regulation M-A Filing is filed with the SEC, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Company shall notify each other as promptly as practicable upon becoming aware of any event or circumstance which should be described in an amendment of, or supplement to, the Registration Statement, Proxy Statement/Prospectus or any Regulation M-A Filing so that any such document would not include any misstatement of material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, and as promptly as practicable 

   ##### 

  

   

thereafter, an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such
information shall be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent required
by applicable Law or the SEC, disseminated to the stockholders of Parent
and/or the Company. Parent and the Company shall each notify the other as
promptly as practicable after the receipt by it of any written or oral
comments of the SEC or its staff on, or of any written or oral request by the
SEC or its staff for amendments or supplements to, the Registration Statement,
the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or any Regulation M-A Filing, and shall
promptly supply the other with copies of all correspondence between it or any
of its representatives and the SEC or its staff with respect to any of the
foregoing filings. Prior to filing the Registration Statement or mailing
the Proxy Statement/Prospectus to stockholders (or filing or mailing any
amendment thereof or supplement thereto), each of Parent and the Company, as
the case may be, (i) shall provide the other party with a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on such document or response, (ii) shall
include in such document or response all comments reasonably and
timely proposed by such other party and (iii) shall not file or mail such
document or respond to the SEC prior to receiving such other partys
approval, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed. 

   

 (e) Parent and the Company shall make any necessary filings with respect to the Merger under the Securities Act, the Advisers Act and the Exchange Act. In addition, Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to take all actions required under any applicable federal or state securities or Blue Sky Laws in connection with the issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock in the Merger.

 (b) The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to solicit proxies from the Company stockholders in connection with the Merger Proposal and the Option Exchange Proposal, and unless the Company Board has effected a Company Board Recommendation Change pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of _Section 6.7_, the Company Board shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Requisite Merger Approval and Requisite Option Exchange Approval at the Company Stockholder Meeting or any postponement or adjournment thereof, including by soliciting proxies from Company stockholders in favor of the Merger Proposal and the Option Exchange Proposal. At the Company Stockholder Meeting, the Company shall submit to a vote of its stockholders the Merger Proposal and the Option Exchange Proposal. Except as required by applicable Law, the Company shall not propose for consideration or submit for a vote any matters at the Company Stockholder Meeting other than the Merger Proposal and the Option Exchange Proposal (or an adjournment of the Company Stockholder Meeting, if 

   ##### 

  

   

permitted hereunder) without the prior written consent of Parent. Except as
required by applicable Law, the Company shall not establish a record date for,
call, give notice of, convene or hold any meeting of the Company stockholders
unless and until the Company Stockholder Meeting has been held, a vote of the
Company stockholders has been taken on the Merger Proposal and the Option
Exchange Proposal and the Company Stockholder Meeting has been
adjourned. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, the Companys obligations under this _Section 6.6_ shall not be
terminated, superceded, limited, modified or otherwise affected by the
commencement, disclosure, announcement or submission to the Company of
any Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Transaction, or by any Company Board
Recommendation Change (whether or not in compliance with the terms hereof).
For the avoidance of doubt, the Company shall not be required (i) to hold the
Company Stockholder Meeting if this Agreement is validly terminated in
accordance with _Section 8.1_ or (ii) to make a formal recommendation to its
stockholders on the Option Exchange Proposal. 

   

 (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Company may adjourn or postpone the Company Stockholder Meeting (i) to the extent necessary to ensure that any required supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus is filed and/or provided to the Companys stockholders, (ii) if as of the time for which the Company Stockholder Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus) there are insufficient shares of Company Common Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the Company Stockholder Meeting, (iii) on a single occasion, for a period not to exceed thirty (30) days, for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies in favor of the approval of the Merger Proposal, or (iv) with the prior written consent of Parent, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

    ##### 

  

     

 (i) a material fact, event, change, development or set of circumstances (other than an Acquisition Proposal occurring or arising after the date of this Agreement, it being understood and hereby agreed that the Company Board may only effect a Company Board Recommendation Change in response to or in connection with an Acquisition Proposal pursuant to and in accordance with  _Section 6.7(b)(ii)_ below) that was not known by the Company Board as of or at any time prior to the date of this Agreement (and not relating in any way to any Acquisition Proposal) (such material fact, event, change, development or set of circumstances, an " _Intervening Event_ ") shall have occurred and be continuing and prior to effecting such Company Board Recommendation Change: 

   

 (A) the Company Board shall have reasonably determined in good faith (after consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel) that, in light of such Intervening Event, the failure of the Company Board to effect such Company Board Recommendation Change would reasonably be expected to result in a breach of its fiduciary duties under Delaware Law; 

   

 (B) the Company Board shall have given Parent at least five (5) Business Days prior written notice that the Company Board intends to take such action and the opportunity to meet with the Company Board and the Companys financial advisors and outside legal counsel at such times as Parent may reasonably request for the purpose of enabling Parent and the Company to discuss in good faith (x) the Company Boards basis and rationale for proposing to effect such Company Board Recommendation Change, and/or (y) possible modifications of the terms and conditions of this Agreement in such a manner that would obviate the need for the Company Board to effect such Company Board Recommendation Change in response to the Intervening Event; and 

   

 (C) after the foregoing five (5) Business Day period and, if requested by Parent, meetings with Parent and its financial advisors and legal counsel during such five (5) Business Day period, the Company Board reasonably determines in good faith (after consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel), that, in light of such Intervening Event and any modifications to the terms and conditions of this Agreement that Parent may propose, the failure to effect such a Company Board Recommendation Change would reasonably be expected to result in a breach of its fiduciary duties under Delaware Law; or 

  

 (ii) the Company Board shall have received a _bona fide_ , unsolicited Acquisition Proposal in writing after the date hereof, other than as a result of a breach or violation of the terms of  _Section 6.1_, which has not been withdrawn, and prior to (and in connection with) effecting such Company Board Recommendation Change or terminating this Agreement in accordance with  _Section 8.1(f)_, as applicable: 

   

 (A) none of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any directors, officers or other employees, controlled Affiliates, or any investment bankers, attorneys or other advisors, representatives or agents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, shall have breached or violated in any material respect the terms of _Section 6.1_ in connection with such Acquisition Proposal or in connection 

   ##### 

  

    

with any other Acquisition Proposal made or submitted by any Person (or any
Affiliate or agent thereof) making such Acquisition Proposal; 

   

 (B) the Company Board shall have reasonably determined in good faith (after consultation with Paragon or another financial advisor of nationally recognized standing and the Companys outside legal counsel) that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and shall have further reasonably determined in good faith (after consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel) that, in light of such Superior Proposal, the failure to effect a Company Board Recommendation Change or to terminate this Agreement in accordance with _Section 8.1(f)_ in response to such Superior Proposal, as applicable, would reasonably be expected to result in a breach of its fiduciary duties under Delaware Law; 

   

 (C) the Company Board shall have given Parent at least five (5) Business Days prior written notice (1) of the identity of the Person(s) making such Superior Proposal and all of the material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal (and if such Superior Proposal is in written form, a copy of such Superior Proposal and all related agreements, commitment letters and other material documents provided or otherwise furnished by the Person(s) making such Superior Proposal in connection therewith), and (2) that the Company Board intends to effect a Company Board Recommendation Change or terminate this Agreement in accordance with _Section 8.1(f)_ in response to such Superior Proposal and the opportunity to meet with the Company Board and the Companys financial advisors and outside legal counsel at such times as Parent may reasonably request for the purpose of enabling Parent and the Company to discuss in good faith such Superior Proposal, this Agreement and the terms and conditions hereof, and any modifications of the terms and conditions of this Agreement that Parent may propose in response thereto; and 

   

 (D) after the foregoing five (5) Business Day period and, if requested by Parent, meetings with Parent and its financial advisors and legal counsel during such five (5) Business Day period, the Company Board shall have reasonably determined in good faith (after consultation with Paragon or another financial advisor of nationally recognized standing and the Companys outside legal counsel) that such Acquisition Proposal continues to constitute a Superior Proposal, and shall have further reasonably determined in good faith (after consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel) that, in light of such Superior Proposal and after good faith consideration of all proposals (whether or not binding) by Parent, the failure to effect a Company Board Recommendation Change or to terminate this Agreement in accordance with _Section 8.1(f)_, as applicable, would reasonably be expected to result in a breach of its fiduciary duties under Delaware Law. 

  

 (c) Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company Board from taking and disclosing to the Company stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e- 

   ##### 

  

   

2(a) under the Exchange Act or complying with the provisions of Rule 14d-9
promulgated under the Exchange Act; _provided, however_ , that any statement

disclosure (other than a "stop, look and listen communication" of the
type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act, and within the
time period contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f)(3)) shall be deemed to be a Company
Board Recommendation Change if the Company Board does not expressly publicly
reaffirm the Company Board Recommendation in connection with such statement
or disclosure. 

   

 (d) Nothing set forth in this _Section 6.7_ shall (i) limit the obligation of the Company to establish a record date for, call, give notice of, convene and hold the Company Stockholder Meeting, (ii) relieve the Company of its obligation to solicit proxies for the Company Stockholder Meeting and submit to a vote of its stockholders the Merger Proposal at the Company Stockholder Meeting, or (iii) except as required by applicable Law, permit the Company to submit for a vote of its stockholders at or prior to the Company Stockholder Meeting any matter other than the Merger Proposal and the Option Exchange Proposal.

The Company shall give Parent the opportunity to consult with the Company regarding the defense or settlement of any such Legal Proceeding Matter involving the Company and shall consider in good faith Parents views with respect to such Legal Proceeding Matter involving the Company, and the Company shall not settle any such Legal Proceeding Matter without the prior written consent of Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). 

   

 (e) At all times during the period commencing with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier to occur of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article VIII_ and the Effective Time, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, make available to Parent a copy of each annual and quarterly report on 10-K or 10-Q (as applicable), and each registration statement, proposed

 6.11 _Employee Matters_. 

  

 (a) Prior to the Effective Date, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to (and from and after the Effective Date, Parent shall cause the Final Surviving Corporation to) honor in accordance with their terms all existing employment, change of control and severance agreements between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any director, officer or other employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on the other hand. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent and the Final Surviving Corporation shall be permitted to amend such agreements to the extent required by applicable Laws. 

   

 (b) Effective as of the day immediately preceding the Closing Date, each of the Company and any ERISA Affiliate shall terminate any and all Employee Plans 

   ##### 

  

   

intended to include a Code Section 401(k) arrangement (each, a " _401(k)
Plan_ ") (unless Parent provides written notice to the Company that such
401(k) Plans shall not be terminated). Unless Parent provides such
written notice to the Company, no later than five (5) Business Days prior to
the Closing Date, the Company shall provide Parent with evidence that such
Employee Plan(s) have been terminated (effective as of the day immediately
preceding the Closing Date) pursuant to resolutions of the Company Board
or such Affiliate, as the case may be. The form and substance of such
resolutions shall be subject to the reasonable review and approval of Parent.
The Company also shall take such other actions in furtherance of terminating
such Employee Plan(s) as Parent may reasonably require. In the event that
termination of a 401(k) Plan would reasonably be anticipated to trigger
liquidation charges, surrender charges or other fees then the Company shall
take such actions as are necessary to reasonably estimate the amount of such
charges and/or fees and provide such estimate in writing to Parent no later
than fifteen (15) calendar days prior to the Closing Date. If, in accordance
with this _Section 6.11(b)_, Parent requests in writing that the Company not
terminate any 401(k) Plan, the Company shall take such actions as Parent
may reasonably require in furtherance of the assumption of any such 401(k)
Plan by Parent, including, but not limited to, adopting such amendments as
Parent may deem necessary or advisable in connection with such assumption
with or without cause or notice.

 (d) Parent shall, or shall cause the Final Surviving Corporation, for the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the second anniversary thereof, to maintain or provide for the individuals employed by the Company and its Subsidiaries at the Effective Time (the " _Continuing Employees_ ") compensation and benefits (including without limitation severance benefits) under Employee Plans that are (i) in the aggregate no less favorable than the compensation and benefits maintained for and provided to Continuing Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) in the aggregate at least as favorable as the compensation and benefits provided to similarly situated employees of Parent, or (iii) any combination of clauses (i) and (ii) above; _provided, however_ , subject to the foregoing, that nothing herein shall prevent the amendment or termination of any Employee Plan or interfere with the Final Surviving Corporations right or obligation to make such changes as are necessary to conform with applicable Law. Nothing in this _Section 6.11(d)_ shall limit the right of Parent, the Final Surviving Corporation or any of their subsidiaries to terminate the employment of any Continuing Employee at any time. The provisions of this _Section 6.11(d)_ are not intended to confer upon any person other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder, and nothing herein shall be deemed to amend any Employee Plan to reflect the terms of this _Section 6.11(d)_. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (e) From and after the Effective Time, and to the extent permitted by applicable Law, Parent shall, or shall cause the Final Surviving Corporation to, recognize the prior service with the Company or its Subsidiaries of each Continuing Employee in connection with all employee benefit plans, programs or policies of Parent or its Affiliates in which Continuing Employees are eligible to participate following the Effective Time for purposes of eligibility and vesting and determination of level of benefits (but not for purposes of benefit accruals under any defined benefit pension plan or to the extent that such recognition would result in duplication of benefits). From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Final Surviving Corporation to, (i) cause any pre-existing conditions or limitations and eligibility waiting periods under any group health plans of Parent or its Affiliates to be waived with respect to Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents to the extent such Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents were not subject to such preexisting conditions and limitations and eligibility waiting periods under the comparable Employee Plans as of the time immediately preceding the Closing, and (ii) provide each Continuing Employee with credit for any deductibles paid under any Employee Plan that provides medical, dental or vision benefits in the plan year in effect as of the Closing Date in satisfying any applicable deductible or out of pocket requirements under any medical, dental or vision plans of Parent, the Final Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries that such employees are eligible to participate in after the Effective Time to the same extent that such expenses were recognized under the comparable Employee Plan. The provisions of this _Section 6.11(e)_ are not intended to confer upon any person other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder, and nothing herein shall be deemed to amend any Employee Plan to reflect the terms of this _Section 6.11(e)_. 

   

 6.12 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_. 

  

 (a) The Final Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall (and Parent shall cause the Final Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) honor and fulfill in all respects the obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries under the certificate of incorporation and bylaws (or other similar organizational documents) of the Company and its Subsidiaries as in effect on the date hereof and any and all agreements for indemnification, exculpation of liability and/or advance of expenses in effect as of the date hereof between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any of their respective current or former directors and officers and any person who becomes a director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time (the " _Indemnified Parties_ "). In addition, for a period of six (6) years following the Effective Time, the Final Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall (and Parent shall cause the Final Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) cause the certificate of formation (and other similar organizational documents) of the Final Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to contain provisions with respect to indemnification, exculpation from liability and the advancement of expenses that are at least as favorable as the indemnification, exculpation from liability and advancement of expense provisions set forth in the certificate of incorporation and bylaws (or other similar organizational documents) of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the date hereof, and during such six (6) year period, such provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely 

    ##### 

  

    

affect the rights thereunder of individuals who were covered by such
provisions, except as required by applicable Law or Order. 

   

 (b) Prior to or as of the Effective Time, Parent shall purchase a six-year "tail" prepaid policy on the Companys current directors and officers liability insurance (" _D andO Insurance_") in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, covering each person covered by the DandO Insurance as of the date hereof, on terms and conditions no less favorable to the beneficiaries thereof, in the aggregate, than the DandO Insurance. Parent and the Final Surviving Corporation shall maintain such "tail" policy in full force and effect and continue to honor their respective obligations thereunder; _provided, however_ , that in satisfying its obligations under this _Section 6.12(b)_, Parent shall not be obligated to pay in excess of the amount set forth in _Section 6.12_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule (such aggregate amount, the " _Maximum Premium_ "), provided that if the cost of such "tail" insurance coverage exceeds the Maximum Premium, Parent and the Final Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding the Maximum Premium. 

   

 (c) If any Indemnified Person makes a claim to enforce the obligations set forth in this  _Section 6.12_ that is denied by the Final Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries (or by Parent after a request that Parent fulfill its obligations hereunder), and a court of competent jurisdiction determines that such Indemnified Person is entitled to the benefit of such obligations hereunder, then the Final Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Final Surviving Corporation to) pay all expenses, including reasonable fees and expenses of counsel, that such Indemnified Person incurred to enforce the obligations set forth in this _Section 6.12_;  _provided, however_ , that nothing in this _Section 6.12(c)_ shall prejudice the right of any Indemnified Person to any advancement of expenses provided under the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the Company or its Subsidiaries as in effect on the date hereof or any agreement with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. 

   

 (d) If Parent, the Final Surviving Corporation, any Subsidiaries of the Final Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns shall (i) consolidate with or merge into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent, the Final Surviving Corporation and/or any such Subsidiaries, as applicable, shall assume all of the obligations of Parent, the Final Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries, as applicable, under this _Section 6.12_. 

   

 (e) The obligations under this _Section 6.12_ shall not be terminated, amended or otherwise modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any Indemnified Party (or any other person who is a beneficiary under "tail" policy referred to in _Section 6.12(b)_ (and their heirs and representatives)) without the prior written consent of such affected Indemnified Party or other person who is a beneficiary under the "tail" policy referred to in _Section 6.12(b)_ (and their heirs and representatives). Each of the 

   ##### 

  

   

Indemnified Parties or other persons who are beneficiaries under the "tail"
policy referred to in _Section 6.12(b)_ (and their heirs
and representatives) are intended to be third party beneficiaries of this
_Section 6.12_, with full rights of enforcement as if a party thereto. The
rights of the Indemnified Parties (and other persons who are beneficiaries
under the "tail" policy referred to in _Section 6.12(b)_ (and their heirs
and representatives)) under this _Section 6.12_ shall be in addition to, and
not in substitution for, any other rights that such persons may have under
the certificate or articles of incorporation, bylaws or other equivalent
organizational documents, any and all indemnification agreements of or
entered into by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or applicable
Laws (whether at law or in equity).

At or prior to the Closing, upon the request of Parent, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the resignations of all directors and officers of its Subsidiaries, in each case to be effective as of the Effective Time.

In addition, the Company Board, or a committee thereof consisting of non-employee directors (as such term is defined for purposes of Rule 16b-3(d) promulgated under the Exchange Act) shall adopt a resolution prior to the Effective Time providing that the disposition by Company Insiders of Company Common Stock in exchange for cash and shares of Parent Common Stock, and the disposition of their Company Stock Awards which will be deemed to occur upon the assumption of those options and their resulting conversion into options to purchase Parent Common Stock pursuant to the transactions contemplated hereby are also intended to be exempt from Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act pursuant to Rule 16b-3 promulgated thereunder. For purposes of this Agreement, and the term " _Company Insiders_ " shall mean those directors and officers of the Company who are subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act.

Prior to the Closing, Parent shall file a Notification of Listing of Additional Shares (or such other form as may be required by Nasdaq) with Nasdaq with respect to the shares of the Parent Common Stock to be issued in the Merger and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause such shares to be approved for listing as promptly as practicable and, in any event, before the Closing Date. 

  

 6.16 _Registration Statements for Assumed Options and Other Awards_. As soon a practicable following the Effective Time, but in no event later than ten (10) Business Days following the Effective Time, Parent shall file a registration statement under the Securities Act on Form S-8 (and use its reasonable best efforts to maintain the 

   ##### 

  

    

effectiveness thereof) relating to shares of Parent Common Stock issuable
with respect to the Assumed Options, in each case to the extent eligible for
registration on Form S-8, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cause such registration statement to remain in effect for so long as such
Assumed Options shall remain outstanding. 

  

 6.17 _Obligations of the Merger Subs_. Parent shall cause Merger Sub One, Merger Sub Two, the Interim Surviving Corporation and the Final Surviving Corporation to perform their respective obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement. 

  

 6.18 _Tax Matters_. None of Parent, Merger Sub One, Merger Sub Two or the Company shall, and they shall not permit any of their respective Subsidiaries to, take any action prior to or following the Effective Time that would reasonably be expected to cause the Integrated Merger to fail to qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. Each of Parent, Merger Sub One, Merger Sub Two and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Tax opinions described in _Section 7.1(g)_ (collectively, the " _Tax Opinions_ ").

At Parents request, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i) obtain a customary pay-off letter with respect to the Credit Agreement in advance of the Closing Date and (ii) apply the available cash of the Company (to the extent permitted without causing non-compliance with _Section 5.2(q)_ of this Agreement) toward the repayment effective on the Closing Date immediately after the Effective Time of outstanding indebtedness under the Credit Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, this covenant is not intended to assure a minimum amount of cash or cash equivalents on the balance sheet of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date.
