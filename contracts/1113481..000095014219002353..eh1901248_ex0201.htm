ARTICLE 2

 

THE OFFER AND THE MERGER

 

Section 2.01. _The Offer_.

 

(a) _Commencement of the Offer_. As  promptly as practicable after the
execution and delivery of this Agreement and in no event later than December
5, 2019, Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, commence
(within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 promulgated by the SEC under  the Exchange
Act) the Offer to purchase any and all of the Shares at a price per Share
equal to the Per Share Amount to the holder of the Share in cash, without
interest.

 

(b) _Terms and Conditions of the Offer_.                 The
obligations of Merger Sub to, and of Parent to cause Merger Sub to, accept for
payment, and pay for, any Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer are subject
only to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, including the
prior  satisfaction or waiver of the Minimum Tender Condition, the
Termination Condition and the other conditions set forth in _Annex A_
(collectively, the " _Offer Conditions_ "). Merger Sub expressly reserves the
right (but is not obligated  to) at any time and from time to time in its
sole discretion to waive, in whole or in part, any Offer Condition or modify
the terms of the Offer (including by increasing the Per Share Amount), in each
case only (and Merger Sub shall not do so  except) in a manner not
inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement, except that, for the avoidance
of doubt, without the prior written consent of the Company, Merger Sub shall
not (i) reduce the number of Shares subject to the Offer, (ii) reduce  the
Per Share Amount, (iii) directly or indirectly amend, modify, supplement or
waive the Minimum Tender Condition or the Termination Condition, (iv) add to
or directly or indirectly amend, modify or supplement any Offer Condition, (v)
directly or  indirectly amend, modify or supplement any other term of the
Offer in any individual case in any manner adverse to the holders of Shares or
that would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to
prevent or materially delay the  consummation of the Offer or the Merger or
impair the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the Offer, (vi)
extend or otherwise change the Offer Expiration Time (except as expressly
required or permitted by the other provisions of this
_Section                2.01_ ), (vii) change the form of
consideration payable in the Offer or (viii) provide for any "subsequent
offering period" (or any extension of any thereof) within the meaning of Rule
14d-11 under the Exchange Act.

 

 

16  

(c) _Expiration and Extension of the  Offer_. The expiration date and time
for the Offer, as the same may be extended from time to time, is hereinafter
referred to as the " _Offer Expiration Time_." The initial Offer Expiration
Time shall be 11:59 p.m. (New York City time)  on the twentieth (20th)
Business Day following (and including the day of) commencement of the Offer
(determined pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 14d-1(g)(3)). Subject to the
parties' respective rights to terminate the Agreement pursuant to
_Section                8.01_ and notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement, Merger Sub shall (and Parent shall cause
Merger Sub to):

 

(i) extend the Offer for any period  required by any applicable rule,
regulation, interpretation or position of the SEC or the staff thereof or
Nasdaq (including in order to comply with Exchange Act Rule 14e-1(b) in
respect of any change in the Per Share Amount) or as may be necessary  to
resolve any comments of the SEC or the staff or Nasdaq, in each case, as
applicable to the Offer, the Schedule 14D-9 or the Offer Documents; and

 

(ii) if, as of any then-scheduled Offer  Expiration Time, any Offer Condition
is not satisfied and has not been waived by Parent or Merger Sub (to the
extent permitted hereunder), extend the Offer (x) on one or more occasions in
consecutive increments of up to five (5) Business Days each  (or such longer
or shorter period as the parties hereto may agree) or (y) if any then-
scheduled Offer Expiration Time is five (5) or less Business Days before the
End Date, until 11:59 p.m., New York City Time, on the day before the End Date
(or  such other date and time as the parties hereto may agree);

 

_provided_ that, without the Company's written consent, Merger Sub shall not
extend the Offer, and without Parent's prior written consent, Merger  Sub
shall not be required to extend the Offer, in each case, beyond the earlier of
the End Date or the valid termination of this Agreement in accordance with
_Section 8.01_.

 

(d) _Consummation of the Offer; Payment_.                 On
the terms and subject to the conditions of the Offer and this Agreement,
Merger Sub shall (and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to) (i) consummate the
Offer and accept for payment all Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn
pursuant to the Offer  promptly after (in any event, no later than the first
(1st) Business Day after) the Offer Expiration Time and (ii) promptly after
(in any event, no more than the  second (2nd) Business Days after) the Offer
Expiration Time, pay for such Shares. Parent shall provide or cause to be
provided to Merger Sub on a timely basis the  funds necessary to purchase any
Shares that Merger Sub becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to the Offer.
The Per Share Amount shall be paid to the holder of the Share in cash, without
interest, upon the terms and subject to the conditions of  the Offer.

 

(e) _Termination of the Offer_.   Parent and Merger Sub shall not terminate
the Offer or permit the Offer to be terminated prior to the Offer Expiration
Time (as it may be extended and re-extended in accordance with this
Agreement), unless and until this Agreement is validly  terminated in
accordance with _Section 8.01_. In the event that this Agreement is validly
terminated pursuant to _Section 8.01_ prior to any scheduled expiration of the
Offer, Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to,  promptly (but
in any event not more than one (1) Business Day after such termination)
irrevocably and unconditionally terminate the Offer. If the Offer is
terminated or withdrawn by Merger Sub, Merger Sub shall

 

 

17  

promptly return, and shall cause any depository acting on behalf of Merger Sub
to return, all tendered Shares to the record holders thereof  in accordance
with Applicable Law.

 

(f) _Offer Documents_. On the date of  commencement of the Offer (determined
pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 14d-2), Parent and Merger Sub shall (i) file
with the SEC, in accordance with Exchange Act Rule 14d-3, a Tender Offer
Statement on Schedule TO with respect to the Offer, which  Tender Offer
Statement shall contain an offer to purchase and a related letter of
transmittal, summary advertisement, notice of guaranteed delivery and other
ancillary offer documents pursuant to which the Offer will be made (such
Schedule TO and  documents, together with any exhibits, supplements or
amendments thereto, the " _Offer Documents_ ") and (ii) cause the Offer
Documents to be disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case, as and to the
extent required by Applicable Law. The  Company shall promptly furnish Parent
and Merger Sub with all information concerning the Company and its
stockholders required by the Exchange Act or other Applicable Law to be set
forth in the Offer Documents and all other information concerning  the
Company and its stockholders as reasonably requested by Parent and Merger Sub
for inclusion in the Offer Documents and, unless previously withdrawn in
accordance with _Section 6.02(d)_ or _Section 6.02(e)_ , shall allow Parent
and  Merger Sub to include the Board Recommendation in the Offer Documents.
Parent and Merger Sub shall cause the Offer Documents to comply in all
material respects with the requirements of Applicable Law and, on the date
first filed with the SEC and  on the date first published, sent or given to
the holders of Shares, not to contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
in order to make the statements therein, in  light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading, except that no covenant is made by
Parent or Merger Sub with respect to information supplied by the Company in
writing specifically for inclusion or incorporation by reference  in the
Offer Documents. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall promptly
correct any information provided by it for use in the Offer Documents if and
to the extent that such information is or shall have become false or
misleading in any  material respect, and each of Parent and Merger Sub shall
take all steps necessary to amend or supplement the Offer Documents and to
cause the Offer Documents as so amended or supplemented to be filed with the
SEC and disseminated to the holders of  Shares, in each case, as and to the
extent required by Applicable Law. The Company and its counsel shall be given
a reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon the Offer Documents and
any amendments and supplements thereto prior to filing  such documents with
the SEC or dissemination of such documents to the stockholders of the Company
and Parent and Merger Sub shall give reasonable and good faith consideration
to any comments made by the Company and its counsel. Parent and Merger  Sub
shall (A) provide the Company and its counsel any written comments that
Parent, Merger Sub or their counsel may receive from the SEC or its staff with
respect to the Offer Documents promptly after the receipt of such comments
(and shall give  the Company and its counsel prompt telephonic notice of any
material discussions with or oral comments received from the SEC staff), (B)
provide the Company and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment upon the proposed responses  to any such comments and a copy of any
proposed written responses thereto prior to the filing thereof, and (C) give
reasonable and good faith consideration to any comments made by the Company
and its counsel on any such proposed responses. Parent  and Merger Sub shall
respond promptly to any comments of the SEC or its staff with respect to the
Offer Documents.

 

 

18  

(g) _Guaranteed Delivery_. For  purposes of this Agreement and the Offer,
unless mutually agreed by Parent and the Company, any Shares subject to
notices of guaranteed delivery shall be deemed not to be validly tendered into
the Offer unless and until the Shares underlying such  notices of guaranteed
delivery are "received" (as defined by Section 251(h) of the DGCL) by Merger
Sub or by an agent of Merger Sub.

 

(h) _Notification of Offer Status_.   Parent shall keep the Company
reasonably informed on a reasonably current basis of the status of the Offer,
including with respect to the number of Shares that have been validly tendered
and not validly withdrawn in accordance with the terms of the  Offer, and
with respect to any material developments with respect thereto and, upon the
Company's written request, provide the Company as soon as practicable with the
most recent report then available from the Depository Agent detailing the
number  of Shares that have been validly tendered and not validly withdrawn
in accordance with the terms of the Offer.

 

Section 2.02. _Company  Actions_.

 

(a) _Approval_. The Company hereby  approves of and consents to the
Transactions. The Company agrees that no Shares held by the Company or any of
the Company Subsidiaries (other than any such shares held on behalf of third
parties) will be tendered pursuant to the Offer.

 

(b) _Schedule 14D-9_. Concurrently  with or as soon as reasonably practicable
following the filing of the Schedule TO with the SEC, the Company shall (i)
file with the SEC a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9
with respect to the Offer (such Schedule 14D-9, as  amended or supplemented
from time to time and including any exhibits thereto, the " _Schedule 14D-9_
") and, unless previously withdrawn in accordance with _Section 6.02(d)_ or
_Section 6.02(e), shall include in the Schedule 14D-9,_
the                Board Recommendation. The Company shall (i)
include in the Schedule 14D-9 a notice of appraisal rights and (ii) cause the
Schedule 14D-9 to be disseminated to holders of Shares as and to the extent
required by Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the  Exchange Act and any other
Applicable Law, including by setting the Stockholder List Date as the record
date for purposes of receiving the notice required by Section 262(d)(2) of the
DGCL. Parent and Merger Sub shall promptly furnish the Company  with all
information concerning Parent and Merger Sub required by the Exchange Act to
be set forth in the Schedule 14D-9, and all other information concerning
Parent and Merger Sub as reasonably requested by the Company for inclusion in
the  Schedule 14D-9. The Company shall cause the Schedule 14D-9 to comply in
all material respects with the requirements of Applicable Law and, on the date
first filed with the SEC and on the date first published, sent or given to the
holders of  Shares, not to contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not  misleading, except that no covenant is made by the
Company with respect to information supplied by Parent or Merger Sub in
writing specifically for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the
Schedule 14D-9. Each of the Company, Parent and  Merger Sub shall promptly
correct any information provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to
the extent that such information shall have become false or misleading in any
material respect, and the Company shall take all steps necessary  to amend or
supplement the Schedule 14D-9 and to cause

 

 

19  

the Schedule 14D-9 as so amended or supplemented to be filed with the SEC and
disseminated to the holders of Shares, in each case as and to  the extent
required by Applicable Law. Parent and its counsel shall be given a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment upon the Schedule 14D-9 and any amendments
and supplements thereto prior to filing such documents with the SEC or 
dissemination of such documents to the stockholders of the Company and the
Company shall give reasonable and good faith consideration to any comments
made by Parent and its counsel. The Company shall (A) provide Parent and its
counsel any written  comments that the Company or its counsel may receive
from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after
the receipt of such comments (and shall give Parent and its counsel prompt
telephonic notice of any oral comments  received from the SEC staff), (B)
provide Parent and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment
upon the proposed responses to any such comments and a copy of any proposed
written responses thereto prior to the filing thereof and  (C) give
reasonable and good faith consideration to any comments made by Parent and its
counsel on any such proposed responses. The Company shall respond promptly to
any comments of the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9.

 

(c) _Stockholder Lists_. In  connection with the Offer, the Company shall
instruct its transfer agent to furnish Merger Sub (x) promptly after the date
of this Agreement and (y) from time to time thereafter as requested by Parent,
with a list of its stockholders and mailing  labels containing the names and
addresses of the record holders of Shares as of the most recent practicable
date and of those persons becoming record holders subsequent to such date,
together with copies of all lists of stockholders, security  position
listings and computer files and all other information in the Company's
possession regarding the beneficial owners of the Shares, and shall furnish to
Merger Sub such information and assistance (including updated lists of
stockholders,  security position listings and computer files) as Parent may
reasonably request in communicating the Offer to the holders of Shares (the
date of the list used to determine the Persons to whom the Offer Documents and
the Schedule 14D-9 are first  disseminated, the " _Stockholder List Date_ ").
Subject to Applicable Law, and except for such steps as are necessary to
communicate the Offer to the holders of Shares, Parent and Merger Sub and
their Representatives shall (i) hold in  confidence such lists, files and
information and will use such information only in connection with the Offer
and the Merger and (ii) if this Agreement is terminated, promptly either
deliver to the Company or destroy, and shall cause their  Representatives to
deliver to the Company or destroy, all copies and any extracts or summaries of
such information then in their possession or control and notify the Company
that all such material has been so returned or destroyed.

 

Section 2.03. _The Closing_.                 Upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, the closing of the
Merger (the " _Closing_ ") will take place as soon as practicable after (but
in any event on the same day as) the consummation of the Offer, subject to 
satisfaction or, to the extent permitted hereunder and by Applicable Law,
waiver of all conditions set forth in _Article 7_ (other than those conditions
that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction  or waiver (to the extent permitted hereunder and by Applicable
Law) of such conditions), unless this Agreement has been terminated pursuant
to its terms or unless another time or date is agreed to in writing by the
parties hereto. The Closing  shall be held at the offices of Paul, Weiss,
Rifkind, Wharton and Garrison LLP, 1285 Avenue of the Americas, New York, New
York 10019, or remotely by exchange of documents and

 

 

20  

signatures (or their electronic counterparts), unless another place is agreed
upon in writing by the parties hereto.

 

Section 2.04. _The Merger_.

 

(a) _Effecting the Merger_. Upon the  terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the DGCL, as promptly as
practicable on the Closing Date, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall (i)
cause a certificate of merger (the " _Certificate of  Merger_ "), to be
executed and delivered to the Office of the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware (the " _Delaware Secretary_ ") for filing in such form as required by
and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the DGCL and  (ii) take
all other necessary or appropriate action to cause the Merger to be effected
under Section 251(h) of the DGCL without the adoption of this Agreement by the
stockholders of the Company. The Merger shall be governed by and effected 
pursuant to Section 251(h) of the DGCL.

 

(b) _Effective Time_. The Merger  shall become effective on such date and at
such time as when the Certificate of Merger has been duly filed with the
Delaware Secretary or at such later time and date as may be agreed by the
parties in writing and specified in the Certificate of  Merger in accordance
with the DGCL (the " _Effective Time_ ").

 

(c) _Surviving Corporation_. At the  Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be
merged with and into the Company in accordance with the DGCL, including
Section 251(h) thereof, whereupon the separate existence of Merger Sub shall
cease, and the Company shall be the surviving corporation in  the Merger (the
" _Surviving Corporation_ ") and shall become a wholly owned Subsidiary of
Parent, and the separate corporate existence of the Company, with all its
rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises, shall continue
unaffected  by the Merger. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all of the properties, rights,
privileges, immunities, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub
shall vest in the Surviving  Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and
duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and
duties of the Surviving Corporation.

 

(d) _Effects of the Merger_. The  Merger shall have the effects set forth in
the applicable provisions of the DGCL, this Agreement and the Certificate of
Merger.

 

Section 2.05. _Conversion of  Shares_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company or any stockholder thereof or any other Person:

 

(a) except as otherwise provided in _Section               
2.05(b)_ , _Section 2.05(c)_ , _Section 2.05(d)_ , or _Section 2.07_ , each
Share outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall (i) be
converted automatically into the right to receive the Per Share Amount (the "
_Merger                Consideration_ ") in cash, without
interest and (ii) cease to be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled
and cease to exist and each holder of a Certificate representing any such
Shares shall have only the right to receive the Per Share  Amount with
respect thereto in accordance with _Section 2.06_ or _Section 2.08(e)_ , as
applicable;

 

 

21  

(b) each Share owned by Parent, Merger Sub  or any other direct or indirect
wholly owned subsidiary of Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time
(other than Shares tendered and accepted for payment by Merger Sub in
connection with the Offer) shall be canceled and cease to exist, and no 
payment shall be made with respect thereto and each holder of a Certificate
representing any such Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto;

 

(c) each Share owned by the Company or held  in the Company's treasury
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and cease to exist,
and no payment shall be made with respect thereto and each holder of a
Certificate representing any such Shares shall cease to have any rights  with
respect thereto;

 

(d) each Share owned by any direct or  indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of
the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and
cease to exist, and no payment shall be made with respect thereto and each
holder of a Certificate representing any such Shares shall  cease to have any
rights with respect thereto; and

 

(e) each share of common stock of Merger  Sub outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one fully paid,
nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the
Surviving Corporation (the " _Surviving Corporation Common Stock_
"),                which shall constitute the only outstanding
shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation as of immediately
following the Effective Time.

 

Section 2.06. _Surrender and  Payment_.

 

(a) _Depository Agent, Paying Agent and  Payment Fund_. Prior to the
expiration of the Offer, Parent shall appoint a paying agent reasonably
acceptable to the Company to act as agent (the " _Depository Agent_ ") for the
holders of Shares to receive the aggregate Per Share Amount  to which holders
of such Shares shall become entitled pursuant to _Section 2.01(d)_ and to act
as agent (the " _Paying Agent_ ") for the holders of Shares to receive the
aggregate Merger Consideration to which holders of such Shares  (excluding
Company Restricted Shares) shall become entitled pursuant to _Section
2.05(a)_. Promptly after the expiration of the Offer, Parent shall deposit, or
shall cause to be deposited, (i) with the Depository Agent cash sufficient
to  make the payment of the aggregate Per Share Amount payable pursuant to
_Section 2.01(d)_ and (ii) with the Paying Agent cash sufficient to pay the
aggregate Merger Consideration payable pursuant to _Section 2.05_ , excluding
the  aggregate Merger Consideration payable with respect to Company
Restricted Shares (together with the amount deposited pursuant to clause (i),
the " _Payment Fund_ "). To the extent such fund diminishes for any reason
below the level required to  make prompt payment of any outstanding Per Share
Amounts to be paid in exchange for Shares accepted for payment pursuant to
_Section 2.01(d)_ or converted in the Merger pursuant to _Section 2.05(a)_ ,
Parent and the Surviving Corporation  shall promptly replace or restore the
lost portion of such fund so as to ensure that it is, at all times, maintained
at a level sufficient to make such payments. The Payment Fund shall not be
used for any purpose other than to pay the aggregate  Per Share Amount in the
Offer and the Merger. The Payment Fund shall be invested by the Paying Agent
as directed by the Surviving Corporation; _provided_ that such investments
shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of  America in
commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody's Investors
Service, Inc. or Standard and Poor's Corporation, respectively, in certificates
of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or banker's

 

 

22  

acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $1 billion, or in money
market funds having a rating in the highest investment  category granted by a
recognized credit rating agency at the time of acquisition or a combination of
the foregoing and, in any such case, no such instrument shall have a maturity
exceeding three (3) months. Promptly after the Effective Time and in  any
event no later than five (5) Business Days after the Effective Time, Parent
shall send, or shall cause the Paying Agent to send, to each record holder of
Shares at the Effective Time, in each case whose Shares were converted into
the right to  receive the Per Share Amount pursuant to _Section 2.05(a)_ , a
letter of transmittal and instructions (which shall specify that delivery of
the Shares shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon
proper delivery or  transfer of the certificate representing the Shares (the
" _Certificates_ "; _provided_ , _however_ , that any references herein to
"Certificates" are deemed to include references to effective affidavits of
loss in accordance with _Section              2.12_ or to book-
entry account statements relating to the ownership of Shares, as applicable)
to the Paying Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions
as Parent may reasonably specify (after due consultation with the  Company)
prior to the consummation of the Offer) for use in effecting the surrender of
Certificates in exchange for payment of the Per Share Amount for each Share.

 

(b) _Surrender of Shares_. Each  holder of Shares that have been converted
into the right to receive the Per Share Amount shall be entitled to receive
the Per Share Amount in respect of the Shares represented by a Certificate
promptly upon (i) surrender to the Paying Agent of the  Certificate (
_provided_ , _however_ , that delivery of a book-entry statement shall not be
required in respect of any uncertificated Shares held of record in book-
entry), together with a duly completed and validly executed letter of 
transmittal and such other documents as may reasonably be requested by the
Paying Agent, or (ii) receipt of an "agent's message" by the Paying Agent (or
such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Paying Agent may reasonably
request) in the  case of the exchange of book-entry Shares. Until so
surrendered or transferred each such Certificate shall represent after the
Effective Time for all purposes only the right to receive such Per Share
Amount. No interest shall be paid or accrued  on the cash payable upon the
surrender or transfer of such Certificate.

 

(c) _Unregistered Transferees_. If  any portion of the aggregate Per Share
Amount to be paid in respect of any Certificate is to be paid to a Person
other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is registered,
it shall be a condition to such payment that (i) either  such Certificate
shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer
and (ii) the Person requesting such payment shall either pay to the Paying
Agent any transfer or other Tax required as a result of such payment being
made  to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or
otherwise establish to the satisfaction of the Paying Agent that such Tax has
been paid or is not payable.

 

(d) _No Other Rights_. The Per Share  Amount paid upon the surrender of
Certificates or book-entry Shares in accordance with the terms hereof shall be
deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the
Shares formerly represented by such Certificate or  book-entry Share and from
and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall not permit any
further registration of transfers of Shares on the stock transfer books of the
Surviving Corporation. If, after the Effective Time, any  Certificate is
presented to the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent for
transfer, the holder of such Certificates shall be given a copy of a letter of
transmittal and instructed to comply with the instructions therein in

 

 

23  

order to receive the Per Share Amount to which such holder is entitled
pursuant to the Merger. From and after the Effective Time, the  holders of
the Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to
have any rights with respect to such Shares except to receive, upon surrender
of a Certificate or book-entry Share pursuant to and in accordance with this
_Section              2.06_ , the Per Share Amount in respect of
each Share represented thereby, except as otherwise provided herein or by
Applicable Law.

 

(e) _Termination of the Payment Fund_.                 Any
portion of the Payment Fund that remains unclaimed by the holders of Shares at
any time following the date that is twelve (12) months after the Effective
Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any such holder who has
not exchanged  Shares for the Per Share Amount in accordance with this
_Section 2.06_ prior to that time shall, subject to abandoned property,
escheat or other Applicable Laws, thereafter look only to the Surviving
Corporation (subject to _Section 2.11_ )  as general creditors thereof for
payment of the Per Share Amount.

 

Section 2.07. _Dissenting  Shares_. Notwithstanding _Section 2.06_ or any
other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, Shares issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who
is entitled to demand appraisal and who has  properly exercised and perfected
a demand for appraisal of such Shares in accordance with Section 262 of the
DGCL and, as of the Effective Time, has neither effectively withdrawn nor lost
such holder's right to appraisal and payment under the DGCL  with respect to
such Shares (any such Shares, " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted
into a right to receive the Per Share Amount but instead shall be entitled
only to such rights as are granted by the DGCL to a holder of Dissenting 
Shares; _provided_ , _however_ , that, if, after the Effective Time, such
holder fails to perfect, withdraws, waives or otherwise loses such holder's
right to appraisal pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL or if a court of
competent  jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not entitled to
the relief provided by Section 262 of the DGCL, such Shares shall immediately
cease to be Dissenting Shares and shall be treated as if they had been Shares
converted as of the  Effective Time into the right to receive the Per Share
Amount in accordance with _Section 2.05(a)_ , without interest thereon, upon
surrender of such Certificate formerly representing such Shares. The Company
shall provide Parent with prompt  written notice of any demands received by
the Company for appraisal of any Shares, any withdrawal of any such demand and
any other demand, notice and/or instrument delivered to the Company prior to
the Effective Time pursuant to Section 262 of the  DGCL that relates to such
demand, and Parent shall have the opportunity and right to direct all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Except with the
prior written consent of Parent, or if required by Applicable Law, the 
Company shall not make any payment with respect to, or offer to settle or
settle, any such demands.

immediately prior to the consummation of the Offer, whether vested or
unvested, shall become fully vested and shall be canceled as of immediately

exercise price of such Company Stock Option) in exchange for the right to
receive a lump-sum cash payment in the amount of the Option Consideration, if
any, with respect to such Company Stock Option; _provided_ , _however_ , that
if  the

 

 

24

greater than the Per Share Amount, such Company Stock Option shall  be
canceled and terminated without any cash payment being made in respect
thereof.

immediately prior to the consummation of the Offer shall, automatically and
without any required action on the part of the holder thereof, become fully

participant under the Company ESPP as of immediately prior to the Offer

participant as promptly as practicable following the Effective Time (without
interest).

 

(d) At or prior to the consummation of the  Offer, the Company, the Company
Board and the Compensation Committee of the Company Board, as applicable,

actions necessary to ensure that from and after the Effective Time, neither
Parent nor the Surviving Corporation will be required to deliver Shares or
other capital stock of the Company to any Person pursuant to or in settlement
of  Company Equity Awards.

 

(e) As soon as reasonably practicable after  the Effective Time (but no later
than ten (10) calendar days after the Effective Time), the Surviving
Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, pay
the amounts provided for in _Section 2.08(a)_ \- _Section  2.08(b)_ that are

the right to receive the payments provided for under this _Section 2.08_.

 

 

25  

(f) To the extent a payment pursuant in  this _Section 2.08_ would trigger a
Tax or penalty under Section 409A of the Code, such payment shall be made on
the earliest date that payment would not trigger such Tax or penalty.

shall not have been surrendered immediately prior to such date on which any
amounts payable pursuant to this _Article 2_ would otherwise escheat to or
become the  property of any Governmental Authority, any such amounts shall,
to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, become the property of the
Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto.

involves management or other employees of the Acquired Companies who have a
significant role in the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

Parent informed on a reasonably current basis of any material developments

negotiations relating to  the Product. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, the Company shall (i)
consult with Parent and promptly inform Parent, and provide Parent with a
reasonable opportunity to review, as  reasonably in advance as practicable
under the circumstances, and consider in good faith Parent's comments to or in
connection with any material meetings, filings, submissions, correspondence or
other activities or communications made by or on  behalf of any Acquired
Company to, between or with the FDA, EMA or any other Governmental Authority
performing functions similar to those performed by the FDA relating to the

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the  contrary in this _Section 6.01_ , the
parties hereto acknowledge and agree that nothing contained in this Agreement
shall give Parent or Merger Sub, directly or indirectly, the right to control

prior to the consummation of the Offer. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions hereof,
complete control and supervision over its operations.

 

Section 6.02. _Acquisition  Proposals; Change in Recommendation_.

 

(a) Except as permitted by this _Section  6.02_ , during the Pre-Closing
Period, the Acquired Companies and their respective directors and officers
shall not, and shall not authorize their other Representatives to, and shall
direct them not to (i) initiate, solicit, propose, knowingly  induce or
knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate the making of any Acquisition
Proposal, (ii) other than informing Third Parties of the existence of the
provisions contained in this _Section 6.02_ , engage in, continue or
otherwise  participate in negotiations or discussions with, or furnish any
non-public information (or access thereto) concerning the Company or any of
the Company Subsidiaries to, any Third Party in connection with, or for the
purpose of knowingly encouraging  or knowingly facilitating, an Acquisition
Proposal, (iii) recommend or enter into any Contract, letter of intent,
acquisition agreement, agreement in principle, memorandum of understanding or
similar agreement with respect to any Acquisition  Proposal or (iv) approve,
authorize or agree to do any of the foregoing. Promptly following the
execution of this Agreement, and in any event within one (1) Business Day of
the date of this Agreement, the Acquired Companies shall, and shall direct 
their respective Representatives to, (A) cease and cause to be terminated any
solicitation and any and all existing discussions or negotiations with any
Person conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or any
inquiry or request  for information that could reasonably be expected to lead
to, or result in, an Acquisition Proposal and (B) terminate access by any
Third Party to any physical or electronic data room relating to any potential
Acquisition Transaction.   Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, the Company shall be permitted to grant waivers of, and not enforce,
any standstill provision or similar provision that has the effect of
prohibiting the counterparty thereto from making  an Acquisition Proposal to
the Company Board to the extent

 

 

61  

that the Company Board determines in good faith that the failure to grant such
waiver or to not enforce such provision would reasonably be expected to
constitute a breach of the Company Board's fiduciary duties under Applicable
Law.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the  contrary contained in this Agreement, if
prior to the consummation of the Offer the Company receives a bona fide
written Acquisition Proposal (which Acquisition Proposal was made after the
date of this  Agreement and did not result from a material breach of this
_Section 6.02_ ), and the Company Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such
Acquisition Proposal constitutes,  or could reasonably be expected to lead
to, a Superior Proposal, then the Company and its Representatives may: (i)
furnish any information with respect to the Acquired Companies and access
thereto to any Third Party making such Acquisition Proposal  (and its
Representatives and financing sources); _provided_ that (A) prior to
furnishing any such information, the Company receives from such Third Party an
executed Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement and (B) any such non-public
information  so furnished has been previously provided or Made Available to
Parent or is provided or Made Available (including through the Data Room) to
Parent promptly (and in any event no later than twenty-four (24) hours) after
it is so furnished to such  Third Party or (ii) participate or engage in
negotiations or discussions with the Third Party making such Acquisition
Proposal and its Representatives and financing sources regarding such
Acquisition Proposal.

 

(c) Except as set forth in this _Section  6.02_ (including _Sections 6.02(d),
(e)_ and _(g)_ ), neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall
(i) (A) withdraw (or modify, amend or qualify in a manner adverse to Parent or
Merger Sub), or propose publicly to  withdraw (or modify, amend or qualify in
a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub), the Board Recommendation, (B)
approve, recommend or declare advisable, or propose publicly to approve,
recommend or declare advisable, any Acquisition Proposal or  (C) fail to
include the Board Recommendation in the Schedule 14D-9 when disseminated to
the Company's stockholders (any action described in this clause (i) being
referred to as a " _Change in Recommendation_ ") or (ii) approve, recommend, 
declare advisable or enter into any Contract, letter of intent, acquisition
agreement, agreement in principle, memorandum of understanding or similar
agreement with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, other than an Acceptable
Confidentiality  Agreement (an " _Alternative Acquisition Agreement_ ").

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the  contrary contained in this Agreement, at
any time prior to the consummation of the Offer, the Company Board may make a
Change in Recommendation in response to an Intervening Event if (i) the
Company Board determines in good faith, after  consultation with its outside
legal counsel, that the failure to do so would reasonably be expected to
constitute a breach of the Company Board's fiduciary duties under Applicable
Law, (ii) (A) the Company shall have provided Parent five (5)  Business Days'
prior written notice ( _provided_ that such notice shall not constitute a
Change in Recommendation) advising Parent that the Company intends to make a
Change in Recommendation (and specifying, in reasonable detail, the 
Intervening Event) ( _provided_ that Parent shall be required to keep all such
information confidential in accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality
Agreement), and (B):

 

 

62  

(1) during such five (5) Business Day period, if requested by Parent in good
faith, the Company and its Representatives shall  negotiate with Parent
regarding any changes to the terms

 

of this Agreement and any other proposals made by Parent so that a failure to
effect a Change in Recommendation would no longer constitute a breach of the 
Company Board's fiduciary duties under Applicable Law; and

 

(2) following such five (5) Business Day period, the Company Board shall have
determined in good faith (after consultation with its  outside legal counsel
and financial advisors) that the failure to effect a Change in Recommendation
in response to such Intervening Event would reasonably be expected to
constitute a breach of the Company Board's fiduciary duties under Applicable 
Law.

 

In the event of any material change in any event, occurrence or fact relating
to such Intervening Event (other than in respect of any revisions proposed 
or proposals made by Parent as referred to above), a new notice shall be
required from the Company pursuant to _Section 6.02(d)(ii)_ , except that the
references to five (5) Business Days in this _Section 6.02(d)_ shall be deemed
to be  three (3) Business Days, and the provisions of this _Section 6.02(d)_
shall otherwise apply to the Intervening Event as modified thereby.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the  contrary contained in this Agreement, at
any time prior to the consummation of the Offer if, in response to a bona fide
written Acquisition Proposal made by a Third Party after the date of this
Agreement  which does not arise from a material breach of this _Section 6.02_
and has not been withdrawn, the Company Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors) that (i)
such Acquisition  Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and (ii) the
failure to take an action set forth in clause (x) or (y) would reasonably be
expected to constitute a breach of the Company Board's fiduciary duties under
Applicable Law, then (x) the Company  Board may make a Change in
Recommendation or (y) the Company may terminate this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 8.01(d)(i)_ in order to enter into an Alternative Acquisition
Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal; _provided_   that in either
such case (A) the Company shall have provided to Parent three (3) Business
Days' prior written notice (the " _Superior Proposal Notice_ ") ( _provided_
that such notice shall not constitute a Change in Recommendation) advising 
Parent that the Company intends to take such action (and specifying, in
reasonable detail, the material terms and conditions of any such Superior
Proposal, including the identity of the Third Party making any such Superior
Proposal) and providing  Parent with a complete copy of any written request,
proposal or offer, including any proposed Alternative Acquisition Agreement,
and any other documents containing the material terms of such Superior
Proposal ( _provided_ that Parent shall be  required to keep all such
documents and their terms confidential in accordance with the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement), and (B):

 

(1) during such three  (3) Business Day period, if requested by Parent in
good faith, the Company and its Representatives shall negotiate with Parent
regarding changes to the terms of this Agreement and any other proposals made
by Parent intended by Parent to cause such  Acquisition Proposal to no longer
constitute a Superior Proposal; and

 

 

63  

(2) following such three  (3) Business Day period, the Company Board shall
have determined in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal
counsel and financial advisors) that (x) such Acquisition Proposal continues
to

 

constitute a Superior Proposal, and (y) the failure to make the Change in
Recommendation or terminate this Agreement  pursuant to _Section 8.01(d)(i)_
would reasonably be expected to constitute a breach of the Company Board's
fiduciary duties under Applicable Law.

 

Any material revisions to such Acquisition Proposal shall constitute a new
Acquisition Proposal and shall in each case require the Company to deliver
to  Parent a new Superior Proposal Notice, except that the references to
three (3) Business Days in this _Section 6.02(e)_ shall be deemed to be two
(2) Business Days.

 

(f) During the Pre-Closing Period, the  Company shall promptly (and in any
event no later than twenty-four (24) hours after receipt) advise Parent orally
or in writing in the event that the Company receives any Acquisition Proposal
and in connection with such notice provide to Parent the  material terms and
conditions of any such Acquisition Proposal (including the identity of the
Third Party making any such Acquisition Proposal). During the Pre-Closing
Period, the Company shall (i) keep Parent reasonably informed of the status, 
material details and material terms of any such Acquisition Proposal
(including, prior to initially furnishing any information or to commencing any
discussions or negotiations pursuant to _Section 6.02(b)_ , advising Parent of
any  determination by the Company Board pursuant to _Section 6.02(b)_ ) and
any discussions and negotiations concerning the material terms and conditions
thereof and (ii) promptly provide to Parent (and in any event no later than
twenty four (24)  hours after receipt or delivery thereof) any written
proposal, indication of interest (or amendment thereto) or any other written
material that constitutes an Acquisition Proposal (or amendment thereto)
including copies of any proposed Alternative  Acquisition Agreements and any
other material agreements (or drafts thereof) and any financing commitments
related thereto.

 

 

(g) Nothing contained in this Agreement  shall prohibit the Company or the
Company Board, directly or indirectly, through their respective
Representatives, from (i) taking and disclosing to the stockholders of the
Company any position contemplated by Rule 14d-9, Rule 14e-2(a) or Item 
1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act, (ii) making any
"stop, look and listen" communication to the Company's stockholders pursuant
to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act or (iii) making any
disclosure to the  stockholders of the Company that the Company has
determined in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel)
is required by Applicable Law; _provided_ that this _Section 6.02(g)_ shall
not be deemed to permit the  Company Board to make a Change in Recommendation
except to the extent permitted by _Section 6.02(d)_ \- _(e)_ ; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that nothing in this _Section 6.02_ shall prohibit the Company
from contacting and  engaging in a discussion with any Person or group or
their respective Representatives who has made an Acquisition Proposal solely
for the purpose of clarifying such Acquisition Proposal and the terms thereof
so long as the Company promptly  provides Parent with a reasonably detailed
summary of such discussion.

 

 

Section 6.03. _Approval of  Merger_. The Merger shall be governed by Section
251(h) of the DGCL and shall be effected by Parent, Merger Sub and the Company
as soon as

 

 

64  

practicable following the consummation of the Offer, without a vote of the
stockholders of the Company, pursuant to Section 251(h) of the  DGCL.

 

Section 6.04. _Access to  Information_.

 

(a) Upon reasonable notice to the Company,  the Acquired Companies shall, and
shall cause their respective officers, directors, employees and other
Representatives to, afford Parent's and Merger Sub's officers and Parent's and
Merger Sub's other authorized Representatives reasonable access  as
reasonably requested by Parent, during normal business hours throughout the
Pre-Closing Period, to their respective Representatives, officers, employees,
properties, facilities, books, Contracts, records (including Tax Returns),
reports,  correspondence and any other documents and information of the
Acquired Companies that is in the possession, custody or control of any of the
Acquired Companies or their respective Representatives (whether in physical or
electronic form) and shall  furnish Parent and Merger Sub all financial,
operating and other data and information, in each case, as Parent and Merger
Sub through their officers, employees or other Representatives, may reasonably
request, in each case, for reasonable business  purposes related to the
consummation of the Transactions; _provided_ , _however_ , that any such
access shall be conducted at Parent's expense, at a reasonable time, under the
supervision of appropriate personnel of the Acquired Companies  and in such a
manner as not to unreasonably interfere with the normal operation of the
business of the Acquired Companies. Nothing in this Agreement shall require
any of the Acquired Companies to disclose any information to Parent to the
extent  such disclosure would, in the Company's reasonable discretion (i)
jeopardize any attorney-client or other legal privilege or (ii) contravene any
Applicable Law, fiduciary duty or binding confidentiality obligation of any
Acquired Company or its  Affiliate (so long as the Company has used
reasonable best efforts to make appropriate substitute arrangements to permit
reasonable disclosure not in violation of such Applicable Law, agreement or
duty); _provided_ , _further_ , that  information shall be disclosed subject
to the execution of a joint defense agreement in customary form, and
disclosure may be limited to external counsel for Parent, in each case, to the
extent that the Company determines that doing so may be  reasonably required
for the purposes of complying with applicable Antitrust Laws.

 

(b) No information or knowledge obtained by  Parent or Merger Sub pursuant to
_Section 6.02_ , this _Section 6.04_ or otherwise shall affect or be deemed to
affect or modify any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained
in this Agreement, the conditions to the  obligations of the parties to
consummate the Transactions, including the Offer and the Merger, in accordance
with the terms and provisions of this Agreement or otherwise prejudice in any
way the rights and remedies of Parent or Merger Sub  hereunder, nor shall any
such information, knowledge or investigation be deemed to affect or modify
Parent's or Merger Sub's reliance on the representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements made by the Company in this Agreement.

 

(c) With respect to all information  provided to Parent or any of its
Representatives by the Company or any of its Representatives in connection
with this Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions (including any
information disclosed pursuant to this _Section 6.04_ )  Parent shall comply
with and shall instruct its Representatives to comply with, all of its
obligations under the Confidentiality Agreement.

 

 

65  

Section 6.05. _Employee  Benefit Plan Matters_.

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time,  Parent shall honor, and shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to honor all Company Employee Plans in effect
immediately before the Effective Time that by their terms provide a
contractual entitlement to any employee or service provider party to or 
participating in such arrangements. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing
herein, other than _Section 6.05(b)_ and the terms of such arrangements,
including the contractual rights of such participants, shall prevent Parent
from amending or  terminating any Company Employee Plan or providing
compensation or benefits in its discretion.

 

 

(b) For a period of one (1) year  following the Effective Time, Parent shall
provide, or shall cause to be provided, to each Continuing Employee who
remains employed (i) base salary and base wages and short-term cash incentive
compensation opportunities that are no less favorable  than those in effect
for such Continuing Employee as of the date hereof, (ii) severance payments
and severance benefits, in each case, in accordance with the severance plans
and guidelines in effect as of the date hereof and described on
_Section             6.05(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter,
(iii) health and welfare benefits that are substantially comparable in the
aggregate to the health and welfare benefits provided to such Continuing
Employee as of the Effective Time and (iv) other  benefits that have been
Made Available (excluding long-term incentive, equity and equity-based
compensation and deferred compensation) that are substantially comparable in
the aggregate to the other such benefits provided to such Continuing 
Employees immediately prior to the execution of this Agreement.

 

 

(c) Each Continuing Employee who  participates in the annual bonus program in
respect of the Company's 2019 fiscal year shall, to the extent not paid prior
to the Closing Date, receive a cash bonus in respect of 2019 based on actual
performance against 2019 corporate goals as  determined by the Compensation
Committee consistent with past practices, with individual performance assessed
at one-hundred percent (100%); _provided_ that, if the Closing occurs prior to
the end of 2019, the cash bonuses payable to the  Continuing Employees shall
be prorated based on the number of days elapsed in the 2019 fiscal year
through the Closing Date.

 

(d) From and after the Closing Date, with  respect to Continuing Employees,
Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the service of each such
Continuing Employee with the Acquired Companies prior to the Closing Date to
be recognized for purposes of eligibility to participate,  levels of benefits
(but not for benefit accruals or participation eligibility under any defined
benefit pension plan or plan providing post-retirement medical benefits,
subsidized early retirement benefits, or any other similar benefits) and 
vesting under each compensation, vacation, fringe or other welfare benefit
plan, program or arrangement of the Surviving Corporation or any of its
Affiliates (collectively, the " _Parent Benefit Plans_ ") in which any
Continuing Employee is or  becomes eligible to participate, but solely to the
extent that service was credited to such employee for such purposes under a
comparable Company Employee Plan immediately prior to the Closing Date and to
the extent that such credit would not  result in a duplication of benefits.

 

(e) From and after the Closing Date, with  respect to each Parent Benefit
Plan that is an "employee welfare benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(1) of
ERISA in

 

 

66  

which any Continuing Employee is or becomes eligible to participate, Parent
shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause each such Parent Benefit Plan
to waive all limitations as to pre-existing conditions, waiting periods,
required physical examinations and exclusions with respect to participation
and coverage  requirements applicable under such Parent Benefit Plan for such
Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents to the same extent that
such pre-existing conditions, waiting periods, required physical examinations
and exclusions would not have  applied or would have been waived under the
corresponding Company Employee Plan in which such Continuing Employee was a
participant immediately prior to his commencement of participation in such
Parent Benefit Plan.

 

(f) Prior to the Effective Time, if  requested by Parent in writing not less
than ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, to the extent permitted
by Applicable Law and the terms of the applicable plan or arrangement, the
Company shall cause the Company 401(k) Plan (the "
_Company                401(k) Plan_ ") to be terminated
effective immediately prior to the Effective Time. In the event that Parent
requests that the Company 401(k) Plan be terminated, (i) the Company shall
provide Parent with evidence that such plan has been  terminated (the form
and substance of which shall be subject to review and approval by Parent) not
later than the day immediately preceding the Effective Time and (ii) Parent
shall cause a tax-qualified defined contribution retirement plan  designated
by Parent (the " _Parent 401(k) Plan_ ") to permit each Continuing Employee to
make rollover contributions of "eligible rollover distributions" (within the
meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code, including loans) in the form of 
cash, shares of Parent stock, notes or a combination thereof, in an amount
equal to the full account balance distributed or distributable to such
Continuing Employee from the Company 401(k) Plan to the Parent 401(k) Plan.

 

(g) Parent, the Company and the Surviving  Corporation acknowledge and agree
that all provisions contained in this _Section 6.05_ are included for the sole
benefit of the respective parties to this Agreement and shall not create any
right in any other Person, including any Company  Employee, any participant
in any Company Employee Plan or Parent Benefit Plan or any beneficiary thereof
or any right to continued employment with Parent, Company, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their Affiliates. Nothing in this _Section  6.05_ shall
be deemed to amend any Company Employee Plan, any Parent Benefit Plan or to
require Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates to permit
any Person to participate in any particular benefit plan sponsored or 
maintained by Parent or any of its Affiliates, or to continue or amend any
particular benefit plan, before or after the consummation of the Transactions,
and any such plan may be amended or terminated in accordance with its terms
and Applicable  Law.

 

Section 6.06. _State  Takeover Laws_. If any "control share acquisition,"
"business combination," "fair price," "moratorium" or other anti-takeover
Applicable Law may become or is deemed or purports to be applicable to any
Transaction, then each of the Company,  Parent, Merger Sub, and their
respective Boards of Directors shall use their respective reasonable best
efforts to (i) take such actions with respect thereto as are necessary so that
the Transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on  the terms
contemplated hereby and (ii) otherwise act to render such anti-takeover
Applicable Law (or, in the case of Section 203 of the DGCL, the restrictions
on business combinations provided therein) inapplicable to, or to minimize the
effects of  the foregoing on, the Transactions.

 

 

67  

Section 6.07. _Obligations  of Parent_. Parent shall cause Merger Sub to
perform its obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the
Transactions, including the Offer and the Merger, on the terms and conditions
set forth in this Agreement.

 

Section 6.08. _Director and  Officer Liability_.

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time,  Parent shall (and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to) indemnify, defend and hold harmless, to the fullest
extent permitted under Applicable Law (and shall advance expenses as incurred
to the fullest extent permitted under Applicable Law,  provided the Person to
whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if a
court of competent jurisdiction determines in a final, nonappealable judgment
that such Person is not entitled to be indemnified hereunder), each  present
and former director and officer of the Acquired Companies and each of their
employees who serves as a fiduciary of a Company Stock Plan, as the case may
be, (in each case, when acting in such capacity) (each, an " _Indemnified
Party_ ")  against any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys'
fees), judgments, settlements, fines, losses, claims, damages or Liabilities
(whether civil, criminal, administrative, investigative or other), arising out
of or pertaining to matters  existing or occurring at or prior to the
Effective Times, including the Transactions.

 

(b) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall  use its reasonable best efforts
to purchase a "tail" or "runoff" officers' and directors' liability insurance
policy in respect of acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time
covering each Indemnified Party on terms with respect to  coverage,
deductibles and amounts no less favorable than those of such policy in effect
on the date of this Agreement (the " _Current Policy_ ") for the six (6) year
period following the Closing and at a price not to exceed three hundred
fifty  percent (350%) of the amount per annum the Company paid or required to
be paid for a twelve (12)-month period under the Current Policy (the "
_Current Premium_ "). If the Company or, pursuant to the immediately following
sentence, Parent  obtains prepaid "tail" or "runoff" policies in accordance
with this _Section 6.08(b)_ , the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent
shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain such policies in
full force and effect for their  full term, and they shall continue to honor
the obligations thereunder. If the Company fails to purchase such "tail" or
"runoff" policy prior to Closing, then either (i) Parent may purchase such
"tail" or "runoff" policy on behalf of the Company  or the Surviving
Corporation or (ii) the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to, maintain an officers' and directors' liability
insurance policy in respect of acts or omissions occurring prior to the 
Effective Time covering the Indemnified Parties on terms with respect to each
of coverage and amount no less favorable than those of such policy in effect
as of the date of this Agreement for a period of six (6) years after the
Effective Time; _provided_ _further_ ,  that in satisfying its obligation
under this _Section 6.08(a)(ii)_ , neither Parent nor the Surviving
Corporation shall be obligated to pay annual premiums in excess of three
hundred fifty percent (350%) of the Current Premium and if such  premiums for
such insurance would at any time exceed three hundred fifty percent (350%) of
the Current Premium, then Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall cause to
be maintained such policies of insurance described above that provide the 
maximum dollar amount of coverage available at an annual premium equal to
three hundred fifty percent (350%) of the Current Premium.

 

 

68  

(c) From and after the Effective Time,  Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to fulfill and honor in all respects the obligations of the
Acquired Companies pursuant to (i) each indemnification agreement that has
been Made Available and is in effect between the Company or any of  the
Company Subsidiaries and any individual who at the Effective Time is, or at
any time prior to the Effective Time was, a director or officer of the Company
or of a Company Subsidiary; and (ii) any indemnification provision and any
exculpation  provision set forth in the certificate of incorporation or
bylaws or other Organizational Documents of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary as in effect on the date of this Agreement. From the Effective Time
through the sixth (6th) anniversary of  the date on which the Effective Time
occurs, the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation shall contain, and Parent shall cause the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation to so contain, 
provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification, advancement of
expenses and exculpation than are set forth in the Organizational Documents of
the Company as in effect on the date of this Agreement.

 

(d) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation  or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or  substantially
all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and, in each such case,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the
Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, shall assume the
obligations  set forth in this _Section 6.08_.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this  Agreement to the contrary, the
provisions of this _Section 6.08_ (i) shall survive the acceptance of the
Shares for payment pursuant to the Offer and the consummation of the Merger,
(ii) are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be  enforceable by,
each indemnified or insured party (including each Indemnified Party), his or
her heirs and his or her or their trustees or administrators or persons acting
in similar capacities and (iii) are in addition to, and not in substitution 
for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such
individual may have under the certificate of incorporation or bylaws, or
comparable Organizational Documents of the Company or any Company Subsidiary,
under any applicable  Contract or Applicable Laws, or otherwise. Unless
required by Applicable Law, this _Section 6.08_ may not be amended, altered,
or repealed after the acceptance of the Shares for payment pursuant to the
Offer in such a manner as to adversely  affect any of the rights of any
Person indemnified by this _Section 6.08_ without the prior written consent of
the affected Person.

 

Section 6.09. _Best Efforts_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of  this Agreement, including the
proviso to the first sentence of _Section 6.09_ (d),the Company and Parent
shall (and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to) each use their best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do,  or cause to be
done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing all things
necessary, proper or advisable under Applicable Law to (i) obtain all
necessary actions, waivers, registrations, permits, authorizations, orders,

consummate the Transactions as promptly as practicable and in  any event
prior to the End Date and (ii) deliver required notices or any necessary
additional instruments to, and obtain required consents, waivers or any
additional instruments necessary from, Third Parties in order to consummate

this _Section 6.09_ , each of Parent and the Company shall (i) prepare and
file any notification and report forms and related material required under the
HSR Act and any other applicable Antitrust Laws with respect  to the
Transactions (if any), and any additional filings or notifications and related
material that are necessary, proper or advisable to permit consummation of the
Transactions, as promptly as reasonably practicable (but in no event later
than ten  (10) Business Days from the date of this Agreement for the filing
of the notification and report forms and related material required under the
HSR Act), (ii) provide or cause to be provided as promptly as reasonably
practicable any information and  documentary material that may be requested
by the DOJ or FTC under the HSR Act or by other Governmental Authorities under
applicable Antitrust Laws (if any) and (iii) promptly take such actions as are
necessary or advisable to obtain prompt  expiration or termination of any
applicable waiting period or other approval of consummation of the
Transactions by the DOJ or FTC or other applicable Governmental Authorities,
including to cause to be lifted or vacated any restraint, injunction or 
other legal impediment to any of the Transactions, so as to enable the parties
hereto to consummate the Transactions prior to the End Date. Parent shall pay

Laws (if  any).

 

(c) Subject to Applicable Law, the Company  and Parent and their respective
counsel shall (i) cooperate in all respects with each other in connection with

before a Governmental Authority relating to the Transactions, including any
proceeding initiated by a private person, (ii) have the right to review in
advance, and to the extent practicable each shall consult the other on, any

communication received or given in connection with any proceeding by a private
Person, in each  case regarding any of the Transactions, (iii) promptly
inform each other of any material communication (or any other material
correspondence or memoranda) received from, or given to, the DOJ or the FTC or
any other applicable Governmental Authority  and (iv) promptly furnish each
other with copies of all correspondence, filings and written communications
between them or their Subsidiaries or Affiliates, on the one hand, and any
Governmental Authority or its respective staff, on the other hand,  with
respect to the Transactions. In furtherance of the foregoing, the Company and
Parent shall (with respect to any in-person discussion or meeting), and shall
to the extent practicable (with respect to any telephonic discussion or
meeting),  provide the other party and its counsel with advance notice of and
the opportunity to participate in any material discussion or meeting with any
Governmental Authority in respect of any filing, investigation or other
inquiry in connection with the  Transactions; _provided_ that each of the
parties hereto shall have the right to review in advance, and to the extent
practicable each will consult the other on, all the information relating to
the other parties and their respective  Subsidiaries, as the case may be,
that appears in any filing made with, or written materials (including
correspondence) submitted to,

 

 

70  

any Third Party and/or any Governmental Authority in connection with any
governmental inquiry, investigation or proceeding with respect to  the
Transactions. Neither Parent nor the Company shall commit to or agree with any
Governmental Authority to stay, toll or extend any applicable waiting period
under the HSR Act without the prior written consent of the other. Without
limiting the  foregoing, each of Parent and the Company shall request and
shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain early termination of the waiting
period under the HSR Act. The Company and Parent may, as each deems advisable
and necessary, reasonably  designate any competitively sensitive material
provided to the other under this _Section 6.09_ as "Antitrust Counsel Only
Material." Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 6.09_ ,
materials provided to the other party  or its counsel may be redacted to
remove references concerning the valuation of the Acquired Companies and as
necessary to address reasonable attorney-client or other privilege or
confidentiality concerns.

 

(d) In furtherance of the undertakings of  Parent pursuant to _Section
6.09(a)_ and _Section 6.09(b)_ , but subject to the proviso to this sentence,
Parent shall take, or cause to be taken, any and all steps necessary to avoid
or eliminate each and every impediment under any  Antitrust Law that may be
asserted by any Governmental Authority or any other Person so as to enable the
parties hereto to consummate the Transactions as promptly as practicable, and
in any event prior to the End Date, including proposing,  negotiating,
committing to and effecting, by consent decree, hold separate orders, or
otherwise, the sale, divestiture, license or other disposition of such of its
and its Subsidiaries' assets, properties or businesses or of the assets,
properties  or businesses to be acquired by Parent pursuant hereto, and
entering into such other arrangements, as are necessary or advisable in order
to avoid the entry of, and the commencement of litigation seeking the entry
of, or to effect the dissolution  of, any injunction, temporary restraining
order or other Order in any Proceeding by a Governmental Authority or any
other Person under Antitrust Laws that would otherwise have the effect of
preventing or materially delaying the consummation of the  Transactions;
_provided_ that, notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this _Section
6.09(d)_ or any other provision of this Agreement, in no event shall Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries be required (i) to agree to (nor shall the  Company
or any Company Subsidiaries be permitted to agree unless Parent so directs
them (and they shall, if Parent so directs, agree to, so long as such
agreements are conditioned upon the Closing)) any action, concession or
undertaking, unless  such action, concession or undertaking is conditioned on
the Closing or (ii) to effect or offer or commit to effect any sale,
divestiture, license or other disposition of any assets, properties or
businesses, or to take or make or commit to take or  make any other action,
concession or undertaking, to the extent that any such sale, divestiture,
license, disposition, action, concession or undertaking would constitute or
result in a Substantial Detriment. In addition, Parent shall defend  through
litigation on the merits any claim asserted in court by any Governmental
Authority or any other person under Antitrust Laws in order to avoid entry of,
or to have vacated or terminated, any Order (whether temporary, preliminary
or  permanent) that would prevent the Closing occurring prior to the End
Date.

 

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent  shall, following consultation with
the Company and after considering the Company's views in good faith, and
subject to Parent's and Merger Sub's obligations under this _Section 6.09_ ,
direct and control all aspects of the parties' efforts  with respect to the
HSR Act and other applicable Antitrust Laws with respect to the Transactions,
and the Company shall cooperate in good faith with Parent and Merger Sub in
the parties' efforts to obtain any clearance, approval, waiver or expiry  or
early termination of

 

 

71  

any applicable waiting periods with respect to any Antitrust Laws; _provided_
, that each of the parties shall (i) have the right to  review in advance,
and to the extent practicable each will consult the other on, all the
information relating to the other party and its respective Subsidiaries, as
the case may be, that appears in any filing made with, or written materials 
(including correspondence) submitted to, any Third Party and/or any
Governmental Authority in connection with any governmental inquiry,
investigation or proceeding with respect to the Transactions, (ii) promptly
inform each other of any material  communication (or any other material
correspondence or memoranda) received from, or given to, the DOJ or the FTC or
any other applicable Governmental Authority and (iii) promptly furnish each
other with copies of all correspondence, filings and  written communications
between them or their Subsidiary, on the one hand, and any Governmental
Authority or its respective staff, on the other hand, with respect to the
Transactions. The parties shall (with respect to any in-person discussion or 
meeting), and shall to the extent practicable (with respect to any telephonic
discussion or meeting), provide the other party and its counsel with advance
notice of and the opportunity to participate in any material discussion or
meeting with any  Governmental Authority in respect of any filing,
investigation or other inquiry in connection with the Transactions.

 

(f) Neither Parent nor Merger Sub (nor any  other Subsidiary of Parent) shall
enter into any agreement, transaction or any agreement to effect any
transaction (including any merger or acquisition) that would reasonably be
expected to prevent or materially delay Parent's or Merger Sub's  ability to:
(i) obtain the timely expiration or termination of the waiting period under
the HSR Act, or the authorizations, consents, Orders and approvals required
under any other applicable Antitrust Law, applicable to the Transactions, (ii)
avoid  the entry of, the commencement of litigation seeking the entry of, or
to effect the dissolution of, any injunction, temporary restraining order or
other Order that would prevent or materially delay the consummation of the
Transactions, or  (iii) obtain all other authorizations, consents, Orders and
approvals of Governmental Authorities necessary for the consummation of the
Transactions in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

 

Section 6.10. _Transaction  Litigation_. During the Pre-Closing Period, the
Company shall control the defense of any Transaction Litigation; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Company shall promptly notify Parent in writing of any
such Transaction Litigation.   The Company shall (a) give Parent the right to
review and comment on all material filings or responses to be made by the
Company and shall discuss in advance any material discussions or
communications proposed to be held by the Company with any  Third Party in
connection with any such Transaction Litigation (and the Company shall in good
faith take any comments or feedback provided by Parent into account), and the
opportunity to participate in the defense and settlement of, any such 
Transaction Litigation and (b) if Parent does not exercise such right to
participate (subject to the Company's control right), keep Parent reasonably
and promptly informed with respect to the status of such Transaction
Litigation; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the disclosure of information in
connection therewith shall be subject to the provisions of _Section 6.04_ ,
including regarding attorney-client privileges and other applicable legal
privileges. No compromise or full or  partial settlement of any Transaction
Litigation shall be agreed to by the Company without Parent's prior written
consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed).

 

 

72  

Section 6.11. _Public  Announcements_. Parent and the Company shall consult
with each other before issuing any press release, or scheduling a press
conference or conference call with investors or analysts, and shall use
reasonable best efforts to consult with each  other before making any other
public statement, in each case, with respect to this Agreement or the
Transactions, and shall not issue any such press release or make any such
other public statement relating to this Agreement or the Transactions 
without the consent of the other party, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, except for any such release or
announcement that Parent or the Company determines, after consultation with
outside legal counsel, is  required by Applicable Law or any listing
agreement with or rule of any national or foreign securities exchange or
association upon which the securities of the Company or Parent, as applicable,
are listed, in which case the party required to make  the release or
announcement shall provide notice to and, to the extent reasonably
practicable, consult with the other party about, and shall use its reasonable
best efforts to allow the other party reasonable time (taking into account
the  circumstances) to comment on, such release or announcement in advance of
such issuance, and the party will consider any such reasonable comments that
are timely provided in good faith; _provided_ , _however_ , each party may,
without such  consultation or consent, make any public statement in response
to questions from the press, analysts, investors or those attending industry
conferences, make internal announcements to employees and make disclosures in
Company SEC Documents and any  documents, reports, statements, forms or other
filings required to be made by Parent with the SEC, so long as such
statements, announcements and disclosures substantially reiterate (and are not
inconsistent with) previous press releases, public  disclosures or public
statements approved in advance by the other party; and _provided_ , _further_
, that, notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Parent nor the Company shall be
required to consult with or obtain consents from the other  parties hereto
before issuing any press release or making any other public statement with
respect to any Change in Recommendation, Acquisition Proposal or Intervening
Event or any action taken in response thereto.

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, the  Company shall take all actions as may
be required in accordance with, and subject to the terms of, the applicable
provisions of the Convertible Senior Notes Indentures and the Capped Call
Documentation, including the giving of any notices required  by the
Convertible Senior Notes Indentures and/or the Capped Call Documentation in
connection with the Transactions and any repurchases or conversions of the
Convertible Senior Notes occurring as a result of or in connection with the
Transactions  constituting a Fundamental Change (as defined in the respective
Convertible Senior Notes Indentures). In addition, the Company shall, at
Parent's request prior to the Effective Time, provide all notices and take all
other actions reasonably  requested by Parent in connection with the delivery
of a notice of optional redemption of the 2.50% Convertible Senior Notes due
2022 at or after the Effective Time; _provided_ , that the Company shall not
be required to deliver any notice of   optional redemption prior to the
Effective Time.

 

(b) The Company shall, prior to the  effective date of the Fundamental Change
(as defined in the Convertible Senior Notes Indentures), prepare any
supplemental indentures required in connection with the Transactions and the
consummation thereof to be executed and delivered to the  Trustee (as defined
in the respective Convertible Senior Notes

 

 

73  

Indentures) at or prior to the Effective Time, which supplemental indentures
shall be satisfactory in form and substance to the Trustee and  Parent.

 

(c) The Company shall, prior to the Closing  Date, use reasonable best
efforts to have the restrictive legends removed from the Convertible Senior
Notes and have unrestricted CUSIP numbers assigned to the Convertible Senior
Notes, and shall take all actions as may be required in accordance  with, and
subject to the terms of, the applicable provisions of the Convertible Senior
Notes Indentures, to accomplish the same, including the delivery of any
officers' certificates and opinions of counsel.

 

(d) The Company shall, prior to the Closing  Date, take all such further
actions, including the delivery of any officers' certificates and opinions of
counsel required by the Convertible Senior Notes Indentures as may be
necessary, as reasonably determined by Parent to comply with all of the 
terms and conditions of the Convertible Senior Notes Indentures in connection
with the Transactions.

 

(e) The Company shall provide Parent and  its counsel (i) copies of any
notices or other communications, promptly after the receipt thereof, from the
trustees or holders of notes under the Convertible Senior Notes Indentures or
the counterparties under the Capped Call Transactions, (ii)  prompt updates
on any Convertible Senior Notes surrendered for conversion prior to the
Effective Time, and (iii) reasonable opportunity (and in any event at least
two (2) Business Days to the extent reasonably practicable) to review and
comment on any written notice or communication and any notices, certificates,
press releases, supplemental indentures, legal opinions, officers' 
certificates or other documents or instruments, including those referred to in
clauses (a) through (d) of this _Section 6.12_ deliverable pursuant to or in
connection with the Convertible Senior Notes Indentures or Capped Call
Documentation  prior to the dispatch or making thereof, and the Company shall
consult with Parent or its counsel with respect to such notices or actions and
give due consideration to any recommendations made by Parent or its counsel
prior to the dispatch or  making thereof; _provided_ , that any notices or
actions (including the specific substance and/or content thereof) that are not
required by the terms of the applicable Convertible Senior Notes Indenture or
the Capped Call Documentation and any  time periods for conversion or other
aspects of the conversion process or capped call settlement that are
determined by the Company pursuant to the applicable Convertible Senior Notes
Indenture or Capped Call Documentation, respectively, shall be  subject to
the prior approval of Parent (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed).

 

(f) The Company agrees (A) to use its  reasonable best efforts to cooperate
with Parent, at Parent's written request, to enter into arrangements with the
counterparties of each Capped Call Transaction to cause such Capped Call
Transaction to be exercised, settled, terminated and/or  canceled as of the
Effective Time, _it_ _being_ _understood_ that the calculation and settlement
of any amounts payable thereunder shall be payable only in cash, and subject
to the mutual agreement of Parent, the Company and the  respective
counterparties of each Capped Call Transaction in accordance with the terms of
the Capped Call Documentation or pursuant to such other written agreement
relating to the termination of the Capped Calls Transactions as agreed between
the  Company and the applicable counterparty and (B) not to amend, modify or
terminate the Capped Call Documentation without the prior written consent of
Parent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed ( _it_ _being_ __

 

 

74  

_understood_ , for the avoidance of doubt, that such limitations shall not
apply to any modification or adjustment made unilaterally by  the
counterparty to a Capped Call Transaction pursuant to the terms of the
applicable Capped Call Documentation).

 

(g) Notwithstanding anything in this  Agreement to the contrary, it is
understood and agreed that nothing in this _Section 6.12_ shall require the
Company to (i) other than with respect to any fees, costs, expense or
liabilities expressly provided under the Convertible Senior  Notes Indentures
or Capped Call Documentation (including as a result of any conversions that
are required to be settled prior to the Closing and interest payments required
to be paid prior to the Closing), pay any fees, incur or reimburse any costs 
or expenses, or make any payment prior to the occurrence of the Effective Time
for which it has not first received full reimbursement or is not otherwise
indemnified and held harmless to its reasonable satisfaction by or on behalf
of Parent; (ii)  enter into any instrument or agreement, or agree to any
change or modification to any instrument or agreement, that is effective prior
to the occurrence of the Effective Time or that would be effective if the

disclose information that would reasonably be expected to jeopardize attorney-
client privilege or other privilege or contravene Applicable Law or violate
any Contract; or (iv) compromise any prior Tax or accounting  position. For
the avoidance of doubt, and without limiting the obligations in this _Section
6.12_ , each of Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that its
obligations to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are
not  conditioned upon either (1) the execution of supplemental indentures
pursuant to each Convertible Senior Notes Indenture by the relevant trustee
thereunder or (2) the exercise, settlement, termination and/or cancellation of
the Capped Call  Transactions.

 

(h) Each of Parent and Merger Sub (i) shall  promptly, upon request by the
Company, reimburse the Acquired Companies, for all fees, costs and expenses
(including attorneys' fees) incurred by the Acquired Companies, as applicable,
in connection with the actions of the Company, the Company  Subsidiaries and
their respective Representatives contemplated by this _Section 6.12_ and (ii)
acknowledges and agrees that the Company, the Company Subsidiaries and their
respective Representatives shall not be required to incur any  liability to
any Person prior to the Closing with respect to any actions of the Company,
the Company Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives contemplated by
this _Section 6.12_ ; _provided_ that clauses (i) and (ii) shall not,  prior
to the occurrence of the Effective Time, apply to any fees, costs, expenses or
liabilities expressly provided under the Convertible Senior Notes Indentures
or Capped Call Documentation (including as a result of any conversions that
are  required to be settled prior to the Closing and interest payments
required to be paid prior to the Closing). Parent and Merger Sub shall
indemnify and hold harmless the Company, the Company Subsidiaries and their
respective Representatives from  and against any and all liabilities, losses,
damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards, judgments and penalties
suffered or incurred by any of them in connection with the actions
contemplated by this _Section 6.12_ , in each case,  other than to the extent
any of the foregoing was suffered or incurred prior to the occurrence of the
Effective Time as a result of the bad faith, gross negligence or willful
misconduct of the Company, any of the Company Subsidiaries or their 
respective Representatives or that is expressly provided under the Convertible
Senior Notes Indentures or Capped Call Documentation (including as a result of
any conversions that are required to be settled prior to the Closing and
interest payments  required to be paid prior to the Closing).

necessary or as may be reasonably requested by any party hereto in connection
with this Agreement to cause the  transactions contemplated by _Section 2.08_
and any and all dispositions or cancellations of equity securities of the
Company (including any deemed dispositions or cancellations and any derivative
securities with respect to any equity  securities of the Company) held by
each individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a)
of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company, and who would otherwise be
subject to Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act, to be exempt  under Rule 16b-3
under the Exchange Act.

accordance with the requirements of Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the  Exchange Act
and the instructions thereto as an "employment compensation, severance or
other employee benefit arrangement" within the meaning of Rule 14d-10(d)(2)
under the Exchange Act and satisfy the requirements of the non-exclusive safe
harbor  set forth in Rule 14d-10(d) of the Exchange Act.

 

Section 6.15. _Stock_ _Exchange                De-listing_.
Parent shall cause (and the Company shall reasonably cooperate with Parent to
cause) the Company's securities to be de-listed from Nasdaq and de-registered
under the Exchange Act as promptly as practicable following the Effective 
Time.

Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any notice given
in accordance with the foregoing clauses (i) or (ii) of this _Section  9.01_
shall only be effective if a duplicate copy of such notice is also given by
email in the method described in this _Section 9.01_.

 

Section 9.02. _Survival of  Representations and Warranties_. None of the
representations and warranties contained in this Agreement or in any
certificate or other writing delivered pursuant hereto shall survive the
Effective Time. Any covenant or agreement of the  parties contained in this
Agreement which, by its terms, contemplates performance after the Effective
Time, shall survive in accordance with its terms.

 

Section 9.03. _Amendments  and Waivers_.

 

(a) Prior to the consummation of the Offer,  any provision of this Agreement
may be amended or waived by the parties hereto only by action taken or
authorized by or on behalf of their respective Boards of Directors (or duly
authorized committee thereof), but only if such amendment or waiver  is in
writing and is signed, in the case of an amendment, by each party to this
Agreement or, in the case of a waiver, by each party against whom the waiver
is to be effective; _provided_ , _however_ , that without the further approval
of  the Company's stockholders, no such amendment or waiver shall be made or
given that requires the approval of the stockholders of the Company under the
DGCL unless the required further approval is obtained.

 

(b) Any failure of any of the parties to  comply with any obligation,
covenant, agreement or condition in this Agreement (including _Annex A_ ) may
be waived at any time prior to the Effective Time by any of the parties
entitled to the benefit thereof only by a written instrument  signed by each
such party granting such waiver. No failure or delay by any party in
exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver
thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or
further  exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or
privilege. Subject to _Section 9.04(h)_ , the rights and remedies herein
provided shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies
provided by Applicable Law or in  equity.

 

Section 9.04. _Fees;  Expenses_.

 

(a) Except as otherwise expressly provided  in this Agreement, all costs and
expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions shall
be paid by the party incurring such costs or expenses.

 

(b) If this Agreement is terminated by the  Company pursuant to _Section
8.01(d)(i)_ , prior to or concurrently with such termination, the Company
shall pay (or cause to be paid to) Parent a fee in the amount of $290,000,000
(the " _Termination Fee_ ").

 

 

80  

(c) If this Agreement is terminated by  Parent pursuant to _Section
8.01(c)(i)_ , then the Company shall promptly, but in no event later than two
(2) Business Days after termination of this Agreement, pay (or cause to be
paid to) Parent the Termination Fee.

 

(d) If this Agreement is terminated (i) (A)  by Parent or the Company
pursuant to _Section 8.01(b)(i)_ (but in the case of a termination by the
Company, only if at such

 

time Parent would not be prohibited from terminating this Agreement pursuant
to the proviso in _Section 8.01(b)(i)_ ) or (B) by Parent  pursuant to
_Section 8.01(c)(ii)_ , (ii) at any time on or after the date of this
Agreement and prior to such termination a bona fide Acquisition Proposal shall
have been publicly made or otherwise  become publicly known and not publicly
withdrawn prior to such termination, and (iii) within twelve (12) months after
the date of such termination, (A) the Company enters into an Alternative
Acquisition Agreement providing for an Acquisition  Transaction or (B) an
Acquisition Transaction is consummated, then, the Company shall pay (or cause
to be paid to) Parent the Termination Fee concurrently with the consummation
of any such Acquisition Transaction; _provided_ , _however_ ,  that, for
purposes of this _Section 9.04(d)_ , all references to "twenty percent (20%)"
in the definition of Acquisition Transaction shall be deemed to be references
to "fifty percent (50%)".

 

(e) For the avoidance of doubt, any payment  made by the Company under this
_Section 9.04_ shall be payable only once with respect to this _Section 9.04_
and not in duplication even though such payment may be payable under one or
more provisions hereof.

 

(f) The Company acknowledges that the  agreements contained in this _Section
9.04_ are an integral part of the Transactions and that without such
provisions Parent and Merger Sub would not have entered into this Agreement.

 

(g) If the Company fails to pay the  Termination Fee or any portion thereof
and Parent or Merger Sub commences a suit which results in an Order against
the Company for the Termination Fee or any portion thereof, the Company shall
pay Parent and Merger Sub their costs and expenses  (including reasonable
attorney's fees and disbursements) in connection with such suit, together with
interest on the Termination Fee (or any portion thereof that has not been paid
timely in accordance with this Agreement) and on the amount of such  costs
and expenses, in each case, from and including the date payment of such amount
was due to through the date of actual payment at the prime rate set forth in
The Wall Street Journal in effect on the  date such payment was required to
be made. Any amounts payable pursuant to this _Section 9.04_ shall be paid to
Parent by wire transfer of immediately available funds. Parent shall promptly
provide the Company upon request therefor the wire  transfer information
required to make any payments pursuant to this _Section 9.04_.

 

(h) Notwithstanding anything in this  Agreement to the contrary, if Parent
receives payment from the Company of the Termination Fee pursuant to _Sections
9.04(b)_ \- _(d)_ (i) Parent's right to receive payment from the Company of
the Termination Fee pursuant to _Sections  9.04(b)_ \- _(d)_ and any payments
pursuant to _Section 9.04(g)_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of any of
Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates or representatives
against the Company and any of its former,  current or future officers,
directors, partners, stockholders, Company Stock Option holders, Company
Restricted Share holders, managers, members or Affiliates (collectively, the "
_Company Related Parties_ ") for any loss

 

 

81  

suffered as a result of the failure of the Transactions to be consummated or
for a breach or failure to perform hereunder or otherwise, and  upon payment
of the Termination Fee, none of the Company Related Parties shall have any
further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement
or the Transactions and (ii) if Parent (or its designee) received any payments
from  the Company in respect of any breach of this Agreement, and thereafter
Parent (or its designee) is entitled to receive the Termination Fee under this
_Section 9.04_ , the amount of such Termination Fee shall be reduced by the
aggregate amount of any payments made by the Company to Parent (or its
designee) in respect of any such breaches of this Agreement.

 

Section 9.05. _Assignment;  Benefit_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the
rights, interests or obligations herein may be assigned by any party hereto
without the prior written consent of the other parties and any purported
assignment in violation hereof shall be null  and void ab initio.
Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing
in this Agreement, expressed or implied, is intended to confer on any Person
other than the parties hereto  and their respective successors and permitted
assigns any rights, remedies, obligations or liabilities under or by reason of
this Agreement, except (i) from and after the consummation of the Offer, the
provisions of _Article 2_ relating to  the payment of the Per Share Amount,
which shall be enforceable by the holders of Shares immediately prior to the
consummation of the Offer who validly tendered and did not withdraw Shares
pursuant to the Offer, (ii) from and after the Effective  Time, (A) the
provisions of _Article 2_ relating to the payment of the Per Share Amount, the
Merger Consideration and the Option Consideration, which shall be enforceable
by the holders of Company Common Stock and Company Equity Awards, as 
applicable, as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and (B) the
provisions of _Section 6.08_ , which shall be enforceable by the Persons or
entities benefiting therefrom and (iii) the provisions of _Section 9.04(h)_ ,
which shall be  enforceable by the Company Related Parties.

 

Section 9.06. _Governing Law_.                 This Agreement
and any Proceedings arising out of or related hereto or the Transactions or to
the inducement of any party hereto to enter into this Agreement (whether for
breach of contract, tortious conduct or otherwise and whether predicated on 
common law statute or otherwise) shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to the
conflicts of law rules of such state.

 

Section 9.07. _Jurisdiction_.                 The parties
hereto hereby irrevocably agree (i) that any Proceeding seeking to enforce any
provision of, or based on any matter arising out of or in connection with,
this Agreement or the Transactions shall be brought in the Chancery Court of
the  State of Delaware and any state appellate court therefrom, or, if no
such state court has proper jurisdiction, the Federal District Court for the
District of Delaware located in Wilmington, Delaware, and any appellate court
therefrom and (ii) not  to commence any such Proceeding in any court except
such courts. Each party hereby irrevocably submits to the exclusive
jurisdiction of such court in respect of any legal or equitable Proceeding
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the  Transactions, or
relating to enforcement of any of the terms of this Agreement, and hereby
waives, and agrees not to assert, as a defense in any such Proceeding, any
claim that it is not subject personally to the jurisdiction of such court,
that  the Proceeding is brought in an inconvenient forum, that the venue of
the Proceeding is improper or that this Agreement or the Transactions may not
be enforced in or by such courts. Each party agrees that notice or the

 

 

82  

service of process in any Proceeding arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or the Transactions shall be properly served or delivered  if
delivered in the manner contemplated by _Section 9.01_ or in any other manner
permitted by Applicable Law.

 

Section 9.08. _Waiver of  Jury Trial_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY

 

APPLICABLE LAW ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY PROCEEDING ARISING
DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE 
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT
(I) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO  ENFORCE EITHER OF SUCH WAIVERS, (II) IT UNDERSTANDS AND
HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVERS, (III) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVERS
VOLUNTARILY AND (IV) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY,
AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS  AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION
9.08_.

 

Section 9.09. _Specific  Performance; Remedies_. The parties agree that
irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even if available, would not be
an adequate remedy, would occur and that the parties would not have any
adequate remedy at law in the event that any  of the provisions of this
Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were
otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that (a) the parties shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions, specific performance, or  other
equitable relief, to prevent breaches or threatened or anticipated breaches of
this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement in the courts described in _Section 9.07_ , without proof of damages
or  otherwise, and (b) the right of specific performance is an integral part
of the Transactions and without that right, neither the Company nor Parent
would have entered into this Agreement. Each of the parties agrees that it
waives the defense of  adequacy of a remedy at law and will not oppose the
granting of an injunction or injunctions, specific performance or other
equitable relief on the basis that the other parties have an adequate remedy
at law or equity. The parties acknowledge and  agree that any party seeking
an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in accordance
with this _Section 9.09_ shall not be required to provide any  bond or other
security in connection with any such order or injunction.

 

Section 9.10. _Severability_.                 If any term,
provision, covenant or restriction of this Agreement is held by a court of
competent jurisdiction or other Governmental Authority to be invalid, void or
unenforceable, the remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and
restrictions  of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and
shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated so long as the economic
or legal substance of the Offer, the Merger and the other Transactions is not
affected in any manner materially  adverse to any party. Upon such a holding,
the parties agree to negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to
effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an
acceptable manner, in order that the Offer, the Merger  and the other
Transactions be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent
possible.

 

 

83  

Section 9.11. _Entire  Agreement_. This Agreement, including the exhibits and
annexes to this Agreement, the Company Disclosure Letter and the Parent
Disclosure Letter and any documents delivered by the parties in connection
herewith and the Confidentiality  Agreement constitute the entire agreement
among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all
prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties
with respect thereto; _provided_ , _however_ ,  that, the Confidentiality
Agreement shall not be

 

superseded, shall survive any termination of this Agreement and shall continue
in full force and effect until the earlier to occur of (a) the  Effective
Time and (b) the date on which the Confidentiality Agreement expires in
accordance with its terms or is validly terminated by the parties thereto.

 

Section 9.12. _Rules of  Construction_. Each of the parties hereto
acknowledges that it has been represented by counsel of its choice throughout
all negotiations that have preceded the execution of this Agreement, and that
it has executed the same with the advice of  said independent counsel. Each
party and its counsel cooperated and participated in the drafting and
preparation of this Agreement and the documents referred to in this Agreement,
and any and all drafts relating thereto exchanged among the parties  shall be
deemed the work product of all of the parties and may not be construed against
any party by reason of its drafting or preparation. Accordingly, any rule of
law or any legal decision that would require interpretation of any ambiguities
in  this Agreement against any party that drafted or prepared it is of no
application and is hereby expressly waived by each of the parties hereto. Any
matter set forth on the Company Disclosure Letter shall not be deemed to
constitute an admission by  the Company or any Company Subsidiary, or to
otherwise imply, that any such matter is material, is required to be disclosed
by the Company under this Agreement or falls within relevant minimum
thresholds or materiality standards set forth in this  Agreement, nor shall
be construed as an admission or indication to any Third Party that any breach
or violation exists or has actually occurred.

 

Section 9.13. _Counterparts;  Effectiveness_. This Agreement may be signed in
any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same
effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument.
This Agreement shall become effective  when each party hereto shall have
received a counterpart hereof signed by all of the other parties hereto, _it_
_being_ _understood_ and agreed that all parties hereto need not sign the same
counterpart. Until and unless each  party has received a counterpart hereof
signed by each other party hereto, this Agreement shall have no effect and no
party shall have any right or obligation hereunder (whether by virtue of any
other oral or written agreement or other  communication). Signatures to this
Agreement transmitted by electronic mail in PDF form, or by any other
electronic means designed to preserve the original graphic and pictorial

_Annex A_

 

Conditions of the Offer

 

 

The obligation of Merger Sub to accept for payment and pay for Shares validly
tendered (and not validly withdrawn) pursuant to the  Offer is subject to the
satisfaction of the conditions set forth in clauses "(a)" through "(h)" below.
Accordingly, notwithstanding any other term of the Offer or the Agreement to
the contrary, Merger Sub shall not be required to accept for payment  or,
subject to any applicable rules and regulations of the SEC, including Exchange
Act Rule 14e-l(c) (relating to Merger Sub's obligation to pay for or return
tendered Shares promptly after the termination or withdrawal of the Offer),
pay for, and  may delay the acceptance for payment of or, subject to such
rules and regulations, the payment for, any tendered Shares: (i) if the Merger
Agreement has been validly terminated in accordance with _Section 8.01_ ; and
(ii) at any scheduled Offer  Expiration Time (as the Offer may have been
extended pursuant to, and subject to any requirements to extend the Offer
pursuant to, _Section 2.01(c)_ of the Merger Agreement), if: (x) the Minimum
Tender Condition or the Termination Condition  shall not be satisfied by the
Offer Expiration Time; or (y) any of the additional conditions set forth below
shall not be satisfied or (to the extent permitted by Applicable Law) waived
in writing by Parent:

 

(a) there shall have been validly tendered  in the Offer and not withdrawn
that number of Shares that (together with any Shares owned by Parent and its
Affiliates and excluding any Shares tendered pursuant to guaranteed delivery
procedures that have not yet been "received" (as such term is  defined in
Section 251(h)(6)(f) of the DGCL)) represent at least a majority of the Shares
outstanding at the Offer Expiration Time (the " _Minimum Tender Condition_ ");

 

(b) any waiting period (or any extension  thereof) under the HSR Act
applicable to the Transactions shall have expired or been terminated;

 

(c) no Governmental Authority having  jurisdiction over any party hereto
shall have issued any Order, nor any Applicable Law or other legal restraint,
injunction or prohibition shall be in effect, that (i) makes consummation of
the Offer or the Merger illegal or otherwise prohibited or  (ii) imposes a
Substantial Detriment; _provided_ that Parent and Merger Sub shall not be
permitted to invoke this clause (c) if the issuance of such Order, Applicable
Law or other legal restraint, injunction or prohibition is principally 
caused by the material breach by Parent or Merger Sub of any of its covenants
or obligations set forth in this Agreement;

 

(d) since the date of the Merger Agreement,  there shall not have been any
Effect that has had or would reasonably be expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect;

 

(e) (i) the representation and warranty of  the Company set forth in _Section
4.11(c)_ shall be true and correct as of the date of the Merger Agreement,
(ii) each of the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in
_Section 4.01_ , _Section 4.02_ , _Section  4.03_ and _Section 4.24(g)(vi)_
of the Merger Agreement shall be true and correct in all material respects as
of the consummation of the Offer, as if made at such time, except to the
extent such

   

representation or warranty expressly relates to a specific date (in which case
on and as of such specific date), (iii) the representations  and warranties
of the Company set forth in _Section 4.06(a)_ shall be true and correct except
for de minimis inaccuracies as of the consummation of the Offer, as if made at
such time, except to the  extent any such representation or warranty
expressly relates to a specific date (in which case on and as of such specific
date), and (iv) each of the other representations and warranties of the
Company set forth in the Merger Agreement shall be  true and correct as of
the consummation of the Offer, as if made at such time, except to the extent
any such representation or warranty expressly relates to a specific date (in
which case on and as of such specific date), other than in the case of 
clause (iv) for such failures to be true and correct that have not had or
would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect (
_it_ _being_ _understood_ that for this purpose all references to the term
"Company  Material Adverse Effect" and other qualifications based on the word
"material," set forth in any such representations and warranties shall be
disregarded);

 

(f) the Company shall have complied in all  material respects with each of
the covenants, obligations and agreements it is required to comply with or
perform at or prior to the Effective Time;

 

(g) Parent and Merger Sub shall have  received a certificate of the Company,
signed by an officer of the Company, dated the date on the which the Offer
expires certifying that the conditions specified in clauses (d), (e) and (f)
have been satisfied; and

 

(h) the Merger Agreement shall not have been  terminated in accordance with
its terms (the " _Termination Condition_ ").

 

The foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of Parent and Merger Sub
and, except for the Minimum Tender Condition and the  Termination Condition
(each of which may only be waived with the prior written consent of the
Company), may be waived by Parent or Merger Sub in whole or in part at any
time and from time to time and in the sole discretion of Parent or Merger
Sub,  subject in each case to the terms of the Merger Agreement and
Applicable Law. The foregoing conditions shall be in addition to, and not a
limitation of, the rights and obligations of Parent and Merger Sub with
respect to extending, terminating  and/or modifying the Offer pursuant to the
terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement or Applicable Law. The failure by
Parent, Merger Sub or any other Affiliate of Parent at any time to exercise
any of the foregoing rights shall not be deemed a  waiver of any such right,
the waiver of any such right with respect to particular facts and
circumstances shall not be deemed a waiver with respect to any other facts and
circumstances and each such right shall be deemed an ongoing right that may
be  asserted at any time and from time to time.

 

Capitalized terms used in this _Annex A_ but not defined herein shall have the
meanings set forth in the Agreement to which it  is attached, except that the
term " _Merger Agreement_ " shall be deemed to refer to the Agreement to which
this _Annex A_ is attached.
