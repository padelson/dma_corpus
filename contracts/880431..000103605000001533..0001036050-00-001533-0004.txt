power and authority to own and operate its properties and assets, and to carry
on its business as presently conducted and as proposed to be conducted. The
Company is presently qualified to do business as a foreign corporation in

condition of the Company. The Company has furnished to counsel for the Purchaser

that are not subject to any of the stock option plans or employee compensation
plans of the Company. Warrants to purchase 1,387,949 shares of the Company's
Common Stock are held by third parties. Of these, warrants to purchase 1,158,210
shares contain antidilution provisions that increase the number of shares
subject to the warrants and decrease the exercise price if the Company issues
Common Stock and/or other securities convertible into Common Stock at certain
prices. Except as set forth above and as provided in the Company's Certificate
of Incorporation, there are no options, warrants or other rights to purchase or
acquire any of the Company's authorized and unissued capital stock.

indemnification in the Registration Rights Agreement which may be
unenforceable), subject to laws of general application relating to bankruptcy,
insolvency and the relief of debtors and rules of law governing specific
performance, injunctive relief or other equitable remedies.  The Preferred
Shares and the Common Shares, when issued in compliance with the provisions of
this Agreement, will be validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable, and will
have the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions described in the
Certificate of Designations and the Certificate of Incorporation, respectively;
the Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Preferred Shares has been duly
and validly reserved and, when issued in compliance with the provisions of the
Certificate of Designations, will be validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable; and the Shares and the Conversion Stock will be free of any liens
or encumbrances (assuming the Purchaser takes the Shares with no notice thereof)
other than any liens or encumbrances created by or imposed upon the holders;
provided, however, that the Shares and the Conversion Stock may be subject to
restrictions on transfer
<PAGE>

under state or federal securities laws and restrictions set forth in the
Registration Rights Agreement. The issuance of the Shares is not subject to any
preemptive rights or rights of first refusal.

     Section 3.6.  Proprietary Rights.  The Company has title and ownership of,
or rights to use, all patents, trademarks, service marks, trade names,
copyrights, trade secrets, information, proprietary rights and processes
necessary for its business as now conducted without any conflict with or
infringement of the rights of others, except as would not have a material
adverse effect on the Company.  Except as set forth in Schedule 2 hereof, there
are no outstanding options, licenses, or agreements of any kind relating to the
subject of the License Agreement and the transactions and the research
contemplated by the License Agreement, nor is the Company bound by or a party to
any options, licenses or agreements of any kind with respect to the patents,
trademarks, service marks, trade names, copyrights, trade secrets, licenses,
information, proprietary rights and processes of any other person or entity.
The Company has not received any communications alleging that the Company has
violated or, by conducting its business as proposed, would violate any of the
patents, trademarks, service marks, trade names, copyrights or trade proprietary
rights of any other person or entity and that management reasonably believes
will have a material adverse effect on the Company.  To the best knowledge of
the Company, none of its employees is obligated under any contract (including
licenses, covenants or commitments of any nature) or other agreement, or subject
to any judgment, decree or order of any court or administrative agency, that
would interfere with the use of his or her best efforts to promote the interests
of the Company or that would conflict with the Company's business as proposed to
be conducted.  Neither the execution nor delivery of this Agreement or the
Registration Rights Agreement, nor the carrying on of the Company's business by
the employees of the Company, nor the conduct of the Company's business as
proposed, will, to the best of the Company's knowledge, conflict with or result
in a breach of the terms, conditions or provisions of, or constitute a default
under, any contract, covenant or instrument under which the Company or any of
such employees is now obligated except as would not have a material adverse
effect on the Company.  The Company does not believe it is or will be necessary
to utilize any inventions of any of its employees (or people it currently
intends to hire) made prior to their employment by the Company.

     Section 3.7.  Litigation, Etc.  There are no actions, suits, proceedings or
investigations pending or, to the Company's knowledge, threatened against the
Company or its properties before any court or governmental agency which
management believes is likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company.
The foregoing includes, without limitation, actions pending or threatened (or
any basis therefor known to the Company) involving the prior employment of any
of
<PAGE>

the Company's employees, their use in connection with the Company's business of
any information or techniques allegedly proprietary to any of their former
employers, or their obligations under any agreements with prior employers. The
Company is not a party or subject to the provisions of any order, writ,
injunction, judgment or decree of any court or government agency or
instrumentality. There is no action, suit, proceeding or investigation by the

                                                      Philadelphia, Pennsylvania

     For Value Received, Magainin Pharmaceuticals Inc., a Delaware corporation
("Borrower"), hereby unconditionally promises to pay to the order of Genentech,

thereon, payable on the dates and in the manner set forth below.

       (a)   Principal Repayment.  The outstanding principal amount of the Note
shall be payable one year after the date of issuance (the "Maturity Date"),
provided, however, that the Company may at any time prepay in whole or in part
the outstanding principal amount under the Note, plus accrued and unpaid
Interest, without penalty.

       (b)   Interest Rate.  Borrower further promises to pay interest on the
sum of the unpaid principal balance of the Note outstanding on each day, from
the date of this Note until all such principal amounts shall have been repaid in
full, which interest shall be payable at the rate of [2% plus the highest prime
rate of major banking institutions as reported in the Federal Reserve H.15
weekly bulletin in the three (3) month period immediately preceding the date of
issuance of the Note] per annum.  Interest shall be payable at the Maturity Date
and shall be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year for the actual number of
days elapsed.
<PAGE>

       (c)   Place of Payment.  All amounts payable hereunder shall be payable
to Lender at the address it specifies to Borrower in writing.

       (d)   Application of Payments.  All payments on this Note shall be
applied first to accrued interest and thereafter to the outstanding principal
balance hereof.

       (e)   Default.  Borrower's failure to pay timely any of the principal
amount due under this Note on the date the same becomes due and payable or any
accrued interest or other amounts due under this Note on the date the same
becomes due and payable or within ten (10) calendar days after written receipt
of notice of failure to pay shall constitute a default under this Note (an
"Event of Default").  If an Event of Default is not cured within thirty (30)
days of the receipt of notice of failure to pay, all unpaid principal, accrued
interest and other amounts owing thereunder shall, at the option of Lender, be
immediately collectible by Lender pursuant to applicable law.

       (f)   Assignment by Company.  Neither this Note nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder may be assigned, by operation of law or
otherwise, in whole or in part, by Borrower without the prior written consent of
Lender.

permitted hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly
given if personally delivered or mailed by registered or certified mail, postage
prepaid, or by recognized overnight courier or personal delivery at the
respective addresses of the parties as set forth herein or on the register
maintained by Borrower. Any party hereto may by notice so given change its
address for future notice hereunder. Notice shall conclusively be deemed to have
been given when received.

       (h)   Waiver.  Borrower waives presentment and demand for payment, notice
of dishonor, protest and notice of protest of this Note, and shall pay all costs
of collection when incurred, including, without limitation, reasonable
attorneys' fees, costs and other expenses.  The right to plead any and all
statutes of limitations as a defense to any demands hereunder is hereby waived
to the fullest extent permitted by law.

       (i)   Attorney's Fees.  In the event of default by the Borrower (or its
assignee) in the payment of interest due on this Note, Lender shall be entitled
to receive and Borrower (or its assignee) agrees to pay all costs of collection
incurred by Lender, including, without limitation, reasonable attorney"s fees
for consultation and suit.

       (j)   Governing Law.  This Note shall be governed by, and construed and
enforced in accordance with, the laws of the State of California, excluding
conflict of laws principles that would cause the application of laws of any
other jurisdiction.

       (k)   Successors and Assigns.  The provisions of this Note shall inure to
the benefit of and be binding on any successor to Borrower and shall extend to
any holder hereof.
