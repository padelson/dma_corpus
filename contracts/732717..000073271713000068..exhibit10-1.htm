AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

  

  

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (hereinafter called this "Agreement"), dated as
of July 12, 2013, is by and among Leap Wireless International, Inc., a
Delaware corporation (the "Company"), ATandT Inc., a Delaware corporation
("Parent"), Laser, Inc., a Delaware Corporation (the "Stockholders'
Representative"), and Mariner Acquisition Sub Inc., a Delaware corporation and
a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub," with the Company and Merger
Sub sometimes being hereinafter collectively referred to, together, as the
"Constituent Corporations").

  

  

RECITALS

  

  

WHEREAS, the respective boards of directors of each of Parent, Merger Sub and
the Company have approved the merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company
(the "Merger") upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement and have approved and declared advisable this Agreement;

  

  

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, as a
condition and inducement to Parent's and Merger Sub's willingness to enter
into this Agreement and incurring the obligations set forth herein, a
stockholder of the Company, who owns, beneficially or of record, an aggregate
of approximately 29.8% of the Shares issued and outstanding on the date of
this Agreement, is entering into a Voting Agreement with Parent and the
Company in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A (the "Voting Agreement"),
pursuant to which, upon the terms and conditions set forth therein, such
stockholder has agreed to vote the Shares over which it has voting control in
favor of the adoption of this Agreement, and the board of directors of the
Company has approved the entry into the Voting Agreement by the parties
thereto;

  

  

WHEREAS, the parties to this Agreement agree that, prior to the consummation
of the Merger, Parent and the Stockholders' Representative shall enter into a
contingent value rights agreement substantially in the form attached hereto as
Exhibit B (subject to changes to reflect the reasonable requests of the Rights
Agent) (the "CVR Agreement") with an institution selected by Parent that is
reasonably satisfactory to the Company to act as Rights Agent (as such term is
defined in the CVR Agreement), pursuant to which Parent shall grant to each
holder of Shares (other than Excluded Shares), Company Restricted Stock,
certain Company Options and Company Stock Units a Contingent Value Right to
receive a certain payment as part of the Per Share Merger Consideration
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement; and

  

  

WHEREAS, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with this
Agreement.

  

  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, and of the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, the parties hereto
agree as follows:

THE MERGER; CLOSING; EFFECTIVE TIME

  

  

1.1. The Merger

  

  

. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, at
the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company and
the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall thereupon cease. The
Company shall be the surviving corporation in the Merger (sometimes
hereinafter referred to as the "Surviving Corporation"), and the separate
corporate existence of the Company, with all of its rights, privileges,
immunities, powers and franchises, shall continue unaffected by the Merger,
except as set forth in Article II. The Merger shall have the effects specified
in the Delaware General Corporation Law, as amended (the "DGCL").

  

  

1.2. Closing

  

  

. Unless otherwise mutually agreed in writing between the Company and Parent,
the closing for the Merger (the "Closing") shall take place at the offices of
Sullivan and Cromwell LLP, 125 Broad Street, New York, New York, at 9:00 A.M.
(Eastern Time) on the first (1st) business day (the "Closing Date") following
the day on which the last to be satisfied or waived of the conditions set
forth in Article IV (other than those conditions that by their nature are to
be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the fulfillment or waiver of those
conditions) shall be satisfied or waived in accordance with this Agreement.
For purposes of this Agreement, the term "business day" shall mean any day
ending at 11:59 p.m. (Eastern Time) other than a Saturday or Sunday or a day
on which banks are required or authorized to close in the City of New York.

  

  

1.3. Effective Time

  

  

. As soon as practicable following the Closing, the Company and Parent will
cause a Certificate of Merger (the "Delaware Certificate of Merger") to be
executed, acknowledged and filed with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware as provided in Section 251 of the DGCL. The Merger shall become
effective at the time when the Delaware Certificate of Merger has been duly
filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at such later
time as may be agreed by the parties in writing and specified in the Delaware
Certificate of Merger (the "Effective Time").

  

  

ARTICLE II

  

  


 

  

  

CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION AND BY-LAWS

  

  

OF THE SURVIVING CORPORATION

  

  

2.1. The Certificate of Incorporation

prior to the Effective Time shall be the certificate of incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation (the "Charter"), until duly amended as provided therein
or by applicable Law.

  

  

2.2. The By-Laws

  

  

. The parties hereto shall take all actions necessary so that the by-laws of
Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the
by-laws of the Surviving Corporation (the "By-Laws"), until thereafter amended
as provided therein or by applicable Law.

  

  

ARTICLE III

  

  


 

  

  

DIRECTORS OF THE SURVIVING CORPORATION

  

  

3.1. Directors

  

  

. The parties hereto shall take all actions necessary so that the board of
directors of Merger Sub at the Effective Time shall, from and after the
Effective Time, be the directors of the Surviving Corporation until their
successors have been duly elected or appointed and qualified or until their
earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the Charter and the
By-Laws.

  

  

ARTICLE IV

  

  


 

  

  

EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK;

  

  

EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

  

  

4.1. Effect on Capital Stock

  

  

. At the Effective Time, as a result of the Merger and without any action on
the part of the holder of any capital stock of the Company:

  

  

(a) Merger Consideration. Each share of common stock, par value $0.0001 per
share, of the Company (a "Share" or, collectively, the "Shares") issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than (i) Shares
owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any other direct or indirect subsidiary of
Parent and Shares owned by the Company or any direct or indirect subsidiary of
the Company, and in each case not held on behalf of third parties, (ii) Shares
of Company Restricted Stock which shall be treated in accordance with Section
4.3(b) and (iii) Shares that are owned by stockholders ("Dissenting
Stockholders") who have perfected and not withdrawn a demand for appraisal
rights pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL (each, an "Excluded Share" and
collectively, "Excluded Shares")) shall be converted into the right to receive
(y) $15.00 per Share (the "Per Share Cash Merger Consideration") and (z) one
non-transferable contingent value right (a "Contingent Value Right") to be
issued by Parent pursuant to the CVR Agreement (the Per Share Cash Merger
Consideration together with the Contingent Value Right, the "Per Share Merger
Consideration"). At the Effective Time, all of the Shares shall cease to be
outstanding, shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each certificate
(a "Certificate," it being understood that any reference herein to a
"Certificate" shall be deemed to include reference to book-entry account
statements relating to the ownership of Shares) formerly representing any of
the Shares (other than Excluded Shares), and each book-entry account statement
relating to the ownership of Shares (other than Excluded Shares), shall
thereafter represent only the right to receive the Per Share Merger
Consideration, without interest.

  

  

(b) Treatment of Excluded Shares. Except as provided in the second sentence of
this Section 4.1(b), each Excluded Share shall, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of the holder of such Excluded Share, cease to
be outstanding, be cancelled without payment of any consideration therefor and
shall cease to exist, subject to any rights the holder thereof may have under
Section 4.2(f). Each Excluded Share held by Merger Sub or any direct or
indirect subsidiary of Parent or the Company shall remain outstanding and be
unaffected by the Merger.

  

  

(c) Merger Sub. At the Effective Time, each share of common stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into one share of common stock, par value
$0.0001 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

  

  

4.2. Exchange of Certificates

  

  

.

  

  

(a) Paying Agent. At the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause
to be deposited, with a paying agent selected by Parent with the Company's
prior approval (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) (the
"Paying Agent"), for the benefit of the holders of Shares, a cash amount in
immediately available funds necessary for the Paying Agent to make payments
under Section 4.1(a) (such cash amount being hereinafter referred to as the
"Exchange Fund"). The Paying Agent shall invest the Exchange Fund as directed
by Parent; provided that such investments shall be in obligations of or
guaranteed by the United States of America, in commercial paper obligations
rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and
Poor's Corporation, respectively, in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase
agreements or banker's acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding
$1 billion, or in money market funds having a rating in the highest investment
category granted by a recognized credit rating agency at the time of
acquisition or a combination of the foregoing and, in any such case, no such
instrument shall have a maturity exceeding three months. To the extent that
there are losses with respect to such investments, or the Exchange Fund
diminishes for other reasons below the level required to make prompt cash
payment of the aggregate Per Share Cash Merger Consideration as contemplated
hereby, Parent shall promptly replace or restore the cash in the Exchange Fund
lost through such investments or other events so as to ensure that the
Exchange Fund is at all times maintained at a level sufficient to make such
cash payments. Any interest and other income resulting from such investment
shall become a part of the Exchange Fund, and any amounts in excess of the
amounts payable under Section 4.1(a) shall be promptly returned to Parent.

  

  

(b) Exchange Procedures. Promptly after the Effective Time (and in any event
within three (3) business days thereafter), the Surviving Corporation shall
cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of Shares (other than
holders of Excluded Shares) (i) a letter of transmittal in customary form
specifying that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits
of loss in lieu of the Certificates as provided in Section 4.2(e)) to the
Paying Agent, such letter of transmittal to be in such form and have such
other provisions as Parent and the Company may reasonably agree, and (ii)
instructions for surrendering the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu
of the Certificates as provided in Section 4.2(e)) to the Paying Agent. Upon
surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu of the Certificate as
provided in Section 4.2(e)) to the Paying Agent in accordance with the terms
of such letter of transmittal, the holder of such Certificate shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor (1) a cash amount in immediately
available funds (after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as
provided in Section 4.2(g)) equal to (x) the number of Shares represented by
such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu of the Certificate as provided
in Section 4.2(e)) multiplied by (y) the Per Share Cash Merger Consideration
and (2) one Contingent Value Right for each Share represented by such
Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu of the Certificate as provided in
Section 4.2(e)), and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be
cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due
surrender of the Certificates. In the event of a transfer of ownership of
Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, a check
for any cash to be exchanged upon due surrender of the Certificate may be
issued to such transferee if the Certificate formerly representing such Shares
is presented to the Paying Agent, accompanied by all documents required to
evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock
transfer Taxes have been paid or are not applicable.

  

  

(c) Transfers. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers
on the stock transfer books of the Company of the Shares that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any
Certificate is presented to the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying
Agent for transfer, it shall be cancelled and exchanged for the cash amount in
immediately available funds and the Contingent Value Right(s) to which the
holder of the Certificate is entitled pursuant to this Article IV.

  

  

(d) Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including
the proceeds of any investments of the Exchange Fund) that remains unclaimed
by the stockholders of the Company for 180 days after the Effective Time shall
be delivered to the Surviving Corporation. Any holder of Shares (other than
Excluded Shares) who has not theretofore complied with this Article IV shall
thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of the Per Share
Merger Consideration (after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as
provided in Section 4.2(g)) upon due surrender of its Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu of the Certificates as provided in Section 4.2(e)),
without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the
Surviving Corporation, Parent, the Paying Agent or any other Person shall be
liable to any former holder of Shares for any amount properly delivered to a
public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
Laws. For the purposes of this Agreement, the term "Person" shall mean any
individual, corporation (including not-for-profit), general or limited
partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, estate, trust,
association, organization, Governmental Entity or other entity of any kind or
nature.

  

  

(e) Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event any Certificate shall
have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that
fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed
and, if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in customary
amount and upon such terms as may be required by Parent as indemnity against
any claim that may be made against it or the Surviving Corporation with
respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue (1) a check in the
amount (after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in
Section 4.2(g)) equal to (x) the number of Shares represented by such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate multiplied by (y) the Per Share Cash Merger
Consideration and (2) one Contingent Value Right for each Share represented by
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate.

  

  

(f) Appraisal Rights. No Person who has perfected a demand for appraisal
rights pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL shall be entitled to receive the
Per Share Merger Consideration with respect to the Shares owned by such Person
unless and until such Person shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such
Person's right to appraisal under the DGCL. Each Dissenting Stockholder shall
be entitled to receive only the payment provided by Section 262 of the DGCL
with respect to Shares owned by such Dissenting Stockholder. The Company shall
give Parent (i) prompt notice of any written demands for appraisal, attempted
withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments served pursuant to
applicable Law that are received by the Company relating to stockholders'
rights of appraisal and (ii) the opportunity to direct all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the DGCL. The Company
shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make
any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal, offer to settle or
settle any such demands or approve any withdrawal of any such demands. Any
Contingent Value Right to which a Dissenting Stockholder would be entitled but
for this Section 4.2(f) shall be deemed to be outstanding for the purposes of
determining the amount to be paid per Contingent Value Right.

  

  

(g) Withholding Rights. Each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Shares such amounts as it is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), or any other
applicable state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so
withheld by the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, such
withheld amounts (i) shall be remitted by Parent or the Surviving Corporation,
as applicable, to the applicable Governmental Entity, and (ii) shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder
of Shares in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the
Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be.

  

  

4.3. Treatment of Stock Plans

  

  

.

  

  

(a) Company Options.

  

  

(i) At least 20 days prior to the Closing Date, each holder of outstanding
options to purchase Shares ("Company Options"), whether vested or unvested,
that was granted under the Stock Plans and that has an exercise price per
Share underlying such Company Option (the "Applicable Exercise Price") that is
greater than the Per Share Cash Merger Consideration shall be provided with
written notice that such holder shall, during the period beginning on the date
of such notice and ending on the business day preceding the Closing Date (the
"Exercise Period"), have the right to exercise such Company Option by
providing the Company with a notice of exercise and a cash amount equal to (A)
the Applicable Exercise Price, less (B) the Per Share Cash Merger
Consideration, with such exercise conditioned on the occurrence of the
Effective Time. Each Company Option that is exercised pursuant to this Section
4.3(a)(i) shall be settled at the Effective Time in exchange for one
Contingent Value Right in respect of each Share underlying such Company
Option. Any Company Option described in this Section 4.3(a)(i) that is not
exercised during the Exercise Period shall be cancelled at the Effective Time
for no consideration.

  

  

(ii) Each Company Option that remains outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and that has an Applicable Exercise Price that is equal to or
less than the Per Share Cash Merger Consideration shall be cancelled and shall
only entitle the holder of such Company Option to receive, as soon as
reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, (A) an amount in cash equal
to the product of (1) the total number of Shares underlying the Company Option
multiplied by (2) the excess, if any, of the Per Share Cash Merger
Consideration over the exercise price per Share underlying such Company
Option, less applicable Taxes required to be withheld with respect to such
payment and (B) one Contingent Value Right for each Share underlying the
Company Option.

  

  

(b) Company Restricted Stock

  

  

. At the Effective Time, each share of restricted stock granted pursuant to
the Stock Plans that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(each such share, a share of "Company Restricted Stock") shall be cancelled
and shall only entitle the holder of each such share of Company Restricted
Stock to receive, as soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time,
(i) an amount in cash equal to the Per Share Cash Merger Consideration, less
applicable Taxes required to be withheld with respect to such payment and (ii)
one Contingent Value Right.

  

  

(c) Company Stock Units

  

  

. At the Effective Time, each outstanding stock unit issued under the Stock
Plans, including all performance share units (including, for the avoidance of
doubt, any "Muve Music" performance share units) and deferred stock units but
excluding any cash award with a value that is not determined based on the
value of Shares (each such unit, a "Company Stock Unit"), whether or not then
exercisable or vested, shall be cancelled and shall only entitle the holder of
such Company Stock Unit to receive, as soon as reasonably practicable after
the Effective Time, (i) an amount in cash equal to the product of (x) the
number of Shares covered by such Company Stock Unit multiplied by (y) the Per
Share Cash Merger Consideration, less applicable Taxes required to be withheld
with respect to such payment and (ii) one Contingent Value Right for each
Share covered by such Company Stock Unit. If the number of Shares subject to a
Company Stock Unit has not been finally determined as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time due to the existence of a performance condition for which
the applicable measurement period is incomplete as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time, such number of Shares shall be determined assuming achievement
of target levels of performance. To the extent any such cancelled Company
Stock Unit is subject to a deferred payment schedule pursuant to the
applicable distribution provisions of Section 409A of the Code so that such
cash amount cannot be paid to the holder within such period without the
holder's incurrence of a penalty Tax and interest penalties under Section 409A
of the Code, then any such cash amount otherwise payable to the holder of such
cancelled Company Stock Unit will be distributed in accordance with Section
409A of the Code and the applicable Treasury Regulations.

  

  

(d) Company Cash Awards. At the Effective Time, each outstanding cash award
(including performance cash awards but excluding those awards with a value
determined based on the price of Shares) will remain outstanding and will
remain subject to the terms and conditions of the applicable award agreement
(including any requirement of continued employment); provided that any
applicable share price gating condition shall be deemed met at the Effective
Time and any performance goals will be deemed met at the target performance
level. For the avoidance of doubt, outstanding cash awards with a value
determined based on the price of Shares are Company Stock Units for the
purposes of this Agreement and will be treated as specified in Section 4.3(c).

  

  

(e) Treatment of ESPP

  

  

. The Company shall terminate the Company's Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the
"ESPP") effective as of the Effective Time. If the offering period under the
ESPP that is in effect on the date of this Agreement (the "Current Offering
Period") does not conclude prior to the Effective Time, (i) the Current
Offering Period shall terminate immediately prior to the Effective Time; (ii)
each participant's accumulated payroll deduction shall be used to purchase
Shares in accordance with the terms of the ESPP; and (iii) such Shares shall
be treated the same as all other Shares in accordance with Section 4.1(a). The
Company shall take such action as may be necessary to provide that (i) only
Employees (as defined under the ESPP) who are participants in the ESPP as of
the date of this Agreement may continue to participate in the ESPP after the
date of this Agreement; (ii) no participant in the ESPP may increase after the
date of this Agreement the payroll deductions credited to such participant's
account under the ESPP; and (iii) no further offering periods shall commence
under the ESPP on or following the date of this Agreement.

  

  

(f) Corporate Actions

  

  

. At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the board of directors of
the Company and the compensation committee of the board of directors of the
Company (the "Compensation Committee"), as applicable, shall adopt any
resolutions and take any actions which are necessary to effectuate the
provisions of Sections 4.3(a), 4.3(b), 4.3(c), 4.3(d) and 4.3(e). The Company
shall take all actions necessary to ensure that from and after the Effective
Time neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation will be required to deliver
Shares or other capital stock of the Company to any Person pursuant to or in
settlement of any Company Option, share of Company Restricted Stock or Company
Stock Unit. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall deliver to the
holders of the Company Options, Company Restricted Stock and Company Stock
Units any notices required pursuant to the relevant Stock Plans and award
documents. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall use reasonable best
efforts to obtain from each holder of a Company Option an acknowledgement of
the treatment of the Company Options as set forth in Section 4.3(a) and shall
make such acknowledgements available to Parent.

  

  

4.4. Adjustments to Prevent Dilution

  

  

. In the event that the number of Shares or securities convertible or
exchangeable into or exercisable for Shares issued and outstanding prior to
the Effective Time shall have been changed into a different number of Shares
or securities or a different class as a result of a reclassification, stock
split (including a reverse stock split), stock dividend or distribution,
recapitalization, merger, issuer tender or exchange offer, or other similar
transaction, the Per Share Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted.

  

  

4.5. Treatment of Convertible Notes

  

  

. Pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, dated as of June 25, 2008, between
the Company and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as trustee, as amended or supplemented
to the date of this Agreement (the "Convertible Notes Indenture"), after the
Effective Time, each holder of the Company's convertible 4.50% senior notes
due 2014 (the "Convertible Notes") will be entitled, subject to the terms and
conditions of the Convertible Notes Indenture, to (i) convert such holder's
Convertible Notes only into the right to receive (A) an amount in cash for
each $1,000 principal amount of Convertible Notes held by such holder equal to
the product of (1) the sum, subject to the Maximum Conversion Cap, of the Base
Conversion Rate and the Additional Shares (such sum, the "Conversion Number"),
multiplied by (2) the Per Share Cash Merger Consideration and (B) for each
$1,000 principal amount of Convertible Notes held by such holder, a number of
Contingent Value Rights equal to the Conversion Number (the "Convertible Make-
Whole Conversion Right"), (ii) require the Company to repurchase such holder's
Convertible Notes or any portion of principal amount thereof that is equal to
$1,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000, for cash on a date specified by the
Company in accordance with the Convertible Notes Indenture at a repurchase
price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Convertible Notes to be
repurchased, together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon to, but
excluding, the repurchase date (the "Convertible Put Right") or (iii) continue
to hold such holder's Convertible Notes. Capitalized terms used in this
Section 4.5 but not defined in this Agreement shall have the meanings ascribed
to such terms in the Convertible Notes Indenture.

  

  

4.6. Treatment of 2020 Notes

  

  

. The Company's unsecured 7.75% senior notes due 2020 shall remain outstanding
in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in the Indenture, dated
as of November 19, 2010, by and between Cricket Communications, Inc.
("Cricket") and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as trustee.

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

  

  

5.1. Representations and Warranties of the Company

  

  

. Except as set forth in the Company Reports filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission (the "SEC") after December 31, 2012 and prior to the date
of this Agreement (excluding, in each case, any disclosures set forth in any
risk factor section or in any other section to the extent they are forward-
looking statements or cautionary, predictive or forward-looking in nature) or
in the corresponding sections or subsections of the disclosure letter
delivered to Parent by the Company prior to entering into this Agreement (the
"Company Disclosure Letter") (it being agreed that disclosure of any item in
any section or subsection of the Company Disclosure Letter shall be deemed
disclosure with respect to any other section or subsection to which the
relevance of such item is readily apparent), the Company hereby represents and
warrants to Parent and Merger Sub that:

  

  

(a) Organization, Good Standing and Qualification. Each of the Company and its
Subsidiaries is a legal entity duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the Laws of its respective jurisdiction of organization and has
all requisite corporate or similar power and authority to own, lease and
operate its properties and assets and to carry on its business as presently
conducted and is qualified to do business and is in good standing as a foreign
corporation or other legal entity in each jurisdiction where the ownership,
leasing or operation of its assets or properties or conduct of its business
requires such qualification, except where the failure to be so organized,
qualified or in such good standing, or to have such power or authority, would
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be likely to have a Material
Adverse Effect. The Company has provided to Parent prior to the date of this
Agreement correct and complete copies of the Company's and its Subsidiaries'
certificates of incorporation and by-laws or comparable governing documents,
each as amended to the date of this Agreement, and each as so delivered is in
full force and effect. Section 5.1(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter
contains a correct and complete list of each jurisdiction where the Company
and its Subsidiaries are organized and qualified to do business.

  

  

As used in this Agreement, the term (i) "Subsidiary" means, with respect to
any Person, any other Person (w) of which at least fifty (50) percent of the
securities or ownership interests having by their terms ordinary voting power
to elect a majority of the board of directors or other persons performing
similar functions is directly or indirectly owned or controlled by such Person
and/or by one or more of its Subsidiaries, (x) of which such Person is the
general partner, or (y) whose business and policies such Person and/or one or
more of its Subsidiaries has the power to control, (ii) "Joint Ventures" means
PRWireless, LLC and Flat Wireless, LLC and (iii) "Material Adverse Effect"
means a material adverse effect on the financial condition, properties,
assets, liabilities, business or results of operations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole; provided, however, that none of the following,
in and of itself or themselves, shall constitute a Material Adverse Effect:

  

  

(A) changes or conditions (including political conditions) generally affecting
(1) the United States economy or financial markets or (2) the industries in
which the Company and its Subsidiaries operate;

  

  

(B) any act of terrorism or sabotage;

  

  

(C) changes in United States generally accepted accounting principles after
the date of this Agreement;

  

  

(D) other than any Regulatory Approval, any legislation adopted by any
Governmental Entity having jurisdiction over the Company and its Subsidiaries,
or any rule or regulation enacted by the FCC, in each case after the date of
this Agreement and applicable to all wireless telecommunications carriers;

  

  

(E) any change in the market price or trading volume of the Shares (but not
the underlying cause of such change); and

  

  

(F) any actions taken, or failures to take action, by the Company in
compliance with the express terms of this Agreement;

  

  

provided, further, that, with respect to clauses (A), (B), (C) and (D), such
change, event, circumstance or development does not (i) primarily relate only
to (or have the effect of primarily relating only to) the Company and its
Subsidiaries or (ii) disproportionately adversely affect the Company and its
Subsidiaries compared to other companies of similar size operating in the
industries in which the Company and its Subsidiaries operate.

  

  

(b) Capital Structure.

  

  

(i) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of (A) 160,000,000
Shares, of which 79,165,545 Shares were outstanding as of the close of
business on July 9, 2013, and (B) 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock,
$0.0001 per share (the "Preferred Shares"), of which no Preferred Shares are
outstanding. All of the outstanding Shares have been duly authorized and are
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. The Company has no Shares or
Preferred Shares reserved for or subject to issuance, except that, as of July
9, 2013, there were 6,158,915 Shares subject to issuance pursuant to the
Company's 2004 Stock Option, Restricted Stock and Deferred Stock Unit Plan, as
amended, the 2009 Employment Inducement Equity Incentive Plan, as amended, and
the ESPP, as amended (collectively, the "Stock Plans"), 160,000 shares of
Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock reserved for issuance pursuant
to the Tax Benefit Preservation Plan, dated as of August 30, 2011, between the
Company and Mellon Investor Services LLC, as Rights Agent (the "Rights
Agreement"), and 4,761,000 Shares subject to issuance pursuant to the
Convertible Notes. 4,761,000 Shares is the maximum number of Shares issuable
at any time upon conversion of the Convertible Notes. Except for Shares issued
in respect of Company Options outstanding prior to July 9, 2013, since July 9,
2013 and through the date of this Agreement, the Company has not issued any
Shares or Preferred Shares or reserved for or subjected to issuance any Shares
or Preferred Shares pursuant to any Stock Plan, the Rights Agreement, the
Convertible Notes or otherwise. Section 5.1(b)(i) of the Company Disclosure
Letter contains a correct and complete list, as of the date of this Agreement,
of Company Options, shares of Company Restricted Stock and Company Stock
Units, including the holder, date of grant, term, number of Shares and, where
applicable, exercise price and vesting schedule, including whether the vesting
will be accelerated by the execution of this Agreement or consummation of the
Merger or by termination of employment or change of position following
consummation of the Merger and there are no other awards granted pursuant to
the Stock Plans. Each of the outstanding shares of capital stock or other
securities of each of the Company's Subsidiaries is duly authorized, validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable and owned by the Company or by a direct
or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company, free and clear of any
Encumbrance. Except as set forth above and except for the rights (the
"Rights") that have been issued pursuant to the Rights Agreement, there are no
preemptive or other outstanding rights, options, warrants, conversion rights,
stock appreciation rights, redemption rights, repurchase rights, agreements,
arrangements, calls, commitments or rights of any kind that obligate the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to issue or sell any shares of capital
stock or other securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any
securities or obligations convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for,
or giving any Person a right to subscribe for or acquire, any securities of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and no securities or obligations
evidencing such rights are authorized, issued or outstanding. Upon any
issuance of any Shares in accordance with the terms of the Stock Plans, such
Shares will be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable
and free and clear of any Encumbrances. The Company does not have outstanding
any bonds, debentures, notes or other obligations (a) the holders of which
have the right to vote (or convertible into or exercisable for securities
having the right to vote) with the stockholders of the Company on any matter
or (b) that are required to be registered under the Exchange Act.

  

  

(ii) Section 5.1(b)(ii) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth (x) each
of the Company's Subsidiaries and the ownership interest of the Company in
each such Subsidiary, as well as the ownership interest of any other Person or
Persons in each such Subsidiary and (y) the Company's or its Subsidiaries'
capital stock, equity interest or other direct or indirect ownership interest
in any other Person other than securities in a publicly traded company held
for investment by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and consisting of
less than 1% of the outstanding capital stock of such company. The Company
does not own, directly or indirectly, any voting interest in any Person that
requires an additional filing by Parent under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust
Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the "HSR Act").

  

  

(iii) Each Company Option (A) was granted in compliance with all applicable
Laws and all of the terms and conditions of the Company Stock Plan pursuant to
which it was issued, (B) has an exercise price per Share equal to or greater
than the fair market value of a Share on the date of such grant, (C) has a
grant date identical to or after the date on which the Company's board of
directors or Compensation Committee actually awarded such Company Option, and
(D) qualifies for the Tax and accounting treatment afforded to such Company
Option in the Company's Tax returns and the Company Reports, respectively.

  

  

(iv) Except as expressly contemplated by the Voting Agreement, there are no
voting trusts or other agreements or understandings to which the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries is a party with respect to the voting of the capital
stock or other equity interest of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

  

  

(v) At the Effective Time, the Conversion Number shall not exceed 10.7290.

  

  

(c) Corporate Authority; Approval and Fairness.

  

  

(i) The Company has all requisite corporate power and authority and has taken
all corporate action necessary in order to execute, deliver and perform its
obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the Merger, subject only to
adoption of this Agreement by the holders of a majority of the outstanding
Shares entitled to vote on such matter at a stockholders' meeting duly called
and held for such purpose (the "Requisite Company Vote"). This Agreement has
been duly executed and delivered by the Company and constitutes a valid and
binding agreement of the Company enforceable against the Company in accordance
with its terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer,
reorganization, moratorium and similar Laws of general applicability relating
to or affecting creditors' rights and to general equity principles (the
"Bankruptcy and Equity Exception").

  

  

(ii) The board of directors of the Company has (A) unanimously determined that
the Merger is fair to, and in the best interests of, the Company and its
stockholders, approved and declared advisable this Agreement and the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated hereby and resolved to recommend
adoption of this Agreement to the holders of Shares (the "Company
Recommendation"), (B) directed that this Agreement be submitted to the holders
of Shares for their adoption and (C) received the opinion of its financial
advisor, Lazard Freres and Co. LLC ("Lazard"), to the effect that the Per Share
Merger Consideration is fair from a financial point of view, as of the date of
such opinion, to the holders (other than Parent and its Subsidiaries) of
Shares, a copy of which opinion has been delivered to Parent. The board of
directors of the Company has taken all action so that Parent will not be an
"interested stockholder" or prohibited from entering into or consummating a
"business combination" with the Company (in each case as such term is used in
Section 203 of the DGCL) as a result of the execution of this Agreement or the
Voting Agreement or the consummation of the transactions in the manner
contemplated hereby.

  

  

(d) Governmental Filings; No Violations; Certain Contracts, Etc.

  

  

(i) Other than the filings and/or notices (A) pursuant to Section 1.3, (B)
under the HSR Act, (C) under the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, and
applicable rules and regulations thereunder (the "Communications Act"),
including any rules, regulations and orders (the "FCC Rules") of the Federal
Communications Commission (the "FCC"), (D) under any applicable state public
utility Laws and rules, regulations and orders of any state public utility
commissions ("PUCs") or similar foreign public utility Laws and rules,
regulations and orders of any regulatory bodies regulating telecommunications
businesses, to the extent set forth on Section 5.1(d)(i) of the Company
Disclosure Letter, (E) under the rules and regulations of the NASDAQ Stock
Market, Inc. (the "NASDAQ"), (F) under any state securities or "blue sky" laws
and (G) set forth on Section 5.1(d)(i) of the Company Disclosure Letter, no
notices, reports or other filings are required to be made by the Company with,
nor are any consents, registrations, approvals, permits or authorizations
required to be obtained by the Company from, any domestic or foreign
governmental or regulatory authority, agency, commission, body, court or other
legislative, executive or judicial governmental entity (each a "Governmental
Entity"), in connection with the execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement by the Company and the consummation of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby, or in connection with the continuing
operation of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries following the
Effective Time in substantially the same manner operated by the Company
immediately preceding the Effective Time, except those that the failure to
make or obtain would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
likely to have a Material Adverse Effect or prevent, materially delay or
materially impair the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

  

  

(ii) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Company
do not, and the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby will not, constitute or result in (A) a breach or
violation of, or a default under, the certificate of incorporation or by-laws
of the Company or the comparable governing documents of any of its
Subsidiaries, (B) with or without notice, lapse of time or both, a breach or
violation of, a termination (or right of termination) or default under, the
creation or acceleration of any obligations under or the creation of an
Encumbrance on any of the assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
pursuant to, any agreement, lease, license, contract, note, mortgage,
indenture, arrangement or other obligation (each, a "Contract") binding upon
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or, assuming (solely with respect to
performance of this Agreement and consummation of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby) compliance with the matters referred to in
Section 5.1(d)(i) and receipt of the Requisite Company Vote, under any Law to
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is subject, or (C) any change in
the rights or obligations of any party under any Contract binding upon the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, except, in the case of clause (B) or (C)
above, for any such breach, violation, termination, default, creation,
acceleration or change that would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be likely to have a Material Adverse Effect or prevent, materially
delay or materially impair the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. Section 5.1(d)(ii) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets
forth a correct and complete list of Material Contracts pursuant to which
consents or waivers are required prior to consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (whether or not subject to the exception set
forth with respect to clauses (B) and (C) above).

  

  

(iii) The Company and its Subsidiaries are not creditors or claimants with
respect to any debtors or debtor-in-possession subject to proceedings under
chapter 11 of title 11 of the United States Code with respect to claims that,
in the aggregate, constitute more than 25% of the gross assets of the Company
and its Subsidiaries (excluding cash and cash equivalents).

  

  

(e) Company Reports; Financial Statements.

  

  

(i) The Company has filed or furnished, as applicable, on a timely basis, all
forms, statements, certifications, reports and documents required to be filed
or furnished by it with the SEC pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), or the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (the "Securities Act"), since December 31, 2010 (the "Applicable
Date") (the forms, statements, certifications, reports and documents filed or
furnished since the Applicable Date and those filed or furnished subsequent to
the date of this Agreement, including any amendments thereto, the "Company
Reports"). Each of the Company Reports, at the time of its filing or being
furnished complied or, if not yet filed or furnished, will comply in all
material respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act, the
Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the "Sarbanes-Oxley Act"),
and any rules and regulations promulgated thereunder applicable to the Company
Reports. As of their respective dates (or, if amended prior to the date of
this Agreement, as of the date of such amendment), the Company Reports did
not, and any Company Reports filed with or furnished to the SEC subsequent to
the date of this Agreement will not, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements made therein, in light of the
circumstances in which they were made, not misleading.

  

  

(ii) The Company is in compliance in all material respects with the applicable
listing and corporate governance rules and regulations of the NASDAQ. Except
as permitted by the Exchange Act, including Sections 13(k)(2) and (3), or
rules of the SEC, since the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, neither the
Company nor any of its Affiliates has made, arranged or modified (in any
material way) any extensions of credit in the form of a personal loan to any
executive officer or director of the Company. For purposes of this Agreement,
the term "Affiliate" when used with respect to any party shall mean any Person
who is an "affiliate" of that party within the meaning of Rule 405 promulgated
under the Securities Act.

  

  

(iii) The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures required by
Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15 under the Exchange Act. Such disclosure controls and
procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed
by the Company in the forms, statements, certifications, reports and documents
filed with or furnished to the SEC is recorded and reported on a timely basis
to the individuals responsible for the preparation of the Company's filings
with the SEC and other public disclosure documents. The Company maintains
internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15 or
15d-15, as applicable, under the Exchange Act). Such internal control over
financial reporting is effective in providing reasonable assurance regarding
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles and includes policies and procedures that (i) pertain to
the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company, (ii)
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management
and directors of the Company, and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition
of the Company's assets that could have a material effect on its financial
statements. The Company has disclosed, based on the most recent evaluation of
its chief executive officer and its chief financial officer prior to the date
of this Agreement, to the Company's auditors and the audit committee of the
Company's board of directors (A) any significant deficiencies in the design or
operation of its internal controls over financial reporting that are
reasonably likely to adversely affect the Company's ability to record,
process, summarize and report financial information and has identified for the
Company's auditors and audit committee of the Company's board of directors any
material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting and (B) any
fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees
who have a significant role in the Company's internal control over financial
reporting. The Company has provided to Parent prior to the date of this
Agreement (i) a summary of any such disclosure made by management to the
Company's auditors and audit committee since the Applicable Date and (ii) any
communication since the Applicable Date made by management or the Company's
auditors to the audit committee required or contemplated by listing standards
of the NASDAQ, the audit committee's charter or professional standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. Since the Applicable Date, no
material complaints from any source regarding accounting, internal accounting
controls or auditing matters, and no concerns from Company employees regarding
questionable accounting or auditing matters, have been received by the
Company. The Company has provided to Parent prior to the date of this
Agreement a summary of all complaints or concerns relating to other matters
made since the Applicable Date through the Company's whistleblower hot line or
equivalent system for receipt of employee concerns regarding possible
violations of Law. No attorney representing the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, whether or not employed by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a violation of securities Laws, breach
of fiduciary duty or similar violation by the Company or any of its officers,
directors, employees or agents to the Company's chief legal officer, audit
committee (or other committee designated for the purpose) of the board of
directors or the board of directors pursuant to the rules adopted pursuant to
Section 307 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act or any Company policy contemplating such
reporting, including in instances not required by those rules.

  

  

(iv) Each of the consolidated balance sheets included in or incorporated by
reference into the Company Reports (including the related notes and schedules)
fairly presents in all material respects, or, in the case of Company Reports
filed after the date of this Agreement, will fairly present in all material
respects the consolidated financial position of the Company and its
consolidated Subsidiaries and Joint Ventures as of its date and each of the
consolidated balance sheets, consolidated statements of comprehensive income,
consolidated changes in stockholders' equity and consolidated statements of
cash flows included in or incorporated by reference into the Company Reports
(including any related notes and schedules) fairly presents in all material
respects, or in the case of Company Reports filed after the date of this
Agreement, will fairly present in all material respects the consolidated
results of operations, retained earnings (loss) and changes in financial
position, as the case may be, of the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries
and Joint Ventures for the periods set forth therein (subject, in the case of
unaudited statements, to the absence of notes and normal year-end audit
adjustments that will not be material in amount or effect), in each case in
accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP")
consistently applied during the periods involved, except as may be noted
therein or in the notes thereto.

  

  

(f) FCC Matters.

  

  

(i) Section 5.1(f) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a correct and
complete list of all licenses and authorizations issued or granted to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries by the FCC (the "FCC Licenses"), all
pending applications by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for licenses
that would be FCC Licenses if issued or granted, and all pending applications
by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for modification, extension or
renewal of any FCC License. For each FCC License, Section 5.1(f) of the
Company Disclosure Letter sets forth (A) the FCC Registration Number or name
of the licensee, (B) the FCC call sign, license number or other license
identifier, (C) the geographic area for which the Company and its Subsidiaries
are authorized to provide service, (D) the current expiration date, (E) the
frequency block (except for microwave licenses) and (F) where applicable, the
relevant market and service designations used by the FCC. The FCC Licenses
constitute all the licenses and authorizations necessary from the FCC for the
business operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries as they are currently
being conducted. There is no condition outside of the ordinary course imposed
on any of the FCC Licenses by the FCC (including any condition on the grant of
a renewal application) that is not disclosed on the face of the reference copy
of the FCC License in the FCC's Universal Licensing System database; provided,
that "ordinary course" shall mean any condition described in any federal
statutes, FCC Rules or similar sources that apply generally to FCC licenses of
the same service.

  

  

(ii) (A) Each FCC License has been granted pursuant to a Final Order (without
regard to the proviso in the definition of such term) and approved by the FCC
to be held by the licensee listed on Section 5.1(f) of the Company Disclosure
Letter, is valid and in full force and effect, and has not been suspended,
revoked, cancelled, terminated or forfeited or adversely modified; (B) there
is no proceeding pending before the FCC or any other Governmental Entity (and
no pending judicial review of such a proceeding) or, to the Knowledge of the
Company, threatened by any Person with respect to any FCC License that would,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be likely to result in the
suspension, revocation, cancellation, termination, forfeiture, or adverse
modification of any FCC License; and (C) to the Knowledge of the Company, no
event, condition or circumstance exists or, after notice or lapse of time or
both, would exist that would constitute a breach of, or default under, the
terms and conditions of any FCC License that would preclude any FCC License
from being renewed in the ordinary course (to the extent that such FCC License
is renewable by its terms) or could reasonably be expected to place such FCC
license at risk of suspension, revocation, cancellation, termination,
forfeiture or modification. For purposes of this Agreement, "Knowledge" means,
with respect to the Company or Parent, the knowledge of the executive officers
of the Company or Parent, as the case may be, after reasonable inquiry.

  

  

(iii) Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is in material compliance with
the terms of the FCC Rules and any other Laws that apply to, or that are
contained in, each FCC License and has timely fulfilled and performed all of
its material obligations with respect thereto, including making all reports,
filings, notifications and applications to the FCC. The Company has provided
Parent prior to the date of this Agreement with access to copies of each such
report, filing, notification and application, including ownership reports and
regulatory fee filings, filed in the last three (3) years, with the exception
of those reports, filings, notifications and applications that are available
in their entirety in the FCC's Universal Licensing System database. The
Company has not incurred, or if incurred the Company has fully discharged, any
fine, charge or other liability resulting from any noncompliance prior to the
Closing relating to such reports, filings, notifications and applications. The
Company has timely made the payment of all regulatory fees and contributions
to the FCC, the United States Treasury or any other Governmental Entity with
respect to any FCC License or which are otherwise required by the FCC Rules,
including Universal Service Fund and TRS Fund contributions. No payment is
owed to the FCC or any other Governmental Entity with respect to the ownership
and operation of any FCC License. The consummation of the transaction
contemplated hereby will not cause the FCC to impose any unjust enrichment
penalties pursuant to 47 C.F.R. § 1.2111.

  

  

(iv) All of the Cell Sites and microwave paths of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, in respect of which a filing with the FCC was required, have
been constructed to the extent required by FCC Rules and are currently
operated in all respects as represented to the FCC in currently effective
filings, and modifications to such Cell Sites and microwave paths have been
preceded by the submission to the FCC of all required filings.

  

  

(v) None of the FCC Licenses has been modified by the Company or its
Subsidiaries in any respect. There is no pending or planned application by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to modify any FCC License. Neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries have (A) entered into any field-strength
agreements or otherwise granted any interference consents with respect to any
of the spectrum that is the subject of any of the FCC Licenses, or (B) waived
or relinquished any material right or claim with respect to any of the
spectrum that is the subject of any FCC License.

  

  

(vi) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries lease any licenses from
the FCC to or from any other Person (other than leases solely among the
Company and/or direct or indirect Subsidiaries of the Company).

  

  

(g) Other Communications Regulatory Matters.

  

  

(i) Section 5.1(g) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a correct and
complete list of all permits, franchises, grants, easements, variances,
exceptions, consents, certificates, approvals, waivers, orders, licenses or
other authorizations with any Governmental Entity (excluding the FCC Licenses)
("Permits") issued by any state, territorial or local Governmental Entity
regulating telecommunications, Internet or cable businesses to the Company or
its Subsidiaries (the "Other Company Licenses"). Such authorizations
constitute all the authorizations necessary from such state, territorial or
local Governmental Entities for the business operations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as they are currently being conducted in any state, territory or
locality, except those authorizations the absence of which would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be likely to have a Material
Adverse Effect.

  

  

(ii) Each Other Company License is valid and in full force and effect and has
not been suspended, revoked, cancelled or adversely modified, except where the
failure to be in full force and effect, or the suspension, revocation,
cancellation or modification of such license or licenses would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be likely to have a Material
Adverse Effect. No Other Company License is subject to (i) any conditions or
requirements that have not been imposed generally upon Permits in the same
service, unless such conditions or requirements would not, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be likely to have a Material Adverse Effect or (ii)
any pending regulatory proceeding (other than those affecting the
telecommunications industry generally or holders of Permits in the same
service generally) before a Governmental Entity or judicial review, unless
such pending regulatory proceeding or judicial review would not, individually
or in the aggregate, reasonably be likely to have a Material Adverse Effect.

  

  

(iii) Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is in compliance with the terms
of and the Laws that apply to each applicable Other Company License and has
fulfilled and performed all of its obligations with respect thereto, except
(i) for exemptions, waivers or similar concessions or allowances and (ii)
where such failure to be in compliance, fulfill or perform its obligations
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be likely to have a
Material Adverse Effect.

  

  

(h) Absence of Certain Changes. Since December 31, 2012 and through the date
of this Agreement, the Company and its Subsidiaries have conducted their
respective businesses only in, and have not engaged in any material
transaction other than in accordance with, the ordinary course of such
businesses consistent with past practices and there has not been:

  

  

(i) any change in the financial condition, properties, assets, liabilities,
business or results of their operations or any circumstance, occurrence or
development (including any adverse change with respect to any circumstance,
occurrence or development existing on or prior to December 31, 2012) of which
management of the Company has Knowledge which, individually or in the
aggregate, has had or would reasonably be likely to have a Material Adverse
Effect;

  

  

(ii) any material damage, destruction or other casualty loss with respect to
any material asset or property owned, leased or otherwise used by the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not covered by insurance;

  

  

(iii) any declaration, setting aside or payment of any dividend or other
distribution with respect to any shares of capital stock of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries (except for dividends or other distributions by any direct
or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary to the Company or to any wholly owned
Subsidiary of the Company), or any repurchase, redemption or other acquisition
by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of any outstanding shares of capital
stock or other securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries;

  

  

(iv) any material change in any method of accounting or accounting practice by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries;

  

  

(v) (A) any increase in the compensation payable or to become payable to its
officers or employees (except for increases in the ordinary course of business
and consistent with past practice) or (B) any establishment, adoption, entry
into or amendment of any collective bargaining, bonus, profit sharing, thrift,
compensation, employment, termination, severance or other plan, agreement,
trust, fund, policy or arrangement for the benefit of any director, officer or
employee, except to the extent required by applicable Laws;

  

  

(vi) any incurrence of any indebtedness for borrowed money or guarantee of
such indebtedness of another Person, or issuance or sale of any debt
securities or warrants or other rights to acquire any debt security of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries; or

  

  

(vii) any agreement to do any of the foregoing.

  

  

(i) Litigation and Liabilities. There are no (i) civil, criminal or
administrative actions, suits, claims, hearings, arbitrations, investigations
or other proceedings pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened
against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (ii) obligations or
liabilities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not accrued,
contingent or otherwise and whether or not required to be disclosed, or any
other facts or circumstances of which the Company has Knowledge that could
reasonably be expected to result in any claims against, or obligations or
liabilities of, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, including under the
FCC Licenses, except in each of the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) for those
that, individually or in the aggregate, have not had or would not reasonably
be likely to have a Material Adverse Effect or prevent, materially delay or
materially impair the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or
subject to the provisions of any judgment, order, writ, injunction, decree or
award of any Governmental Entity.

  

  

(j) Employee Benefits.

  

  

(i) Section 5.1(j)(i) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a correct
and complete list of each Benefit Plan. For purposes of this Agreement, the
term "Benefit Plan" means any benefit plan, program, arrangement or agreement,
whether written or unwritten, including any such plan, program, arrangement or
agreement that is an employee welfare benefit plan within the meaning of
Section 3(1) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as
amended ("ERISA"), whether or not such employee welfare benefit plan is
subject to ERISA, an employee pension benefit plan within the meaning of
Section 3(2) of ERISA (a "Pension Plan"), whether or not such Pension Plan is
subject to ERISA, or health, medical, dental, disability, accident or life
insurance or a bonus, incentive, deferred compensation, vacation, stock
purchase, stock option, restricted stock or other equity-based award,
severance, termination, retention, retirement, savings, employment, change of
control, vacation or fringe benefit plan, program, arrangement or agreement
which benefits the current or former employees, independent contractors,
consultants or directors of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or which
the Company or any of its ERISA Affiliates sponsors, maintains or contributes
to or in respect of which has any liability, whether contingent or otherwise.
The Company has provided to Parent prior to the date of this Agreement correct
and complete copies of all the Benefit Plans (or a written summary of any
unwritten Benefit Plans) and all amendments thereto and a schedule disclosing
for each category of employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries (including
one-off arrangements) each Benefit Plan (including any and all severance,
retirement and deferred compensation entitlements) applicable to each such
category. The term "ERISA Affiliate" means all employers (whether or not
incorporated) that would be treated together with the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries as a single-employer within the meaning of Section 414 of the
Code.

  

  

(ii) Section 5.1(j)(ii) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a correct
and complete schedule of all outstanding performance cash awards of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, including the holder, target payment level and
vesting schedule of each such award.

  

  

(iii) Each of the Benefit Plans is currently in, and has at all times been
operated and administered in, material compliance with ERISA, the Code and all
other applicable Laws. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has
engaged in a transaction and, to the Knowledge of the Company, no condition
exists with respect to any Benefit Plan that, assuming the taxable period of
such transaction expired as of the date of this Agreement (in the case of a
Tax or penalty imposed by Section 4975 of the Code), would reasonably be
expected to subject the Company or any Benefit Plan to a Tax or penalty
imposed by either Section 4975 of the Code or Section 502(i) of ERISA. Neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has incurred or reasonably expects to
incur a material tax or penalty imposed by Section 4980F of the Code or
Section 502 of ERISA or any material liability under Section 4071 of ERISA.
Each of the Benefit Plans that is intended to be qualified under Section
401(a) or 401(k) of the Code has received a favorable determination letter
from the Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS"), continues to satisfy the
requirements for such qualification and the Company is not aware of any
circumstances likely to result in the loss of the qualification of such plan
under Section 401(a) or 401(k) of the Code.

  

  

(iv) No liability under Subtitle C or D of Title IV of ERISA has been or is
expected to be incurred by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with respect
to any ongoing, frozen or terminated "single-employer plan," within the
meaning of Section 4001(a)(15) of ERISA, currently or formerly maintained by
any of them, or the single-employer plan of any ERISA Affiliate. Neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has now or at any time within the previous
six (6) years contributed to, sponsored or maintained (i) any multiemployer
plan (within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA) or single-employer
plan (within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(15) of ERISA); (ii) a "multiple
employer plan" within the meaning of Section 413(c) of the Code or (iii) a
"multiple employer welfare arrangement" within the meaning of Section 3(40) of
ERISA. None of the Benefit Plans provides retiree medical, disability, life
insurance or other retiree welfare benefits.

  

  

(v) All contributions required to be made under each Benefit Plan, as of the
date of this Agreement, have been timely made when due and all obligations in
respect of each Benefit Plan have been properly accrued and reflected in the
most recent consolidated balance sheet filed or incorporated by reference in
the Company Reports prior to the date of this Agreement.

  

  

(vi) With respect to each Benefit Plan, (i) no actions, suits or claims (other
than routine claims for benefits in the ordinary course) are pending or
threatened in writing, (ii) no facts or circumstances exist that would
reasonably be expected to give rise to any such actions, suits or claims and
(iii) no administrative investigation, audit or other administrative
proceeding by the United States Department of Labor, the Pension Benefit
Guaranty Corporation (the "PBGC"), the IRS or other Governmental Entities are
pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened in progress (including
any routine requests for information from the PBGC).

  

  

(vii) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any obligations for
retiree health and life benefits under any Benefit Plan which is subject to
ERISA (an "ERISA Plan") or collective bargaining agreement. The Company or its
Subsidiaries may amend or terminate any such plan at any time without
incurring any liability thereunder other than in respect of claims incurred
prior to such amendment or termination.

  

  

(viii) There has been no amendment to, announcement by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries relating to, or change in employee participation or coverage
under, any Benefit Plan which would increase materially the expense of
maintaining such plan above the level of the expense incurred therefor for the
most recent fiscal year. Neither the execution of this Agreement, stockholder
adoption of this Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby will (either alone or together with any other event) (A)
entitle any employees, directors, consultants, former employees, former
consultants or former directors of the Company or its Subsidiaries to
severance, change of control or other similar pay or benefits pursuant to any
Benefit Plan, (B) cause any payment or funding (through a grantor trust or
otherwise) to become due or accelerate the time of payment or vesting, or
increase the amount of compensation or benefits to any employees, directors,
consultants, former employees, former consultants or former directors of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries under, or increase the amount payable or
trigger any other obligation pursuant to, any Benefit Plan, (C) limit or
restrict the right of the Company or, after the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, Parent, to merge, amend or terminate any of
the Benefit Plans or (D) result in payments under any of the Benefit Plans
which would not be deductible under Section 162(m) or Section 280G of the
Code.

  

  

(ix) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any obligation to
gross up, indemnify or otherwise reimburse any individual for any taxes,
interest or penalties incurred pursuant to Sections 409A or 4999 of the Code
or otherwise.

  

  

(x) With respect to any Benefit Plan that constitutes a "nonqualified deferred
compensation plan" (as defined in Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code), (A) such
Benefit Plan has been operated in good faith compliance with Section 409A of
the Code and the guidance issued thereunder, (B) such plan complies in all
material respects in form with Section 409A of the Code and the guidance
issued thereunder and (C) the transaction contemplated by this Agreement will
not result in Section 409A of the Code imposing any adverse tax consequences
to the participants in such Benefit Plan (including the inclusion in income of
deferred amounts or any additional tax pursuant to Section 409A(a)(1)(B) of
the Code).

  

  

(xi) Each Benefit Plan can be amended, terminated or otherwise discontinued
after the Effective Time in accordance with its terms, without any material
liability to Parent, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries other than
ordinary administration expenses typically incurred in a termination event.

  

  

(xii) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has now, nor has it
ever, maintained any Benefit Plan outside the jurisdiction of the United
States or covering any employees or other service providers of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries who reside or work outside of the United States.

  

  

(k) Labor Matters. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party
to or otherwise bound by any collective bargaining agreement or other Contract
with a labor union or labor organization, nor is the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries the subject of any material proceeding that asserts that the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries has committed an unfair labor practice or
that seeks to compel it to bargain with any labor union or labor organization
nor is there pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened, nor has
there been since January 1, 2008, any labor strike, dispute, walk-out, work
stoppage, slow-down or lockout involving the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. To the Knowledge of the Company, there are no organizational
efforts with respect to the formation of a collective bargaining unit
presently being made involving employees of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in
any unfair labor practices within the meaning of the United States National
Labor Relations Act, as amended, and the Company and each of its Subsidiaries
is in compliance in all material respects with all labor, employment and
workplace-related Laws.

  

  

(l) Compliance with Laws; Licenses. The businesses of each of the Company and
its Subsidiaries have not been, and are not being, conducted in violation of
any federal, state, local or foreign law, statute or ordinance, common law, or
any rule, regulation, standard, judgment, order, writ, injunction, decree,
arbitration award, agency requirement, license or permit of any Governmental
Entity (collectively, "Laws"), except for violations that would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be likely to have a Material
Adverse Effect or prevent, materially delay or materially impair the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. No
investigation or review by any Governmental Entity with respect to the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries is pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company,
threatened, nor has any Governmental Entity indicated an intention to conduct
the same, except for such investigations or reviews the outcome of which would
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be likely to have a Material
Adverse Effect or prevent, materially delay or materially impair the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. To the
Knowledge of the Company, no material change is required in the Company's or
any of its Subsidiaries' processes, properties or procedures in connection
with any such Laws, and the Company has not received any notice or
communication of any material noncompliance with any such Laws that has not
been cured as of the date of this Agreement.

  

  

(m) Material Contracts.

Company or its Subsidiaries is a party to or bound by:

(E) any Contract (other than solely among the Company and/or direct or

of the Company or its Subsidiaries in accordance with GAAP) (in either case,
whether incurred, assumed, guaranteed or secured by any asset);

  

  

(F) any Contract involving the payment or receipt of royalties or other
amounts calculated based upon the revenues or income of the Company or its

require the disposition of any assets or line of business of the Company or

herein as a "Material Contract").

  

  

(ii) A correct and complete copy of each Material Contract in effect on the
date of this Agreement has been delivered to Parent prior to the date of this
Agreement. Each of the Material Contracts is valid and binding on the Company
or its Subsidiaries, as the case may be and, to the Knowledge of the Company,
each other party thereto, and is in full force and effect, except for such
failures to be valid and binding or to be in full force and effect as would
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be likely to have a Material
Adverse Effect. There is no default under any such Contracts by the Company or
its Subsidiaries or, to the Knowledge of the Company, each other party
thereto, and no event has occurred that with the lapse of time or the giving
of notice or both would constitute a default thereunder by the Company or its
Subsidiaries, or, to the Knowledge of the Company, each other party thereto,
in each case except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
be likely to have a Material Adverse Effect.

  

  

(n) Real Property.

  

  

(i) Section 5.1(n)(i) of the Company Disclosure Letter contains a correct and
complete list of each Cell Site and each Colocation Site that is owned, used
or held for use by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Each Cell Site is
owned, used or held for use by the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company
pursuant to a valid and binding Deed, Ground Lease or Governmental Use Permit,
in each case free and clear of all Encumbrances, and each Colocation Site is
used or held for use by the Company or its Subsidiaries pursuant to a valid
and binding Colocation Agreement, in each case free and clear of all
Encumbrances. The Company or its Subsidiaries hold fee simple, marketable
title in each Cell Site acquired by Deed that is still owned by the Company or
its Subsidiaries. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries have entered
into any Third Party Colocation Agreements or other occupancy agreements that
provide any other Person a right of access to or use of all or any part of any
Cell Site. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has entered into
any Third Party Cell Site Agreements with respect to any Cell Site.

  

  

(ii) Section 5.1(n)(ii) of the Company Disclosure Letter contains a correct
and complete list of each MTSO owned, used or held for use by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries. The Company or its Subsidiaries hold fee simple,
marketable title or leasehold interest in each MTSO, and the land on which
each MTSO is located, free and clear of all Encumbrances.

  

  

(iii) No Ground Lease, Governmental Use Permit or Colocation Agreement in use
by the Company or its Subsidiaries as of July 9, 2013 has expired or been
terminated. Section 5.1(n)(iii) of the Company Disclosure Letter contains a
correct and complete list of each Ground Lease, Governmental Use Permit and
Colocation Agreement in use by the Company or its Subsidiaries as of the date
of this Agreement. The Company and its Subsidiaries are current on all
payments due under each Ground Lease, Governmental Use Permit or Colocation
Agreement, have complied with all obligations thereunder and have not received
any notice of default thereunder which has not been cured.

  

  

(iv) With respect to each Cell Site location, Colocation Site and MTSO,
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries have received written notice
that any of the improvements on the Real Property do not conform to applicable
Law and use restrictions, or that the Real Property is not zoned for the
various purposes for which the Real Property and any improvements thereon are
presently being used. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries have
received written notice of any pending or threatened condemnations, planned
public improvements, annexation, special assessments, zoning or subdivision
changes, or other adverse claims affecting the Real Property. To the Knowledge
of the Company, no Person has any right, option, lease, license, right of

with the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by Parent and

6.2. No Solicitation; Change in Recommendation

  

  

.

  

  

(a) No Solicitation or Negotiation. Except as expressly permitted by this
Section 6.2, the Company shall not, and shall cause its and its Subsidiaries'
directors, officers and employees not to, and shall instruct and use its best
efforts to cause its investment bankers, attorneys, accountants and other
advisors or representatives (collectively, "Representatives") not to, directly
or indirectly:

  

  

(i) solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate any
inquiries or the making of any proposal or offer that constitutes, or could
reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal;

  

  

(ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations with any Person regarding
any Acquisition Proposal;

  

  

(iii) provide any non-public information or data concerning the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries to any Person in connection with any Acquisition Proposal
or potential Acquisition Proposal; or

  

  

(iv) otherwise knowingly facilitate any effort or attempt to make an
Acquisition Proposal.

  

  

The Company shall, and the Company shall cause its Subsidiaries and
Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated any
discussions and negotiations with any Person conducted heretofore with respect
to any Acquisition Proposal, or proposal that could reasonably be expected to
lead to an Acquisition Proposal. The Company will promptly inform the
individuals and entities referred to in the preceding sentence hereof of the
obligations undertaken in this Section 6.2. The Company will promptly request
from each Person that has executed a confidentiality agreement in connection
with its consideration of making an Acquisition Proposal to promptly return or
destroy all confidential information concerning the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries and promptly terminate all physical and electronic data access
previously granted to such Person.

  

  

(b) Fiduciary Exception to No Solicitation Provision. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in Section 6.2(a), prior to the time, but not after, the
Requisite Company Vote is obtained, the Company may, in response to an
unsolicited, bona fide written Acquisition Proposal, (i) provide access to
non-public information regarding the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to the
Person who made such Acquisition Proposal; provided, that such information has
previously been made available to Parent or is provided to Parent prior to or
concurrently with the time such information is made available to such Person
and that, prior to furnishing any such material non-public information, the
Company receives from the Person making such Acquisition Proposal an executed
confidentiality agreement with terms at least as restrictive in all material
respects on such Person as the Confidentiality Agreements are on Parent (it
being understood that such confidentiality agreement need not, at the
Company's discretion, prohibit the making or amending of an Acquisition
Proposal); provided, further, that, if the Person making such Acquisition
Proposal is a competitor of the Company, the Company shall not provide any
commercially sensitive non-public information to such Person in connection
with any actions permitted by this Section 6.2(b) other than in accordance
with "clean team" or other similar procedures designed to limit any adverse
effect on the Company of the sharing of such information; and (ii) participate
in any discussions or negotiations with any such Person regarding such
Acquisition Proposal if, and only if, prior to taking any action described in
clause (i) or (ii) above, the board of directors of the Company determines in
good faith after consultation with outside legal counsel that (A) based on the
information then available and after consultation with an independent
financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation that such Acquisition
Proposal either constitutes a Superior Proposal or would reasonably be
expected to result in a Superior Proposal and (B) such action is necessary in
order for the directors to comply with their fiduciary duties under applicable
Law.

  

  

(c) Notice. The Company shall promptly (and, in any event, within 24 hours)
notify Parent if (i) any inquiries, proposals or offers with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal are received by, (ii) any non-public information is
requested in connection with any Acquisition Proposal from, or (iii) any
discussions or negotiation with respect to an Acquisition Proposal are sought
to be initiated or continued with, it or any of its Representatives,
indicating, in connection with such notice, the name of such Person and the
material terms and conditions of any proposals or offers (including, if
applicable, copies of any written requests, proposals or offers, including
proposed agreements) and thereafter shall keep Parent informed, on a current
basis, of the status and terms of any such proposals or offers (including any
amendments thereto) and the status of any such discussions or negotiations,
including any change in the Company's intentions as previously notified.

  

  

(d) Definitions. For purposes of this Agreement:

  

  

"Acquisition Proposal" means (i) any proposal, offer, inquiry or indication of
interest from any Person or group (as defined in or under Section 13 of the
Exchange Act) relating to a merger, joint venture, agreement for a mobile
virtual network operator that would utilize a major portion of the Company's
network, partnership, consolidation, dissolution, liquidation, tender offer,
recapitalization, reorganization, spin-off, share exchange, business
combination or similar transaction involving the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries and (ii) any acquisition by any Person or group (as defined in or
under Section 13 of the Exchange Act) resulting in, or proposal, offer,
inquiry or indication of interest, which if consummated would result in, any
Person becoming the beneficial owner of, directly or indirectly, in one or a
series of related transactions, 15% or more of the total voting power or of
any class of equity securities of the Company or those of any of its
Subsidiaries, or 15% or more of the consolidated net revenues, net income or
total assets (including equity securities of its Subsidiaries) of the Company,
in each case, other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

  

"Superior Proposal" means an unsolicited, bona fide written Acquisition
Proposal by a third party or group (as defined in or under Section 13 of the
Exchange Act) that would result in such third party or group (as defined in or
under Section 13 of the Exchange Act) becoming the beneficial owner of,
directly or indirectly, more than 50% of the total voting power of the equity
securities of the Company, or more than 50% of the consolidated net revenues,
net income or total assets (including equity securities of its Subsidiaries)
of the Company, that the board of directors of the Company has determined in
good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel and an independent
financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation, taking into account all
legal, financial, financing and regulatory aspects of the proposal, the
identity of the Person(s) making the proposal, the likelihood of the proposal
being consummated in accordance with its terms and the timing of such
consummation, that, if consummated, would result in a transaction more
favorable to the Company's stockholders from a financial point of view than
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (after taking into account any
revisions to the terms of the transaction contemplated by Section 6.2(f)).

  

  

(e) No Change in Recommendation or Alternative Acquisition Agreement. Except
as provided in Section 6.2(f), the board of directors of the Company and each
committee of the board of directors shall not (i) withhold, withdraw, qualify
or modify (or publicly propose or resolve to withhold, withdraw, qualify or
modify), in a manner adverse to Parent, the Company Recommendation; (ii) cause
or permit the Company to enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger
agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or
other agreement (other than a confidentiality agreement referred to in Section
6.2(a) entered into in compliance with Section 6.2(a)) (an "Alternative
Acquisition Agreement") relating to any Acquisition Proposal; and (iii)
approve or recommend, or publicly propose to enter into an Alternative
Acquisition Agreement.

  

  

(f) Fiduciary Exception to Change in Recommendation Provision. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, prior to the time the
Requisite Company Vote is obtained, the board of directors of the Company may
withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify the Company Recommendation or approve,
recommend or otherwise declare advisable any Superior Proposal made after the
date of this Agreement that was not solicited, initiated, encouraged or
facilitated in breach of this Agreement, if the board of directors of the
Company determines in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel and
an independent financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation, that (i)
such offer constitutes a Superior Proposal or (ii) a material development or
change in circumstances occurs or arises after the date of this Agreement that
was not known by nor was reasonably foreseeable to the board of directors of
the Company as of the date of this Agreement and is materially more favorable
to the recurring financial condition of the Company and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, other than (A) developments or changes in the industries in
which the Company and its Subsidiaries operate, (B) changes in the market
price or trading volume of the Shares, (C) the timing of any Regulatory
Approval, (D) an Acquisition Proposal or (E) the fact that, in and of itself,
the Company exceeds internal or published projections (an "Intervening Event")
and (iii) the Company determines in good faith, after consultation with
outside counsel and an independent financial advisor of nationally recognized
reputation, that such action is necessary in order for the directors to comply
with their fiduciary duties under applicable Law (a "Change of
Recommendation"); provided, however, that no Change of Recommendation may be
made until after at least four (4) business days following Parent's receipt of
written notice from the Company advising that management of the Company
currently intends to recommend to its board of directors that it make a Change
of Recommendation and (x) all information required to be provided under
Section 6.2(c) and (y) in the case of a Change of Recommendation relating to
an Intervening Event, all material information related thereto. After
providing such notice and prior to effecting such Change of Recommendation,
(i) the Company shall, throughout such four (4) business day period, negotiate
in good faith with Parent with respect to any revisions to the terms of the
transaction contemplated by the Agreement proposed by Parent in response to a
Superior Proposal or Intervening Event, and (ii) in determining whether to
make a Change of Recommendation in response to a Superior Proposal or
Intervening Event, the board of directors of the Company shall take into
account any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent and any
other information provided by Parent in response to such notice. Any material
amendment to any Acquisition Proposal will be deemed to be a new Acquisition
Proposal for purposes of this Section 6.2(f), including with respect to the
notice period referred to in this Section 6.2(f), except that the four (4)
business day period shall be three (3) business days for such purposes.

  

  

(g) Limits on Release of Standstill and Confidentiality. From the date of this
Agreement until the earlier of the Effective Time or the date, if any, on
which this Agreement is terminated, the Company shall not terminate, amend,
modify or waive any provision of any confidentiality, "standstill" or similar
agreement to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party and shall
enforce, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, the provisions
of any such agreement, including by obtaining injunctions to prevent any
breaches of such agreements and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions thereof. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, the Company shall be permitted to terminate, amend, modify, waive
or fail to enforce any provision of any confidentiality, "standstill" or
similar obligation of any Person if the board of directors of the Company
determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel,
that the failure to take such action is necessary in order for the directors
to comply with their fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

  

  

(h) Compliance with Certain Laws. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall
prevent the Company or the board of directors of the Company from taking
actions to the extent required by Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 promulgated under
the Exchange Act with respect to an Acquisition Proposal; provided that (a)
such Rules will in no way eliminate or modify the effect that any action
pursuant to such Rules would otherwise have under this Agreement and (b) in no
event shall the Company take, or agree or resolve to take, any action other
than in compliance with this Section 6.2.

  

  

6.3. Proxy Filing; Information Supplied

  

  

. The Company shall prepare and file with the SEC, as promptly as practicable
after the date of this Agreement, and in any event within ten (10) business
days after the date of this Agreement, a proxy statement in preliminary form
relating to the Stockholders Meeting (such proxy statement, including any
amendment or supplement thereto, the "Proxy Statement"). The Company agrees,
as to itself and its Subsidiaries, that (i) the Proxy Statement will comply in
all material respects with the applicable provisions of the Exchange Act and
the rules and regulations thereunder and (ii) none of the information supplied
by it or any of its Subsidiaries for inclusion or incorporation by reference
in the Proxy Statement will, at the date of mailing to stockholders of the
Company or at the time of the Stockholders Meeting, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light
of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

  

  

6.4. Stockholders Meeting

  

  

. The Company will take, in accordance with applicable Law and its certificate
of incorporation and by-laws, all action necessary to convene a meeting of
holders of Shares (the "Stockholders Meeting") as promptly as practicable
after the execution of this Agreement, and in any event no later than forty-
five (45) days after (a) the tenth (10th) calendar day after the preliminary
Proxy Statement has been filed with the SEC if by such date the SEC has not
informed the Company that it intends to review the Proxy Statement or (b) if
the SEC has by such date informed the Company that it intends to review the
Proxy Statement, the date on which the SEC confirms that it has no further
comments on the Proxy Statement; provided, that the date of the Stockholders
Meeting may be delayed for a reasonable period (not to exceed ten (10) days)
to the extent required by Law, to consider and vote upon the adoption of this
Agreement, and shall not postpone, recess or adjourn such meeting except to
the extent required by Law or, if as of the time for which the Stockholders

after the date of this Agreement, all applications required to be filed with
the FCC and the notification and report form required under the HSR Act;

practicable to any additional requests for information or documentary material
from the FCC, the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of

case of clauses (ii) and (iv) such requirements would not individually or in
the aggregate reasonably be likely to have a Material Adverse Effect (it being
understood that for these purposes, Material Adverse Effect shall be read
without the provisos set forth in the definition thereof) (any such
requirement set forth in clauses (i), (ii), (iii), or (iv), subject in the
case of clauses (ii) and (iv) to the immediately preceding terms with respect

information, Parent shall have the right to direct all matters with any
Governmental Entity consistent with its obligations hereunder; provided that
Parent and the Company shall have the right to review in advance and, to the
extent practicable, each will consult with the other on and consider in good
faith the views of the other in connection with, all of the information
relating to Parent or the Company, as the case may be, and any of their
respective Subsidiaries, that appears in any filing made with, or written
materials submitted to, any third party and/or any Governmental Entity in

Agreement (including the Proxy Statement). In exercising the foregoing rights,

to participate in any meeting or telephone call with any Governmental Entity
in respect of any filings, investigation or other inquiry relating to the

advance and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity, gives the

FCC License and Other Company License documents and information, and
Representatives of the Company and its Subsidiaries who can respond
knowledgeably to questions related thereto) and, during such period, the
Company shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to) furnish promptly to Parent

reasonably be requested, and (b) as soon as reasonably practicable but in no
event later than thirty (30) days after the date of this Agreement, make

operated by the Company and its Subsidiaries with the FCC Rules and FAA Rules
relating to towers); provided that no investigation pursuant to this Section
6.6 shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty made by

require the Company (i) to permit any inspection, or to disclose any
information, that in the reasonable judgment of the Company would result in
the disclosure of any Trade Secrets of third parties, violate any applicable
Laws or violate any of its obligations with respect to confidentiality if the
Company shall have used reasonable best efforts to obtain the consent of such
third party to such inspection or disclosure or (ii) to disclose any
privileged information of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. All requests

reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do or
cause to be done all things, reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its
part under applicable Laws and rules and policies of the NASDAQ to enable the
delisting by the Surviving Corporation of the Shares from the NASDAQ and the
deregistration of the Shares under the Exchange Act as promptly as practicable

party and/or any Governmental Entity (including any national securities
exchange or interdealer quotation service) with respect thereto, except as may
be required by Law or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with or
rules of any national securities exchange or interdealer quotation service or
by the request of any Governmental Entity.

  

  

6.9. Employee Benefits

  

  

.

  

  

(a) Parent agrees that, during the period commencing at the Effective Time and
ending on the first anniversary of the Effective Time, the employees of the
Company and its Subsidiaries (each a "Company Employee") will be provided with
(i) base compensation that is at least equal to the base compensation provided
to the applicable Company Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time and
(ii) annual cash incentive opportunities and employee benefits that are
substantially comparable in the aggregate to those provided by the Company and
its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time. The Company shall,
prior to the Effective Time, take such actions as may be necessary to
terminate the Cricket severance plan (revised June 1, 2013) effective as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth herein, pursuant to the applicable severance plan of
Parent, Parent shall, or shall cause its applicable Subsidiary to, provide
each Company Employee whose employment terminates during the one-year period
following the Effective Time with severance payments and benefits at levels
and amounts, and on terms and conditions, no less favorable than those set
forth on Section 6.9(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, with respect to any Company Employee who becomes subject to a
collective bargaining agreement after the Effective Time, all compensation and
benefits treatment afforded to such Company Employee shall be provided only in
accordance with the applicable collective bargaining agreement.

  

  

(b) Without limiting the generality of Section 6.9(a), from and after the
Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries to, honor all
Benefit Plans listed on Section 6.9(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter in
accordance with their terms as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time.

  

  

(c) With respect to each benefit plan, program, practice, policy or
arrangement maintained by Parent or its Subsidiaries following the Closing and
in which any Company Employee participates (the "Parent Plans"), for purposes
of the eligibility to participate, vesting requirements and benefit accrual
for purposes of vacation, paid time off severance plans and rate of
contribution or matching under any retirement plan only, each Company
Employee's service with the Company or its Subsidiaries (or predecessor
employers for which Company or its Subsidiaries provide past service credit)
shall be treated as service with Parent and/or any applicable Subsidiary of
Parent; provided, that such service shall not be recognized to the extent that
such recognition would result in a duplication of benefits for the same period
of service, for purposes of any frozen or discontinued Parent Plan or any
frozen or discontinued portion of a Parent Plan or for purposes of benefit
accrual under any defined benefit pension plan or retiree medical plan. Parent
shall cause (i) such service to apply for purposes of satisfying any waiting
periods or evidence of insurability requirements and (ii) each Parent Plan to
waive pre-existing condition limitations for employees (and their
beneficiaries and covered dependents) participating in such plan to the extent
waived or not applicable under the applicable Benefit Plan. Parent shall
provide each Company Employee with credit, or a cash payment in lieu thereof,
for any deductibles paid prior to the Effective Time in satisfying any
applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under any welfare plans of
Parent that such Company Employees are eligible to participate in following
the Effective Time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if "hire date" is used to
determine the particular Parent Plan in which a Company Employee would
participate, if any, then "hire date," solely for such purposes, shall be the
Closing Date.

  

  

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained herein shall (i) be
treated as an amendment of any particular Benefit Plan, (ii) alter or limit
the ability of Parent to amend, modify or terminate any Benefit Plan, Parent
Plan or any other benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement, (iii) give
any third party any right to enforce the provisions of this Section 6.9, (iv)
obligate Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates to (A)
maintain any particular benefit plan or (B) retain the employment of any
particular employee or (v) be deemed to confer upon any such individual or
legal representative any rights under or with respect to any plan, program or
arrangement described in or contemplated by this Agreement, and each such
individual or legal representative shall be entitled to look only to the
express terms of any such plan, program or arrangement for his or her rights
thereunder.

  

  

(e) If requested by Parent in writing no later than thirty (30) days prior to
the Effective Time, to the extent permitted by applicable Law and the terms of
the applicable plan, prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take such
corporate action as is necessary to cause the Company's 401(k) Plan to be
terminated effective immediately prior to the Effective Time, subject to the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and provided
that, prior to the Effective Time, Parent takes all action as is necessary,
including amendments to its 401(k) plan, to permit the Company Employees to
roll any eligible rollover distributions (including loans) over into Parent's
401(k) plan following the Effective Time and to commence participation in
Parent's 401(k) plan on the Closing Date.

  

  

6.10. Expenses

  

  

. Except as otherwise provided in Section 8.5, whether or not the Merger is
consummated, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement
and the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall
be paid by the party incurring such expense.

  

  

6.11. Indemnification; Directors' and Officers' Insurance

  

  

.

  

  

(a) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation agrees that
it will indemnify and hold harmless each present and former director and
officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (in each case, when acting
in such capacity), determined as of the Effective Time (the "Indemnified
Parties"), against any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys'
fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities incurred in
connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of matters
existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or
claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent that
the Company would have been permitted under the DGCL and its certificate of
incorporation or by-laws as in effect on the date of this Agreement to
indemnify such Person and the Surviving Corporation shall also advance
expenses as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law;
provided that the Person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking
to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such Person is not
entitled to indemnification; and provided, further, that any determination
required to be made with respect to whether an officer's or director's conduct
complies with the standards set forth under the DGCL and the Company's
certificate of incorporation and by-laws shall be made by independent counsel
selected by the Surviving Corporation.

  

  

(b) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under Section
6.11(a), upon learning of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, shall promptly notify Parent thereof, but the failure to so
notify shall not relieve the Surviving Corporation of any liability it may
have to such Indemnified Party except to the extent such failure prejudices
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries. In the event of any such claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before or after the
Effective Time), (i) the Surviving Corporation shall have the right to assume
the defense thereof and the Surviving Corporation shall not be liable to such
Indemnified Parties for any fees and expenses of other counsel or any other
expenses incurred by such Indemnified Parties in connection with the defense
thereof, except that if the Surviving Corporation elects not to assume such
defense or counsel for the Indemnified Parties advises that there are issues
which present conflicts of interest between the Surviving Corporation and the
Indemnified Parties, the Indemnified Parties may retain counsel satisfactory
to them, and the Surviving Corporation shall pay all reasonable fees and
expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified Parties promptly as statements
therefor are received; provided that the Surviving Corporation shall be
obligated pursuant to this Section 6.11(b) to pay for only one firm of counsel
for all Indemnified Parties in any jurisdiction unless the use of one counsel
for such Indemnified Parties would present such counsel with a conflict of
interest; provided that the fewest number of counsels necessary to avoid
conflicts of interest shall be used; (ii) the Indemnified Parties will
cooperate with the Surviving Corporation in the defense of any such matter,
and (iii) the Surviving Corporation shall not be liable for any settlement
effected without its prior written consent; and provided, further, that the
Surviving Corporation shall not have any obligation hereunder to any
Indemnified Party if and when a court of competent jurisdiction shall
ultimately determine, and such determination shall have become final, that the
indemnification of such Indemnified Party in the manner contemplated hereby is
prohibited by applicable Law.

  

  

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall and, if the Company is
unable to, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective
Time to obtain and fully pay for "tail" insurance policies with a claims
period of at least six years from and after the Effective Time from one or
more insurance carriers with the same or better credit rating as the Company's
current insurance carrier with respect to directors' and officers' liability
insurance and fiduciary liability insurance (collectively, "DandO Insurance")
with benefits and levels of coverage at least as favorable as the Company's
existing policies with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time (including in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions or actions contemplated hereby); provided, however, that in no
event shall the Company expend for such policies a premium amount in excess of
the amount set forth in Section 6.11(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter. If
the Company and the Surviving Corporation for any reason fail to obtain such
"tail" insurance policies as of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, continue to
maintain in effect for a period of at least six years from and after the
Effective Time the DandO Insurance in place as of the date of this Agreement
with benefits and levels of coverage at least as favorable as provided in the
Company's existing policies as of the date of this Agreement, or the Surviving
Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, use
reasonable best efforts to purchase comparable DandO Insurance for such six-year
period with benefits and levels of coverage at least as favorable as provided
in the Company's existing policies as of the date of this Agreement; provided,
however, that in no event shall Parent or the Surviving Corporation be
required to expend for such policies an annual premium amount in excess of
300% of the annual premium currently paid by the Company for such insurance;
and provided, further, that if the annual premium of such insurance coverage
exceed such amount, the Surviving Corporation shall obtain a policy with the
greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding such amount.

  

  

(d) Parent agrees to cause the Surviving Corporation to fulfill its
obligations set forth in this Section 6.11. If Parent or the Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) shall
consolidate with or merge into any other corporation or entity and shall not
be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger or (ii) shall transfer all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any individual, corporation or other entity, then, and in each such
case, proper provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns of
Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall assume all of the obligations set
forth in this Section 6.11.

  

  

(e) The provisions of this Section 6.11 are intended to be for the benefit of,
and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties.

  

  

(f) The rights of the Indemnified Parties under this Section 6.11 shall be in
addition to any rights such Indemnified Parties may have under the certificate
of incorporation or by-laws of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or
under any applicable Contracts or Laws.

contemplated by this Agreement constituting a "Fundamental Change" and/or
"Make-Whole Fundamental Change" as such terms are defined in the Convertible
Notes Indenture, and delivery of any supplemental indentures, legal opinions,
officers certificates or other documents or instruments required in connection
with the consummation of the Merger.

Effective Time, each outstanding Convertible Note shall no longer be
convertible into Shares and shall be convertible solely into the total Per
Share Merger Consideration and other payments under this Agreement that the
holder of such Convertible Note would have been entitled to receive pursuant
to the Merger if such holder had converted such Convertible Note immediately
prior to the Effective Time.

  

  

(c) Upon the written request of Parent, the Company shall execute and deliver,
or cause to be executed and delivered, at the Closing, any other supplemental
indentures, legal opinions, officers certificates or other documents or
instruments (in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Company)
required for the due assumption of the Company's outstanding debt, guarantees,
securities and other agreements to the extent required by the terms of such
debt, guarantees, securities or other agreements.

respect to which it or any of its Subsidiaries has the power (by agreement,
proxy or otherwise) to cause to be voted (or to provide a consent), in favor
of the adoption and approval of this Agreement at any meeting of stockholders
of the Company or Merger Sub, respectively, at which this Agreement shall be

Company or Merger Sub by consent in lieu of a meeting).

reasonable efforts to (i) cure no later than the Effective Time any violations

FAA Rules, (iii) file or cause to be filed with the FCC and the FAA all
reports and other filings required to be filed by the Company under applicable
FCC Rules and FAA Rules and (iv) take all reasonable actions requested in
writing by Parent on or before the Closing Date (provided that no such action
shall be required if it would require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
to take or refrain from taking any action or to agree to any restriction or
condition with respect to any of their respective assets or operations, in
each case that would take effect prior to the Effective Time) for each of them
to be in compliance upon the consummation of the Closing with the provisions
of Sections 271 and 272 of the Communications Act (including any orders issued
by the FCC interpreting or implementing such provisions).

  

  

(b) During the period from the date of this Agreement to the Closing, the
Company and its Subsidiaries shall use their reasonable best efforts to (i)
take all actions reasonably necessary to maintain and preserve the FCC

institute proceedings for the suspension, revocation or adverse modification
of any FCC Licenses or Other Company Licenses.

ownership interests held by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (such
assets or interests being "Potential Sale Interest"). To the extent reasonably
requested by Parent, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to,
use its reasonable best efforts to (a) permit Persons whom Parent identifies

Contract under which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries may be required to
dispose of any Potential Sale Interest other than immediately prior to, at or
after the Effective Time, or to agree to restrictions on their businesses or
operations, or payment of money or other consideration, prior to the Effective
Time. Parent shall be permitted to identify potential purchasers of Potential
Sale Interests and negotiate any Contracts with respect to dispositions of
Potential Sale Interests; provided that the Company may (and, to the extent
reasonably requested by Parent, shall) participate in such negotiations. If
the Effective Time does not occur, Parent shall reimburse the Company for the
reasonable, documented out of pocket fees and expenses of the Company and its
Subsidiaries expended in complying with this Section 6.15(a).

agreement, the Company and its Subsidiaries' interest in PRWireless, LLC and
Flat Wireless, LLC shall not be considered Potential Sale Interests.

Letter, the Parent Disclosure Letter and the Non-Disclosure Agreement, dated
June 7, 2013, between ATandT Services, Inc., the Company and Cricket and the
Clean Team Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of June 13, 2013, between ATandT
Services, Inc. and the Company (collectively, the "Confidentiality
Agreements"), constitute the entire agreement and supersede all other prior
agreements, understandings, representations and warranties both written and
oral, among the parties, with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement.
No party shall be bound by, or be liable for, any alleged representation,
promise, inducement or statement of intention not contained herein.

  

  

9.8. No Third Party Beneficiaries

  

  

. Except as provided in Section 6.11 (Indemnification; Directors' and
Officers' Insurance), Parent and the Company hereby agree that their
respective representations, warranties and covenants set forth herein are
solely for the benefit of the other party hereto, in accordance with and
subject to the terms of this Agreement, and this Agreement is not intended to,
and does not, confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto any rights
or remedies hereunder, including the right to rely upon the representations
and warranties set forth herein. The parties hereto further agree that the
rights of third party beneficiaries under Section 6.11 shall not arise unless
and until the Effective Time occurs.

  

  

9.9. Obligations of Parent and of the Company

  

  

. Whenever this Agreement requires a Subsidiary of Parent to take any action,
such requirement shall be deemed to include an undertaking on the part of
Parent to cause such Subsidiary to take such action. Whenever this Agreement
requires a Subsidiary of the Company to take any action, such requirement
shall be deemed to include an undertaking on the part of the Company to cause
such Subsidiary to take such action and, after the Effective Time, on the part
of the Surviving Corporation to cause such Subsidiary to take such action.

  

  

9.10. Transfer Taxes

  

  

. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other such
Taxes and fees (including penalties and interest) incurred in connection with
the Merger shall be paid by Parent and Merger Sub when due, and Parent and
Merger Sub will indemnify the Company against liability for any such Taxes.

  

  

9.11. Severability

  

  

. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed severable and the
invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not affect the validity
or enforceability of the other provisions of this Agreement. If any provision
of this Agreement, or the application of such provision to any Person or any
circumstance, is invalid or unenforceable, (a) a suitable and equitable
provision shall be substituted therefor in order to carry out, so far as may
be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid or
unenforceable provision and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and the
application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances shall not be
affected by such invalidity or unenforceability, nor shall such invalidity or
unenforceability affect the validity or enforceability of such provision, or
the application of such provision, in any other jurisdiction.

  

  

9.12. Interpretation; Construction

  

  

. (a) The table of contents and headings herein are for convenience of
reference only, do not constitute part of this Agreement and shall not be
deemed to limit or otherwise affect any of the provisions of this Agreement.
Where a reference in this Agreement is made to a Section or Exhibit, such
reference shall be to a Section of or Exhibit to this Agreement unless
otherwise indicated. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including"
are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words
"without limitation."

  

  

(b) The parties have participated jointly in negotiating and drafting this
Agreement. In the event that an ambiguity or a question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly
by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or
disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provision of this
Agreement.

  

  

(c) The Company has or may have set forth information in the Company
Disclosure Letter in a section of the Company Disclosure Letter that
corresponds to the section of this Agreement to which it relates. The fact
that any item of information is disclosed in the Company Disclosure Letter to
this Agreement shall not be construed to mean that such information is
required to be disclosed by this Agreement.

  

  

9.13. Assignment

  

  

. This Agreement shall not be assignable by operation of Law or otherwise;
provided, however, that Parent may designate, by written notice to the
Company, another wholly owned direct or indirect Subsidiary to be a
Constituent Corporation in lieu of Merger Sub, in which event all references
herein to Merger Sub shall be deemed references to such other Subsidiary,
except that all representations and warranties made herein with respect to
Merger Sub as of the date of this Agreement shall be deemed representations
and warranties made with respect to such other Subsidiary as of the date of
such designation; provided that any such designation shall not materially
impede or delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or otherwise materially impede the rights of the stockholders of the
Company under this Agreement. Any purported assignment in violation of this
Agreement is void.
