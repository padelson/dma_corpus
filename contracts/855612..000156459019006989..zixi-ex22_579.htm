Buyer at least two Business Days prior to the Closing Date, provided, however,
that no such update may increase the portion of the Purchase Price payable to
Blocker above 31.50% of the Purchase Price absent the prior written consent of
the Buyer (in its sole discretion). The amount of such payment (less the
aggregate portion of the Sellers' Representative Expense Fund, which shall be
held by the Sellers' Representative in accordance with Section 5.19)
attributable to the Sellers as set forth on the Distribution Waterfall shall
be paid by the Sellers' Representative to the Sellers in accordance with the

(ii)Upon receipt of evidence of release or payoff letter, as applicable, in a
form reasonably satisfactory to the Buyer, for any Indebtedness and all
corresponding UCC-3 Termination Statements and Encumbrance releases (including
with respect to Intellectual Property) with respect to any Encumbrances
securing such Indebtedness (provided, that each UCC-3 Termination Statement
and Encumbrance releases shall be delivered to the Buyer in escrow or
otherwise conditioned upon the repayment in full of the Payoff Indebtedness),
the Buyer shall deliver, or cause to be delivered on behalf of the Company,
the amount payable to each counterparty or holder of Indebtedness identified
on Schedule 2.2(b)(ii) of the Disclosure Schedules (the "Payoff Indebtedness")
in order to fully discharge such Payoff Indebtedness and terminate all
applicable obligations and liabilities of the Company Group and any of its
Affiliates related thereto, as specified in the Debt Payoff Letters and in
accordance with this Agreement.

 

(iii)The Buyer shall deliver, or cause to be delivered on behalf of the

(v)Each Seller shall deliver a certification of non-foreign status of the
Sellers satisfying the requirements of §1.1445-2(b)(2) of the United States
Treasury Regulations promulgated under the Code and (in the case of each
Seller other than Blocker Seller) IRS Notice 2018-29, and including (in the
case of each Seller other than Blocker Seller) any additional information as
may be required by Treasury Regulations promulgated under Section 1446(f)(2),
in the form attached hereto as Exhibit E.

   

(vi)The Sellers shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Buyer

each member of the Company Group under, all intercompany and intracompany
accounts or contracts between any member of the Company Group, on the one
hand, and the Sellers and their Affiliates (other than the Company Group), on
the other hand, as such accounts and contracts set forth on Schedule
2.2(b)(viii) of the Disclosure Schedules.

 

(c)All payments hereunder, including payments made pursuant to Section 2.4,
shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds in United States
dollars to such account(s) as may be designated to the payor by the Buyer or
the Sellers, as applicable, at least two Business Days prior to the applicable
payment date.

 

(d)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, but without limiting the
Buyer's obligations hereunder (including the Buyer's obligation to pay the
Purchase Price), the Buyer shall be entitled at the Closing to direct that any
of the Equity Interests be transferred by the Sellers to one or more of the
Buyer's Affiliates in lieu of any such transfer to the Buyer itself.

 

Section 2.3Closing Estimates. At least two Business Days prior to the
anticipated Closing Date, the Sellers shall prepare, or cause to be prepared,
and deliver to the Buyer a written statement (the "Preliminary Closing
Statement") that shall include and set forth (i) good-faith estimates of (A)
Net Working Capital (the "Estimated Net Working Capital"), (B) Indebtedness
(the "Estimated Indebtedness"), (C) Cash (the "Estimated Cash") and (D) all
Transaction Expenses that are accrued or due and remain unpaid (the "Estimated
Transaction Expenses") (with each of Estimated Net Working Capital, Estimated
Indebtedness, Estimated Cash and Estimated Transaction Expenses determined as
of 11:59 p.m. on the day immediately preceding the Closing Date and, except
for Estimated Transaction Expenses, without giving effect to the transactions
contemplated herein), and (ii) on the basis of the foregoing, a calculation of
the Estimated Purchase Price. Estimated Net Working Capital, Estimated
Indebtedness and Estimated Cash shall be calculated in accordance with GAAP
applied on a basis consistent with the preparation of the Sample Working
Capital Statement. All such estimates shall be subject to the Buyer's
approval, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, and shall control solely
for purposes of determining the amounts payable at the Closing pursuant to
Section 2.2 and shall not limit or otherwise affect the Buyer's remedies under
this Agreement or otherwise or constitute an acknowledgement by the Buyer of
the accuracy of the amounts reflected therein.

 

Section 2.4Post-Closing Adjustment of Purchase Price.

 

(a)Within 60 days after the Closing Date, the Buyer shall prepare, or cause to
be prepared, and deliver to the Sellers a written statement (the "Initial
Closing Statement") that shall include and set forth a calculation of Net
Working Capital (the "Closing Net Working Capital") (prepared in accordance
with the Sample Working Capital Statement), a calculation of Cash of the
Company Group ("Closing Cash"), a calculation of Closing Indebtedness of the
Company Group ("Closing Indebtedness") and a calculation of Transaction
Expenses as of the Closing ("Closing Transaction Expenses") (with each of
Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness, Closing Cash and Closing
Transaction Expenses determined as of 11:59 p.m. on the day immediately
preceding the Closing Date and, except for Closing Transaction Expenses,
without giving effect to the transactions contemplated herein).

   

(b)The Initial Closing Statement shall become final and binding (the "Final
Closing Statement") on the 60th day following delivery thereof unless, prior
to the end of such period, the Sellers' Representative delivers to the Buyer
written notice of its disagreement (a "Notice of Disagreement") specifying the
nature and amount of any dispute as to the Closing Net Working Capital,
Closing Cash, Closing Indebtedness or Closing Transaction Expenses, as set
forth in the Initial Closing Statement. The Sellers shall be deemed to have
agreed with all items and amounts of Closing Net Working Capital not
specifically referenced in the Notice of Disagreement, and such items and
amounts shall not be subject to review in accordance with Section 2.4(c). Any
Notice of Disagreement may reference only disagreements based on mathematical
errors or based on amounts of the Closing Net Working Capital as reflected on
the Initial Closing Statement not being calculated in accordance with this
Section 2.4. For the avoidance of doubt, the Sellers shall be permitted to
deliver only one Notice of Disagreement pursuant to this Section 2.4(b).

 

(c)During the 15‑Business Day period following delivery of the Notice of
Disagreement by the Sellers' Representative to the Buyer, the Sellers'
Representative and the Buyer in good faith shall seek to resolve in writing
any differences that they may have with respect to the computation of the
Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Cash, Closing Indebtedness and Closing
Transaction Expenses, as specified therein. Any disputed items resolved in
writing between the Sellers' Representative and the Buyer within such
15‑Business Day period shall become part of the Final Closing Statement and be
final and binding with respect to such items, and if the Sellers'
Representative and the Buyer agree in writing on the resolution of each
disputed item specified by the Sellers' Representative in the Notice of
Disagreement and the amount of the Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Cash,
Closing Indebtedness and Closing Transaction Expenses the amounts so
determined shall become part of the Final Closing Statement and be final and
binding on the parties for all purposes hereunder. If the Sellers'
Representative and the Buyer have not resolved all such differences by the end
of such 15‑Business Day period, within five Business Days following the end of
such 15‑Business Day period, the Sellers' Representative and the Buyer shall
engage, pursuant to a standard engagement letter, an independent accounting
firm of national reputation mutually acceptable to Buyer and Seller (the
"Independent Accounting Firm") and, within 15 Business Days following
engagement of the Independent Accounting Firm, shall submit, in writing, to
the Independent Accounting Firm their briefs detailing their respective views
as to the correct nature and amount of each item remaining in dispute and the
amount of the Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Cash, Closing Indebtedness
and Closing Transaction Expenses and the Independent Accounting Firm shall
make a written determination as to each such disputed item and the amount of
each of the Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Cash, Closing Indebtedness
and Closing Transaction Expenses, which determination, along with the other
amounts previously agreed to by the parties pursuant to this Section 2.4,
shall comprise the Final Closing Statement and be final and binding on the
parties for all purposes hereunder and shall not be subject to appeal or
further review. The Independent Accounting Firm shall consider only those
items and amounts in the Sellers' Representative and the Buyer's respective
calculations of the Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Cash, Closing
Indebtedness and Closing Transaction Expenses that are identified as being
items and amounts to which the Sellers' Representative and the Buyer have been
unable to agree. In resolving any disputed item, the Independent Accounting
Firm may not assign a value to any item greater than the greatest value for
such item claimed by either party or less than the smallest value for such
item claimed by either party. The Sellers' Representative and the Buyer shall
use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Independent Accounting
Firm to render a written decision, which shall specify, with particularity,
resolution of the matters submitted to it as promptly as practicable, and in
any event within 30 Business Days following the submission thereof.

   

(d)The costs of any dispute resolution pursuant to Section 2.4(c), including
the fees and expenses of the Independent Accounting Firm and of any
enforcement of the determination thereof, shall be borne by the Sellers, on
the one hand, and the Buyer, on the other hand, in inverse proportion as they
may prevail on the matters resolved by the Independent Accounting Firm, which
proportionate allocation shall be calculated on an aggregate basis based on
the relative dollar values of the amounts in dispute and shall be determined
by the Independent Accounting Firm at the time the determination of such firm
is rendered on the merits of the matters submitted. The fees and disbursements
of the Representatives of each party incurred in connection with the
preparation or review of the Initial Closing Statement and preparation or
review of any Notice of Disagreement, as applicable, shall be borne by such
party.

 

(e)The Buyer will, and will cause the Company to, afford the Sellers and their
Representatives reasonable access, during normal business hours and upon
reasonable prior notice, to the personnel, properties, books and records of
the Company Group and to any other information reasonably requested for
purposes of preparing and reviewing the calculations contemplated by this
Section 2.4. Each party shall authorize its accountants to disclose work
papers generated by such accountants in connection with preparing and
reviewing the calculations of the Net Working Capital as specified in this
Section 2.4; provided, that such accountants shall not be obligated to make
any work papers available except in accordance with such accountants'
disclosure procedures and then only after the non-client party has signed an
agreement relating to access to such work papers in form and substance
acceptable to such accountants and that no party shall be required to provide
any attorney-client privileged communications pursuant to this Section 2.4(e).

 

(f)In accordance with the Final Closing Statement, the Estimated Purchase
Price shall be adjusted, upwards or downwards, as follows:

 

(i)For the purposes of this Agreement, the "Net Adjustment Amount" means an
amount, which may be positive or negative, equal to the aggregate sum of (A)
the Closing Net Working Capital, as finally determined pursuant to this
Section 2.4, minus the Estimated Net Working Capital; (B) the Closing Cash, as
finally determined pursuant to this Section 2.4, minus the Estimated Cash; (C)
the Closing Indebtedness, as finally determined pursuant to this Section 2.4,
minus the Estimated Indebtedness; and (D) the Closing Transaction Expenses, as
finally determined pursuant to this Section 2.4, minus the Estimated
Transaction Expenses.

 

(ii)If the Net Adjustment Amount is positive, (A) the Estimated Purchase Price
shall be adjusted upwards in an amount equal to the Net Adjustment Amount and
(B) the Buyer shall pay, or cause to be paid, to the Sellers' Representative
(for the benefit of the Sellers pursuant to the Distribution Waterfall), an
amount in cash equal to the Net Adjustment Amount within 5 Business Days of
the final determination of Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Cash, Closing
Indebtedness and Closing Transaction Expenses pursuant to this Section 2.4. 

 

(iii)If the Net Adjustment Amount is negative (in which case the Net
Adjustment Amount for purposes of this clause (iii) shall be deemed to be
equal to the absolute value of such amount), the Estimated Purchase Price
shall be adjusted downwards in an amount equal to the Net Adjustment Amount
and the Sellers shall pay to the Buyer an amount in cash equal to the amount
of such deficiency within 5 Business Days of the final determination of
Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Cash, Closing Indebtedness and Closing
Transaction Expenses pursuant to this Section 2.4.

   

Section 2.5Purchase Price Allocation. Within 60 days after the finalization of
the Final Closing Statement pursuant to Section 2.4, the Seller Representative
shall prepare, and provide to the Buyer for its review and approval, a
proposed allocation (the "Purchase Price Allocation") of the portion of the
Purchase Price allocated to the purchase of Units and a ratable share of the
liabilities of the Company and other relevant Tax items among the assets of
the Company and its Subsidiaries for all Tax purposes, including the
determination of the portion of the gain or loss recognized upon the sale of
the Units that is attributable to the Company's "unrealized receivables" and
"inventory items" (as such terms are defined in Section 751 of the Code).
Within thirty days following the Seller Representative's delivery of the
Purchase Price Allocation, the Buyer shall inform the Seller Representative in
writing whether it has approved the Purchase Price Allocation (and in the
event that the Buyer fails to respond in writing within such 30-day period,
the Buyer shall be deemed to have approved the Purchase Price Allocation).
Provided that the Buyer approves the Purchase Price Allocation, the Sellers,
the Buyer and the Company shall prepare and file all Tax Returns and related
forms in a manner consistent with the Purchase Price Allocation, except to the
extent otherwise required by a determination (within the meaning of Section
1313(a) of the Code). In the event of an adjustment to the Purchase Price, the
Sellers and the Buyer agree to adjust the Purchase Price Allocation in a
reasonable manner to reflect such adjustment. If any Governmental Authority
disputes the Purchase Price Allocation, the party receiving notice of the
dispute shall promptly notify the other party and each party shall keep the
other reasonably informed of material developments of any such dispute.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Buyer does not approve the Purchase
Price Allocation then none of the Buyer, the Sellers, nor any of their
Affiliates shall be required, pursuant hereto, to file any Tax Returns or
otherwise take any positions, in each case that are consistent with the
Purchase Price Allocation or the allocation of the other party, but instead
each party may allocate the consideration among the assets in a manner it
considers appropriate and file its Tax Returns in a manner consistent with its
allocation.

 

Section 2.6Withholding Rights. Each of the Buyer and its Affiliates, as the
case may be, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration
otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as it
is required to deduct and withhold under any provision of applicable Law with
respect to the making of such payment. If the Buyer or its Affiliates
determines that an amount is required to be deducted and withheld, Buyer shall
give the Seller Representative at least three (3) days' prior written
notification of its intention to make any such deduction or withholding and
shall reasonably cooperate with the Seller Representative to mitigate, reduce
or eliminate any such deduction or withholding. To the extent that such
amounts are so withheld and paid over to the relevant Governmental Authority
by the Buyer or its Affiliates, as the case may be, such withheld amounts
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
applicable Person in respect to which such deduction and withholding was made.

Section 3.4Equity Interests.

 

(a)The Equity Interests Schedule accurately sets forth the authorized and
outstanding equity interests of the Company and the name and number of equity
securities held by each equityholder thereof and no other classes of Units,
equity interests, shares, capital stock or other equity ownership interests
exist, and no other membership interests are issued and outstanding. All of
the issued and outstanding equity securities of the Company have been duly
authorized, are validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable, and are owned of
record and beneficially by the equityholders of the Company described on the
Equity Interests Schedule. Except for this Agreement and as may be set forth

puts, rights to subscribe, conversion rights or other agreements or
commitments to which the Company is a party or which is binding upon the
Company providing for the issuance, disposition or acquisition of any of its

outstanding or authorized equity appreciation, phantom units or similar rights
with respect to the Company. Following consummation of the transactions

Interests from the Sellers to the Buyer at Closing, Buyer will own (directly
or indirectly) 100% of the outstanding equity interests of the Company.

 

(b)Each Seller holds of record and owns beneficially those Equity Interests
set forth opposite such Seller's name on the Equity Interests Schedule, free
and clear of any Liens and any other restrictions on transfer (other than such
Liens and/or restrictions that shall be released, waived or otherwise

under the 1933 Act and state securities laws). Other than in connection with
the Company LLC Agreement or any other organizational documents of the Company

warrant, right, contract, call, pledge, put or other agreement or commitment
providing for the disposition or acquisition of such Seller's interest in the

understanding with respect to the ownership or voting of any of the Equity
Interests.

outstanding equity securities of Blocker and the number of equity securities
held by each Blocker Seller. All of the issued and outstanding equity
securities of Blocker have been duly authorized, are validly issued, fully
paid and nonassessable, and are owned of record and beneficially by the
Blocker Seller. Except for this Agreement and as may be set forth on Schedule
3.4(c), there are no outstanding options, warrants, rights, contracts,
pledges, calls, puts, rights to subscribe, conversion rights or other
agreements or commitments to which Blocker is a party or which is binding upon

Reorganization, Blocker has not entered into any contracts or conducted any
business and has never owned, leased or used any asset other than the equity
interests of Marlin Seller held by Blocker and any distributions related to
the equity interests of the Marlin Seller held by Blocker, or incurred any
indebtedness or taken any action pursuant to which it could become obligated
with respect to any liabilities. Following consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the sale and transfer of the Blocker Shares
from the Blocker Seller to the Buyer at Closing, Buyer will directly own 100%
of the outstanding equity interests of Blocker.

Seller and Blocker, their ownership of the Equity Interests and (ii) with
respect to the Blocker Seller, its ownership of the Blocker Shares, the
Sellers and Blocker do not hold any assets, properties or rights that relate
to or are used or useful in, developed for use, or held for use in connection
with, or necessary or helpful for the operation of, the Company Group or its
related Business, whether tangible or intangible, real, personal or mixed and
does not engage in any business, employee any personnel or conduct any
activity, nor has it since its formation entered into any contracts or engaged
in any business or conducted any activity or incurred any indebtedness or
taken any action pursuant to which it could become obligated with respect to
any liabilities.

condemnation, expropriation or taking been proposed. All leases of Leased Real
Property and all amendments and modifications thereto are in full force and
effect, and there exists no default under any such lease by the Company, any
of its Subsidiaries or any other party thereto, nor any event which, with
notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a default thereunder by the
Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any other party thereto. No leases of
Leased Real Property shall cease to be valid and binding in accordance with
their terms as a result of the consummation of the transactions contemplated

Registered Intellectual Property or Domains (including the failure to pay any
filing, examination, issuance, post registration and maintenance fees,
annuities and the like).

 

(b)No Action is pending or threatened or asserted in writing alleging that the

Subsidiaries.

 

(d)Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has taken all reasonable steps to
protect the secrecy, confidentiality and value of all Trade Secrets used in
the businesses of the Company and its Subsidiaries, including entering into
appropriate confidentiality agreements with all officers, directors, employees
and other Persons with access to such Trade Secrets. None of such Trade
Secrets has been disclosed or authorized to be disclosed to any Person other
than to employees or agents of the Company or its Subsidiaries for use in
connection with the businesses of the Company or its Subsidiaries or pursuant
to a confidentiality or non-disclosure agreement that reasonably protects the

unauthorized disclosure of any such Trade Secrets has occurred.

 

(e)All Intellectual Property developed by or for the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries was conceived, invented, reduced to practice, authorized or
otherwise created solely by either employees of the Company or the applicable

contractors of the Company or the applicable Subsidiary pursuant to agreements
containing an assignment of all rights to such developed Intellectual Property
to the Company or the applicable Subsidiary.

   

(f)The development, manufacture, sale, distribution or other commercial
exploitation of products, and the provision of any services, by or on behalf
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and all of the other activities or
operations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, do not infringe upon,
misappropriate, violate, dilute or constitute the unauthorized use of, and
have not infringed upon, misappropriated, violated, diluted or constituted the
unauthorized use of, any Intellectual Property of any third party, and neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any (A) notice, claim or
indemnification request asserting or suggesting that any such infringement,
misappropriation, violation, dilution or unauthorized use is or may be
occurring or has or may have occurred or (B) request that such Company or any
of its Subsidiaries consider taking a license under any Patents owned by a
third party and no valid basis for any such infringement or misappropriation
claim exists. None of the Sellers, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has
knowledge that any third party has misappropriated, infringed, diluted or
violated, or is currently misappropriating, infringing, diluting or violating
any Company Owned Intellectual Property.

 

(g)Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has transferred ownership
of, or granted any exclusive license with respect to, any Company Owned
Intellectual Property. The Company Owned Intellectual Property and Company
Licensed Intellectual Property constitutes all Intellectual Property necessary
for the conduct of the Business.

 

(h)The execution, delivery and performance by the Sellers of this Agreement
and the Ancillary Agreements, and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, will not give rise to any right of any third party to
terminate or re-price or otherwise modify any of the Company's or any of its
Subsidiaries' rights or obligations under any agreement under which any right
or license of or under Intellectual Property is granted to or by the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries.

 

(i)None of the Intellectual Property used in the commercial exploitation of
products or the provision of services by or on behalf of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries is subject to any licensing terms requiring the distribution
of source code in connection with the distribution of any portion of such
Intellectual Property or that prohibits the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
from charging a fee or otherwise limits the Company's or any of its
Subsidiaries' freedom of action with regard to seeking compensation in
connection with sublicensing or distributing any portion of such Intellectual
Property (whether in source code or executable code form) or similar
obligations that require the disclosure, redistribution or licensing of any
source code underlying any such Intellectual Property. The Company and its
Subsidiaries do not distribute or host any Open Source Materials with any of
the Company's or its Subsidiaries' products in a manner that would obligate
the Company or its Subsidiaries to disclose or distribute any of the Company's
or its Subsidiaries' products in source code form (other than the applicable
Open Source Materials components) or license or otherwise make available any
of the Company's or its Subsidiaries' products on a royalty-free basis (other
than the applicable Open Source Materials).

 

(j)No source code of any software owned by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries has been licensed or otherwise provided to a third party other

respect to such source code. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
has disclosed or delivered to any escrow agent or any other Person any of the
source code of any software owned by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
and no Person has the right, contingent or otherwise, to obtain access to or
use any such source code. The Company and its Subsidiaries have in their

access and use all Domains and all internal computer and technology systems
used to process, store, maintain and operate data, information and functions
used in connection with the Business or otherwise necessary for the conduct of
the Business. The Company and its Subsidiaries have taken all reasonable steps
to secure such internal computer and technology systems from unauthorized
access or use by any Person, and to enable the continued, uninterrupted and
error-free operation of such systems. Such systems are adequate for the
operation of the Business and are in good working condition (normal wear and
tear excepted), and are free of all viruses, worms, Trojan horses and other
known contaminants and do not contain any bugs, errors or problems of a nature
that would disrupt their operation or have an adverse impact on the operation
of such systems. There has not been any malfunction with respect to any of
such systems since the Look-Back Date that has not been remedied or replaced.
No capital expenditures are necessary with respect to the use of such systems
other than capital expenditures in the ordinary course of business that are
consistent with the past practice of the Company Group.

other educational institution or research center was used in the development

of specific performance and other equitable remedies. As of the date hereof,
there are no engagement letters, fee letters, side letters, commitment
letters, or other agreements or contracts (except for the Redacted Fee Letter
and customary engagement letters with respect to the Debt Financing) in

under any term, or a failure of any condition or inability to satisfy any
conditions precedent to funding the full amount of the Financing, of any of
the Debt Commitment Letter or the Equity Purchase Agreement or otherwise
result in any portion of the Financing to be unavailable or delayed and (ii)
the Buyer does not have reason to believe that it would be unable to satisfy
on a timely basis any condition of the Debt Commitment Letter or the Equity
Purchase Agreement required to be satisfied by it or that any portion of the
Financing contemplated thereby will be unavailable to Buyer at the Closing.
Buyer has fully paid any and all commitment fees or other fees in connection

foregoing, the Buyer hereby expressly agrees and acknowledges that the Sellers
and the Company Group may rely, and are relying, on the representations and
warranties in this Agreement (as modified by the applicable schedule(s), if

properties, offices, plants and other facilities, books and records of
Blocker, the Company and each of its Subsidiaries, and shall furnish the Buyer
with such financial, operating and other data and information as the Buyer may
reasonably request. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 5.2 to the
contrary, no such investigation or examination shall involve any invasive or
intrusive investigation or testing or shall be permitted to the extent that it
would require the Sellers to disclose information (i) subject to attorney-
client privilege, (ii) which would conflict with any confidentiality
obligations to which the Sellers or any member of the Company Group are bound,
(iii) in violation of applicable Law, or (iv) that forms a part of the
analysis of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby by the
Sellers or the Company Group.

 

(b)On the Closing Date, the Sellers will deliver, or cause to be delivered, to
the Buyer all original (and any and all copies of) agreements, documents, and
books and records and all computer disks, records or tapes or any other
storage medium on which agreements, documents, books and records, files and
other information relating to the business and operations of Blocker, the
Company and its Subsidiaries are stored, in each case, that are in the
possession or under the control of the Sellers. Following the Closing Date,
the Sellers shall not retain in its possession or under its control, in any
form, any agreements, documents, or books and records, or any computer disks,
records or tapes or any other storage medium that contains copies of any
agreements, documents, books and records, files and other information relating
to the business and operations of Blocker, the Company and its Subsidiaries
(including any personal or other information stored on any media by any
employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries), including any of the
foregoing that is stored on any server or other storage media maintained by a
third party on behalf of the Sellers (including any "cloud" storage platform).
If, notwithstanding the foregoing, the Sellers discover following the Closing
Date that they are in possession of or have under their control any
agreements, documents, or books and records or any computer disks, records or
tapes or any other storage medium on which any agreements, documents, books
and records, files and other information relating to the business and
operations of Blocker, the Company and its Subsidiaries are stored, the
Sellers shall (x) deliver to the Buyer any such information which may not have
been previously delivered pursuant to the first sentence of this Section
5.2(b) and (y) thereafter permanently delete and erase all such information
(including all copies thereof) in its possession or under its control as soon
as reasonably practicable.

   

(c)Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 5.2(b), the Sellers shall not be
required to deliver information to the Buyer to the extent disclosure of such
information would (i) jeopardize any attorney-client privilege, protection
under the work product doctrine or other legal privilege or (ii) contravene
any applicable Laws, fiduciary duty or binding agreement entered into prior to
the date hereof.

 

Section 5.3Exclusivity. The Sellers agree that between the date of this
Agreement and the earlier of the Closing and the termination of this
Agreement, they shall not, and shall take all action necessary to ensure that
none of Blocker, the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective Affiliates or Representatives shall, directly or indirectly:

 

(a)solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage or accept any other proposals or
offers from any Person (i) relating to any direct or indirect acquisition or
purchase of all or any portion of the membership interests or other equity or
ownership interest of the Company Group or any assets of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, other than inventory to be sold in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice, (ii) to enter into any merger,
consolidation or other business combination relating to the Company Group or
(iii) to enter into a recapitalization, reorganization or any other
extraordinary business transaction involving or otherwise relating to the
Company Group; or

 

(b)with the intention of doing so, participate in any discussions,
conversations, negotiations or other communications regarding, or furnish to
any other Person any information with respect to, or otherwise cooperate in
any way, assist or participate in, facilitate or encourage any effort or
attempt by any other Person to seek to do any of the foregoing in clause (a)
above. The Sellers immediately shall cease and cause to be terminated all
existing discussions, conversations, negotiations and other communications
with any Persons conducted heretofore with respect to any of the foregoing in
clause (a) above.

 

The Sellers shall notify the Buyer promptly, but in any event within 24 hours,
orally and in writing if any such proposal or offer, or any inquiry or other
contact with any Person with respect thereto, is made. Any such notice to the
Buyer shall indicate in reasonable detail the identity of the Person making
such proposal, offer, inquiry or other contact and, to the extent known, the
terms and conditions of such proposal, offer, inquiry or other contact. The
Sellers shall not, and shall cause the Company and each of its Subsidiaries
not to, release any Person from, or waive any provision of, any
confidentiality or standstill agreement to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party, without the prior written consent of the Buyer.

basis, all cooperation and assistance reasonably requested by the Buyer that

Company shall have no responsibility for the preparation, accuracy or
reasonableness thereof); (v) assisting in the preparation, execution and
delivery of the definitive financing documents and facilitating the granting
of a security interest (and perfection thereof) in collateral, in each case,

Notwithstanding anything in this Section 5.4 to the contrary, (A) neither the
Company, Blocker nor the Sellers shall be required to pay any commitment fee
or similar fee or reimburse any expenses or provide any indemnities, in each
case in connection with the Financings other than for which the Company,

permitted by law); (F) the Sellers, Blocker and the Company shall not be
required to provide any pro forma information, projections, forecasts or

Company, its Subsidiaries or any of their respective directors, officers or
employees for and against any and all losses actually suffered or incurred by
them in connection with the arrangement of the Debt Financing, any action

Section 5.5Obligations of the Buyer with respect to Debt Financing.

 

(a)The Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary to
arrange and consummate the Debt Financing on the terms described in the Debt
Commitment Letter, including using reasonable best efforts to (i) satisfy (or
cause to be satisfied or obtain a waiver) on a timely basis all terms,
conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter, (ii) maintain in effect
the Debt Commitment Letter and comply with its obligations thereunder
(including the payment of all fees to be paid under the Debt Commitment Letter
as and when required), (iii) as promptly as practicable, negotiate and enter
into definitive agreements with respect thereto on the terms and conditions
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter (including the flex provisions set
forth in the Redacted Fee Letter) or enforce its rights under the Debt
Commitment Letter and (iv) consummate (and draw upon) the Debt Financing at or
prior to the Closing; provided, however, that nothing in this Section 5.5 or
elsewhere in this Agreement requires the Buyer to initiate, prosecute or
maintain any action, arbitration or other proceeding against any Financing
Source or other Persons providing the Financing under the Debt Commitment
Letter.

 

(b)The Buyer shall not, without the prior written consent of the Company, (A)
permit any amendment, modification, waiver, supplement or replacement to the
Debt Commitment Letter that (x) would add new (or adversely modify any
existing) conditions to the Debt Financing or the commitments thereunder that
prevents or materially delays or impedes the ability or consummation of the
Debt Financing, (y) reduces the amount of the Debt Financing such that the
aggregate funds that would be available to the Buyer at the Closing (taking
into account the Equity Financing and available cash on hand of the Buyer)
would not be sufficient to satisfy the Buyer's obligations to pay the amount
required under Section 2.2(b)(i) and (ii) any fees and expenses of or payable
by, as of the Closing Date, the Buyer unless the Equity Financing, other Debt
Financing or available cash on hand of Buyer is increased by a corresponding
amount, or (z) materially adversely affects the ability of the Buyer to
enforce its rights against other parties to the Debt Commitment Letter, (B)
terminate the Debt Commitment Letter, unless such Debt Commitment Letter is
replaced in a manner consistent with clause (c) below or (C) permit any
amendment, modification, waiver, supplement or replacement to the Debt
Commitment Letter that, taken together with all other amendments,
modifications, waivers, supplements or replacements to the Debt Commitment
Letter, would reasonably be expected to prevent or materially impede or delay
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

   

(c)If all or a part of the funds in the amounts and on the terms set forth in
the Debt Commitment Letter (including the flex provisions set forth in the
Redacted Fee Letter) become unavailable to the Buyer on the terms and
conditions set forth therein (other than as a result of a breach by the
Sellers, the Company or any of the Company's Subsidiaries of Section 5.4 of
this Agreement), then regardless of the reason therefor, the Buyer shall use
(and shall cause its controlled Affiliates to use) reasonable best efforts, as
promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event, to obtain
alternative debt financing (the "Alternative Financing") in amounts
sufficient, when taken together with other sources of funds available to the
Buyer, including additional equity financing, other debt financing or rollover
investments and available cash on hand of Buyer, to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to pay related fees and
expenses earned, due and owing by the Buyer on the Closing Date, and otherwise
on terms and conditions no less favorable in the aggregate to the Buyer than
as set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter as in effect on the date hereof;
provided, that if the Buyer proceeds with Alternative Financing, it shall be
subject to the same obligations as set forth in this Section 5.5 with respect
to the Debt Financing. For the purposes of this Agreement, the term "Debt
Commitment Letter" shall be deemed to include any commitment letter (or
similar agreement) with respect to any Alternative Financing arranged in
compliance herewith (and any Debt Commitment Letter remaining in effect at the
time in question). For the purposes of this Agreement, the term "Debt
Financing" shall be deemed to include the terms and conditions upon which the
lenders and any other financing sources named therein have committed with
respect to any Alternative Financing arranged in compliance herewith (and any
Debt Financing remaining in effect at the time in question). Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein, any Alternative Financing shall not, without
the prior written consent of the Company, be reasonably expected to prevent or
materially impede or delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and such Alternative Financing shall not impose any
additional conditions on the consummation thereof. In the event any
Alternative Financing is sought, Buyer shall promptly provide the Company with
a copy of any definitive commitment letter or other definitive agreements with
respect thereto. The Buyer shall keep the Company , upon the reasonable
request of the Company, reasonably informed on a reasonably current basis of
(and upon request, shall promptly provide updates with respect to) the status
of its efforts to consummate the Financing (or any Alternative Financing) and
shall promptly provide the Company with copies of any executed amendments,
modifications or replacements of any Debt Commitment Letter (it being
understood that any amendments, modifications or replacements shall only be as
permitted herein) or definitive agreements related to any of the Financing,
and such other information and documentation available to Buyer as shall be
reasonably requested by the Company for purposes of monitoring the progress of
the financing activities or exercising other rights pursuant to this Section
5.5. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Buyer shall promptly,
after obtaining actual knowledge thereof, notify the Company (A) of any
material breach or default by any party to the Debt Commitment Letter or
definitive agreements related to any of the Financing or of any event or
circumstance that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, could
reasonably be expected to give rise to any such breach or default, (B) of the
receipt by Buyer of any written notice or communication from any Financing
Source with respect to any breach (or threatened breach) or default, or any
termination or repudiation, in each case by any party to a Debt Commitment
Letter or any definitive agreements related to any of the Financing of any
provisions of any Debt Commitment Letter or such definitive agreements, and
(C) if for any reason Buyer no longer believes in good faith that it will be
able to obtain all or a portion of the Financing contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letter. As soon as reasonably practicable following reasonable
request from the Company therefor, Buyer shall provide any information so
requested relating to any circumstances referred to in clauses (A) through (C)
of the immediately preceding sentence; provided, that the Buyer shall not be
required to provide any information to the extent that the provision thereof
would violate or waive any attorney-client or other privilege, constitute
attorney work product or violate or contravene any law, rule or regulation, or
any obligation of confidentiality (not created in contemplation hereof)
binding on the Buyer. Notwithstanding the foregoing, compliance by the Buyer
with this Section 5.5 shall not relieve the Buyer of its obligation to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement whether or not the
Financing is available.

   

(d)Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything else in this Agreement, in no
event shall reasonable best efforts be deemed or construed to require the
Buyer to, and the Buyer shall not be required to, (A) pay any fees in excess
of those contemplated by the commitments under the Debt Commitment Letter or
(C) agree to conditionality or economic terms of the Debt Financing that are
less favorable in the aggregate than those contemplated by the Debt Commitment
Letter or any related fee letter (including any flex provisions therein).
Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement, including Section 4.7, this
Section 5.5 comprises the sole obligations of the Buyer under this Agreement
with respect to the Debt Financing.

 

Section 5.6Notification of Certain Matters. The Sellers shall give prompt
written notice to the Buyer of (a) the occurrence or non-occurrence of any
change, condition or event, the occurrence or non‑occurrence of which would
render any representation or warranty of the Sellers contained in this
Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement, if made on or immediately following the
date of such event, untrue or inaccurate, (b) the occurrence of any change,
condition or event that has had or is reasonably likely to have a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company Group, (c) any failure of the Sellers, Blocker,
the Company, any Subsidiary of the Company or any of their respective
Affiliates to comply with or satisfy any covenant or agreement to be complied
with or satisfied by it hereunder or any event or condition that would
otherwise result in the nonfulfillment of any of the conditions to the Buyer's
obligations hereunder, (d) any notice or other communication from any Person
alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection
with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
the Ancillary Agreements or (e) any Action pending or threatened against a
party or parties relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
or the Ancillary Agreements.

 

Section 5.7Release of Indemnity Obligations. Effective as of the Closing, the
Sellers do hereby, for themselves and each of their Affiliates (excluding the
Company Group) and each of their Related Parties (each, a "Seller Releasing
Party"), irrevocably release, waive and absolutely forever discharge the
Company Group and all of their respective, past, present and future officers,
directors, agents, representatives, successors and assigns (collectively, the
"Released Persons"), from any and all actions, causes of action, suits, debts,
dues, sums of money, accounts, bonds, bills, covenants, contracts,
controversies, agreements, promises, variances, trespasses, damages,
judgments, executions, claims and demands of every type and nature whatsoever,
known or unknown, at law or in equity (each a "Claim" and collectively, the
"Claims"), that any Seller Releasing Party has had, may now have or may
hereinafter have against any Released Person relating to, arising out of or
resulting from any matter, act or omission whatsoever during all periods
through the Closing and whether or not first asserted before or after the
Closing (together, the "Released Matters"). The Released Matters shall not
include (i) any agreement listed on Schedule 5.7 of the Disclosure Schedules
or (ii) this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement. It is the intention of the
Sellers in providing this release to the Released Persons, and in giving and
receiving the consideration called for in this Agreement, that this release
shall be effective as a full and final accord and satisfaction and general
release of and from all Released Matters and the final resolution by the
applicable Seller Releasing Party and the Company Group of all Released
Matters.

   

 

Section 5.8Confidentiality.

 

(a)Each of the parties shall hold, and shall cause its Representatives to
hold, in confidence all documents and information furnished to it by or on
behalf of the other party in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby pursuant to the terms of the mutual non-disclosure agreement dated
August 13, 2018 between the Buyer and the Company Group (the "Confidentiality
Agreement"), which shall continue in full force and effect until the Closing
Date, at which time such Confidentiality Agreement and the obligations of the
parties under this Section 5.8(a) shall terminate. If for any reason this
Agreement is terminated prior to the Closing Date, the Confidentiality
Agreement shall nonetheless continue in full force and effect in accordance
with its terms.

 

(b)For a period of two years following the Closing Date, the Sellers shall
not, and the Sellers shall cause their Affiliates and their respective
Representatives not to, use for its or their own benefit or divulge or convey
to any third party, any Confidential Information; provided, however, that the
Sellers, or their Affiliates may furnish such portion (and only such portion)
of the Confidential Information as the Sellers or such Affiliate reasonably
determines it is legally obligated to disclose if: (i) it receives a request
to disclose all or any part of the Confidential Information under the terms of
a subpoena, civil investigative demand or order issued by a Governmental
Authority; (ii) to the extent not inconsistent with such request, it notifies
the Buyer of the existence, terms and circumstances surrounding such request
and consults with the Buyer on the advisability of taking steps available
under applicable Law to resist or narrow such request; (iii) it exercises its
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain an order or other reliable assurance
that confidential treatment will be accorded to the disclosed Confidential
Information at the Buyer's expense; and (iv) disclosure of such Confidential
Information is required to prevent the Sellers or such Affiliate from being
held in contempt or becoming subject to any other penalty under applicable
Law. Furthermore, the Sellers or their Affiliates may furnish such portion
(and only such portion) of the Confidential Information as the Sellers or such
Affiliate reasonably determines is reasonably necessary or appropriate in
order to narrow or oppose the efforts of a third party with respect to any
subpoena, civil investigative demand or order issued by a Governmental
Authority. For purposes of this Agreement, "Confidential Information" consists
of all information and data relating to the Company Group or the transactions
contemplated hereby (other than data or information that (w) is known or
available through other lawful sources not known by the Sellers to be bound by
a confidentiality agreement with, or other contractual, legal or fiduciary
obligation of confidentiality to, the Company Group; (x) is or becomes
publicly known or generally known in the industry through no fault of the
Sellers or their Representatives; (y) relates to the Tax aspects and
consequences of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or (z) is
released as part of a public announcement of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, as permitted by this Agreement).
Furthermore, the Sellers or their Affiliates may furnish Confidential
Information to its legal, financial and tax advisors as reasonably necessary
for such advisors to perform their duties to such Person, and as reasonably
necessary to enable any such Person enforce their obligations under this
Agreement.

jurisdiction, as agreed to by the Buyer and the Sellers. All filing fees
incurred in connection with regulatory filings made pursuant to this Section

filing or other filing or investigation. Neither the Buyer nor the Sellers
shall independently participate in any meeting or discussion, either in person
or by telephone, with any Governmental Authority in respect of any such
filings, investigation, or other inquiry without giving the other prior notice
of the meeting and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Authority,
the opportunity to attend and/or participate. Subject to applicable Law and
the Confidentiality Agreement, the Buyer and the Sellers will consult and
cooperate with one another in connection with any analyses, appearances,
presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals made or
submitted by or on behalf of any party relating to any HSR Act filing or other
filing or investigation; provided, however, that notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Buyer shall be entitled, after consultation with the Sellers,
to make all strategic and tactical decisions as to the manner in which to
obtain any such consents, including any decision to make any filing or to
enter into any agreement with a Governmental Authority regarding the timing of
any investigation or waiting period relating to the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, each party reserves the right to limit disclosure of any document,
or portion thereof, submitted to any Governmental Authority with respect to
any HSR Act filing or other filing to the Buyer's and the Sellers' respective
outside counsel only.

 

(c)Except as otherwise set forth in this Section 5.9, the Sellers and the
Buyer shall use their reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken,
all appropriate action to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable under applicable Law or otherwise to consummate and make
effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements as promptly as practicable, including to (i) obtain from
Governmental Authorities and other Persons all consents, approvals,
authorizations, qualifications and orders as are necessary for the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements, and (ii) promptly make all necessary filings, and
thereafter make any other required submissions, with respect to this Agreement
required under the HSR Act or any other applicable Law. In furtherance and not
in limitation of the foregoing, the Sellers shall permit the Buyer reasonably
to participate in the defense and settlement of any claim, suit or cause of
action relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, and
the Sellers shall not settle or compromise any such claim, suit or cause of
action without the Buyer's written consent.

   

(d)The Company and its Subsidiaries shall give promptly such notice to third
parties and obtain such third-party consents and estoppel certificates as are
explicitly required by this Agreement. The Buyer shall cooperate with and
assist the Sellers in giving such notices and obtaining such consents and
estoppel certificates; provided, however, that the Buyer shall have no
obligation to give any guarantee or other consideration of any nature in
connection with any such notice, consent or estoppel certificate or consent to
any change in the terms of any agreement or arrangement that the Buyer in its
sole discretion may deem adverse to the interests of the Buyer or the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries. The Sellers shall provide the Buyer with copies of
any consents or estoppel certificates obtained pursuant to this Section
5.9(d).

 

(e)The Buyer on the one hand and the Sellers on the other hand shall each be
responsible for paying any fees and other costs (including, but not limited
to, legal and consultant fees) incurred by that party relating to any third-
party consents, including but not limited to fees and other costs relating to
the preparation of any filings or submissions to any Governmental Authority
(other than filing fees incurred in connection with regulatory filings made
pursuant to this Section 5.9, which shall be paid one-half by the Buyer, on
the one hand, and one-half by the Sellers, on the other hand); provided,
however, that no party shall be required to pay any fees or other payments to
any Governmental Authority in order to obtain any such consent (other than
filing fees incurred in connection with regulatory filings made pursuant to
this Section 5.9, which shall be paid one-half by the Buyer, on the one hand,
and one-half by the Sellers, on the other hand). If any objections are
asserted with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby under any
Competition Law or if any suit or proceeding is instituted or threatened by
Governmental Authority or any private party challenging any of the
transactions contemplated hereby as violating any Competition Law, the Buyer
and the Sellers shall use their reasonable best efforts to promptly resolve
such objections in order to enable the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement to be consummated as promptly as practicable, provided, however,
that notwithstanding the foregoing, each party hereto shall have the right,
but not the obligation, to defend any lawsuits or other legal proceedings,
whether judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under any
Competition Law, including but not limited to seeking to have any stay,
injunction, or temporary restraining order entered by any court or other
Governmental Authority vacated or reversed.

 

(f)The Sellers and the Buyer agree that, in the event that any consent,
approval or authorization necessary or desirable to preserve for the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries any right or benefit under any lease, license,
commitment or other Contract to which the Company or any Subsidiary is a party
is not obtained prior to the Closing, the Sellers will, subsequent to the
Closing, cooperate with the Buyer, the Company or any such Subsidiary in
attempting to obtain such consent, approval or authorization as promptly
thereafter as practicable.

 

(g)From time to time after the Closing, and for no further consideration, each
of the Parties shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, execute,
acknowledge and deliver such assignments, transfers, consents, assumptions and
other documents and instruments and take such other actions as may be
necessary or desirable to consummate and make effective the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements.

   

Section 5.10Termination of Indebtedness. The Sellers shall cause Debt Payoff
Letters to be delivered to the Buyer for all Payoff Indebtedness. The Sellers
shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to deliver all notices and take
all other actions reasonably requested by the Buyer to facilitate the
termination of all Contracts relating to Payoff Indebtedness, the termination
of the commitments provided thereunder, the repayment in full of all
obligations then outstanding thereunder (using funds provided by the Buyer)
and the release of all Encumbrances in connection therewith on or about the
Closing Date; provided, however, that in no event shall this Section 5.10
require any of the Sellers or the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to cause
the termination of any Contracts relating to Payoff Indebtedness other than as
part of the Closing.

 

Section 5.11Public Announcements. The Sellers and the Company shall consult
with the Buyer before issuing, and provide the Buyer the opportunity to
review, comment upon and approve, any press release or other public statement
with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby, and the Sellers shall
not, or shall cause the Company or its Subsidiaries to not, issue any such
press release or make any such public statement prior to receiving such
approval from the Buyer, except as may be required by applicable Law.

 

Section 5.12Delivery of Additional Financial Statements.

 

(a)Between the date hereof and the Closing, the Sellers shall cause to be
delivered to the Buyer within ten (10) days after the end of each calendar
month an unaudited consolidated balance sheet of ARI and its Subsidiaries, and
the related consolidated statements of income, retained earnings, members'
equity and changes in financial position of ARI and its Subsidiaries, together
with all related notes and schedules thereto, in each case, prepared in
accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods
indicated (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto) (such sets of
monthly financial statements, the "Pre-Closing Monthly Financial Statements").
To the extent that an independent auditor or accountant shall be engaged to
prepare such financial statements contemplated pursuant to this Section
5.12(a), the Sellers shall bear the costs thereof.

 

(b)The Sellers shall, at Buyer's expense, cooperate with Ernst and Young or
another auditor selected by the Buyer and consented to by the Sellers (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) and
commence preparation of, and shall cooperate with the Buyer and such auditor
in the preparation of, audited consolidated financial statements of the
Company or ARI, as applicable, and its Subsidiaries for the fiscal years ended
December 31, 2017 and 2018, respectively (collectively, the "Required Audited
Financial Statements"), prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a
consistent basis throughout the periods indicated (except as may be indicated
in the notes thereto) and any other document or materials (including consents
from such auditor) required to satisfy any public filing requirements of the
Buyer arising out of or otherwise relating to the consummation of the
transactions contemplated in this Agreement. In the event that the Required
Audited Financial Statements have not been completed on or before Closing, the
Sellers shall continue to provide such cooperation as reasonably required by
the Buyer or its auditors in order to promptly complete the Required Audited
Financial Statements.

 

Section 5.13Data Room Contents. The Buyer and the Sellers shall cooperate to
ensure that each of the Buyer and the Sellers receives a copy, on one or more
DVDs, of the true, correct and complete contents of the Data Room as of the
Closing Date, as promptly as practicable after the Closing Date.

   

 

Section 5.14Record Retention. From and after the Closing until the seventh
anniversary of the Closing, each party shall provide, or cause to be provided,
to each other, as soon as reasonably practicable after written request
therefor and at the requesting party's sole expense, reasonable access
(including using commercially reasonable efforts to give access to the
Sellers' auditors, accountants and other advisors reasonably requested by each
party), during normal business hours, to the other party's Representatives and
to any books, records, files, documents, instruments, accounts,
correspondence, writings, evidences of title and other papers of the Company
Group (the "Books and Records") in the possession or under the control of the
other Party with respect to periods prior to the Closing that the requesting
Party reasonably needs (i) to comply with reporting, disclosure, filing,
auditing or other requirements imposed on the requesting party (including
under applicable securities laws) by a Governmental Authority having
jurisdiction over the requesting party in connection with the transactions
contemplated herein, (ii) for use in any other judicial, regulatory,
administrative or other proceeding or in order to satisfy audit, accounting,
claims, regulatory, litigation or other similar requirements arising from the
transactions contemplated in this Agreement, or (iii) to comply with its
obligations under this Agreement; provided, however, that no party shall be
required under this provision to provide access to or disclose information if
the parties are in a dispute with each other regarding matters related to such
information request or where such access or disclosure would violate any Law,
protective order or confidentiality agreement, or waive any attorney-client,
attorney work product or other similar privilege, and, in the event such
provision of information could reasonably be expected to violate any Law,
protective order or confidentiality agreement or waive any attorney-client,
attorney work product or other similar privilege, the parties shall take
commercially reasonable measures to permit the compliance with such
obligations in a manner that avoids any such harm or consequence, to the
extent practicable. Each Party shall retain the Books and Records relating to
the Business in such party's respective possession or control for the greater
of (i) seven years following the Closing Date or (ii) such period of time as
may be required by applicable Law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any party
may destroy or otherwise dispose of any Books and Records not in accordance
with its retention policy, provided, that prior to such destruction or
disposal (i) such party shall provide no less than 30 days' prior written
notice to the other party of any such proposed destruction or disposal (which
notice shall specify in detail which of the Books and Records is proposed to
be so destroyed or disposed of), and (ii) if a recipient of such notice shall
request in writing prior to the scheduled date for such destruction or
disposal that any of the information proposed to be destroyed or disposed of
be delivered to such recipient, such party proposing the destruction or
disposal shall, as promptly as practicable, arrange for the delivery of such
of the Books and Records as was requested by the recipient (it being
understood that all reasonable out-of-pocket costs associated with the
delivery of the requested Books and Records shall be paid by such recipient).

   

 

Section 5.15Compensation and Benefits Matters.

 

(a)280G Vote. Before the Closing Date and to the extent a determination is
reasonably made by the Company, Blocker or their Affiliates that any payment
obligation of the Sellers, the Company, Blocker or an Affiliate thereof could
constitute "parachute payments" pursuant to Section 280G of the Code, the
Sellers shall solicit the requisite vote in accordance with Sections
280G(b)(5)(A)(ii) and 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and the applicable regulations
promulgated thereunder (the "280G Vote") with respect to any payments in
respect of the change in control that otherwise would not be deductible
pursuant to Section 280G of the Code as a result of or in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, if
any "disqualified individual" (within the meaning of Section 280G(c) of the
Code) with respect to the Company, Blocker or their Affiliates has the right
to receive payments that could constitute "parachute payments" (within the
meaning of Section 280G(b)(2)(A) of the Code), the Sellers or the Company
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to request from each such Person a
waiver of the right to a portion of the aggregate amount of such payments that
would be deemed to constitute "parachute payments" (within the meaning of
Section 280G of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder) prior to
soliciting the 280G Vote described in the immediately preceding sentence. The
Sellers shall provide, or cause to be provided, to the Buyer reasonable
opportunity to review a draft of any soliciting materials, waivers or other
documents relating to the 280G Vote, and the Sellers shall incorporate in good
faith any reasonable comments that are made by the Buyer to such documents.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that any contract, agreement, or
plan is entered into by Buyer, the surviving corporation or any of their
Affiliates and a disqualified individual in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement before the Closing Date (the "Buyer
Arrangements"), the Buyer shall provide all information reasonably necessary
to allow the Sellers and the Company to determine whether any payments made or
to be made or benefits granted or to be granted pursuant to the Buyer
Arrangements at least seven (7) days before the Closing Date and shall
cooperate with the Sellers and the Company in good faith in order to calculate
or determine the value (for the purposes of Section 280G of the Code) of any
payments or benefits granted or contemplated therein provided that, in any
event, the Company's failure to include the Buyer Arrangements in the
stockholder voting materials described herein, for any reason, will not result
in a breach of the covenants set forth in this Section 5.15(a). In no event
shall the Sellers or the Company be deemed in breach of this Section 5.15(a)
if any disqualified individual refuses to execute a waiver or the stockholder
vote is not obtained.

 

(b)Termination of Qualified Plans. The Sellers shall (i) have caused the
Company and each Subsidiary that sponsors a Plan intended to be a Qualified
Plan to adopt a board consent to terminate such Qualified Plan effective no
later than the day prior to the Closing Date. Buyer will take such actions as
are necessary to allow employees of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries
to participate in a 401(k) plan sponsored by Buyer or its Affiliates as soon
as practicable following the Closing and shall recognize such employees'
service with the Company and each of its Subsidiaries prior to the Closing for
purposes of eligibility and vesting under such 401(k) plan.

   

(c)WARN Matters. Prior to the Closing Date, the Sellers shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to preserve the services of the present
officers and employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries. For periods on
and after the Closing Date, to the extent actions of the Buyer or any of its
Affiliates result in losses or obligations for the Sellers or any of their
Affiliates pursuant to the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act
or the regulations promulgated thereunder or any similar state or local Law,
the Buyer shall indemnify and hold the Sellers and their Affiliates harmless
for such losses and obligations, provided that the Sellers shall cooperate in
good faith with Buyer to determine whether any notification may be required
thereunder and in the provision of such notice or payment in lieu thereof
(which notification shall be so provided upon the reasonable direction of
Buyer to do so).

 

(d)Indemnification related to Equity-Based Awards. The Sellers shall pay,
shall be liable for and shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Buyer and
its Affiliates for all losses by such Person incurred resulting or arising
from claims or disputes related to the payment of any and all amounts due and
owing under the Plans set forth on Schedule 5.15(d) of the Disclosure
Schedules; provided, however, that at any time the Sellers' Representative may
elect to assume the defense of such claims or disputes and may negotiate and
consent to the entry of any judgement or enter into any settlement with
respect to such claims or disputes ; provided further, however, that any such
assumption and any such judgement or settlement does not materially adversely
affect any Person then being indemnified hereunder.

 

Section 5.16Non-Solicitation Covenants.

 

(a)The Sellers and their Affiliates (excluding their respective
investee/portfolio companies) (collectively, the "Restricted Parties," and
each a "Restricted Party") agrees that for a period of two years commencing on
the Closing Date, such Restricted Party shall not, and shall cause its
Affiliates and Subsidiaries not to, whether as a principal, agent, executive,
employee, consultant, volunteer or otherwise, directly or indirectly, without
the express written approval of the Buyer, hire or attempt to hire any
Business Employee listed on Schedule 5.16(a) of the Disclosure Schedules (the
"Restricted Business Employees") or solicit, induce, recruit or encourage (or
attempt to solicit, induce, recruit or encourage) any Restricted Business
Employee to leave or terminate their employment with the Company, Buyer or any
of their respective Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding the foregoing, it shall not
be a breach of this paragraph for a Restricted Party to (x) solicit Restricted
Business Employees who respond to general advertisements in newspapers and/or
other media of general circulation (including advertisements posted on the
Internet), job fairs or other similar general solicitation, so long as they
are not specifically directed towards such Restricted Business Employees, or
(y) solicit or hire any Restricted Business Employee whose employment with the
Buyer and all of its Subsidiaries has been terminated for at least twelve (12)
months.

 

(b)Each Restricted Party expressly represents and warrants to the Buyer that
it is incurring the obligations of the covenants in this Section 5.16 as an
inducement to the Buyer to enter into this Agreement and as an essential
element of the Buyer's agreement to acquire the Company and pay the Purchase
Price for the Equity Interests, and the Buyer would not have done so but for
the agreement by each Restricted Party to comply with the terms and provisions
hereof.

 

(c)Each Restricted Party understands and acknowledges that the Buyer has made
substantial investments to acquire the Equity Interests, including business
interests, goodwill and confidential information. Each Restricted Party agrees
that such investments are worthy of protection, and that the Buyer's need for
the protection afforded by this Section 5.16 is greater than any hardship the
Restricted Parties might experience by complying with its terms.

   

(d)The Buyer and Restricted Parties agree that the limitations as to time,
geographic area and scope of activity to be restrained, as applicable,
contained in this Agreement are fair and reasonable and are not greater than
necessary to protect the confidential information and/or the goodwill or other
legitimate business interests of the Buyer. However, if at any time any of the
provisions of this Section 5.16 shall be determined to be invalid or
unenforceable by reason of being vague or unreasonable as to duration, area,
scope of activity or otherwise, then this Section 5.16 shall be considered
divisible (with the other provisions to remain in full force and effect) and
the invalid or unenforceable provisions shall become and be deemed to be
immediately amended to include only such time, area, scope of activity and
other restrictions, as shall be determined to be reasonable and enforceable by
the court or other body having jurisdiction over the matter, and the Sellers
expressly agree that this Agreement, as so amended, shall be valid and binding
as though any invalid or unenforceable provision had not been included herein.

 

Section 5.17Director and Officer Indemnification.

 

(a)The Company and the Buyer shall provide or maintain in effect for six years
from and after the Closing Date, through the purchase (at the Buyer's expense)
of "run-off" coverage or otherwise (the "Tail Policy"), directors' and
officers' insurance covering those individuals who are covered by the
directors' and officers' insurance policy or policies provided for directors
and officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the date hereof
(collectively, the "Existing Policy"), which insurance policies shall provide
coverage for events, acts and omissions arising, in whole or in part, from
facts or circumstances which occurred prior to the Closing on terms comparable
in all material respects to the Existing Policy and such coverage shall
contain minimum aggregate limits of liability for directors' and officers'
insurance coverage for directors and officers of the Company and its
Subsidiaries in amounts at least equal to that of the Existing Policy and with
deductibles no larger than those customary for such type of insurance
coverage; provided, however, that if such "run-off" or other coverage is not
available at a cost less than 150% of the annual premiums paid as of the date
hereof under the Existing Policy (the "Insurance Cap"), then the Company and
the Buyer shall be required to obtain as much coverage as is possible under
substantially similar policies for aggregate annual premiums equal to the
Insurance Cap. The Buyer covenants and agrees to take commercially reasonable
steps to obtain the Tail Policy prior to or at Closing.

 

(b)For a period of six years after the Closing Date, the Company shall honor
and cause the Company Group to honor all rights to indemnification,
advancement of expenses, elimination of liability and exculpation from
liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Closing Date
(including the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) now existing in
favor of the directors and officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries as and
to the extent provided in the governing documents of the Company as in effect
on the date hereof and set forth in Schedule 5.17(b), and shall not amend,
repeal or otherwise modify such governing documents in any manner that would
adversely affect any such rights thereunder without the written consent of the
person benefited thereby, in each case unless and to the extent otherwise
provided by applicable law.

 

(c)All references in this Section 5.17 to "directors" shall apply equally to
managers of any limited liability company.

   

Section 5.18Indemnity Policy. The Buyer shall obtain a policy providing
representations and warranties insurance coverage (the "Indemnity Policy")
with respect to Losses incurred, sustained or suffered by any Buyer
Indemnified Party as a result of, arising out of or relating to a breach of
any representation or warranty by the Sellers, Blocker, the Company or its
Subsidiaries under this Agreement or as a result of Pre-Closing Taxes. The
aggregate amount of the premium with respect to such Indemnity Policy (plus
applicable surplus lines tax), together with the related underwriting fees,
due diligence fees, net brokerage fees and any other related fees of Euclid
Transactional, LLC will, in the aggregate, be paid one-half by the Buyer and
one-half by the Sellers prior to Closing. The foregoing amount paid by the
Sellers with respect to the Indemnity Policy shall be a Transaction Expense
and may, at the direction of Sellers, be deducted from the Estimated Purchase
Price otherwise payable to Sellers at Closing. The Buyer and the Seller have
further agreed that the Buyer shall be responsible for Losses within the
retention amount under the Indemnity Policy up to a maximum of 1% of the
Purchase Price, with the Seller to be responsible for any Losses in excess of
1% of the Purchase Price within the retention amount under the Indemnity
Policy. To the extent that the Buyer intends after the Closing to make or
consider making a claim under the Indemnity Policy and deems the assistance
and cooperation of the Sellers reasonably necessary or helpful in connection
therewith, the Buyer shall so notify the Sellers and the Sellers shall use all
reasonable efforts to provide such assistance and cooperation.

 

Section 5.19Sellers' Representative. The Sellers' Representative is hereby
approved to serve as the representative of the Sellers with respect to the
matters expressly set forth in this Agreement to be performed by the Sellers'
Representative. Each of the Sellers hereby irrevocably appoints the Sellers'
Representative as the agent, proxy and attorney in fact for such Seller for
all purposes of this Agreement, including full power and authority on such
Seller's behalf (a) to consummate the transactions contemplated herein, (b) to
pay expenses (whether incurred on or after the date hereof) incurred in
connection with the negotiation and performance of this Agreement, (c) to
disburse any funds received hereunder to such Seller and each other Seller,
(d) to execute and deliver any certificates representing the Company Group's
equity interests and execution of such further instruments as the Buyer shall
reasonably request, (e) to execute and deliver on behalf of such Seller any
amendment or waiver hereto, (f) to take all other actions to be taken by or on
behalf of such Seller in connection herewith and (g) to do each and every act
and exercise any and all rights which such Seller is, or Sellers collectively
are, permitted or required to do or exercise under this Agreement. Each of
the Sellers shall agree to reimburse the Sellers' Representative for any fees
and expenses incurred by the Sellers' Representative in its capacity as agent,
proxy or attorney in fact of the Sellers in connection with this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated herein. At the Closing, the Buyer shall deliver
to the Sellers' Representative an amount equal to $250,000 (the "Sellers'
Representative Expense Fund") to be held in trust to cover and reimburse the
fees and expenses incurred by the Sellers' Representative for its obligations
in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated herein.
Any balance of the Sellers' Representative Expense Fund not incurred for such
purposes shall be returned to the Sellers on a pro rata basis as soon as
reasonably practicable after payment of the Sellers' Representative the amount
due to it from the Sellers' Representative Expense Fund.

 

Section 5.20Contact with Customers and Suppliers. Until the Closing Date,
Buyer shall not, and shall cause its representatives not to, contact or
communicate with the employees (other than the employees identified on the
"Key Employees Schedule"), customers, potential customers, suppliers,
distributors or licensors of the Company or any of the Company's Subsidiaries,
or any other Persons having a business relationship with the Company or any of
the Company's Subsidiaries, concerning the transactions contemplated hereby

cause their Subsidiaries to, begin the process of transferring all listed
domain names that are registered with names other than or in addition to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to either the Company or Buyer and shall
use commercially reasonably efforts to complete such transfers prior to the
Closing Date. Sellers and their Subsidiaries shall execute any additional
documents required to effect such a transfer and shall provide the Buyer with
the appropriate log-in credentials, passwords, documents and other information
required to transfer the domain names to the Company or Buyer.

 

Section 5.22Termination Fee . Prior to the Closing, at all times, Buyer shall
keep, and shall have readily available, on its balance sheet an amount in cash
and cash equivalents that is sufficient to pay the Termination Fee.

 

ARTICLE VI

Section 6.1Apportionment. For purposes of this Agreement, with respect to any
Straddle Period, the portion of any Tax that is attributable to the part of
such Straddle Period that ends on the Closing Date shall be (i) in the case of
any property Tax or other ad valorem Taxes, the total amount of such Tax for
the full Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is
the number of days from the beginning of such Straddle Period to and including
the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the total number of days in
such full Straddle Period, and (ii) in the case of any other Taxes, the Tax

account designated in writing by the Sellers.

   

(b)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement and subject to
Section 9.3(e), in the event the Sellers validly terminate this Agreement
pursuant to Section 9.1(e), then the Sellers' sole and exclusive remedy
against the Buyer in respect of this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreement and

collect the Termination Fee.

 

(c)For the avoidance of doubt, the maximum aggregate liability of the Buyer
under this Agreement in the event the Sellers validly terminate this Agreement
pursuant to Section 9.1(e) shall not exceed under any circumstances the amount

Sellers seek or be entitled to, directly or indirectly, any monetary recovery
or award or any monetary damages of any kind pursuant to this Agreement and

the full Termination Fee, together with the reimbursement of applicable
expenses pursuant to this Section 9.3, on more than one occasion and (ii) any
payment of the Termination Fee described in this Section 9.3 is not a penalty
but is liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate the
Sellers in the circumstances in which such fees are payable for the efforts
and resources expended and the opportunities foregone while negotiating this
Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, which amount
would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision.

 

(e)In the event of any dispute over whether the Sellers are entitled to be
paid the Termination Fee pursuant to this Section 9.3 that results in a
lawsuit, the party prevailing in such lawsuit shall be entitled to be
reimbursed for the reasonable costs and expenses that such party incurs in
connection with such lawsuit (including but not limited to attorney fees,
accountant fees, expert fees and other third party advisory fees).

 

(f)While the Company and the Sellers' Representative may pursue both a grant
of specific performance in accordance with Section 10.11 and the payment of
the Termination Fee, under no circumstances shall the Company or the Sellers'
Representative be permitted or entitled to receive both a grant of specific
performance that results in the Closing occurring and the Termination Fee.

hereto each hereby acknowledge that this Agreement embodies the justifiable
expectations of sophisticated parties derived from arm's-length negotiations;

transaction. The sole and exclusive remedies for any breach of the terms and
provisions of this Agreement (including any representations and warranties set
forth herein, made in connection herewith or as an inducement to enter into
this Agreement) or any claim or cause of action otherwise arising out of or
related to the sale and purchase of the Company Group shall be those remedies
available at law or in equity for breach of contract only (as such contractual
remedies have been further limited or excluded pursuant to the express terms
of this Agreement); and the parties hereto hereby agree that no party hereto
shall have any remedies or cause of action (whether in contract or in tort)
for any statements, communications, disclosures, failures to disclose,
representations or warranties not set forth in this Agreement.

action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, (a) any claim that it is not personally

interpreted in such a manner as to be effective and valid under applicable
Law. In case any one or more of the provisions contained herein shall, for any
reason, be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such
provision or provisions shall be ineffective to the extent, but only to the
extent, of such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability, and the remainder

or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in
any manner materially adverse to any party hereto. Upon such a determination,

has been represented by legal counsel (or has had the opportunity to be
represented by legal counsel, and decided not to engage legal counsel) in

Agreement. Accordingly, any rule of law or any legal decision that would

the drafting party has no application and is expressly waived.

   

 

Section 10.19No Recourse to Financing Sources. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in this Agreement, each of Blocker and the Sellers, on
behalf of themselves and their Subsidiaries, including the Company and its
Subsidiaries, hereby:

 

(a)agrees that it will not bring or support any person, or permit any of its
Affiliates or their respective Representatives (in each case, other than
Buyer) to bring or support any person, in any Action, whether in law or in
equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against the Financing
Sources, the Investors, and each of their respective Affiliates and
Representatives, and their respective successors and assigns (in each case,
other than Buyer) (the "Financing Source Related Parties") in any way relating
to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the Financing
or the performance thereof or the financings contemplated thereby, in any
forum other than the federal and New York State courts located in the Borough
of Manhattan within the City of New York, so long as such forum is and remains
available, and any appellate court thereof and each Party irrevocably submits
itself and its property with respect to any such Action to the exclusive
jurisdiction of such court;

 

(b)agrees that, except to the extent relating to the interpretation of any of
the provisions of this Agreement (including any provision of any definitive
agreement governing any Financing that expressly specifies that the
interpretation of such provision shall be governed by, and construed in
accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware), all Actions (whether at
law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) against any of the
Financing Source Related Parties in any way relating to the Financing or the
performance thereof or the financings contemplated thereby, shall be
exclusively governed by, and construed in accordance with, the internal laws
of the State of New York, without giving effect to principles or rules of
conflict of laws to the extent such principles or rules would require or
permit the application of laws of another jurisdiction;

 

(c)HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A
TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION (WHETHER AT LAW OR IN EQUITY, IN
CONTRACT, IN TORT OR OTHERWISE) DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING IN ANY WAY TO THE FINANCING OR THE PERFORMANCE THEREOF OR THE
FINANCING CONTEMPLATED THEREBY;

 

(d)agrees that service of process upon the Company, its Subsidiaries, Blocker
and the Sellers in any such Action or proceeding shall be effective if notice

(e)irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent that it may effectively do so,
the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such Action in any
such court;

 

(f)agrees that none of the Financing Source Related Parties will have any
liability to the Company, Blocker, the Sellers or any of their respective
Affiliates, and their respective Representatives, and their respective
successors and assigns (in each case, other than Buyer) relating to or arising
out of this Agreement, the Financing or any of the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby or the performance of any services thereunder, whether in
law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise; and

beneficiaries of, and may enforce, any of the provisions in this Agreement
reflecting the foregoing agreements in this Section 10.19 and such provisions

Source Related Parties without the prior written consent of the Financing
Sources and the Investors (as applicable).

 

Section 10.20Reseller Partner Matters. The Sellers have obtained and
delivered to the Buyer the written consent of the Reseller Partner dated
January 9, 2019 (the "Consent") to AppRiver's intended assignment to the Buyer
of the Reseller Agreement. The Sellers and Buyer acknowledge and agree that,
pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, a change-in-
control with respect to AppRiver (as contemplated by the Reseller Agreement)
will occur whereby the Buyer will indirectly acquire 100% of the equity
interests of AppRiver, rather than a direct assignment of the Reseller
Agreement from AppRiver to the Buyer. Regardless, the Sellers and the Buyer
shall cooperate in good faith with one another and use their respective
commercially reasonable efforts to (a) confirm with the Reseller Partner that
the Consent is intended to constitute the Reseller Partner's consent to such
change-in-control, and (b) supply the Reseller Partner with a copy of this
Agreement and explain to the Reseller Partner the change-in-control of
AppRiver that will occur thereunder. Until the Closing of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, the Sellers will cause AppRiver to continue to
fulfill its obligations under the Reseller Agreement. From and after the
Closing of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Buyer will
cause AppRiver to continue to fulfill its obligations under the Reseller
Agreement.

 

Section 10.21Attorney-Client Privilege and Conflict Waiver. Kirkland and Ellis
LLP has represented the Company, its Subsidiaries, Blocker, certain of the
Sellers and the Sellers' Representative. All of the parties recognize the
commonality of interest that exists and will continue to exist until Closing,
and the parties agree that such commonality of interest should continue to be
recognized after the Closing. Specifically, the parties agree that (a) the
Buyer shall not, and shall not cause any member of the Company Group to, seek
to have Kirkland and Ellis LLP disqualified from representing the Sellers'
Representative, the Sellers and their respective Affiliates, and each of the
foregoing's respective officers, directors, employees, shareholders,
equityholders, agents and representatives (collectively, the "Seller Parties")
in connection with any dispute that may arise between the Sellers'
Representative, the Seller Parties or their respective Affiliates and the
Buyer, Blocker or the Company in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby and (b) in connection with any such dispute
that may arise between the Sellers' Representative, the Seller Parties or
their respective Affiliates and the Buyer, Blocker or the Company, the
Sellers' Representative, the Seller Parties or their respective Affiliates
involved in such dispute (and not the Buyer or the Company) will have the
right to decide whether or not to waive the attorney-client privilege that may
apply to any communications between the Company, any of its Subsidiaries and
Kirkland and Ellis LLP that occurred before the Closing. 

 

Section 10.22Payments by Sellers. Any amounts contemplated under this
Agreement to made by the Sellers in the aggregate shall be paid severally on a
pro rata basis in accordance with the Distribution Waterfall.

KBCM, the "KeyBank Parties"; together with SunTrust, collectively, the
"Commitment Parties", "we" and "us"), that Zix Corporation (the "Borrower" or
"you") intends to acquire (the "Acquisition"), directly or indirectly, all of
the outstanding equity interests of AppRiver, LLC, a Florida limited liability
company (together with its subsidiaries, collectively, the "Target"). You
have further advised us that, in connection with the foregoing, you and the
Target intend to consummate the other Transactions described in the
Transaction Description attached hereto as Exhibit A (the "Transaction
Description"). Capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the
meanings assigned to them in the Transaction Description, the Summary of
Principal Terms and Conditions attached hereto as Exhibit B (the "Term Sheet")
or the Summary of Additional Conditions attached hereto as Exhibit C. This
commitment letter, the Transaction Description, the Term Sheet and the Summary
of Additional Conditions attached hereto as Exhibit C are referred to herein,

1.

 |  

Commitments. 

---|---|--- 

 

In connection with the Transactions, (a) SunTrust Bank is pleased to advise
you of its commitment to provide 70.0% of the aggregate principal amount of
each of the Credit Facilities (and hereby commits to provide 70.0% of the
entire amount of any increase or differing amounts required as a result of the
exercise of the original issue discount and/or upfront fee flex provisions of
the fee letter dated the date hereof (the "Fee Letter") by us and acknowledged
by you) and (b) KeyBank is pleased to advise you of its commitment to provide
30.0% of the aggregate principal amount of each of the Credit Facilities

   

(and hereby commits to provide 30.0% of the entire amount of any increase or
differing amounts required as a result of the exercise of the original issue
discount and/or upfront fee flex provisions of the Fee Letter) on the terms
set forth herein and subject only to the satisfaction of the limited
conditions expressly set forth in the section entitled "Conditions to Initial
Borrowing" in Exhibit B hereto (limited on the Closing Date (as defined below)
as indicated therein). 

 

SunTrust Bank and KeyBank are sometimes referred to herein, collectively, as
the "Initial Lenders" and, each, as an "Initial Lender." The Initial Lenders
shall be severally liable in respect of their respective commitments to the
Credit Facilities, on a several, and not joint, basis with the other Initial
Lender, and no Initial Lender shall be responsible for the commitment of the
other Initial Lender.

 

2.Titles and Roles.

 

It is agreed that (i) each of STRH and KBCM will act as a joint lead arranger
and joint bookrunner for each of the Credit Facilities (each a "Lead Arranger"
and, collectively, the "Lead Arrangers") and (ii) SunTrust Bank will act as
sole administrative agent and sole collateral agent (in such capacity, the
"Administrative Agent") for the Credit Facilities. It is further agreed that
in any Information Materials (as defined below) and all other offering or
marketing materials in respect of the Credit Facilities, STRH shall have "left
side" designation and shall appear on the top left and shall hold the leading
role and responsibility customarily associated with such "top left" placement,
and KBCM shall have placement immediately to the right of STRH. You agree
that no other agents, co-agents, arrangers or bookrunners will be appointed,
no other titles will be awarded and no compensation (other than compensation
expressly contemplated by this Commitment Letter and the Fee Letter) will be
paid to any Lender (as defined below) in order to obtain its commitment to
participate in the Credit Facilities unless you and we shall so agree.

 

3.Syndication.

 

The Lead Arrangers reserve the right, prior to or after the Closing Date, to
syndicate all or a portion of the Initial Lenders' respective commitments
hereunder to a group of banks, financial institutions and other institutional
lenders and investors identified by the Lead Arrangers in consultation with
you and reasonably acceptable to the Lead Arrangers and you (your consent not
to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), including, without limitation, any
relationship lenders designated by you and reasonably acceptable to the Lead
Arrangers (such banks, financial institutions and other institutional lenders
and investors, together with the Initial Lenders, the "Lenders"); provided
that (a) we agree not to syndicate, assign or participate out our commitments
to (i) certain banks, financial institutions, other institutional lenders and
other investors, in each case, identified to us by you or True Wind Capital
Management, LLC and its controlled affiliates (collectively, the "Sponsor") in
writing prior to the date hereof, (ii) competitors of the Borrower, the Target
and their respective subsidiaries specified to us (or, if after the Closing
Date, to the Administrative Agent) by you or the Sponsor in writing from time
to time, or (iii) in the case of preceding clauses (i) and (ii), any of their
affiliates that are (A) identified by you or the Sponsor in writing to us (or,
if after the Closing Date, to the Administrative Agent) from time to time or
(B) clearly identifiable on the basis of such affiliates' name (provided that
neither the Lead Arrangers nor the Administrative Agent shall have any
liability with respect to any assignment or participation to any such
affiliate included in the definition of Disqualified Lenders solely on account
of this clause (iii)(B)) (the persons described in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii)
above, collectively, "Disqualified Lenders"), and no Disqualified Lenders may
become Lenders or otherwise participate in the Credit

   

Facilities, and (b) notwithstanding the Lead Arrangers' right to syndicate the
Credit Facilities and receive commitments with respect thereto, (i) Initial
Lenders shall not be relieved, released or novated from their obligations
hereunder (including, subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth
herein, its obligation to fund the Credit Facilities on the date of the
consummation of the Acquisition with the proceeds of the initial funding under
the Credit Facilities (the date of such funding, the "Closing Date")) in
connection with any syndication, assignment or participation of the Credit
Facilities, including its commitments in respect thereof, until after the
initial funding of the Credit Facilities on the Closing Date has occurred,
(ii) no assignment or novation by any Initial Lender shall become effective as
between you and such Initial Lender with respect to all or any portion of such
Initial Lender's commitments in respect of the Credit Facilities until after
the initial funding of the Credit Facilities on the Closing Date has occurred
and (iii) unless you otherwise agree in writing, Initial Lenders shall retain
exclusive control over all rights and obligations with respect to its
commitments in respect of the Credit Facilities, including all rights with
respect to consents, modifications, supplements, waivers and amendments, until
after the initial funding on the Credit Facilities on the Closing Date has
occurred; provided that, to the extent that a person is designated or becomes
a Disqualified Lender pursuant to clause (a) above after the date of this
Commitment Letter, such event shall not apply retroactively to disqualify any
parties that have previously acquired an assignment or participation interest
in a Credit Facility, to the extent of the loan or commitment subject to such
assignment or participation interest.

 

It is understood that the Initial Lenders' respective commitments hereunder
are not conditioned upon the syndication of, or receipt of commitments in
respect of, the Credit Facilities and in no event shall the commencement or
successful completion of syndication of the Credit Facilities constitute a
condition to the availability of the Credit Facilities on the Closing Date.
The Lead Arrangers may commence syndication efforts promptly upon your
acceptance of this Commitment Letter and as part of its syndication efforts,
it is the Lead Arrangers' intent to have Lenders commit to the Credit
Facilities prior to the Closing Date (subject to the limitations set forth in
the preceding paragraph). Until the earlier of (i) the date upon which a
Successful Syndication (as defined in the Fee Letter referred to below) is
achieved and (ii) the date that is sixty (60) days after the Closing Date
(such earlier date, the "Syndication Date"), you agree to use commercially
reasonably efforts to assist the Lead Arrangers in seeking to complete a
timely syndication that is reasonably satisfactory to us and you. Such
assistance shall include, without limitation, (a) your using commercially
reasonable efforts to ensure that any syndication efforts benefit from your
existing lending and investment banking relationships and the existing lending
and investment banking relationships of the Sponsor and to the extent
practical and appropriate (and not in contravention of the Acquisition
Agreement), the Target's existing lending and investment banking
relationships, (b) direct contact between appropriate members of senior
management, certain representatives and non-legal advisors of you and the
Sponsor, on the one hand, and the proposed Lenders, on the other hand (and, to
the extent practical and appropriate and in all instances not in contravention
of the Acquisition Agreement, your using commercially reasonable effects to
arrange such contact between senior management of the Target, on the one hand,
and the proposed Lenders, on the other hand), in all such cases with
reasonable advance notice and at times and locations mutually agreed upon, (c)
your and the Sponsor's assistance (including the use of commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the Target to assist to the extent practical and
appropriate and in all instances not in contravention of the Acquisition
Agreement) in the preparation of the Information Materials, (d) the hosting,
with the Lead Arrangers, of one (or more, if reasonably requested by the
Administrative Agent) in-person meeting of prospective Lenders at a time and
location to be mutually agreed upon (and, to the extent reasonably necessary
as determined by the Lead Arrangers, one or more conference calls or one-on-
one meetings with prospective Lenders at times to be

   

mutually agreed upon and upon reasonable advance notice) (and your using
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the officers of the Borrower and the
Target to be available for such meetings to the extent practical and
appropriate and in all instances not in contravention of the Acquisition
Agreement), (e) your providing customary projections of consolidated financial
statements of the Borrower and its subsidiaries (including the Target) for
each year commencing with the fiscal year in which the Closing Date occurs
through the term of the Credit Facilities (collectively, the "Projections")
(it being acknowledged and agreed by the Lead Arrangers that the Projections
were delivered prior to the date hereof), and (f) at any time prior to the
later of the Closing Date and the Syndication Date, your ensuring (and to the
extent practical and appropriate and in all instances not in contravention of
the Acquisition Agreement, using your commercially reasonable efforts to cause
the Target to ensure) that there are no competing issues, offerings,
placements or arrangements of debt securities or commercial bank or other
credit facilities by or on behalf of you, the Sponsor, the Target or any of
your subsidiaries being offered, placed or arranged with respect to the
Borrower, the Guarantors, and the Target without the consent of the Lead
Arrangers (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned), if such issuance, offering, placement or arrangement would
materially impair the primary syndication of the Credit Facilities (it being
understood and agreed that your, the Sponsor's, the Target's, and your and
their subsidiaries' deferred purchase price obligations, ordinary course
working capital facilities and ordinary course capital lease, purchase money,
equipment financing and letters of credit, and any other obligations or
indebtedness existing or permitted to be incurred by the Target and its
subsidiaries under the Acquisition Agreement (and extensions, refinancings and
renewals of any such indebtedness to the extent permitted to be incurred under
the Acquisition Agreement), in each case, will not be deemed to materially
impair the primary syndication of the Credit Facilities). Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Commitment Letter or the Fee Letter
or any other letter agreement or undertaking concerning the financing of the
Transactions to the contrary, your obligations to assist in syndication
efforts as provided herein shall not constitute a condition to the commitments
hereunder or the funding of the Credit Facilities on the Closing Date. We
acknowledge that neither the Target nor any of its subsidiaries or affiliates
is obligated to assist with any syndication of the Credit Facilities and their
obligations to you are limited to the cooperation covenant in the Acquisition
Agreement and your obligation to use commercially reasonable efforts will not
require you to take any action contrary to, or to terminate, the Acquisition
Agreement.

 

The Lead Arrangers, in their capacities as such, will manage, in consultation
with you, all aspects of any syndication of the Credit Facilities, including
decisions as to the selection of institutions (excluding Disqualified Lenders)
reasonably acceptable to you (your consent not to be unreasonably withheld or
delayed) to be approached and when they will be approached, when their
commitments will be accepted, which institutions will participate (subject to
your consent rights set forth in the second preceding paragraph and excluding
Disqualified Lenders), the allocation of the commitments among the Lenders
(subject to your prior consent (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed))
and the amount and distribution of fees among the Lenders. For the avoidance
of doubt, you will not be required to provide any information to the extent
that the provision thereof would violate any law, rule or regulation, or any
obligation of confidentiality binding upon, or waive any attorney-client
privilege of, you, the Target or your or its respective affiliates (provided,
in the event that you do not provide information in reliance on the exclusions
in this sentence, you shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide
written notice to the Lead Arrangers promptly upon obtaining knowledge that
such information is being withheld, and you shall use your commercially
reasonable efforts to communicate, to the extent permitted, the applicable
information in a way that would not violate such restrictions).
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the only financial statements
that shall be required to be provided to the Commitment Parties in connection

   

with the syndication of the Credit Facilities shall be those required to be
delivered pursuant to paragraphs 9 and 10 of Exhibit C attached hereto.

 

You hereby acknowledge that (a) the Lead Arrangers will make available
Information (as defined below), Projections and other offering and marketing
materials and presentations, including confidential information memoranda, to
be used in connection with the syndication of the Credit Facilities in a form
customarily delivered in connection with senior secured bank financings (the
"Information Memorandum" and, together with such other customary marketing
materials to be used in connection with the syndications, the "Information
Materials") to the proposed syndicate of Lenders by posting the Information
Materials on Intralinks, Debt X, SyndTrak Online or by similar electronic
means, in each case, subject to a market standard "click through" or similar
confidentiality agreement reasonably approved by you, and (b) certain of the
Lenders may be "public side" Lenders (i.e., Lenders that wish to receive only
information that (i) is publicly available or (ii) is not material with
respect to you, the Target or your or its respective subsidiaries and
securities for purposes of United States federal securities laws
(collectively, the "Public Side Information"; any information that is not
Public Side Information, "Private Side Information") and who may be engaged in
investment and other market related activities with respect to you, the Target
or your or its respective subsidiaries or securities) (each, a "Public Sider"
and each Lender that is not a Public Sider, a "Private Sider").

 

At the reasonable request of the Lead Arrangers, you agree to assist (and to
use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Sponsor and the Target to
assist to the extent practical and appropriate and in all instances not in
contravention of the Acquisition Agreement) us in preparing an additional
version of the Information Memorandum to be used in connection with the
syndication of the Credit Facilities that consists solely of Public Side
Information with respect to you, the Target or any of your or its respective
subsidiaries or any of your or their respective securities for the purpose of
United States federal and state securities laws to be used by Public Siders.
The information to be included in the additional version of the Information
Materials will not, for the avoidance of doubt, be required to be any more
expansive than the information included in the version of the Information
Materials provided to the Private Siders. It is understood that in connection
with your assistance described above, customary authorization letters will be
included in any Information Materials that authorize the distribution thereof
to prospective Lenders, represent that the additional version of the
Information Memorandum contains only Public Side Information and exculpate
you, the Sponsor, the Target, and your and their respective affiliates and us
and our respective affiliates with respect to any liability related to the use
or misuse of the contents of the Information Materials or related offering and
marketing materials by the recipients thereof. Before distribution of any
Information Materials, at our reasonable request, you agree to identify that
portion of the Information Materials that may be distributed to the Public
Siders as "Public Information", which, at a minimum, shall mean that the word
"PUBLIC" shall appear prominently on the first page thereof. By marking
Information Materials as "PUBLIC", you shall be deemed to have authorized the
Commitment Parties and the proposed Lenders to treat such Information
Materials as containing only Public Side Information (it being understood that
you shall not be under any obligation to mark the Information Materials
"PUBLIC"). Any Information Materials not marked "PUBLIC" shall be deemed to
have Private Side Information.

 

You acknowledge and agree that, subject to the confidentiality and other
provisions of this Commitment Letter, the following documents, without
limitation, may be distributed to both Private Siders and Public Siders,
unless you advise the Lead Arrangers in writing (including by email) within a
reasonable time prior to their intended distribution that such materials
should only be distributed to

   

Private Siders (provided that you and your counsel shall have been given a
reasonable opportunity prior to any such distribution to review such documents
and comply with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission
disclosure obligations or any other applicable disclosure obligations with
respect thereto prior to any such distribution): (a) administrative materials
prepared by the Lead Arrangers for prospective Lenders (such as a lender
meeting invitation, bank allocation, if any, and funding and closing
memoranda), (b) term sheets and notifications of changes in the Credit
Facilities' terms and conditions and (c) drafts and final versions of the
Credit Facilities Documentation. If you advise us in writing (including by
email), within a reasonable period of time prior to dissemination, that any of
the foregoing should be distributed only to Private Siders, then Public Siders
will not receive such materials without your consent.

 

4.Information.

 

You hereby represent and warrant that (with respect to Information relating to
the Target, its subsidiaries and its and their respective businesses prior to
the Closing Date, to your knowledge) (a) all written information and written
data, other than (i) the Projections, estimates, budgets and other forward-
looking information and (ii) information of a general economic or industry
specific nature (such written information and data other than as described in
the immediately preceding clauses (i) and (ii), the "Information"), that has
been or will be made available to any Commitment Party by you or, at your
direction, by any of your representatives on your behalf in connection with
the transactions contemplated hereby, when taken as a whole after giving
effect to all supplements and updates provided thereto from time to time, is
or will be, when furnished, correct in all material respects and does not or
will not, when furnished and when taken as a whole, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in
order to make the statements contained therein not materially misleading in
light of the circumstances under which such statements are made (after giving
effect to all supplements and updates thereto from time to time) and (b) the
Projections that have been or will be made available to us by or on behalf of
you in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby have been prepared
in good faith based upon assumptions that are believed by you to be reasonable
at the time such Projections are so furnished; it being understood that the
Projections are predictions as to future events and are not to be viewed as
facts, that the Projections are subject to significant uncertainties and
contingencies, many of which are beyond your control, that no assurance can be
given that any particular Projections will be realized, and that actual
results during the period or periods covered by any such Projections may
differ from the projected results and such differences may be material. You
agree that if, at any time prior to the later of the Closing Date and the
Syndication Date, you become aware that any of the representations and
warranties in the preceding sentence would be incorrect in any material
respect if the Information and the Projections contained in the Information
Materials were being furnished, and such representations were being made, at
such time, then you will (or, prior to the Closing Date, with respect to the
Information relating to the Target, its subsidiaries or their respective
operations or assets, will, in all instances to the extent not in
contravention of the Acquisition Agreement, use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause the Target to) promptly supplement the Information and such
Projections such that (with respect to Information relating to the Target, its
subsidiaries and their respective businesses prior to the Closing Date, to
your knowledge) such representations and warranties are correct in all
material respects under those circumstances, it being understood in each case
that such supplementation shall cure any breach of such representations and
warranties. In arranging and syndicating the Credit Facilities, the Lead
Arrangers will be entitled to use and rely on the Information and the
Projections contained in the Information Materials without responsibility for
independent verification thereof. The Commitment Parties do not assume any
responsibility for the accuracy or completeness of the Information or the
Projections. Notwithstanding anything to the

   

contrary contained in this Commitment Letter or the Fee Letter, none of the
making of any representation under this Section 4, the provision of any
supplement thereto, nor the accuracy of any such representation or supplement
shall constitute a condition precedent to the availability and initial funding
of the Credit Facilities on the Closing Date.

 

5.Fees.

 

As consideration for the commitments of the Initial Lenders hereunder and for
the agreement of the Lead Arrangers to perform the services described herein,
you agree to pay (or cause to be paid) the fees set forth in the Term Sheet
and the Fee Letter, if and to the extent due and payable in accordance with
the terms set forth in the Term Sheet and the Fee Letter. Once paid, such
fees shall not be refundable except as otherwise set forth herein or therein
or as otherwise agreed in writing by you and us. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary herein or otherwise, if the Closing Date does not occur, no fees,
costs or expenses (other than amounts payable pursuant to clause (a) in the
first paragraph of Section 7 below, but not any fees, costs, expenses or
disbursements of counsel pursuant to clause (b) of that paragraph) will be
payable or reimbursable to you pursuant to this Commitment Letter, the Fee
Letter or any other agreement entered into between you and the Lead Arrangers
and/or any of their affiliates with respect to the Credit Facilities.

 

6.Conditions.

 

The commitments of the Initial Lenders hereunder to fund the Credit Facilities
on the Closing Date and the agreements of the Lead Arrangers to perform the
services described herein are subject solely to the limited conditions set
forth in the section entitled "Conditions to Initial Borrowing" in Exhibit B
attached hereto, and upon satisfaction (or waiver by all Commitment Parties in
writing) of such conditions, the initial funding of the Credit Facilities
shall occur; it being understood and agreed that there are no other conditions
(implied or otherwise) to the commitments hereunder, including compliance with
the terms of this Commitment Letter, the Fee Letter or the Credit Facilities
Documentation.

 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Commitment Letter (including
each of the exhibits attached hereto), the Fee Letter, the Credit Facilities
Documentation or any other letter agreement or other undertaking concerning
the financing of the Transactions to the contrary, (i) the only
representations and warranties the accuracy of which shall be a condition to
the availability and funding of the Credit Facilities on the Closing Date
shall be (A) such of the representations and warranties made by or with
respect to the Target and its subsidiaries in the Acquisition Agreement as are
material to the interests of the Lenders (in their capacities as such), but
only to the extent that you (or your applicable affiliate) have the right
(taking into account any applicable notice or cure provisions) to terminate
your or its obligations under the Acquisition Agreement or to decline to
consummate the Acquisition (in each case, in accordance with the terms
thereof) as a result of a breach of such representations and warranties in the
Acquisition Agreement (the "Specified Acquisition Agreement Representations")
and (B) the Specified Representations (as defined below) and (ii) the terms of
the Credit Facilities Documentation shall be in a form such that they do not
impair the availability or funding of the Credit Facilities on the Closing
Date if the conditions set forth in the section entitled "Conditions to
Initial Borrowing" in Exhibit B attached hereto are satisfied (or waived by
all Commitment Parties in writing) (provided that to the extent any security
interest in any Collateral is not or cannot be provided and/or perfected on
the Closing Date (other than the pledge and perfection of the security
interest in the equity interests of the Target and each Guarantor that is an
existing subsidiary thereof (provided that any certificated equity securities

   

evidencing such equity interests, other than certificated equity securities of
the Target or any Guarantor that is an existing subsidiary of the Target, will
be required to be delivered on the Closing Date only to the extent actually
received from the Target after your use of commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain such certificates) and other assets with respect to which a lien may be
perfected by the filing of a financing statement under the Uniform Commercial
Code) after your use of commercially reasonable efforts to do so without undue
burden or expense, then the provision and/or perfection of a security interest
in such Collateral shall not constitute a condition to the availability of the
Credit Facilities on the Closing Date, but instead shall be required to be
provided and/or perfected within 120 days (or 30 days in the case of equity
interests) after the Closing Date (or such later date after the Closing Date
as the Administrative Agent shall agree) pursuant to arrangements to be
mutually agreed by the Administrative Agent and the Borrower acting
reasonably). For purposes hereof, "Specified Representations" means (a) all
representations and warranties of the Borrower, the Target, and each Guarantor
that is an existing subsidiary thereof set forth in the Credit Facilities
Documentation relating to the following: organizational existence;
organizational power and authority, due authorization, execution and delivery
and enforceability, in each case with respect solely to the Credit Facilities
Documentation; no conflicts with or consents under organizational and
governing documents, in each case, related solely to the entering into and the
performance of the Credit Facilities Documentation, the incurrence of the
extensions of credit thereunder and the giving of guaranties and granting of
security in connection therewith; solvency as of the Closing Date (after
giving effect to the Transactions and with solvency being determined in a
manner consistent with Annex I to Exhibit C attached hereto) of the Target and
its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis; Federal Reserve margin regulations;
the PATRIOT Act; the use of loan proceeds not violating OFAC or FCPA;
beneficial ownership certificates (to the extent required by applicable law);
the Investment Company Act; and, subject to the proviso in the immediately
preceding sentence, creation, validity, perfection and priority (subject to
permitted liens) of security interests in the Collateral (as defined in
Exhibit B). This paragraph, and the provisions herein, shall be referred to
as the "Certain Funds Provisions".

 

For the avoidance of doubt, compliance by you and/or your affiliates with the
terms and conditions of this Commitment Letter (other than the conditions set
forth in the section entitled "Conditions to Initial Borrowing" in Exhibit B
attached hereto) is not a condition to the Initial Lenders' respective
commitments to fund the Credit Facilities hereunder on the Closing Date on the
terms set forth herein and in the Fee Letter.

 

7.Indemnity; Expenses.

 

To induce the Commitment Parties to enter into this Commitment Letter and the
Fee Letter and to proceed with the documentation of the Credit Facilities, you
agree (a) to indemnify and hold harmless each Commitment Party, its affiliates
and controlling persons (in each case other than any Excluded Affiliate acting
in its capacity as such) and the respective officers, directors, employees,
agents, advisors, partners and other representatives and successors and
assigns of each of the foregoing (each, an "Indemnified Person"), from and
against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities of any kind or
nature and reasonable, documented and invoiced out-of-pocket fees and
expenses, joint or several (limited to (i) in the case of legal fees and
expenses, fees and expenses of one counsel for all such Indemnified Persons,
taken as a whole and, of a single local counsel in each appropriate
jurisdiction (which may include a single special counsel acting in multiple
jurisdictions) for all such Indemnified Persons, taken as a whole, and, solely
in the case of an actual or perceived conflict of interest, one additional
primary and one additional local counsel in each applicable jurisdiction to
each group of similarly affected Indemnified Persons and (ii) in the case of
any other

   

advisory or consultant, fees and expenses of such advisor or consultant but
solely to the extent that you have consented to the retention of such person
(such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed)), to which any such
Indemnified Person may become subject to the extent arising out of, resulting
from or in connection with, this Commitment Letter (including the Term Sheet),
the Fee Letter, the Transactions or any related transaction contemplated
hereby, the Credit Facilities or any use of the proceeds thereof or any claim,
litigation, investigation or proceeding (including any inquiry or
investigation) relating to any of the foregoing (any of the foregoing, a
"Proceeding"), regardless of whether any such Indemnified Person is a party
thereto, whether or not such Proceedings are brought by you, your equity
holders, affiliates, creditors or any other third person, and to reimburse
each such Indemnified Person upon written demand for any reasonable,
documented and invoiced out-of-pocket fees and expenses of one counsel for all
such Indemnified Persons, taken as a whole and, of a single local counsel in
each appropriate jurisdiction (which may include a single special counsel
acting in multiple jurisdictions) for all such Indemnified Persons, taken as a
whole, and, solely in the case of an actual or perceived conflict of interest,
one additional primary and one additional local counsel in each applicable
jurisdiction to each group of similarly affected Indemnified Persons, and
other reasonable, documented and invoiced out-of-pocket fees and expenses
incurred in connection with investigating or defending any of the foregoing
and the fees and expenses of any other third-party advisors; provided that the
foregoing indemnity will not, as to any Indemnified Person, apply to losses,
claims, damages, liabilities or related expenses to the extent that they have
resulted from (i) the willful misconduct, bad faith or gross negligence of
such Indemnified Person or any of such Indemnified Person's controlling
persons, affiliates or any of its or their respective officers, directors,
employees, agents, partners or successors (as determined by a court of
competent jurisdiction in a final and non-appealable decision), (ii) a
material breach of the obligations of such Indemnified Person or any of such
Indemnified Person's controlling persons or affiliates under this Commitment
Letter or the Fee Letter (as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction
in a final and non-appealable decision), or (iii) disputes solely between and
among Indemnified Persons to the extent such disputes do not arise from any
act or omission of you, the Sponsor, the Target or any of your or their
respective affiliates; provided, further, that each Indemnified Person, to the
extent acting in its capacity as an agent or arranger or similar role under
the Credit Facilities, shall remain indemnified in respect of such disputes;
and (b) to reimburse each Commitment Party from time to time, upon
presentation of a summary statement, for all reasonable and documented or
invoiced out-of-pocket expenses (including but not limited to expenses of each
Commitment Party's non-legal consultants' fees (to the extent any such
consultant has been retained with your prior written consent (such consent not
to be unreasonably withheld or delayed)), syndication expenses, due diligence
expenses, reasonable, documented and invoiced travel expenses and reasonable,
documented and invoiced fees, disbursements and other charges of a single
counsel to the Commitment Parties identified in the Term Sheet and of a single
local counsel to the Commitment Parties in each appropriate jurisdiction
(which may include a single special counsel acting in multiple jurisdictions)
and of such other counsel retained with your prior written consent (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed)), in each case incurred in
connection with the Credit Facilities and the preparation, negotiation and
enforcement of this Commitment Letter, the Fee Letter, the Credit Facilities
Documentation and any security arrangements in connection therewith
(collectively, the "Expenses"). You acknowledge that certain of us may
receive a benefit, including, without limitation, a discount, credit or other
accommodation, from any such counsel based on the fees such counsel may
receive on account of their relationship with us including, without
limitation, fees paid pursuant hereto. The foregoing provisions in this
paragraph shall be superseded in each case, to the extent covered thereby, by
the applicable provisions contained in the Credit Facilities Documentation
upon execution thereof and thereafter shall have no further force and effect.

   

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Commitment Letter, (i) no
Indemnified Person shall be liable for any damages arising from the use by
others of information or other materials obtained through internet,
electronic, telecommunications or other information transmission systems,
except to the extent that such damages have resulted from (x) the willful
misconduct, bad faith or gross negligence of such Indemnified Person or any of
such Indemnified Person's controlling persons, controlled affiliates or any of
its or their respective officers, directors, employees, agents, partners or
successors or (y) any material breach of the obligations of such Indemnified
Person or any of such Indemnified Person's affiliates under this Commitment
Letter or the Fee Letter, in each case as determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction in a final, non-appealable judgment, and (ii) none of us, you (or
your affiliates), the Sponsor (or its affiliates), the Target (or its
subsidiaries) or any Indemnified Person shall be liable for any indirect,
special, punitive or consequential damages (including, without limitation, any
loss of profits, business or anticipated savings) in connection with this
Commitment Letter, the Fee Letter, the Transactions (including the Credit
Facilities and the use of proceeds thereunder), or with respect to any
activities related to the Credit Facilities, including the preparation of this
Commitment Letter, the Fee Letter and the Credit Facilities Documentation;
provided that nothing in this paragraph shall limit your indemnity and
reimbursement obligations to the extent that such indirect, special, punitive
or consequential damages are included in any claim by a third party
unaffiliated with the applicable Indemnified Person with respect to which the
applicable Indemnified Person is entitled to indemnification as set forth in
the immediately preceding paragraph.

 

In case any Proceeding is instituted involving any Indemnified Person for
which indemnification is to be sought hereunder by such Indemnified Person,
then such Indemnified Person will promptly notify you of the commencement of
such Proceeding; provided, however, that the failure to so notify you will not
relieve you of any liability that you may have to such Indemnified Person
pursuant to this Section 7, except to the extent you are materially prejudiced
by such failure. You shall not, without the prior written consent of the
applicable Indemnified Person (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed) (it being understood that withholding consent due to non-
satisfaction of any of the conditions described in clauses (i) and (ii) of
this sentence shall be deemed reasonable), effect any settlement of, or
consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or
threatened Proceedings in respect of which indemnity could have been sought
hereunder by such Indemnified Person unless such settlement (i) includes an
unconditional release of such Indemnified Person in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Person from all liability or
claims that are the subject matter of such Proceeding and (ii) does not
include any statement as to or admission of fault, culpability, wrongdoing or
failure to act by or on behalf of any Indemnified Person. In connection with
any one Proceeding, you will not be responsible for the fees and expenses of
more than one separate law firm for all Indemnified Persons plus additional
local counsel and conflicts counsel to the extent provided herein.

 

You shall not be liable for any settlement of any Proceeding effected without
your written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed), but if settled with your written consent or if there is a judgment
by a court of competent jurisdiction in any such Proceeding, you agree to
indemnify and hold harmless each Indemnified Person from and against any and
all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and reasonable, documented and
invoiced legal or other out-of-pocket expenses by reason of such settlement or
judgment in accordance with and to the extent provided in the other provisions
of this Section 7. Each Indemnified Person (by accepting the benefits hereof)
agrees to, and shall, refund and return any and all amounts paid by you to
such Indemnified Person if a court of competent jurisdiction determines in a
final and non-appealable

   

determination that such Indemnified Person was not entitled to indemnification
or contribution rights with respect to such payment pursuant to this Section
7.

 

8.Sharing of Information, Absence of Fiduciary Relationships, Affiliate
Activities.

 

You acknowledge that the Commitment Parties and their affiliates may be
providing debt financing, equity capital or other services (including, without
limitation, financial advisory services) to other persons in respect of which
you, the Target and your and its respective affiliates may have conflicting
interests regarding the transactions described herein and otherwise. None of
the Commitment Parties and their affiliates will use confidential information
obtained from you, the Target or any of your or their respective affiliates by
virtue of the transactions contemplated by this Commitment Letter or their
other relationships with you, the Target or your or their respective
affiliates in connection with the performance by them or their affiliates of
services for other persons, and none of the Commitment Parties and their
affiliates will furnish any such information to other persons, except to the
extent permitted below. You also acknowledge that none of the Commitment
Parties and their affiliates have any obligation to use in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Commitment Letter, or to furnish to you,
confidential information obtained by them from other persons.

 

As you know, certain of the Commitment Parties may be full service securities
firms engaged, either directly or through their affiliates, in various
activities, including securities trading, commodities trading, investment
management, financing and brokerage activities and financial planning and
benefits counseling for both companies and individuals. In the ordinary
course of these activities, certain of the Commitment Parties and their
respective affiliates may actively engage in commodities trading or trade the
debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and financial
instruments (including bank loans and other obligations) of you, the Target
and other companies which may be the subject of the arrangements contemplated
by this Commitment Letter for their own account and for the accounts of their
customers and may at any time hold long and short positions in such
securities. Certain of the Commitment Parties or their affiliates may also
co-invest with, make direct investments in, and invest or co-invest client
monies in or with funds or other investment vehicles managed by other parties,
and such funds or other investment vehicles may trade or make investments in
securities of you, the Target or other companies which may be the subject of
the arrangements contemplated by this Commitment Letter or engage in
commodities trading with any thereof.

 

The Commitment Parties and their respective affiliates may have economic
interests that conflict with those of you or the Target and may be engaged in
a broad range of transactions that involve interests that differ from yours
and those of your affiliates and the Commitment Parties have no obligation to
disclose any of such interests to you or your affiliates. You agree that the
Commitment Parties will act under this Commitment Letter as independent
contractors and that nothing in this Commitment Letter or the Fee Letter will
be deemed to create an advisory, fiduciary or agency relationship or fiduciary
or other implied duty between the Commitment Parties, on the one hand, and
you, the Target, your and its respective equity holders or your or their
respective affiliates, on the other hand. You acknowledge and agree that (i)
the transactions contemplated by this Commitment Letter and the Fee Letter are
arm's-length commercial transactions between the Commitment Parties and, if
applicable, their affiliates, on the one hand, and you, on the other, (ii) in
connection therewith and with the process leading to such transaction each
Commitment Party and each of its applicable affiliates (as the case may be) is
acting solely as a principal and has not been, is not and will not be acting
as an advisor, an agent or a fiduciary of you, the Target, your and its

   

management, equity holders, creditors, affiliates or any other person, (iii)
the Commitment Parties and their applicable affiliates (as the case may be)
have not assumed an advisory or fiduciary responsibility or any other
obligation in favor of you or your affiliates with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby or the process leading thereto (irrespective of whether
the Commitment Parties or any of their respective affiliates have advised or
are currently advising you or the Target on other matters) except the
obligations expressly set forth in this Commitment Letter and the Fee Letter,
and (iv) you have consulted your own legal, tax, accounting and financial
advisors to the extent you deemed appropriate. You further acknowledge and
agree that (a) you are responsible for making your own independent judgment
with respect to such transactions and the process leading thereto, (b) you are
capable of evaluating and understand and accept the terms, risks and
conditions of the transactions contemplated hereby, and (c) we have provided
no legal, accounting, regulatory or tax advice and you contacted your own
legal, accounting, regulatory and tax advisors to the extent you have deemed
appropriate. You agree that you will not claim that the Commitment Parties or
their applicable affiliates, as the case may be, have rendered advisory
services of any nature or respect, or owe a fiduciary or similar duty to you
or your affiliates, in connection with such transaction or the process leading
thereto.

 

9.Confidentiality.

 

You agree that you will not disclose, directly or indirectly, the Fee Letter
and the contents thereof or this Commitment Letter, the Term Sheet, the other
exhibits and attachments hereto and the contents of each thereof, or the
activities of any Commitment Party pursuant hereto or thereto, to any person
or entity without prior written approval of the relevant Commitment Parties
(which may be provided by electronic means) (such approval not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), except (a) to you and your
Related Parties (as defined below) who need to know such information in
connection with the Transactions, (b) to the Sponsor, and to your and any of
the Sponsor's affiliates, in each case, on a confidential basis, (c) if the
relevant Commitment Parties consent in writing (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed) to such proposed disclosure, (d) to the
extent such information becomes publicly available other than by reason of
improper disclosure in violation of any confidentiality obligation owing to us
(including those set forth in this paragraph), (e) in any legal, judicial or

disclosure of information referred to above be made to any Disqualified
Lender. It is understood and agreed that each Commitment Party may, at its

other periodical, on any website or similar place for dissemination of
information on the internet, as part of a "case study" incorporated into
promotional materials, in the form of a "tombstone" advertisement or
otherwise) without the prior written consent of the Borrower.

 

10.Miscellaneous.

 

This Commitment Letter and the commitments hereunder shall not be assignable
by any party hereto without the prior written consent of each other party
hereto (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed)
and any attempted assignment without such consent shall be null and void. This
Commitment Letter and the commitments hereunder are intended to be solely for
the benefit of the parties hereto (and Indemnified Persons to the extent
expressly set forth

   

herein) and do not and are not intended to confer any benefits upon, or create
any rights in favor of, any person other than the parties hereto (and
Indemnified Persons to the extent expressly set forth herein). Subject to the
limitations set forth in Section 3 above, the Commitment Parties reserve the
right to employ the services of their affiliates or branches in providing
services contemplated hereby and to allocate, in whole or in part, to their
affiliates or branches certain fees payable to the Commitment Parties in such
manner as the Commitment Parties and their affiliates or branches may agree in
their sole discretion and, to the extent so employed, such affiliates and
branches shall be entitled to the benefits and protections afforded to, and
subject to the provisions governing the conduct of, the Commitment Parties
hereunder; provided that (a) no Commitment Party shall be relieved of any of
its obligations hereunder, including in the event that any affiliate or branch
through which it performs its obligations fails to perform the same in
accordance with the terms hereof, and (b) the applicable Commitment Party
shall be responsible for any breach by any such affiliate or branch referred
to in the foregoing clause (a) of the obligations hereunder. This Commitment
Letter may not be amended or any provision hereof waived or modified except by
an instrument in writing signed by each of the Commitment Parties and you.
This Commitment Letter may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of
which shall be deemed an original and all of which, when taken together, shall
constitute one agreement. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature
page of this Commitment Letter by facsimile transmission or other electronic
transmission (i.e., a "pdf" or "tif" or similar format) shall be effective as
delivery of a manually executed counterpart hereof. This Commitment Letter
(including the exhibits hereto), together with the Fee Letter, (i) are the
only agreements that have been entered into among the parties hereto with
respect to the Credit Facilities and (ii) supersede all prior understandings,
whether written or oral, among us with respect to the Credit Facilities and
sets forth the entire understanding of the parties hereto with respect
thereto. THIS COMMITMENT LETTER SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN
ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT
(A) THE INTERPRETATION OF THE DEFINITION OF "MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT" (AS
DEFINED IN THE ACQUISITION AGREEMENT) (AND WHETHER OR NOT A MATERIAL ADVERSE
EFFECT (AS DEFINED IN THE ACQUISITION AGREEMENT) HAS OCCURRED), (B) THE
DETERMINATION OF THE ACCURACY OF ANY SPECIFIED ACQUISITION AGREEMENT
REPRESENTATION AND WHETHER AS A RESULT OF ANY INACCURACY THEREOF YOU AND ANY
OF YOUR AFFILIATES HAVE THE RIGHT (TAKING INTO ACCOUNT ANY APPLICABLE CURE
PROVISIONS) TO TERMINATE YOUR AND ITS OBLIGATIONS THEREUNDER OR TO DECLINE TO
CONSUMMATE THE ACQUISITION IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS THEREOF, AND (C) THE
DETERMINATION OF WHETHER THE ACQUISITION HAS BEEN CONSUMMATED IN ACCORDANCE
WITH THE TERMS OF THE ACQUISITION AGREEMENT SHALL IN EACH CASE, BE GOVERNED
BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE,
REGARDLESS OF THE LAWS THAT MIGHT OTHERWISE GOVERN UNDER APPLICABLE PRINCIPLES
OF CONFLICT OF LAWS THEREOF.

 

Each of the parties hereto agrees that (i) this Commitment Letter is a binding
and enforceable agreement with respect to the subject matter contained herein,
including the good-faith negotiation of the Credit Facilities Documentation by
the parties hereto in a manner consistent with this Commitment Letter, it
being acknowledged and agreed that the commitments provided hereunder are
subject solely to conditions as expressly provided herein, and (ii) the Fee
Letter is a legally valid and binding agreement of the parties thereto with
respect to the subject matter set forth therein. Promptly following the
execution of this Commitment Letter and the Fee Letter, the parties hereto
shall proceed with the negotiation in good faith of the Credit Facilities
Documentation for purposes of

   

executing and delivering the Credit Facilities Documentation substantially
simultaneously with the consummation of the Acquisition.

 

EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO IRREVOCABLY WAIVES THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN
ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING, CLAIM OR COUNTERCLAIM BROUGHT BY OR ON BEHALF OF ANY
PARTY RELATED TO OR ARISING OUT OF THIS COMMITMENT LETTER OR THE FEE LETTER OR
THE PERFORMANCE OF SERVICES HEREUNDER OR THEREUNDER.

 

Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally (a) submits,
for itself and its property, to the exclusive jurisdiction of any New York
State court or federal court of the United States of America sitting in New
York County (the Borough of Manhattan), and any appellate court from any
thereof, in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this
Commitment Letter, the Fee Letter or the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby, or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment, and agrees that
all claims in respect of any such action or proceeding shall only be heard and
determined in such New York State court or, to the extent permitted by law, in
such federal court, (b) waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and
effectively do so, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the
laying of venue of any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating
to this Commitment Letter, the Fee Letter or the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby in any New York State or in any such federal court, (c)
waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the defense of an inconvenient
forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in any such court, and
(d) agrees that a final judgment in any such suit, action or proceeding shall
be conclusive and may be enforced in any other courts to whose jurisdiction
such person is subject, by suit on the judgment or in any other manner
provided by law; provided that with respect to any suit, action or proceeding
arising out of or relating to the Acquisition Agreement or the transactions
contemplated thereby and that does not involve claims against us or the
Lenders or any Indemnified Person, this sentence shall not override any
jurisdiction provision set forth in the Acquisition Agreement. Each of the
parties hereto agrees that service of process, summons, notice or document by
registered mail addressed to you or us at the addresses set forth above shall
be effective service of process for any suit, action or proceeding brought in
any such court.

 

We hereby notify you that pursuant to the requirements of the USA PATRIOT Act
(Title III of Pub. L. 107-56 (signed into law October 26, 2001)) (as amended,
the "PATRIOT Act") and 31 C.F.R. § 1010.230 (the "Beneficial Ownership
Regulation"), each of us and each of the Lenders may be required to obtain,
verify and record information that identifies the Borrower and the Guarantors,
which information may include their names, addresses, tax identification
numbers and other information that will allow each of us and the Lenders to
identify the Borrower and the Guarantors in accordance with the PATRIOT Act
and the Beneficial Ownership Regulation. This notice is given in accordance
with the requirements of the PATRIOT Act and the Beneficial Ownership
Regulation and is effective for each of us and the Lenders.

 

The indemnification, compensation (if applicable in accordance with the terms
hereof and of the Fee Letter), reimbursement (if applicable in accordance with
the terms hereof and of the Fee Letter), jurisdiction, governing law, venue,
waiver of jury trial, service of process, syndication and confidentiality
provisions contained herein and in the Fee Letter and the provisions of
Section 8 of this Commitment Letter shall remain in full force and effect
regardless of whether the Credit Facilities Documentation shall be executed
and delivered and notwithstanding the termination or expiration of this
Commitment Letter or the Initial Lenders' respective commitments hereunder;
provided that your obligations under this Commitment Letter (other than your
obligations with

   

respect to (a) assistance to be provided in connection with the syndication
thereof (including supplementing and/or correcting Information and
Projections) prior to the Syndication Date, (b) confidentiality of the Fee
Letter and the contents thereof and (c) your understandings and agreements
regarding no agency or fiduciary duty) shall automatically terminate and be
superseded, to the extent covered thereby, by the provisions of the Credit
Facilities Documentation upon the initial funding thereunder, and you shall
automatically be released from all liability in connection therewith at such
time. You may terminate this Commitment Letter and/or the Initial Lenders'
respective commitments with respect to the Credit Facilities hereunder (in
whole but not in part) at any time subject to the provisions of the
penultimate preceding sentence. In addition, in the event that a lesser
amount of indebtedness is required to fund the Transactions for any reason,
you may reduce the Initial Lenders' respective commitments with respect to the
Credit Facilities in a manner consistent with the allocation of purchase price
reduction described under paragraph 1 of Exhibit C.

 

Section headings used herein are for convenience of reference only and are not
to affect the construction of, or to be taken into consideration in
interpreting, this Commitment Letter.

 

If the foregoing correctly sets forth our agreement, please indicate your
acceptance of the terms of this Commitment Letter and of the Fee Letter by
returning to the Commitment Parties (or their legal counsel), executed
counterparts hereof and of the Fee Letter not later than 11:59 p.m., New York
City time, on January 14, 2019. The Initial Lenders' respective commitment
and the obligations of the Commitment Parties hereunder will automatically
expire at such time in the event that the Lead Arrangers (or their counsel)
have not received such executed counterparts in accordance with the
immediately preceding sentence. If you do so execute and deliver to us this
Commitment Letter and the Fee Letter at or prior to such time, we agree to
hold our commitment to provide the Credit Facilities and our other
undertakings in connection therewith available for you until the earliest of
(i) the termination of the Acquisition Agreement in accordance with its terms,
(ii) consummation of the Acquisition with or without the funding of the Credit
Facilities and (iii) 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on May 14, 2019 (such
earliest time, the "Expiration Date"). Upon the occurrence of any of the
events referred to in the preceding sentence, this Commitment Letter and the
commitments of each of the Commitment Parties hereunder and the agreement of
the Lead Arrangers to provide the services described herein shall
automatically terminate unless the Commitment Parties shall, in their
discretion, agree to an extension in writing.

 |  

On or prior to the Closing Date, True Wind Capital Management, LLC and its
controlled affiliates (collectively, the "Sponsor") will directly or
indirectly make new cash equity contributions to the Borrower in the form of
perpetual accruing convertible preferred equity (the "Preferred Equity")
pursuant to that certain Investment Agreement, dated as of January 14, 2019,
among the Sponsor and the Borrower (the "Equity Contribution") in an aggregate
amount equal to at least $100 million in gross proceeds (the "Minimum Equity
Amount"). 

---|--- 

 

    

b)

 |  

The Borrower will obtain the Credit Facilities described in Exhibit B to the
Commitment Letter, which will include (i) a senior secured term loan facility
denominated in dollars (the "Term Facility") in an aggregate principal amount
of $175 million plus, at the Borrower's election, an amount sufficient to fund
any original issue discount ("OID") or upfront fees required to be paid in
connection with the exercise of the "market flex" provisions in the Fee Letter
with respect to the Term Facility and (ii) a senior secured revolving credit
facility in an aggregate principal amount equal to $25 million (the "Revolving
Facility" and, together with the Term Facility, the "Credit Facilities"). 

---|--- 

 

    

c)

 |  

Prior to, or substantially contemporaneously with, the funding of the Credit
Facilities, all of the Borrower's, the Target's and their respective
subsidiaries' existing debt for borrowed money (other than any such debt that
is permitted to survive pursuant to, in the case of the Borrower and its
subsidiaries, the Credit Facility Documentation, and in the case of the Target
and its subsidiaries, the Acquisition Agreement (as may be modified in
accordance with paragraph 1 of Exhibit C)) will be repaid in full and all
commitments to extend credit thereunder will be terminated and any security
interests and guarantees in connection therewith shall be terminated and/or
released (or arrangements for such repayment, termination and release
reasonably satisfactory to the Commitment Parties shall have been made)
(together, the "Refinancing"). 

---|--- 

 

    

d)

 |  

Pursuant to that certain Securities Purchase Agreement, dated as of January
14, 2019, among the Borrower, AppRiver Marlin Blocker Corp. ("Blocker"), AR
Topco, LLC ("Topco"), and the other parties thereto (together with all
exhibits, schedules and disclosure letters thereto, collectively, as amended,
modified, supplemented, consented to or waived in accordance with paragraph 1
of Exhibit C, the "Acquisition Agreement"), the Borrower will acquire all of
the issued and outstanding equity interests of the Target (the "Acquisition"),
indirectly through its acquisition of Blocker and Topco, in accordance with
the terms of the Acquisition Agreement. 

---|--- 

 

    

e)

 |  

The proceeds of the Equity Contribution and the Credit Facilities borrowed on
the Closing Date will be applied (i) to pay a portion of the consideration in
connection with the Acquisition and any other payments contemplated by the
Acquisition Agreement, (ii) to effect the Refinancing and (iii) to pay the
fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Transactions (such fees and
expenses, the "Transaction Costs" and, together with the amounts set forth in
clause (i) above, collectively, the "Acquisition Costs"). 

---|--- 

 

The transactions described above (including the payment of the Acquisition
Costs) are collectively referred to herein as the "Transactions".

the Lenders or the Commitment Parties so long as any such reduction is applied
to reduce the Equity Contribution and the Term Facility on a ratable basis;
(b) any increase in the purchase price of, or consideration for the
Acquisition shall not be considered materially adverse to the Lenders or the
Commitment Parties to the extent that any such increase is not funded with
additional indebtedness (other than permitted Closing Date draws on the
Revolving Facility) and (c) any amendment or modification to, waiver of or
consent under the definition of "Material Adverse Effect" in the Acquisition
Agreement shall be considered materially adverse to the interests of the

October 5, 2017 through December 31, 2017 and (b) unaudited consolidated
balance sheets and related consolidated statements of income, retained
earnings, and members' equity and changes in financial position of ARI as of
the end of and for the ten months ended October 31, 2018, and (c) a quality of
earnings report for the Target. It is acknowledged and agreed that the
Commitment Parties have received the items required by clauses (a), (b) and
(c) of this Paragraph 10 as of the date of this Commitment Letter.

All fees required to be paid on the Closing Date pursuant to the Fee Letter
and reasonable, documented and invoiced out-of-pocket expenses required to be
paid on the Closing Date pursuant to the Commitment Letter, to the extent
invoiced at least three business days prior to the Closing Date, shall, upon
the initial borrowing under the Term Facility, have been, or will be
substantially simultaneously, paid (which amounts may be offset against the
proceeds of the Credit Facilities).

With respect to the Target and the Borrower and its subsidiaries, the
Specified Representations shall be true and correct in all material respects
(or, if already qualified by materiality, in all respects). With respect to
the Target, the Specified Acquisition Agreement Representations shall be true
and correct in all material respects (or, if already qualified by materiality,
in all respects).

The Commitment Parties shall have been afforded a period (the "Marketing
Period") of at least 20 consecutive business days from and including the date
of delivery of the financial statements referred to in preceding paragraphs 9
and 10 above (the "Required Bank Information"), to syndicate the Credit
Facilities to prospective Lenders; provided, however, that January 21, 2019,
and February 18, 2019, shall not constitute "business days" for purposes of
calculating such 20 consecutive business day period (but, for the avoidance of
doubt, shall not cause such 20 consecutive business day period to restart);
provided, further, that if the Borrower reasonably believes that it has
delivered the Required Bank Information, the Borrower may deliver to the
Commitment Parties written notice to that effect (stating when the Borrower
believes it has completed such delivery), in which case the Borrower will be
deemed to have delivered the Required Bank Information, unless the Lead
Arrangers in good faith reasonably believe that the Borrower has not done so
and, within two business days after their receipt of such notice from the
Borrower, the Lead Arrangers deliver a written notice to the Borrower to that
effect (stating with reasonable specificity what portions of the Required Bank
Information are missing or unsuitable). For the avoidance of doubt, once the
Marketing Period begins, the Marketing Period shall not be required to restart
in the event additional financial information would otherwise be required to
be delivered under the preceding paragraph 9.

  ANNEX I to 
EXHIBIT C

 

[THE BORROWER]

 

SOLVENCY CERTIFICATE

 

[____], 20[_]

 

Pursuant to Section [_] of the Credit Agreement, dated as of the date hereof
(as amended, restated, amended and restated, supplemented or otherwise
modified from time to time, the "Credit Agreement"), among [_________], the
undersigned [chief financial officer] [other officer with equivalent duties]
of the Borrower hereby certifies as of the date hereof, solely on behalf of
the Borrower and not in his/her individual capacity and without assuming any
personal liability whatsoever, that:

 

    



 |  

1.

 |  

I am familiar with the finances, properties, businesses and assets of the
Borrower and its Subsidiaries. I have reviewed the Loan Documents and such
other documentation and information and have made such investigation and
inquiries as I have deemed necessary and prudent therefor. I have also
reviewed the consolidated financial statements of the Borrower and its
Subsidiaries, including projected financial statements and forecasts relating
to income statements and cash flow statements of the Borrower and its
Subsidiaries. 

---|---|--- 

 

    



 |  

2.

 |  

On the Closing Date, after giving effect to the Transactions, the Borrower and
its Subsidiaries (on a consolidated basis) (a) have property with fair value
greater than the total amount of their debts and liabilities, contingent (it
being understood that the amount of contingent liabilities at any time shall
be computed as the amount that, in light of all the facts and circumstances
existing at such time, represents the amount that can reasonably be expected
to become an actual or matured liability), subordinated or otherwise, (b) have
assets with present fair salable value not less than the amount that will be
required to pay their liability on their debts as they become absolute and
matured, (c) will be able generally to pay their debts and liabilities,
subordinated, contingent or otherwise, as they become absolute and matured and
(d) are not engaged in business or a transaction, and are not about to engage
in business or a transaction, for which their property would constitute an
unreasonably small capital. 

---|---|--- 

 

All capitalized terms used but not defined in this certificate shall have the
meanings set forth in the Credit Agreement.

 

[SIGNATURE PAGE TO FOLLOW]

 



 

Annex I to Exhibit C-1  

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned has executed this Certificate as of the
date first written above.

Section 1445 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code")
provides that a transferee of a U.S. real property interest must withhold tax
if the transferor is a foreign person. Further, Section 1446(f)(1) of the
Code provides that a transferee of an interest in a partnership must withhold
tax if the disposition of such interest would be treated as effectively
connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States
under Section 864(c)(8) of the Code. Section 1446(f)(2) of the Code provides
an exception to such requirement where the transferor of such interest
furnishes to the transferee an affidavit stating the transferor's U.S.
taxpayer identification number and that the transferor is not a foreign person
for U.S. tax purposes. For U.S. tax purposes (including Sections 1445 and
1446 of the Code), the owner of a disregarded entity (which has legal title to
a U.S. real property interest under local law) will be the transferor of the
property and not the disregarded entity. To inform Buyer that withholding of
tax is not required upon disposition of a U.S. real property interest by the
entity listed on the signature page hereto ("Seller"), the undersigned hereby
certifies the following on behalf of Seller:
