The Company will supply Parent with copies of all correspondence between the Company or any

confidentiality owing to a third party, jeopardize any applicable privilege of the institution in
possession or control of such information or contravene any Law or any binding agreement entered

Company does not provide access or information in reliance on the preceding sentence, it shall
provide notice to Parent that it is withholding such access or information and shall use its

following conditions has been satisfied: (i)&nbsp;all of the conditions set forth in Sections&nbsp;6.1

conditions to the consummation of the financing provided by the Debt Financing Commitment
(or, if alternative financing is being used in accordance with Section&nbsp;5.15, pursuant to the
commitments with respect thereto) have been satisfied (other than those conditions that by
their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing). In the event that any suit, action or
other proceeding should be brought in equity to enforce any of the provisions of this
Agreement, no party will allege, and each party hereby waives the defense, that there is an
adequate remedy under applicable Law.
