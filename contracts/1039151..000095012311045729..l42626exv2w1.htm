   ##### 

  

  

 1.3 _Effects of the Merger_. At the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company and the separate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and the Company shall continue as the surviving entity in the Merger and as a subsidiary of Parent. The Merger will have the effects set forth in the ORC. As used in this Agreement, " _Surviving Entity_ " shall mean the Company, at and after the Effective Time, as the surviving entity in the Merger. 

  

 1.4 _Articles of Incorporation_. At the Effective Time, the Articles of Incorporation of the Company as the Surviving Entity shall be amended and restated in the form attached hereto as  _Exhibit A-1_, and such Articles of Incorporation shall be the Articles of Incorporation until thereafter amended.

 (a) Each of the parties hereto shall take all necessary action to cause the directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time to be the directors of the Surviving Entity immediately following the Effective Time, to hold office until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified or their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the Articles of Incorporation and Code of Regulations of the Surviving Entity. 

   

 (b) The officers of the Company as of the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Entity, until their respective successors are duly appointed and qualified or their earlier resignation or removal or otherwise ceasing to be an officer in accordance with the Articles of Incorporation and Code of Regulations of the Surviving Entity. 

  

ARTICLE II 
  _EFFECTS OF THE MERGER_  

   

 2.1 _Effect on Capital Shares_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any holder of any shares of common stock, without par value, of the Company (together with any associated Rights, as such term is defined in the Shareholder Rights Agreement, dated August 14, 2009, between the Company and American Stock Transfer and Trust the Company LLC, as Rights Agent (the " _Rights Agreement_ "), the " _Company Common Stock_ "): 

   

 (a) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock_. Any shares of Company Common Stock that are owned by the Company as treasury stock shall be cancelled and extinguished and shall cease to exist. 

   

 (b) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other 

   ##### 

  

    

than (i) shares of Company Common Stock to be cancelled in accordance with
Section 2.1(a), (ii) shares of Company Common Stock owned by Parent
immediately prior to the Effective Time, which shares shall, at the Effective
Time, be cancelled and extinguished and shall cease to exist for
no consideration, (iii) shares of Company Common Stock owned by any direct or
indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent immediately prior to the Effective
Time, which shares shall, at the Effective Time, be cancelled and
extinguished and shall cease to exist for no consideration, and (iv) Company
Dissenting Shares, which shall be treated in accordance with Section 2.6)
shall be cancelled and extinguished and shall cease to exist and
automatically converted into the right to receive $15.25 in cash without any
interest thereon (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). Upon such conversion, all
such shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be cancelled and extinguished and shall cease to exist, and
each certificate previously representing any such shares (or book entry
representing any such non-certificated shares) shall thereafter represent
only the right to receive the Merger Consideration, in respect of such shares
upon the surrender of the certificate or book entry representing such shares
in accordance with Section 2.2 (or in the case of a lost, stolen or destroyed
certificate, upon delivery of an affidavit (and bond, if required) in the
manner provided in Section 2.3). 

   

 (c) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each share of class A common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be, without any further action on the part of the shareholders of Merger Sub, converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of class A common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Entity (the " _Survivor Class A Common Stock_"). Each share of class B common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be, without any further action on the part of the shareholders of Merger Sub, converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of class B common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Entity (the " _Survivor Class B Common Stock_") (the shares of Survivor Class A Common Stock into which the shares of Merger Sub capital stock are so converted, along with the shares of Survivor Class B Common Stock into which shares of Merger Sub capital stock are so converted, shall be the only shares of the Surviving Entitys capital stock that are issued and outstanding immediately after the Effective Time). 

   

 (d) _Adjustments_. The Merger Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect fully the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Company Common Stock), reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification or other like change with respect to Company Common Stock having a record date on or after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time. 

  

 2.2 _Surrender and Payment_. 

   

 (a) Prior to the date of mailing of the Proxy Statement, Parent shall appoint an agent (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") reasonably acceptable to the Company for the 

   ##### 

  

    

purpose of exchanging certificates or book entries, as applicable, which
immediately prior to the Effective Time evidenced shares of Company Common
Stock (the " _Certificates_ "), for the applicable Merger Consideration
pursuant to an exchange agent agreement in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to the Company. On or before the Effective Time, Parent shall
deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent, the
Merger Consideration to be exchanged or paid in accordance with this Article
II (such amount being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ ").
The Surviving Entity shall, or shall cause the Exchange Agent to, send to
each holder of record of shares of Company Common Stock immediately prior to
the Effective Time whose shares were converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1, promptly after the Effective
Time, (i) a letter of transmittal for use in such exchange (which shall
specify that the delivery of the applicable Merger Consideration shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title in respect of the Certificates shall
pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent)
and (ii) instructions to effect the surrender of the Certificates in exchange
for the applicable Merger Consideration. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, the Exchange Agent shall not disburse
any part of the Exchange Fund until the Dissenters Determination Date (as
defined in Section 2.6). Pending its disbursement in satisfaction of such
obligations, the Exchange Fund shall be invested by the Exchange Agent as
directed by Parent. Upon the date that is one (1) Business Day after
the Dissenters Determination Date, the Exchange Agent shall disburse to
Parent that portion of the Exchange Fund (if any) attributable to Company
Dissenting Shares. If a holder of Company Dissenting Shares effectively
withdraws its demand for, or loses its rights to, payment of fair cash value
pursuant to Section 1701.85 of the ORC with respect to any Company Dissenting
Shares, (i) such Company Common Stock shall cease to be Company Dissenting
Shares and (ii) Parent shall make available or cause to be made available to
the Exchange Agent additional funds in an amount equal to the product of (x)
the number of Company Dissenting Shares for which the holder has withdrawn
its demand for, or lost its rights to, payment of fair cash value pursuant to
1701.85 of the ORC and (y) the Merger Consideration. Nothing contained in
this Section 2.2(a) and no investment losses resulting from investment of the
funds deposited with the Exchange Agent shall diminish the rights of any
holder of Company Common Stock to receive the Merger Consideration. 

   

 (b) Each holder of shares of Company Common Stock that have been converted into the right to receive the applicable Merger Consideration upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate or Certificates, together with a properly completed letter of transmittal covering such shares and such other documents as the Exchange Agent may reasonably require, shall be entitled to receive the applicable Merger Consideration payable in respect of such shares of Company Common Stock. Certificates surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled as of the Effective Time. Until so surrendered, each such Certificate, following the Effective Time, shall represent for all purposes only the right to receive the applicable Merger Consideration. No interest shall be paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of the Certificates on cash amounts payable upon the surrender of such Certificates pursuant to this Section 2.2. 

   ##### 

  

   

 (c) After the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers of shares of Company Common Stock. If, after the Effective Time, any Certificate formerly representing shares of Company Common Stock is presented to the Surviving Entity, it shall, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, be cancelled and exchanged for the applicable Merger Consideration provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set forth, in this Article II. 

   

 (d) None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries or affiliates shall be liable to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any Merger Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. 

   

 (e) Each of the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Entity and Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration otherwise payable to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock, such amounts as the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Entity or Parent is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any provision of United States (" _U.S._ ") federal, state or local tax Law or any other non-U.S. tax Law or any other applicable legal requirement. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Entity or Parent, such amounts withheld from the Merger Consideration shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been received by the holder of the shares of Company Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Entity or Parent. 

   

 (f) Any portion of the Merger Consideration (including any interest received with respect thereto) supplied to the Exchange Agent which remains unclaimed by the holders of shares of Company Common Stock twelve (12) months after the Effective Time shall be returned to Parent, upon demand, and any such holder who has not exchanged his Certificates for the applicable Merger Consideration in accordance with this Section 2.2 prior to the time of demand shall thereafter look only to Parent (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) as a general creditor thereof with respect to the payment of any Merger Consideration that may be payable upon surrender of any Certificates held by such holders, as determined pursuant to this Agreement, without any interest thereon. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by such holders at such time at which such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property to any Governmental Entity shall become, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, the property of Parent or its designee, free and clear of all claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto. 

  

 2.3 _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the applicable Merger Consideration in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates; provided that Parent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in such sum as it may reasonably direct as

indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent or the Exchange
Agent with respect to the Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or
destroyed. 

  

 2.4 _Treatment of Company Equity Awards_.

 (b) _Restricted Stock_. At the Effective Time, each outstanding share of restricted stock granted under the Company Stock Plans, vested or unvested (each a " _Restricted_ _Share_ "), shall as of the Effective Time become fully vested and free of any forfeiture restriction and converted into the right to receive from Parent or the Surviving Entity, as soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (but in any event no later than three (3) Business Days after the Effective Time), an amount in cash equal to the Merger Consideration, less any required withholding taxes. 

   

 (c) _Time-Based Awards_. At the Effective Time, the right to receive shares of Company Common Stock or cash in respect of outstanding time-based restricted stock units under the Company Stock Plans (each, a " _Time-Based Award_ "), whether or not vested, shall be cancelled and shall only entitle the holder of such Time-Based Award to receive, as soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (but in any event no later than three (3) Business Days after the Effective Time), a cash payment from Parent or the Surviving Entity equal to (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock issuable pursuant to the Time-Based Award, multiplied by (ii) the Merger Consideration, less any required withholding taxes. 

   

 (d) _Performance-Based Awards_. At the Effective Time, the right to receive shares of Company Common Stock or cash in respect of outstanding performance-based restricted stock unit awards under the Company Stock Plans (each, a " _Performance-Based Award_ "), whether or not vested, shall be cancelled and shall only entitle the holder of such Performance-Based Award to receive, as soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (but in any event no later than three (3) Business Days after the Effective Time), a cash payment from Parent or the Surviving Entity equal to (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock issuable pursuant to the 

   ##### 

  

    

Performance-Based Award multiplied by (ii) the Merger Consideration, less any
required withholding taxes. 

   

 (e) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to take all such actions as may be required to effectuate the provisions of this Section 2.4.

 (f) Each of the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Entity and Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration otherwise payable to any holder of a Stock Option, Restricted Share, Time-Based Award or Performance-Based Award, such amounts as the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Entity or Parent is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any provision of U.S. federal, state or local tax Law or any other non-U.S. tax Law or any other applicable legal requirement. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Entity or Parent, such amounts withheld from the Merger Consideration shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been received by the holder of the Stock Option, Restricted Share, Time-Based Award or Performance-Based Award, as applicable, in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Entity or Parent. 

  

 2.5 _Treatment of Securities; Indentures_. 

   

 (a) If requested by Parent, the Company shall commence, or shall use its reasonable best efforts to assist Parent or an affiliate of Parent or the Company, at Parents option, in commencing (i) an offer to purchase the Securities (as defined below) (the " _Debt Offer_ ") or (ii) a consent solicitation to solicit the consent of holders of the Securities (as defined below) to certain amendments as specified by Parent, to the covenants in the Indenture (as defined below) and/or the Supplemental Indenture (the " _Consent Solicitation_ "), with respect to all of the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the 3.375% Convertible Senior Notes due July 15, 2012 (the " _Securities_ ") on the terms and conditions reasonably satisfactory to Parent and the Company, and otherwise send out any required notices and comply with the terms of the Indenture and the Supplemental Indenture. The closing of the Debt Offer and Consent Solicitation shall be conditioned upon the completion of the Merger and shall provide that the Securities be accepted for payment by the Surviving Entity immediately upon the completion of the Merger. Concurrent with the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Entity to accept for payment and thereafter promptly pay for the Securities that have been properly 

   ##### 

  

    

tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Debt Offer and in
accordance with the Debt Offer. Furthermore, if requested by Parent, the
Company shall assist Parent in causing all derivative instruments related
to the Securities or the Company Common Stock, including all hedging
agreements and warrants, to be terminated prior to the Effective Time. 

   

 (b) The Company covenants and agrees that, promptly following the Consent Solicitation expiration date, assuming the requisite consents are received in the Consent Solicitation, each of the Company and its applicable Subsidiaries as is necessary (i) shall (and shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause the applicable trustee to) execute a supplemental indenture and related certificates, in form reasonably satisfactory to the Company, to the Indenture, dated as of March 31, 2007 (the " _Indenture_ ") and the Supplemental Indenture No. 1 dated July 16, 2007 (the " _Supplemental Indenture_ "), between the Company and LaSalle Bank, National Association, as trustee, which supplemental indenture shall become operative only concurrently with the Effective Time, and (ii) shall provide any required certificate or opinion and any other documentation required by the terms of the Indenture and the Supplemental Indenture. 

   

 (c) Parent shall prepare all necessary and appropriate documentation in connection with the Debt Offer and the Consent Solicitation (collectively, the " _Offer Documents_ ") and provide the Company with a reasonable opportunity to comment on such documents. Parent and the Company shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to and shall use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to cause their respective Representatives to, reasonably cooperate with each other in the preparation of the Offer Documents. The Offer Documents (including all amendments or supplements) and all mailings to the holders of the Securities in connection with the Debt Offer and the Consent Solicitation shall be subject to the prior review of the Company and Parent and shall be reasonably acceptable to each of them. If at any time prior to the completion of the Debt Offer or the Consent Solicitation, as applicable, any information in the Offer Documents should be discovered by the Company and its subsidiaries, on the one hand, or Parent, on the other, which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Offer Documents, so that the Offer Documents shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, the party that discovers such information shall use reasonable best efforts to promptly notify the other party, following which an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be prepared by Parent and disseminated to the holders of the Securities.

that have not been voted in favor of the proposal to adopt this Agreement at
the Company Shareholders Meeting in accordance with Sections 1701.84 and
1701.85 of the ORC (the " _Company Dissenting Shares_ "), shall not be
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration unless and until
such holder fails to demand payment properly or otherwise waives, withdraws
or loses such holders rights as a dissenting shareholder, if any, under
Section 1701.85 of the ORC. From and after the Effective Time the holders of
such Company Dissenting Shares shall be entitled to such rights as are
granted in accordance with, and to the extent of, the provisions of Sections
1701.84 and 1701.85 of the ORC. At the Effective Time, all Company Dissenting
Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and
cease to exist. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any such holder shall fail
to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose its rights as a
dissenting shareholder under Section 1701.85 of the ORC or other applicable
Law, or a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is
not entitled to the relief provided by Section 1701.85 of the ORC, then each
such Company Dissenting Share shall thereafter be deemed to have been
converted into and to have become, as of the Effective Time, the right to
receive, without interest thereon, the Merger Consideration. The Company
shall deliver prompt notice to Parent of any demands delivered in accordance
with Section 1701.85 of the ORC, any withdrawals of such demands and any

agree to do any of the foregoing.

No Company Benefit Plan is subject to Section 302 or Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code and none of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any Company ERISA Affiliate (defined in clause (v) below) has, within the past six (6) years, sponsored, maintained, contributed to or been required to maintain or contribute to, or has any current or contingent liability with respect to, any benefit plan or arrangement that is subject to Section 302 or Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code or is otherwise a defined benefit plan.

Each Company Benefit Plan which is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code is currently so qualified and has been so qualified and has received a favorable determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service with respect to the qualification and tax-exempt status of the Company Benefit Plan (or such Company Benefit Plan operates as a prototype or volume submitter plan with respect to which none of the circumstances which would require it to obtain a favorable determination letter is applicable), and nothing has occurred (or failed to occur) that could reasonably be expected to cause the loss of the plans qualification and tax-exempt status or the imposition of any material penalty under ERISA or the Code.

   ##### 

  

    

for the accrued benefit obligations, as of the Closing Date, with respect to
all current and former participants in such plan according to the actuarial
assumptions and valuations most recently used to determine employer
contributions to such Foreign Company Benefit Plan and no transaction
contemplated by this Agreement shall cause such assets or insurance
obligations to be less than such benefit obligations with respect to such
retirement benefits and (B) to the Knowledge of the Company each
Foreign Company Benefit Plan required to be registered has been registered
and has been maintained in good standing with applicable regulatory
authorities, except where the failure to so register or maintain good
standing would not, either individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company; and (C) to
the Knowledge of the Company there are no pending, threatened or anticipated
claims (other than routine claims for benefits) by, on behalf of or against
any of the Foreign Company Benefit Plans or any trusts related thereto which
would reasonably be expected to result in any material liability of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries. 

   

 (viii) (i) Neither the Company nor any Company ERISA Affiliate has, since October 3, 2004, (x) granted to any person an interest in a nonqualified deferred compensation plan (as defined in Code Section 409A(d)(1)), which interest has been or, upon lapse of a substantial risk of forfeiture with respect to such interest, will be subject to the tax imposed by Code Section 409A(a)(1)(B) or (b)(4)(A), or (y) modified the terms of any nonqualified deferred compensation plan in a manner that would cause an interest previously granted under such plan to become subject to the taxes imposed by Code Section 409A, and (ii) each Company Benefit Plan that is a nonqualified deferred compensation plan has been established, documented, maintained and operated in compliance with Code Section 409A and the applicable regulations and guidance thereunder, and no service provider of the Company or any Company ERISA Affiliate is or would be, upon lapse of a substantial risk of forfeiture, subject to any taxes or penalties imposed under Code Section 409A. Further, no person had a legally binding right to an amount under a nonqualified deferred compensation plan of the Company or any Company ERISA Affiliate prior to January 1, 2005 that is subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture or a requirement to perform future services after December 31, 2004, which would subject such person to the taxes imposed by Code Section 409A.

  _ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS_  

   

 5.1 _Preparation of Proxy Statement; Shareholders Meetings_. 

   

 (a) _Proxy Statement_. 

   

 (i) As promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement, but in no event more than twelve (12) Business Days following the date of this Agreement, the Company shall prepare and shall cause to be filed with the SEC a preliminary proxy statement relating to the matters to be submitted to the Company shareholders at the Company Shareholders Meeting (such proxy statement and any amendments or supplements thereto, the " _Proxy Statement_ "). 

   

 (ii) The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to have the Proxy Statement cleared by the SEC as promptly as practicable after its initial filing and to mail the Proxy Statement to its shareholders as promptly as practicable thereafter. The Company shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable after receipt thereof, provide Parent with copies of any written comments received from the SEC or its staff and of any request by the SEC or its staff for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement, or for additional information. The Company will supply Parent with copies of all correspondence between the Company or any of its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or its staff, on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Company and its counsel shall keep Parent and its counsel reasonably informed of all communications with the SEC and its staff (including all meetings and telephone conferences) with respect to the Proxy Statement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Prior to filing or mailing the Proxy Statement or any other required filings (or, in each case, any amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC with respect thereto, the Company shall provide Parent and its counsel with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any such document or response and shall consider Parents comments in good faith. 

   

 (iii) The Company shall insure that none of the information set forth or incorporated by reference in the Proxy Statement will, at the date of mailing to shareholders and at the times of the meetings of shareholders to be held in connection with the Merger, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The Company agrees that the Proxy Statement will comply as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder. No representation or warranty is made by the Company with respect to statements made or incorporated by reference therein based on information supplied by Parent for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement. 

   ##### 

  

   

 (iv) The Company shall make any necessary filings with respect to the Merger under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder. If at any time prior to the Effective Time, any information relating to either of the parties, or their respective affiliates, officers or directors should be discovered by either party which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement so that such document would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party which discovers such information shall promptly notify the other party hereto and the Company shall promptly prepare and file with the SEC an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information, and, to the extent required by Law, the Company shall cause such amendment or supplement to be disseminated to the shareholders of the Company and, if required in connection therewith, proxies shall be re-solicited with respect thereto. 

   

 (v) The Company, in connection with a Change in Company Recommendation, may amend or supplement the Proxy Statement to effect or reflect such change without Parents approval, by an amendment or supplement which effects or reflects a Change in Company Recommendation;  _provided_ _further_ that prior to amending or supplementing the Proxy Statement, it has complied with Section 5.4 of this Agreement and such amendment or supplement is limited to (A) a Change in Company Recommendation, (B) a discussion of the reasons of the Companys Board of Directors for making such Change in Company Recommendation and (C) background information regarding the deliberations and conclusions of the Companys Board of Directors relating to the Change in Company Recommendation or other factual information reasonably related thereto. 

   

 (b) _Company Shareholders Meeting_. The Company shall, as soon as reasonably practicable following confirmation by the SEC that it has no further comments on the Proxy Statement, duly take all lawful action to establish a record date for, call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its shareholders as promptly as practicable (the " _Company Shareholders Meeting_ ") for the purpose of obtaining the Required Company Vote with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and, unless it is permitted to make a Change in Company Recommendation pursuant to Section 5.4(e), shall use its reasonable best efforts to solicit the adoption of this Agreement by its shareholders in accordance with applicable Law. The Companys Board of Directors shall include the Company Recommendation in the Proxy Statement and shall not (i) withdraw or modify in any manner adverse to Parent (including a change to "neutral"), the Company Recommendation or (ii) publicly propose to, or publicly announce that the Companys Board of Directors has resolved to, take any such action (any of the foregoing, a " _Change in Company Recommendation_ "), except as and to the extent permitted by Section 5.4(e). 

  

 5.2 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_. Upon reasonable notice, the Company shall and shall cause its Subsidiaries to afford to Parent and Parents Representatives and sources of Debt Financing reasonable access, during normal business hours during the period prior to the Effective Time, to the Companys properties, books, contracts, records, officers, employees, 

   ##### 

  

 

agents and liabilities and make available to Parent such financial and other
information concerning its business, properties and personnel as Parent may
reasonably request. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be
required to provide access to or to disclose information where such access or
disclosure would, in the Companys reasonable judgment, violate an obligation
of confidentiality owing to a third party, jeopardize any applicable
privilege of the institution in possession or control of such information or
contravene any Law or any binding agreement entered into prior to the date of
this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, in the event that the Company
does not provide access or information in reliance on the preceding sentence,
it shall provide notice to Parent that it is withholding such access or
information and shall use its reasonable best efforts to communicate, to the
extent feasible, the applicable information in a way that would not violate
the applicable Law or binding agreement or risk waiver of such
privilege. Without limiting the generality of this Section 5.2, from the date
of this Agreement until the Effective Time, the Company shall furnish to
Parent promptly after becoming available (to the extent such items become
available), monthly financial statements, including an unaudited
balance sheet and income statement for each month through the Closing Date,
as it may prepare for managements internal use in accordance with GAAP.
Until the Effective Time, the information provided will be subject to the
terms of the letter agreement, dated February 1, 2011, by and among J.P.
Morgan Securities LLC, on behalf of the Company, and Parent (as may be amended
from time to time, the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "); it being understood
and agreed that any such information may be disclosed as contemplated by
Section 5.15. 

   

 5.3 _Commercially Reasonable Efforts_. 

   

 (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each party will use commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under this Agreement and applicable Laws to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as practicable after the date hereof, including preparing and filing or submitting as promptly as practicable (but in no event later than ten (10) Business Days after the date hereof, unless mutually agreed by the parties), all documentation to effect all necessary applications, notices, filings and other documents and to obtain as promptly as practicable (i) all consents, waivers, orders, approvals, permits, rulings, authorizations and clearances necessary, proper or advisable to be obtained from any Governmental Entity, including under the HSR Act and the GWB and (ii) all material consents, waivers, orders, approvals, permits, rulings, authorizations and clearances necessary, proper or advisable to be obtained from any third party (other than a Governmental Entity), in each case in order to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ that, in connection therewith, without the prior written consent of Parent, none of the Company or its Subsidiaries will make or agree to make any material payment or accept any material conditions or obligations, including amendments to existing conditions or obligations. 

   

 (b) Each of Parent and Company shall, in connection with the efforts referenced in Section 5.3(a), use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) cooperate in all respects with the other in connection with any applications, notices, filings and other 

   ##### 

  

   

documents (including by furnishing all information required in connection
therewith) and in connection with any investigation, inquiry, request for
information or other proceeding or procedure required by any Governmental
Entity or third party in connection with the consents, waivers, orders,
approvals, permits, rulings, authorizations and clearances referenced in
Section 5.3(a), (ii) promptly inform the other party of the status of any of
the matters contemplated hereby, including providing the other party with a
copy of any substantive written communication (or summary of substantive oral
communications) received by such party from any third party or Governmental
Entity, in each case regarding the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (iii) permit the other party
reasonable opportunity to review, and consider in good faith any comments of
such other party to, any substantive written communication to be given to any
third party or Governmental Entity regarding the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (iv) consult with the other
in advance of any meeting or conference with any Governmental Entity and in
advance of any material meeting or conference with any third party, and to the
extent permitted by such Governmental Entity or third party, give the other
party the opportunity to attend and participate in such meetings and
conferences. 

   

 (c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties contained in this Section 5.3, each of Company and Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) resolve any objections, actions or proceedings asserted or instituted by any Governmental Entity or third party challenging the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including to contest and resist any administrative or judicial action or proceeding and to seek to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any judgment, injunction or other decree or order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prevents, materially delays or materially impedes the consummation, or otherwise materially reduces the contemplated benefits, of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (ii) seek to have repealed, rescinded or made inapplicable any Law which would otherwise prevent, delay or impede the consummation, or otherwise materially reduce the contemplated benefits of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

   

 (d) Each of Company and Parent and their respective Boards of Directors shall, if any "moratorium," "control share," "fair price" or other anti-takeover law or regulation becomes applicable to this Agreement, the Merger or any other transactions contemplated hereby, use its reasonable best efforts to ensure that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise to minimize the effect of such law or regulation on this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby. 

  

 5.4 _Acquisition Proposals_. 

   

 (a) The Company agrees that neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any of the officers or directors of it or its Subsidiaries shall, and shall cause its and its

Subsidiaries directors, officers, employees, affiliates, agents and other
representatives (including any investment banker, financial advisor,
attorney, accountant or consultant retained by it or any of its Subsidiaries)
(collectively, " _Representatives_ ") not to, directly or indirectly: 

   

 (i) initiate, solicit, encourage or knowingly facilitate (including by way of providing information) the making of any proposal or offer with respect to, or a single transaction or a series of related transactions to effect, a merger, reorganization, share exchange, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving it or any of its Subsidiaries or any purchase or sale of 15% or more of the consolidated assets (including equity interests of its Subsidiaries) of it and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or any purchase or sale of, or tender or exchange offer for, its voting securities that, if consummated, would result in any person or group of persons (or the shareholders of such person or group of persons) beneficially owning securities representing 15% or more of its or any of its Subsidiaries total voting power (or of the surviving parent entity in such transaction) or any combination of the foregoing types of transactions if the sum of the percentage of consolidated assets (as determined on a book value basis) and Company Common Stock is 15% or more, being hereinafter referred to as an " _Acquisition Proposal_ "; 

   

 (ii) have any discussions with or provide any confidential information or data to any person relating to an Acquisition Proposal, engage in any negotiations concerning an Acquisition Proposal or knowingly facilitate any effort or attempt to make or implement an Acquisition Proposal; or

The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and any of the officers
and directors of it or its Subsidiaries and shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause its and their Representatives to immediately cease and
terminate, any solicitation, arrangement, discussion, negotiation or
cooperation with, or assistance or participation in, or facilitation of, any
such inquiries, proposals, discussions or negotiations with any
persons conducted heretofore by the Company, its Subsidiaries and its and
their Representatives with respect to any Acquisition Proposal and promptly
request and instruct the prompt return or destruction of all confidential
information previously furnished to any such person, and the Company shall
take all reasonably necessary actions to secure its rights and ensure
the performance of any such persons obligations under any applicable
confidentiality agreement. To the extent consistent with its fiduciary
duties, the Company shall take all actions necessary to enforce its rights
under the provisions of any 

   ##### 

  

   

"standstill" agreement between the Company and any person, and shall not
grant any waiver of, or agree to any amendment or modification to, any such
agreement. The Company shall ensure that its Representatives are aware of the
provisions of this Section 5.4, and any violation of the restrictions
contained in this Section 5.4 by its Board of Directors (including any
committee thereof) or its Representatives shall be deemed to be a breach of
this Section 5.4 by the Company. 

   

 (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 5.4(a) or any other provisions of this Agreement, if at any time following the date of this Agreement and prior to obtaining the Required Company Vote, (i) the Company has received an unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal from a third party that the Board of Directors determines in good faith to be bona fide, (ii) such Acquisition Proposal did not result from a breach of this Section 5.4, (iii) the Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside financial and legal advisors that (x) such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal and (y) the failure to take the actions described in clauses (A) and (B) below would be a breach of the Board of Directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law, then the Company may (A) enter into an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement with the persons making such Acquisition Proposal and furnish information with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries pursuant to the Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement with the Company to the persons making the Acquisition Proposal and (B) participate in discussions or negotiations with the persons making such Acquisition Proposal regarding such Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , that the Company shall give written notice to Parent after any such determination by the Board of Directors and before taking any of the actions described in the foregoing clauses (A) and (B). The Company shall concurrently provide Parent with copies of any information or materials provided or made available to any third party which were not previously made available to Parent. 

   

 (c) The Company shall promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) notify Parent in writing of any Acquisition Proposal received by, or any request for non-public information concerning the Company or any of its Subsidiaries related to, or that could reasonably be expected to be related to or from any person or group who could reasonably be expected to make any Acquisition Proposal, or any discussions with or negotiations related to any Acquisition Proposal (including any material changes related to the foregoing), indicating, in connection with such notice, the identity of such person and the material terms and conditions of any such Acquisition Proposal or request for information (including a copy thereof if in writing and any related available documentation or correspondence).

   ##### 

  

   

confidentiality and standstill agreement (including any waivers thereof or
amendments thereto) that contains confidentiality and standstill provisions
that are no less favorable to the Company and no more favorable to any such
third party than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement (an "
_Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement_ ") and neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries shall be party to any agreement that prohibits the Company
from providing to Parent any information provided or made available to any
other person pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement. 

   

 (e) From and after the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the Effective Time or the date, if any, on which this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 7.1, and except as otherwise provided for in the immediately following sentence, neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor any committee thereof shall effectuate a (i) Change in Company Recommendation, (ii) approve or recommend or propose to publicly approve or recommend any Acquisition Proposal or (iii) approve or recommend, or publicly propose to approve or recommend, or execute any letter of intent, agreement in principle, acquisition or other agreement relating to any Acquisition Proposal (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement). The Board of Directors may, at any time prior to receipt of the Required Company Vote, if it determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal and financial advisors) that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors to the Companys shareholders under Ohio Law, (A) effect a Change in Company Recommendation, (B) if the Company receives an unsolicited Acquisition Proposal after the date hereof which constitutes a Superior Proposal after giving effect to all of the adjustments to the terms of this Agreement which may be offered by Parent, approve or recommend such Superior Proposal and/or (C) only in the case of the foregoing clause (B), terminate this Agreement, pursuant to Section 7.1(e) of this Agreement after or concurrently with payment of the Termination Fee in accordance with Section 7.2(c), to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal,  _provided_ , that the Board of Directors may not make a Change in Company Recommendation pursuant to the foregoing clauses (A) or (B) or terminate this Agreement pursuant to the foregoing clause (C) unless the Company has complied with its obligations under this Section 5.4 and: 

   

 (i) the Company shall have provided prior written notice to Parent and Merger Sub of its intention to take any action contemplated in clause (A), (B) or (C) of this Section 5.4(e) at least five (5) days in advance of taking such action (the " _Notice Period_ "), which notice shall specify in reasonable detail (x) the material terms and conditions of any such Superior Proposal, if applicable, (including the identity of the person making such Superior Proposal), and shall have contemporaneously provided a copy of then-current forms of all relevant transaction agreements relating to any such Superior Proposal, if applicable, or if no such agreement exists, a written summary of the material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal and (y) if such Change in Company Recommendation is not being made as a result of a Superior Proposal, the reasons for such action; 

   ##### 

  

   

 (ii) if such Change in Company Recommendation is not being made as a result of a Superior Proposal, during the Notice Period, if requested by Parent, the Company shall have engaged in good faith negotiations with Parent to amend this Agreement in such a manner that would otherwise obviate the need for such Change in Company Recommendation, in which event the Board of Directors shall not make such Change in Company Recommendation; and 

   

 (iii) prior to approving or recommending such Superior Proposal or terminating this Agreement to enter into a proposed definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal, the Company shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, during the Notice Period, negotiate with Parent and Merger Sub in good faith (to the extent Parent and Merger Sub desire to negotiate) to make adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such proposal ceases to be a Superior Proposal, in which event the Company shall not make a Change in Company Recommendation with respect to and shall have no right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(e) as a result of such proposal. 

   

In the event of any material revision to the terms of any Superior Proposal or
any Acquisition Proposal that the Companys Board of Directors determines no
longer constitutes a Superior Proposal, including any change in any price
term thereof, the Company shall be required to deliver a new written notice
to Parent and Merger Sub and to again comply with the requirements of this
Section 5.4(e) with respect to such new written notice, and a new Notice
Period shall commence with respect to such notice. 

   

 (f) Nothing contained in this Section 5.4 shall prohibit the Board of Directors from (i) taking and disclosing to the Companys shareholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act to the extent applicable to an Acquisition Proposal (other than any disclosure of confidential information to third parties prohibited by Section 5.4(e)) or (ii) making any disclosure to its shareholders as, in the good faith determination of the Board of Directors, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, is required by applicable Laws; _provided_ , that clause (ii) shall not be deemed to permit the Board of Directors to make a Change in Company Recommendation except to the extent permitted by Section 5.4(d); _provided further_ , that, notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, any disclosure (other than a "stop-look-and-listen" communication to its shareholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act) made pursuant to Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) shall be deemed to be a Change in Company Recommendation, unless the Board of Directors expressly reaffirms its recommendation to the Companys shareholders in favor of the Merger and this Agreement. The Company shall not submit to the vote of its shareholders any Superior Proposal prior to the termination of this Agreement. 

   

 (g) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Superior Proposal_ " means a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal which the Companys Board of Directors concludes in good faith, after consultation with its outside financial advisors and outside legal advisors, taking into account the legal, financial, regulatory, timing and other aspects of the proposal and the person making the proposal (including any required voting 

   ##### 

  

   

agreements, break-up fees, expense reimbursement provisions and conditions to
consummation): (i) if consummated, would be more favorable to the
unaffiliated shareholders of the Company, than the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, taking into account all terms and conditions
thereof (including all financial, legal, financing, regulatory and other
aspects of such Acquisition Proposal (including the person or group making
the Acquisition Proposal and the conditions for the completion of such
Acquisition Proposal)) and of this Agreement (after giving effect to any
adjustments to the terms and provisions of this Agreement committed to in
writing by the parties hereto in response to such Acquisition Proposal) and
(ii) is fully financed or reasonably capable of being fully financed and is
otherwise reasonably capable of being completed on the terms proposed;
_provided_ that, for purposes of this definition of "Superior Proposal," the
term Acquisition Proposal shall have the meaning assigned to such term in
Section 5.4(a), except that the reference to "15%" in the definition of
"Acquisition Proposal" shall be deemed to be a reference to "75%". 

  

 5.5 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, each of the Company and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to approve in advance in accordance with the procedures set forth in Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act and the Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP SEC No-Action Letter (January 12, 1999) any dispositions of shares of Company Common Stock (including derivative securities with respect to Company Common Stock) resulting from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who is subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company (or who will become subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act as a result of the transactions contemplated hereby). 

  

 5.6 _Fees and Expenses_. Whether or not the Merger is consummated, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party incurring such expense, except as set forth in Section 7.2 herein. 

  

 5.7 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_. 

   

 (a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Entity shall, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, jointly and severally indemnify, defend and hold harmless, and provide advancement of expenses to, each person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date hereof or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, an officer, director or employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (the " _Company Indemnified Parties_ ") against all losses, claims, damages, costs, expenses, liabilities or judgments or amounts that are paid in settlement of or in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation based in whole or in part on or arising in whole or in part out of the fact that such person is or was a director, officer or employee of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, or at or after, the Effective Time (including matters, acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby) to the same extent such persons are indemnified or have the right to advancement of expenses as of the date of this Agreement by the Company pursuant to the Companys Articles of Incorporation, Code of Regulations and indemnification agreements, in existence on the 

   ##### 

  

   

date hereof with any present or former directors, officers or employees

Each of Parent, the Surviving Entity and Company Indemnified Parties shall cooperate in the defense of any Claim and shall provide access to properties and individuals as reasonably requested and furnish, or cause to be furnished, records, information and testimony, and attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials or appeals as may be reasonably requested in connection therewith.

 (d) Parent and the Surviving Entity shall pay (as incurred) all expenses, including reasonable fees and expenses of counsel, which an indemnified person may incur in enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided for in this Section 5.7, provided that the person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances to the extent required by applicable Law. 

   

 (e) If Parent, the Surviving Entity or any of their successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving person in such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in each such case, to the extent necessary, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent and the Surviving Entity, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 5.7. 

   ##### 

  

   

 (f) The provisions of this Section 5.7 are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Company Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives and are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such person may have by contract or otherwise. 

  

 5.8 _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company, of (a) any notice or other communication received by such party from any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby or from any person alleging that the consent of such person is or may be required in connection with the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby, if the subject matter of such communication or the failure of such party to obtain such consent could be material to the Company, the Surviving Entity or Parent, (b) any actions suits, claims, investigations or proceedings commenced or, to such partys Knowledge, threatened against, relating to or involving or otherwise affecting such party or any of its subsidiaries which relate to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (c) the discovery of any fact or circumstance that, or the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event the occurrence or non-occurrence of which, would reasonably be expected to cause or result in any of the conditions to the Merger set forth in Article VI not being satisfied or the satisfaction of those conditions being materially delayed in violation of any provision of this Agreement; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 5.8 shall not (i) cure any breach of, or non-compliance with, any other provision of this Agreement or (ii) limit the remedies available to the party receiving such notice. The parties agree and acknowledge that the Companys, on the one hand, and Parents, on the other hand, compliance or failure of compliance with this Section 5.8 shall not be taken into account for purposes of determining whether the condition referred to in Section 6.2(b) or Section 6.3(b), respectively, shall have been satisfied. 

  

 5.9 _Public Announcements_. The initial press release with respect to the execution of this Agreement shall be a joint press release to be reasonably agreed upon by Parent and the Company. Thereafter, unless and until a Change in Company Recommendation has occurred in accordance with Section 5.4(e) of this Agreement, so long as this Agreement is in effect, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall use reasonable best efforts (a) to develop a joint communications plan related to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, (b) to ensure that all press releases and other public statements with respect to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby shall be consistent with such joint communications plan and (c) except in respect of any announcement required by applicable Law or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with or rules of Nasdaq in which it is impracticable to consult with each other as contemplated by this clause (c), to consult with each other before issuing any press release or, to the extent practical, otherwise making any public statement with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. 

  

 5.10 _Shareholder Litigation_. In the event any shareholder litigation related to this Agreement, the Merger, any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement, or with respect to Company Dissenting Shares is brought against the Company and/or its directors, the Company shall have the right to control the defense of such litigation; _provided_ , that no settlement shall be agreed to without Parents prior written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or 

   ##### 

  

 

delayed). The Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed of the status of
all such litigation, including with respect to any settlement discussions
relating thereto, unless, in the reasonable judgment of the Company, doing so
would result in the loss of attorney-client privilege. 

   

 5.11 _Delisting and De-Registration_. Each of the Company and Parent shall take such actions reasonably required prior to the Effective Time to cause the Companys securities to be de-listed from Nasdaq and de-registered under the Exchange Act as soon as reasonably practicable following the Effective Time. 

  

 5.12 _Resignations_. The Company shall obtain and deliver to Parent at the Closing evidence reasonably satisfactory to Parent of the resignation, effective as of the Effective Time, of all directors of the Company and its Subsidiaries (except those designated by Parent in writing to the Company prior to the Closing). 

  

 5.13 _Section 280G Matters_. No later than twenty (20) Business Days following the date of this Agreement with respect to each "officer" of the Company (as defined in Rule 16a-1(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act) (each, a " _Section 16 Officer_") and any other "disqualified individual" of the Company (as defined in Section 280G(c) of the Code), the Company shall furnish a schedule that sets forth (i) the Companys reasonable, good faith estimate of the maximum amount (separately identifying single and double-trigger amounts and any tax gross-up payments) that could be paid to such Section 16 Officer or other disqualified individual as a result of any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (alone or in combination with any other event), (ii) the "base amount" (as defined in Section 280G(b)(3) of the Code) for each such Section 16 Officer or other disqualified individual, and (iii) the underlying documentation on which such calculations are based.

 5.14 _Employee Information and Consultation_. Parent, the Company and their respective affiliates, as applicable, shall provide one another, upon request, with such information as reasonably necessary to enable the other to comply with its obligations to inform and/or consult with all works councils and any other employee representative bodies, as applicable, in order to comply with applicable Laws in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, and shall take all other necessary and appropriate actions in connection with employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries covered thereby as may be required pursuant to applicable Law. 

  

 5.15 _Financing_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement (including the Companys compliance with Section 5.16), Parent shall, and shall cause its affiliates to, use all reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done all things necessary to consummate the financings contemplated by the Commitment Letters as promptly as possible following the date hereof, including (i) maintaining in effect the Commitment Letters in accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions thereof; (ii) negotiating definitive agreements with respect to the debt financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters on the terms and conditions contained in the Debt Commitment Letters (the 

   ##### 

  

 

" _Debt Financing_ ") and (iii) satisfying on a timely basis all the
conditions to the Debt Financing and the Equity Financing (together, the "
_Financing_ ") contemplated by the Commitment Letters to the extent such
conditions are in Parents or any affiliate of Parents control. Upon
the reasonable request of the Company, Parent shall inform the Company of the
status of its efforts to arrange the financing contemplated by the Commitment
Letters. Parent shall have the right to amend or replace the Debt Commitment
Letters and any related fee letter from time to time between the date hereof
and Closing (A) to add or replace lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners,
syndication agents or similar entities as a party thereto or (B) in any other
manner that would not, taken as a whole, have the effect of (I) reducing the
aggregate amount of the Financing, (II) imposing new or additional conditions
to the receipt of the Financing or otherwise expanding, amending or
modifying any of the conditions to the receipt of the Financing in a manner
that would reasonably be expected to (x) delay or prevent the Closing, (y)
make the timely funding of the Financing or satisfaction of the conditions to
obtaining the Financing less likely to occur, or (III) adversely impacting
the ability of Parent to enforce its rights against the other parties to the
Commitment Letters or any related fee letter. If any portion of the Debt
Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated in the
Debt Financing Commitments, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to
arrange and obtain alternative debt financing from alternative debt sources in
an amount sufficient to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement upon terms and conditions not less favorable, taken as a whole, to
Parent and Merger Sub (in the reasonable judgment of Parent) than those in
the Debt Financing Commitments as promptly as practicable following
the occurrence of such event but no later than the Business Day immediately
prior to the Closing Date. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall any
Guarantor be required to provide any financing other than equity financing,
which equity shall in no event exceed the amount set forth in its respective
Equity Commitment Letter, and in no event shall Parent or Merger Sub be
required to seek or obtain equity financing other than the Equity Financing.
The term "Debt Commitment Letter" shall thereafter be deemed to refer to the
Debt Commitment Letter as so amended or replaced as provided herein. 

   

 5.16 _Cooperation with Financing_. 

   

 (a) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall provide, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to provide, and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause their respective Representatives (including legal and accounting representatives) to provide all necessary or customary cooperation as may reasonably be requested by Parent in connection with the Debt Payoff and the closing of the Financing contemplated by the Commitment Letters and this Agreement, including cooperation that consists of: 

   

 (i) assisting in the preparation for and participating in a customary and reasonable number of meetings, due diligence sessions, presentations, drafting sessions, sessions with rating agencies and road shows, including making available the Representatives and the members of the finance department or other employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries;

Subsidiaries to prospective lenders and containing customary information),
and private placement memoranda, offering memoranda, prospectuses and similar
documents for use in connection with the Debt Financing, including
making available the Representatives and the members of the finance
department or other employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries to assist
Parent in Parents preparation of any required financial information

 (v) furnishing Parent and its financing sources as promptly as practicable with:

 (B) without limiting the requirements of the paragraph above, all financial statements, pro forma financial information, financial data, audit reports and other information regarding the Company of the type that would be required by Regulation S-X and Regulation S-K promulgated under the Securities Act for a registered public offering of non-convertible debt securities of Parent or the

private placement, or otherwise necessary to receive from the Companys
independent accountants customary " _comfort_ " (including " _negative
assurance_ " comfort) with respect to the financial information to be
included in such offering memorandum and which, with respect to any
interim financial statements, shall have been reviewed by the Companys
independent accountants as provided in SAS 100, 

   

 (C) all other information and disclosures relating to the Company as may be reasonably requested by Parent, including such information of the type and form required by Regulation S-X and Regulation S-K promulgated under the Securities Act for registered public offerings of securities on Form S-1 (or any successor form) under the Securities Act, 

   

 (D) an electronic version of the trademarks, service marks and corporate logo of the Company for use in marketing materials for the purpose of facilitating the syndication of the Debt Financing, and 

   

 (E) the authorization letters referred to in Section 5.16(a)(ii) (all such information in this clause (v), the " _Required Information_ "); and 

   

 (vi) using commercially reasonable efforts to take all actions reasonably necessary to (x) permit the prospective lenders to evaluate the Companys current assets, cash management and accounting systems, policies and procedures relating thereto for the purpose of preparing bank memoranda and offering documents and establishing collateral arrangements to the extent customary and reasonable and (y) benefit from the Companys existing lending relationships and (z) establish bank and other accounts and blocked account agreements and lock box arrangements in connection with the foregoing;

 _provided_ that the actions contemplated in the foregoing clauses (i) through
(vii) do not (A) unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (B) require the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to pay any out-of-pocket fees or expenses prior to the Closing
that are not reimbursed by Parent as set forth in Section 5.16(e). All non-
public or other confidential information provided by the Company pursuant to
this Section 5.16(a) shall be kept confidential in a customary manner for
syndicated financings, except that 

    ##### 

  

    

Parent shall be permitted to disclose such information to potential sources
of capital, rating agencies, prospective lenders and investors and their
respective Representatives, during syndication of the Debt Financing
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters, subject to such potential sources
of capital, prospective lenders and investors entering into customary
confidentiality undertakings with respect to such information. 

    

 (b) The Company agrees that it shall inform Parent if, to the Knowledge of the Company, any information regarding the Company in the documents described in Section 5.16(a)(ii) would cause such document to be materially misleading. 

   

 (c) The Company hereby consents to the use of its trade names, trademarks, service marks and corporate logos in connection with the Financing; _provided_ that such trademarks, service marks and corporate logos are used solely in a manner that is not intended to or reasonably likely to harm or disparage the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the reputation or goodwill of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. 

   

 (d) The Company shall reasonably cooperate with Parent in Parents review of and planning for any internal restructuring or reorganization of Subsidiaries, assets or liabilities (a " _Internal Restructuring_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) the Company shall not be required to take any actions to implement any steps (other than the creation of newly formed entities; _provided_ that no transfer of assets to such entities shall be required) on such Internal Restructuring (A) unless Parent has confirmed in writing that it is prepared to proceed immediately to Closing and the Company is satisfied that the Closing will immediately occur thereafter, or (B) if such action would contravene an organizational document of the Company or any of its affiliates or Law; and (ii) such cooperation will not unreasonably interfere with the business or operations of the Company. 

   

 (e) Parent shall promptly, upon written request by the Company, reimburse the Company for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable and documented attorneys fees) incurred by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the cooperation of the Company and its Subsidiaries contemplated by Section 5.16;  _provided_ that the aggregate amount reimbursed by Parent shall not exceed $750,000 without first obtaining Parents prior written consent, and shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives from and against any and all Losses suffered or incurred by any of them in connection with the arrangement of financing and any information used in connection therewith, except to the extent such Losses were caused by the gross negligence or intentional misconduct of the Company, its affiliates or their respective officers, advisors and representatives or by breach of this Agreement by the Company.

which (i) Parent shall have the Required Information, (ii) the conditions set
forth in Section 6.1(a) and 6.1(b) are satisfied and (iii) nothing has
occurred and no condition exists that would cause any 

   ##### 

  

   

of the conditions set forth in Section 6.1(c) or Section 6.2 to fail to
be satisfied, assuming that the Closing Date were to be scheduled at any time
during such twenty (20) consecutive calendar day period; _provided_ that (x)
the Marketing Period shall end on any earlier date that is the date on which
all of the proceeds of the Debt Financing have been obtained, (y) the
Marketing Period shall not include any day from August 19, 2011 to and
including September 5, 2011, and (z) the Marketing Period shall not be deemed
to have commenced if, after the date hereof and prior to the completion of
the Marketing Period:

 (b) the financial statements included in the Required Information that is available to Parent on the first day of any such twenty (20) consecutive calendar day period would be required to be updated under Rule 3-12 of Regulation S-X in order to be sufficiently current on any day during such twenty (20) consecutive calendar day period to permit a registration statement using such financial statements to be declared effective by the SEC on the last day of such twenty (20) consecutive calendar day period, in which case the Marketing Period shall not be deemed to commence unless and until, at the earliest, the receipt by Parent of updated Required Information that would be required under Rule 3-12 of Regulation S-X to permit a registration statement using such financial statements to be declared effective by the SEC on the last day of such new twenty (20) consecutive calendar day period, together with a reasonably detailed schedule of corporate allocations for such updated financial statements; 

   

 (c) the Company issues a public statement indicating its intent to restate any historical financial statements of the Company, in whole or in part, or otherwise indicates its intent or the need to restate any of the financial statements included in the Required Information, or that any such restatement is under consideration or may be a possibility, in which case the Marketing Period shall not be deemed to commence unless and until, at the earliest, such restatement has been completed and the relevant financial statements have been amended or the Company has announced or informed Parent that it has concluded (including the basis for such conclusion) that no restatement of Company Financial Statements shall be required in accordance with accounting principles and practices generally accepted in the United States of America (" _GAAP_ "), applied on a consistent basis with the preparation of Company Financial Statements; or 

   

 (d) the Required Information ceases to be Compliant, in which case the Marketing Period shall not be deemed to commence unless and until, at the earliest, all such Required Information is Compliant. 

 

If at any time the Company shall in good faith reasonably believe that the
Marketing Period has begun, it may deliver to Parent a written notice to that
effect, in which case the Marketing Period will be deemed to have begun on
the date of such notice, unless Parent in good faith reasonably believes the
Marketing Period 

     ##### 

 

  

will be deemed to have begun on the date of such notice, unless Parent in good
faith reasonably believes the Marketing Period has not begun and, within
three (3) Business Days after the delivery of such notice, delivers a written
notice to the Company to that effect, stating with reasonable specificity why
Parent believes the Marketing Period has not begun (including, if Parent
believes the Required Information has not been provided, stating with
reasonable specificity which items of Required Information have not been
provided). 

  

As used in this Agreement, " _Compliant_ " means, with respect to any Required
Information, that such Required Information does not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact regarding the
Company necessary in order to make such Required Information not misleading,

   ##### 

  

   

 (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, each of the parties hereto hereby agrees that it will not bring or support any action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim of any kind or description, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against lenders party to the Debt Commitment Letter and the Debt Financing Sources in any way relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the Debt Financing or the performance thereof, in any forum other than the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York, or if under applicable law exclusive jurisdiction is vested in the Federal courts, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (and the appellate courts thereof) and that the provisions of Section 8.10 regarding a waiver of jury trial shall apply to any such action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim. 

  

 8.7 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability without rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement in any other jurisdiction. If any provision of this Agreement is so broad as to be unenforceable, the provision shall be interpreted to be only so broad as would be enforceable. 

  

 8.8 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations of the parties hereunder shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by either of the parties hereto (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other party, and any attempt to make any such assignment without such consent shall be null and void; _provided_ , that Parent and Merger Sub may assign this Agreement to any of their affiliates; _provided_ , _further_ , that no such assignment shall relieve Parent or Merger Sub of any of its obligations herein. Subject to the immediately preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns. 

  

 8.9 _Specific Performance_. 

   

 (a) The parties recognize and agree that if for any reason any of the provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance with their specific terms or are otherwise breached or violated, immediate and irreparable harm or injury would be caused for which money damages would not be an adequate remedy under applicable Law. Accordingly, each party agrees that, in addition to all other remedies to which it may be entitled, each of the parties is entitled to seek a decree of specific performance and each of the parties shall further be entitled to seek an injunction restraining any violation or threatened violation of any of the provisions of this Agreement without the necessity of posting a bond or other form of security, subject to the provisions of Section 7.2(g), Section 8.9(b) and Section 8.9(c) below. 

   

 (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties hereby further acknowledge and agree that prior to the Closing, the Company shall be entitled to seek 

   ##### 

  

    

specific performance (i) to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of,
and to prevent or cure breaches of Sections 5.3 and 5.15 by Parent or Merger
Sub (but not the right to enforce specifically Parents and/or Merger Subs
obligations consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, including to
effect the Closing in accordance with Section 1.2 (which shall be governed by
the immediately succeeding clause (ii)) and (ii) to cause Parent
and/or Merger Sub to draw down the full proceeds of the Equity Financing and
to cause Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby, including to effect the Closing in accordance with Section 1.2, on
the terms and subject to the conditions in this Agreement, if, but only if
(with respect to this clause (ii)) (x) the Marketing Period has ended and all
of the conditions set forth in Section 6.1 and Section 6.2 were satisfied
as of the date the Closing should have been consummated pursuant to the terms
of this Agreement but for the failure of the Equity Financing to be funded in
accordance with the terms thereof, (y) the Debt Financing has been funded in
accordance with the terms thereof or will be funded in accordance with the
terms thereof at the Closing if the Equity Financing is funded at the Closing
and (z) the Company has irrevocably confirmed that if the Equity Financing
and Debt Financing are funded, then it would take such actions that are within
its control to cause the Closing to occur. Notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary, it is hereby acknowledged and agreed that the Company shall be
entitled to seek specific performance to cause Parent and Merger Sub to
enforce the terms of the Debt Financing Commitment, including by demanding
Parent and/or Merger Sub file one or more lawsuits against the sources of
Debt Financing to fully enforce such sources obligations thereunder and
Parents and Merger Subs rights thereunder, only in the event that each of
the following conditions has been satisfied: (i) all of the conditions set
forth in Sections 6.1 and 6.2 have been satisfied (other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing), and
Parent and Merger Sub fail to complete the Closing by the date the Closing is
required to have occurred pursuant to Section 1.2 and (ii) all of
the conditions to the consummation of the financing provided by the Debt
Financing Commitment (or, if alternative financing is being used in
accordance with Section 5.15, pursuant to the commitments with respect
thereto) have been satisfied (other than those conditions that by their
nature are to be satisfied at the Closing). In the event that any suit, action
or other proceeding should be brought in equity to enforce any of the
provisions of this Agreement, no party will allege, and each party hereby
waives the defense, that there is an adequate remedy under applicable Law. 

   

 (c) For the avoidance of doubt, under no circumstances will the Company or any of its affiliates be entitled, whether in contract, tort or otherwise, to monetary damages in excess of the aggregate amount of (A) the Reverse Termination Fee, (B) any reimbursement obligation of Parent pursuant to the first sentence of Section 7.2(h) and (C) the indemnification, reimbursement and expense obligations of Parent contained in Section 5.16(e). Any party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in connection with any such order or injunction. Until such time as Parent pays the Reverse Termination Fee, the remedies available to the Company pursuant to this Section 8.9 shall be in addition to 

   ##### 

  

    

any other remedy to which it is entitled at law or in equity, and the election
to pursue an injunction or specific performance shall not restrict, impair or
otherwise limit the Company from, in the alternative, seeking to terminate
this Agreement and collect the Reverse Termination Fee under Section 7.2.
