reclassification, reorganization, recapitalization or exchange or other like
change, then (without limiting any other rights of the Parties hereunder), the
Per Share Price or the Exchange Ratio, as applicable, shall be appropriately
and proportionately adjusted to provide to the holders of shares of SSGT
Class A Common Stock, shares of SSGT Class T Common Stock or SSGT OP Units, as
applicable, the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior
to such change. For the avoidance of any doubt, the forgoing provisions
of this _Section_ __ _ 3.1(c)_ shall not apply with respect to any election
by the holder of the SSGT Special Limited Partner Interest to receive SSGT OP
Units in connection with the redemption of the SSGT Special Limited
Partner Interest, as contemplated in _Section_ __ _ 3.1(b)(ii)_.

(d) _Transfer Books_. From and after the REIT Merger Effective Time, the

Effective Time, Persons who held SSGT Common Stock or SSGT OP Units
immediately prior to the REIT Merger Effective Time shall cease to have rights
with respect to such shares or units, except as otherwise provided for in
this Agreement or by applicable Law. On or after the REIT Merger Effective

Merger Consideration.

 

Section 3.2 _Paying Agent; Exchange Fund_.

 

(a) Prior to the mailing of the Proxy Statement, SST II shall appoint a
bank or trust company reasonably satisfactory to SSGT to act as paying agent
(the " _Paying Agent_ ") for the payment and delivery of the REIT Merger
Consideration as provided in _Section_ __ _ 3.1(a)(i)_ and _Section_ __ _
3.1(a)(ii)_. Prior to the REIT Merger Effective Time, SST II shall deposit,
or cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent for the sole benefit of the
holders of shares of SSGT Common Stock, for exchange in accordance with this
_Article III_, immediately available funds equal to the aggregate REIT
Merger Consideration (the " _Exchange Fund_ ").

(b) SST II shall cause the Paying Agent to make, and the Paying Agent
shall make, payments of the REIT Merger Consideration out of the Exchange Fund
in accordance with this Agreement. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any
other purpose. The Exchange Fund shall be invested by the Paying Agent as
directed by SST II; _provided_ , that such investments shall be in (i)
obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America or any agency or
instrumentality thereof and backed by the full faith and credit of the United
States of America, (ii) commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or
better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation,
respectively, or (iii) a money market fund having assets of at least
$1,000,000,000. Interest and other income on the Exchange Fund shall be the
sole and exclusive property of SST II and shall be paid to SST II, as SST II
directs. No investment of the Exchange Fund shall relieve SST II or the Paying
Agent from making the payments required by this _Article III_, and following
any losses from any such investment, SST II shall promptly provide additional
funds to the Paying Agent to the extent necessary to satisfy SST IIs
obligations hereunder for the benefit of the holders of shares of SSGT Common
Stock at the REIT Merger Effective Time, which additional funds will be
deemed to be part of the Exchange Fund.

Section 3.3 _Exchange Procedures_.

 

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable after the REIT Merger Effective Time
(but in no event later than three (3) Business Days thereafter), SST II shall
cause the Paying Agent to mail (and to make available for collection by hand)
to each holder of record of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share representing
shares of SSGT Common Stock (i) a letter of transmittal (a " _Letter of
Transmittal_ ") in customary form as prepared by SST II and reasonably
acceptable to SSGT (which shall specify, among other things, that delivery
shall be effected, and risk 

 



15

    

 of loss and title to the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable,
shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of
loss in lieu thereof) or transfer of any Book-Entry Shares to the Paying
Agent) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates or the transfer of Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the REIT
Merger Consideration into which the number of shares of SSGT Common Stock
previously represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall have been
converted pursuant to this Agreement.

 

(b) Upon (i) surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu
thereof) or transfer of any Book-Entry Share representing shares of SSGT
Common Stock to the Paying Agent, together with a properly completed and
validly executed Letter of Transmittal or (ii) receipt of an "agents message"
by the Paying Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the
Paying Agent may reasonably request) in the case of transfer of a Book-Entry
Share, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying
Agent, the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share representing shares
of SSGT Common Stock shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the
REIT Merger Consideration into which such shares of SSGT Common Stock shall
have been converted pursuant to this Agreement, after the Paying Agents
receipt of such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or
"agents message" or other evidence, and the Certificate (or affidavit of loss
in lieu thereof) so surrendered or the Book-Entry Share so transferred, as
applicable, shall be forthwith cancelled. The Paying Agent shall accept such
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) and Book-Entry Shares
upon compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Paying Agent
may impose to effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with customary
exchange practices. Until surrendered or transferred as contemplated by this
_Section_ __ _ 3.3_, each Certificate or Book-Entry Share representing shares
of SSGT Common Stock shall be deemed, at any time after the REIT Merger
Effective Time, to represent only the right to receive, upon such surrender,
the REIT Merger Consideration as contemplated by this _Article III_. No
interest shall be paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of the
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on the REIT Merger Consideration payable
upon the surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares.

 

(c) In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of SSGT Common Stock
that is not registered in the transfer records of SSGT, it shall be a
condition of payment that any Certificate or Book-Entry Share surrendered or
transferred in accordance with the procedures set forth in this _Section_ __ _
3.3_ shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for
transfer, and that the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any
Taxes required by reason of the payment of the REIT Merger Consideration to a
Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, or
Book-Entry Share transferred, or shall have established to the reasonable
satisfaction of SST II that such Tax either has been paid or is not
applicable.

 

(d) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the
holders of SSGT Common Stock for twelve (12) months after the REIT Merger
Effective Time shall be delivered to SST II upon demand, and any former
holders of SSGT Common Stock prior to the REIT Merger who have not theretofore
complied with this _Article III_ shall thereafter look only to SST II for
payment of their claims with respect thereto.

(e) None of the SSGT Parties, the SST II Parties, the Surviving Entity,
the Paying Agent, or any employee, officer, director, agent or Affiliate of
such entities, shall be liable to any Person in respect of the REIT Merger
Consideration if the Exchange Fund (or the appropriate portion thereof) has
been delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Law. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders
of any shares of SSGT Common Stock immediately prior to the time at which
such amounts would otherwise escheat to, or become property of, any
Governmental Authority shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
become the property of SST II free and clear of any claims or interest of such
holders or their successors, assigns or personal representatives previously
entitled thereto.

Section 3.4 _Withholding Rights_. Each Party (including the Surviving
Entity and the Surviving Partnership) and the Paying Agent, as applicable,
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration and any
other amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of
SSGT Common Stock or SSGT OP Units, such amounts as it is required to deduct
and withhold with respect to such payments under the

 



16

    

 Code or any other provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. Any such
amounts so deducted and withheld shall be paid over to the applicable
Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable Law and shall be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

 

Section 3.5 _SSGT Restricted Shares_. Immediately prior to the REIT Merger
Effective Time, each SSGT Restricted Share granted under the SSGT Equity
Incentive Plan shall be fully vested and non-forfeitable, and all SSGT Common
Stock represented thereby shall be considered outstanding for all purposes of
this Agreement and subject to the right to receive the REIT Merger
Consideration, subject to _Section_ __ _ 3.4_.

 

Section 3.6 _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, then upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by SST II, the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable
amount as SST II may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will pay in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the REIT Merger
Consideration to which the holder thereof is entitled pursuant to this 
_Article III_.

Section 3.7 _Dissenters Rights_. No dissenters or appraisal rights
shall be available with respect to the Mergers or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 

Section 3.8 _General Effects of the Mergers_.

be as set forth in this Agreement and as provided in the applicable
provisions of the MGCL and the MLLCA. Without limiting the generality of the

procedures are effective in timely alerting SSGTs management to material
information required to be included in SSGTs periodic reports required under
the Exchange Act (if SST II were required to file such reports). SSGT and SSGT
Subsidiaries have designed and maintained a system of internal control over
financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the
Exchange Act) sufficient to provide reasonable assurances (A) regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements in accordance with GAAP, (B) that transactions are executed in
accordance with managements general or specific authorizations, (C) that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements and to maintain asset accountability, (D) that access to
assets is permitted only in accordance with managements general or specific
authorization, (E) that the recorded accountability for assets is compared
with the existing assets at reasonable intervals and appropriate action is
taken with respect to any differences and (F) that accounts, notes and other
receivables and inventory are recorded accurately, and proper and adequate
procedures are implemented to effect the collection thereof on a current and
timely basis. SSGT has disclosed to SSGTs auditors and audit committee (and
made summaries of such disclosures available to SST II) (A) any significant
deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal
control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely
affect in any material respect SSGTs ability to record, process, summarize
and report financial information and (B) any fraud, to the Knowledge of SSGT,
whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have
a significant role in internal control over financial reporting.

 

(e) SSGT is not and none of the SSGT Subsidiaries is, a party to, and
neither SSGT nor any SSGT Subsidiary has any commitment to become a party to,
any joint venture, off-balance sheet partnership or any similar Contract,
including any Contract relating to any transaction or relationship between or
among SSGT and any SSGT Subsidiary, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated
Affiliate of SSGT or any SSGT Subsidiary, including any structured finance,
special purpose or limited purpose entity or Person, on the other hand, or
any "off-balance sheet arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation
S-K of the SEC), where the result, purpose or effect of such Contract is to
avoid disclosure of any material transaction involving, or material
liabilities of, SSGT, any SSGT Subsidiary or SSGTs or such SSGT Subsidiarys
audited financial statements or other SSGT SEC Documents.

 

(f) Neither SSGT nor any SSGT Subsidiary is required to be registered as an
investment company under the Investment Company Act.

(g) Neither SSGT nor any SSGT Subsidiary nor, to the Knowledge of SSGT, any
director, officer or Representative of SSGT or any SSGT Subsidiary has (i)
used any corporate funds for any unlawful contributions, gifts, entertainment
or other unlawful expenses related to political activity, (ii) made any
unlawful payment to any foreign or domestic government official or employee
or (iii) made any unlawful bribe, rebate, payoff, kickback or other unlawful
payment to any foreign or domestic government official or employee, in each
case, in violation in any material respect of any applicable Anti-Corruption
Law. Neither SSGT nor any SSGT Subsidiary has received any written
communication that alleges that SSGT or any SSGT Subsidiary, or any of their
respective Representatives, is, or may be, in violation of, or has, or
may have, any liability under, any Anti-Corruption Law.

this Agreement, (i) SSGT and each SSGT Subsidiary has conducted its business
in all material respects in the ordinary course of business consistent with
past practice, (ii) neither SSGT nor any SSGT Subsidiary has taken any action
that would have been prohibited by _Section_ __ _ 6.1(b)_ (Conduct of the
Business by SSGT) if taken from and after the date of this Agreement and
(iii) there has not been any SSGT Material Adverse Effect or any event,
circumstance, change, effect, development, condition or occurrence that,
individually or in the aggregate with all other events, circumstances,
changes, effects, developments, conditions or occurrences, would reasonably
be expected to have a SSGT Material Adverse Effect.

 

Section 4.7 _No Undisclosed Liabilities_. Except (i) as disclosed,
reflected or reserved against on the consolidated balance sheet of SSGT and
the SSGT Subsidiaries dated as of December 31, 2017 (including the notes
thereto), (ii) for liabilities or obligations incurred in connection with the

(a) Except for the authorizations, licenses, permits, certificates,
approvals, variances, exemptions, orders, franchises, certifications and
clearances that are the subject of _Section_ __ _ 4.10_ and _Section_ __ _
4.11_, which are addressed solely in those Sections, SSGT and each SSGT
Subsidiary is in possession of all authorizations, licenses, permits,
certificates, approvals, variances, exemptions, orders, franchises,
certifications, registrations and clearances of any Governmental Authority ("
_Permits_ ") necessary for SSGT and each SSGT Subsidiary to own, lease and,
to the extent applicable, operate their respective properties or to carry on
their respective businesses substantially as they are being conducted as of
the date hereof (the " _SSGT Permits_ "), and all such SSGT Permits are valid
and in full force and effect, except where the failure to be in possession of,
or the failure to be valid or in full force and effect of, any of the SSGT
Permits, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected
to have a SSGT Material Adverse Effect. No event has occurred with respect to
any of the SSGT Permits which permits, or after notice or lapse of time or
both would permit, revocation or termination thereof or would result in any
other material impairment of the rights of the holder of any such SSGT
Permits. To the Knowledge of SSGT, there is not pending any applicable
petition, objection or other pleading with any Governmental Authority having
jurisdiction or authority over the operations of SSGT or the SSGT
Subsidiaries that impairs the validity of any SSGT Permit or which would
reasonably be expected, if accepted or granted, to result in the revocation of
any SSGT Permit, except where the impairment or revocation of any such SSGT
Permit would not adversely affect the ownership or operation of any material
SSGT Property.

(b) Neither SSGT nor any SSGT Subsidiary is, and for the past three (3)
years has been, in conflict with, or in default or violation of (i) any Law
applicable to SSGT or any SSGT Subsidiary or by which any property or asset of
SSGT or any SSGT Subsidiary is bound (except for compliance with Laws
addressed in _Section_ __ _ 4.10_, _Section_ __ _ 4.11_, _Section_ __ _
4.13_ and _Section_ __ _ 4.16_ which are solely addressed in those
Sections), or (ii) any SSGT Permits (except for the SSGT Permits addressed in
_Section_ __ _ 4.10_ or _Section_ __ _ 4.11_, which are solely addressed in
those Sections), except, in each case, for any such conflicts, defaults or
violations that, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
expected to have a SSGT Material Adverse Effect.

 

Section 4.9 _Litigation_. There is no material action, suit, proceeding or
investigation to which SSGT or any SSGT Subsidiary is a party (either as
plaintiff or defendant) pending or, to the Knowledge of SSGT, threatened
before any Governmental Authority, and, to the Knowledge of SSGT, there is no
basis for any such action, suit, proceeding or investigation. Neither SSGT
nor any SSGT Subsidiary has been permanently or temporarily enjoined by any
Order, judgment or decree of any Governmental Authority from engaging in or
continuing to

 



23

    

 conduct the business of SSGT or the SSGT Subsidiaries. No Order of any
Governmental Authority has been issued in any proceeding to which SSGT or any
of the SSGT Subsidiaries is or was a party, or, to the Knowledge of SSGT, in
any other proceeding, that enjoins or requires SSGT or any of the SSGT
Subsidiaries to take action of any kind with respect to its businesses, assets
or properties. Since December 31, 2017, none of SSGT, any SSGT Subsidiary or
any Representative of the foregoing has received or made any settlement offer
for any material Action to which SSGT or any SSGT Subsidiary is a party or
potentially could be a party (in each case, either as plaintiff
or defendant), other than settlement offers that do not exceed $500,000
individually.

Effect, neither SSGT nor any SSGT Subsidiary has received written notice of
any uncured violation of any Law (including zoning, building or similar Laws)
affecting any portion of any of the SSGT Properties issued by
any Governmental Authority; and (iii) except as would not, individually or in
the aggregate, have a SSGT Material Adverse Effect, neither SSGT nor any SSGT
Subsidiary has received written notice to the effect that there are
condemnation or rezoning proceedings that are currently pending or threatened
with respect to any of the SSGT Properties.

(b) Except as disclosed in property condition assessments and similar
structural engineering reports relating to the SSGT Properties, SSGT has not
received written notice of, nor does SSGT have any Knowledge of, any latent
defects or adverse physical conditions affecting any of the SSGT Properties
or the improvements thereon that have not been corrected or cured prior to the
date of this Agreement, except as would not, individually or in the aggregate,
have a SSGT Material Adverse Effect.

 

(c) SSGT and the SSGT Subsidiaries have good title to, or a valid and
enforceable leasehold interest in, all material personal property assets
owned, used or held for use by them. Neither SSGTs, nor the SSGT
Subsidiaries, ownership of any such personal property is subject to any
Liens, other than Permitted Liens.

aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a SSGT Material Adverse
Effect: (i) no notification, demand, request for information, citation,
summons or order has been received, no complaint has been filed, no penalty
has been assessed and no investigation, action, suit or proceeding is pending

Permits are valid and in full force and effect; and (iv) there are no
liabilities or obligations of the SSGT Parties or any of the other SSGT
Subsidiaries of any kind whatsoever, whether accrued, contingent, absolute,
determined, determinable or otherwise arising under or relating to any
Environmental Law or any Hazardous Substance and there is no condition,
situation or set of circumstances that would reasonably be expected to result
in any such liability or obligation.

4.12(a)_ to which SSGT or any SSGT Subsidiary is a party or by which it is
bound as of the date hereof is referred to herein as a " _SSGT Material
Contract_."

 

(c) Each SSGT Material Contract is legal, valid, binding and enforceable on
SSGT and/or the SSGT Subsidiary that is a party thereto and, to the Knowledge
of SSGT, each other party thereto, and is in full force and effect, except as
may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other
similar Laws affecting creditors rights generally and by general principles
of equity (regardless of whether enforceability is considered in a proceeding

under each SSGT Material Contract and, to the Knowledge of SSGT, each other
party thereto has performed all obligations required to be performed by it
under such SSGT Material Contract prior to the date hereof, except where in

received notice of any violation or default under, or owes any termination,
cancellation or other similar fees or any liquidated damages with respect to,
any SSGT Material Contract, except for violations or defaults, or fees or

as of the date hereof, neither SSGT nor any SSGT Subsidiary has received any
written notice of the intention of any party to cancel, terminate, materially
change the scope of rights under or fail to renew any SSGT Material Contract.

Section 4.13 _Taxes_.

 

(a) Each SSGT Party and each other SSGT Subsidiary has timely filed with
the appropriate Governmental Authority all United States federal income Tax
Returns and all other material Tax Returns required to be filed, taking into
account any extensions of time within which to file such Tax Returns, and all
such Tax Returns were complete and correct in all material respects. Each
SSGT Party and each other SSGT Subsidiary has duly paid (or there has been
paid on their behalf), or made adequate provisions in accordance with GAAP
for, all material Taxes required to be paid by them, whether or not shown on
any Tax Return. No written claim has been proposed by any Governmental
Authority in any jurisdiction where SSGT or any SSGT Subsidiary do not file
Tax Returns that SSGT or any SSGT Subsidiary is or may be subject to Tax by
such jurisdiction.

 

(b) SSGT (i) for all taxable years commencing with SSGTs year ending
December 31, 2014 and through December 31, 2017, has been subject to taxation
as a real estate investment trust (a " _REIT_ ") under Sections 856 through
860 of the Code and has satisfied all requirements to qualify as a REIT for
such years; (ii) has operated since January 1, 2014 to the date hereof, in a
manner consistent with the requirements for qualification and taxation as a
REIT; (iii) intends to continue to operate in such a manner as to qualify as a
REIT for its taxable year that will include the day of the REIT Merger; and
(iv) has not taken or omitted to take any action that could reasonably be
expected to result in a challenge by the IRS or any other Governmental
Authority to its status as a REIT, and no such challenge is pending or, to
the Knowledge of SSGT, threatened. No SSGT Subsidiary is a corporation for
United States federal income tax purposes, other than a corporation that
qualifies

 



26

    

 as a Qualified REIT Subsidiary or as a Taxable REIT Subsidiary. SSGTs
dividends paid deduction, within the meaning of Section 561 of the Code, for
all taxable years commencing with SSGTs year ending December 31, 2014,
taking into account any dividends subject to Sections 857(b)(8) or 858 of the
Code, has not been less than the sum of (A) SSGTs REIT taxable income, as
defined in Section 857(b)(2) of the Code, determined without regard to any
dividends paid deduction for such year and (B) SSGTs net capital gain for
such year.

 

(c) (i) There are no audits, investigations by any Governmental Authority
or other proceedings pending or, to the Knowledge of SSGT, threatened with
regard to any material Taxes or material Tax Returns of SSGT or any SSGT
Subsidiary, or of any SSGT Manager for which SSGT or any SSGT Subsidiary would
owe indemnification obligations; (ii) no material deficiency for Taxes of
SSGT or any SSGT Subsidiary, or of any SSGT Manager for which SSGT or any SSGT
Subsidiary would owe indemnification obligations, has been claimed, proposed
or assessed in writing or, to the Knowledge of SSGT, threatened, by any
Governmental Authority, which deficiency has not yet been settled except for
such deficiencies which are being contested in good faith or with respect to
which the failure to pay, individually or in the aggregate, would not
reasonably be expected to have a SSGT Material Adverse Effect; (iii) neither
SSGT nor any SSGT Subsidiary has waived any statute of limitations with
respect to the assessment of material Taxes or agreed to any extension of time
(other than pursuant to an automatic extension to file a Tax Return requested
in the ordinary course of business) with respect to any material Tax
assessment or deficiency for any tax year that is not closed under the
applicable statute of limitations; (iv) neither SSGT nor any SSGT Subsidiary
is currently the beneficiary of any extension of time within which to file any
material Tax Return (other than pursuant to an automatic extension to a file a
Tax Return requested in the ordinary course of business); and (v) neither
SSGT nor any SSGT Subsidiary has entered into any "closing agreement" as
described in Section 7121 of the Code (or any corresponding or similar
provision of state, local or foreign income Tax Law).

 

(d) Each SSGT Subsidiary that is a partnership, joint venture or limited
liability company and that has not elected to be a Taxable REIT Subsidiary
has been since its formation treated for United States federal income tax
purposes as a partnership, disregarded entity, or Qualified REIT Subsidiary,
as the case may be, and not as a corporation, an association taxable as a
corporation whose separate existence is respected for United States federal
income tax purposes, or a "publicly traded partnership" within the meaning of
Section 7704(b) of the Code that is treated as a corporation for
United States federal income tax purposes under Section 7704(a) of the Code.

(e) Neither SSGT nor any SSGT Subsidiary holds any asset the disposition
of which would be subject to Treasury Regulation Section 1.337(d)-7, nor have
they disposed of any such asset during its current taxable year.

 

(f) Since its inception, SSGT and the SSGT Subsidiaries have not incurred
(i) any material liability for Taxes under Sections 857(b)(1), 857(b)(4),
857(b)(5), 857(b)(6)(A), 857(b)(7), 860(c) or 4981 of the Code, (ii) any
liability for Taxes under Sections 857(b)(5) (for income test violations),
856(c)(7)(C) (for asset test violations), or 856(g)(5)(C) (for violations of
other qualification requirements applicable to REITs) and (iii) any material
liability for Tax other than (A) in the ordinary course of business consistent
with past practice, or (B) transfer or similar Taxes arising in connection
with sales of property. No event has occurred, and to the Knowledge of SSGT no
condition or circumstances exists, which presents a material risk that any
material liability for Taxes described clause (i) or (iii) of the preceding
sentence or any liability for Taxes described in clause (ii) of the preceding
sentence will be imposed upon SSGT or any SSGT Subsidiary for any taxable
period (or portion thereof) preceding the REIT Merger.

 

(g) SSGT and the SSGT Subsidiaries have complied, in all material respects,
with all applicable Laws relating to the payment and withholding of Taxes
(including withholding of Taxes pursuant to Sections 1441, 1442, 1445, 1446
and 3402 of the Code or similar provisions under any state and foreign Laws)
and have duly and timely withheld and, in each case, have paid over to the
appropriate taxing authorities all material amounts required to be so withheld
and paid over on or prior to the due date thereof under all applicable Laws.

prior to the date of this Agreement or (ii) in a distribution which could
otherwise constitute part of a "plan" or "series of related transactions"
(within the meaning of Section 355(e) of the Code) in conjunction with

Closing, after giving effect to all of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, the SST II Parties, taken as a whole and not individually, will be
Solvent. For purposes of this  _Section_ __ _ 5.4_, " _Solvent_ " means

SST II Parties, taken as a whole, will not have, as of such date, an
unreasonably small amount of capital with which to conduct its business. For

refinancings, or a combination thereof, to meet its obligations as they become
due.

information as required under applicable Law or (B) after consent by SST II,
if additional time is reasonably required to solicit proxies representing a
sufficient number of shares of SSGT Common Stock to obtain the Stockholder
Approval.

Section 7.2 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

(a) During the Interim Period, to the extent permitted by applicable Law:

Contracts, personnel and records; and (ii) SSGT shall, and shall cause the
SSGT Subsidiaries to, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its
Representatives to, furnish reasonably promptly to SST II any information

Representatives with access to or to disclose information (i) that is subject
to the terms of a confidentiality agreement with a third party entered into
prior to the date of this Agreement or entered into after the date of this
Agreement in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice or
in accordance with this Agreement ( _provided_ , _however_ , SSGT shall use
its reasonable best efforts to obtain the required consent of such third party
to such access or disclosure), (ii) the disclosure of which would violate any
Law applicable to SSGT, any of the SSGT Subsidiaries or any of
their respective Representatives ( _provided_ , _however_ , that SSGT shall
use its reasonable best efforts to make appropriate substitute arrangements to
permit reasonable disclosure not in violation of any Law or duty), (iii) that
is subject to any attorney-client, attorney work product or other legal
privilege ( _provided_ , _however_ , that SSGT shall use its reasonable best
efforts to allow for such access or disclosure to the maximum extent that does
not result in a loss of any such attorney-client, attorney work product or
other legal privilege, including by means of entry into a customary joint
defense agreement that would alleviate the loss of such privilege) or (iv) for
the purpose of allowing SST II or its Representatives to collect samples of
soil, air, water, groundwater or building materials. SST II will use its

the SSGT Subsidiaries that may result from the requests for access, data and
information hereunder. Prior to the REIT Merger Effective Time, SST II shall
not, and shall cause the SST II Subsidiaries and their respective
Representatives and Affiliates not to, contact or otherwise communicate with
parties with which SSGT or any SSGT Subsidiaries has a business relationship
regarding the business of SSGT and the SSGT Subsidiaries or this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement without the prior
written consent of SSGT ( _provided_ , that, for the avoidance of doubt,

from contacting such parties in pursuing the business of SST II operating in
the ordinary course).

(b) SST II will hold, and will cause the SST II Subsidiaries and their
respective Representatives and Affiliates to hold, any non-public
information, including any information exchanged pursuant to this _Section_ __

required to be disclosed under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that
in the case of this clause (iv), to the extent any such disclosure addresses
the approval, recommendation or declaration of advisability by the SSGT Board
with respect to this Agreement or an Acquisition Proposal, such disclosure
shall be deemed to be an Adverse Recommendation Change if not accompanied by
an express public re-affirmation of the SSGT Board Recommendation. For
purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Go Shop Bidder_ " shall mean any
Person (including its controlled Affiliates and Representatives) that submits
a proposal or offer regarding an Acquisition Proposal not later than the Go
Shop Period End Time that has not been withdrawn and that the SSGT Special
Committee determines prior to the Go Shop Period End Time (or in the case of
any Acquisition Proposal received less than five (5) Business Days before the

expected to result in, a Superior Proposal; _provided_ , that a Go Shop Bidder
shall cease to be a Go Shop Bidder if the negotiations between SSGT and such
Go Shop Bidder with respect to the Acquisition Proposal that resulted in such
Go Shop Bidder becoming a Go Shop Bidder shall have been terminated. No later
than two (2) Business Days after the Go Shop Period End Time, SSGT shall
notify SST II in writing of the identity of each Go Shop Bidder and provide

any related transaction documents and financing commitments, if any) to SSGT
or any SSGT Subsidiary and (B) a written summary of the material terms of any
related Acquisition Proposal not made in writing (including any material terms

_Section_ __ _ 7.3(d)_, _Section_ __ _ 7.3(e)_ and _Section_ __ _ 7.3(f)_,
and except with respect to a Go Shop Bidder, from and after the Go Shop Period
End Time, SSGT shall not, and shall cause each of the SSGT Subsidiaries not
to, and shall not authorize or permit any of its or their Representatives to,
(i) initiate, solicit or knowingly encourage or facilitate any inquiries or
the making of any proposal, offer or other action that constitutes any
Acquisition Proposal, (ii) enter into, continue or otherwise participate in
any discussions or negotiations with any Person, or furnish to any Person

information, in furtherance of such inquiries or to obtain an Acquisition
Proposal, (iii) release any Person from or fail to enforce any standstill

in principle, arrangement, understanding, contract or agreement (whether
binding or not) contemplating or otherwise relating to an Acquisition
Proposal, or (vii) take any action to exempt any Person from any Takeover

each SSGT

 



41

    

 Subsidiary and (B) each Representative of SSGT and the SSGT Subsidiaries to,
immediately cease any discussions, negotiations or communications with any
Person with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or potential Acquisition
Proposal (other than as permitted by _Section_ __ _ 7.3(a)_, _Section_ __ _
7.3(c)_ or _Section_ __ _ 7.3(d)_) and shall immediately terminate all
physical and electronic data room access previously granted to any such
person. SSGT agrees that in the event any Representative of SSGT or any SSGT
Subsidiary takes any action that, if taken by SSGT or a SSGT Subsidiary, would
constitute a material violation of this _Section_ __ _ 7.3(b)_, then SSGT
shall be deemed to be in violation of this _Section_ __ _ 7.3(b)_ for all
purposes of this Agreement.

 

(c) At any time prior to the date that is five (5) Business Days after the
Go Shop Period End Time, the SSGT Board may, if the SSGT Board determines in
good faith (and based on the recommendation of the SSGT Special Committee
after consultation with its legal advisor) that failing to do so would be
inconsistent with the directors duties under applicable Law, upon receipt by
SSGT of an Acquisition Proposal from a Go Shop Bidder that constitutes a
Superior Proposal, give notice of its intention to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.1(c)(ii)_ and enter into an agreement related
to such Superior Proposal, _provided_ , that:

(i) SSGT has notified SST II in writing that the SSGT Board intends to
enter into an agreement relating to such Superior Proposal, attaching the most
current version of such agreement (including any amendments, supplements or
modifications) to such notice (a " _SSGT Notice of Intention_ "); and

(ii) during the five (5) Business Day period following SST IIs receipt of
a SSGT Notice of Intention, SSGT shall have offered to negotiate with (and, if
accepted, negotiated in good faith with), and shall have caused its respective
financial and legal advisors to offer to negotiate with (and, if accepted,
negotiate in good faith with), SST II in making adjustments to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement such that the Superior Proposal ceases to be a
Superior Proposal; _provided_ , that any amendment, supplement or modification
to any Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed a new Acquisition Proposal and
SSGT may not enter into any such Superior Proposal pursuant this _Section_ __
_ 7.3(c)_ unless SSGT has complied with the requirements of this  _Section_
__ _ 7.3(c)_ with respect to such Acquisition Proposal including sending a
SSGT Notice of Intention (except that the new negotiation period under this
_Section_ __ _ 7.3(c)_ shall be three (3) Business Days instead of five (5)
Business Days).

(d) At any time beginning on the sixth (6th) Business Day after the Go
Shop Period End Time and prior to receipt of the Stockholder Approval, the
SSGT Board may, if the SSGT Board determines in good faith (and based on the
recommendation of the SSGT Special Committee after consultation with its
legal advisor) that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with the
directors duties under applicable Law, upon receipt by SSGT of an Acquisition
Proposal that constitutes a Superior Proposal (whether or not from a Go Shop
Bidder), make an Adverse Recommendation Change (and SSGT may terminate this
Agreement in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 9.1(c)(iii)_ and enter into an
agreement related to such Superior Proposal); _provided_ , that:

 

(i) (A) such Acquisition Proposal did not result from SSGTs material
breach of its obligations under this _Section_ __ _ 7.3_, and (B) the SSGT
Board has determined in good faith (and based on the recommendation of the
SSGT Special Committee after consultation with its legal and financial
advisors) that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and
that the failure of SSGT to make an Adverse Recommendation Change would be
inconsistent with the directors duties under applicable Law, taking into
account all adjustments to the terms of this Agreement that may be offered by
SST II pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.3(d)(iii)_;

 

(ii) SSGT has notified SST II in writing that the SSGT Board intends to
make an Adverse Recommendation Change (a " _Adverse Recommendation Change
Notice_ "); and

(iii) during the five (5) Business Day period following SST IIs receipt
of an Adverse Recommendation Change Notice, SSGT shall have offered to
negotiate with (and, if accepted,

 



42

    

 negotiated in good faith with), and shall have caused its respective
financial and legal advisors to offer to negotiate with (and, if accepted,
negotiate in good faith with), SST II in making adjustments to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement such that in circumstances involving or relating
to an Acquisition Proposal, the Superior Proposal ceases to be a Superior
Proposal; _provided_ that any change in the consideration offered or any
other material amendment, supplement or modification to any Acquisition
Proposal shall be deemed a new Acquisition Proposal and SSGT may not make an
Adverse Recommendation Change unless SSGT has complied with the requirements
of this  _Section_ __ _ 7.3(d)_ with respect to each such new Acquisition
Proposal including sending an Adverse Recommendation Change Notice with
respect to each such new Acquisition Proposal (except that the new negotiation
period under this _Section_ __ _ 7.3(d)(iii)_ shall be three (3) Business
Days instead of five (5) Business Days). Notwithstanding anything in this
_Section_ __ _ 7.3(d)(iii)_, SST IIs rejection of SSGTs offer to negotiate
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 7.3(d)(iii)_ shall not have any bearing on
SST IIs right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _
9.1(d)(ii)_ herein.

 

(e) At any time prior to receipt of the Stockholder Approval and subject to
_Section_ __ _ 7.1(c)_, the SSGT Board may, if the SSGT Board determines in
good faith (and based on the recommendation of the SSGT Special Committee
after consultation with its legal advisor) that the failure to do so would be
inconsistent with the directors duties under applicable Law, make an Adverse
Recommendation Change in response to an Intervening Event.

(f) Nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 7.3_ or elsewhere in this Agreement
shall prevent the SSGT Board or SSGT, directly or indirectly, from (i) taking
and disclosing to the stockholders of SSGT a position contemplated by Rule
14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal, making any required disclosure to the stockholders of
SSGT under applicable Law, including Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the
Exchange Act or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A or (ii) making any disclosure
to the stockholders of SSGT if the SSGT Board determines in good faith (and
based on the recommendation of the SSGT Special Committee after consultation
with its legal advisors) that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with
the directors duties under applicable Law;  _provided_ , _however_ , that to
the extent any such disclosure addresses the approval, recommendation or
declaration of advisability by the SSGT Board with respect to this Agreement
or an Acquisition Proposal, such disclosure shall be deemed to be an Adverse
Recommendation Change if not accompanied by an express public re-affirmation
of the SSGT Board Recommendation.

such Acquisition Proposal that the SSGT Board deems relevant and conditions
to consummation thereof)) to be more favorable from a financial point of view
to the stockholders of SSGT (in their capacities as stockholders) than the
Mergers and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (as it may
be proposed to be amended by SST II).

Recommendation Change or any action taken pursuant to, and in accordance with,
_Section_ __ _ 7.1_ or _Section_ __ _ 7.3_, so long as this Agreement is in

that would limit the freedom of such Party, its subsidiaries (including

or their ability to retain, one or more of their businesses, product lines
or assets.

(b) In connection with and without limiting the foregoing _Section_ __ _
7.5(a)_, each of the Parties shall give (or shall cause their respective
Affiliates to give) any notices to third parties, and each of the Parties
shall use, and cause each of their respective Affiliates to use, its
reasonable best efforts to obtain any third party consents that are
necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the Mergers and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each of the Parties will, and
shall cause their respective Affiliates to, furnish to the other such
necessary information and reasonable assistance as the other may request in

Affiliates that appears in any filing made with, or written materials
submitted to, any Governmental Authority in connection with the Mergers and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except that
confidential competitively sensitive business information may be redacted from
such exchanges. To the extent reasonably practicable, neither Party shall,
nor shall they permit their respective Representatives to, participate
independently in any meeting or engage in any substantive conversation with
any Governmental Authority in respect of any filing, investigation or other
inquiry without giving the other Party prior notice of such meeting or
conversation and, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, without giving

sentence, the Parties shall cooperate with respect to reasonable
accommodations that may be requested or appropriate to obtain such consents.

 

Section 7.6 _Notification of Certain Matters; Transaction Litigation_.

 

(a) The SSGT Parties and their Representatives shall give prompt notice to
the SST II Parties, and the SST II Parties and their Representatives shall
give prompt notice to the SSGT Parties, of any notice or other communication
received by such Party from any Governmental Authority in connection with this
Agreement, the Mergers or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, or from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or
may be required in connection with the Mergers or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(b) The SSGT Parties and their Representatives shall give prompt notice to
the SST II Parties, and the SST II Parties and their Representatives shall
give prompt notice to the SSGT Parties, if (i) any representation or warranty
made by it contained in this Agreement becomes untrue or inaccurate such that
it would be reasonable 

 



45

    

 to expect that the applicable closing conditions would be incapable of being
satisfied by the Outside Date or (ii) it fails to comply with or satisfy in
any material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with
or satisfied by it under this Agreement; _provided_ , that no such
notification shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements of the Parties or the conditions to the obligations of the Parties
under this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, the failure by the SSGT Parties, the SST II Parties or their
respective Representatives to provide such prompt notice under this 
_Section_ __ _ 7.6(b)_ shall not constitute a breach of covenant for purposes
of _Section_ __ _ 8.2(b)_, _Section_ __ _ 8.3(b)_, _Section_ __ _
9.1(c)(i)_, or  _Section_ __ _ 9.1(d)(i)_.

(c) The SSGT Parties and their Representatives shall give prompt notice to
the SST II Parties, and the SST II Parties and their Representatives shall
give prompt notice to the SSGT Parties, of any Action commenced or, to such
Partys Knowledge, threatened against, relating to or involving such Party or
any SSGT Subsidiary or SST II Subsidiary, respectively, or any of their
respective directors, officers or partners that relates to this Agreement, the
Mergers or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The SSGT
Parties and their respective Representatives shall give SST II the
opportunity to reasonably participate in (but not control) the defense and
settlement of any stockholder litigation against the SSGT Parties and/or their
directors, officers or partners relating to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and no such settlement shall be
agreed to without SST IIs prior written consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned). The SST II Parties and their
respective Representatives shall give the SSGT Parties the opportunity to
reasonably participate in (but not control) the defense and settlement of any
litigation against the SST II Parties and/or their directors, officers
or partners relating to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and no such settlement shall be agreed to without SSGTs prior
written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned). 

Section 7.7 Indemnification; Directors and Officers Insurance.

 

(a) Without limiting or being limited by the provisions of Section 7.7(b),
during the period commencing as of the REIT Merger Effective Time and ending
on the sixth (6th) anniversary of the REIT Merger Effective Time, SST II shall
(and shall cause the Surviving Entity to): (i) indemnify, defend and hold
harmless each Indemnified Party against and from any costs or expenses
(including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims,
damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any
Action to the extent such Action arises out of or pertains to (A) any
action or omission or alleged action or omission in such Indemnified Partys
capacity as a manager, director, officer, partner, member, trustee, employee
or agent of SSGT or any of the SSGT Subsidiaries or (B) this Agreement or any
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Mergers;
and (ii) pay in advance of the final disposition of any such Action the
expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and any expenses incurred by
any Indemnified Party in connection with enforcing any rights with respect to
indemnification) of any Indemnified Party without the requirement of any bond
or other security, in each case to the fullest extent permitted by Law, but
subject to SST IIs or the Surviving Entitys receipt of an undertaking by or
on behalf of such Indemnified Party to repay such amount if it shall
ultimately be determined that such Indemnified Party is not entitled to be
indemnified. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, SST II or the Surviving Entity, as applicable, (i) shall not settle
or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment or otherwise seek
termination with respect to any claim, action, suit or proceeding against or
investigation of any Indemnified Party for which indemnification may be sought
under this _Section_ __ _ 7.7(a)_ without the Indemnified Partys prior
written consent unless such settlement, compromise, consent or termination
includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all liability
arising out of such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, (ii)
shall not be liable for any settlement effected without their prior
written consent and (iii) shall not have any obligation hereunder to any
Indemnified Party to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction shall
determine in a final and non-appealable order that such indemnification is
prohibited by applicable Law, in which case the Indemnified Party shall
promptly refund to SST II or the Surviving Entity the amount of all such
expenses theretofore advanced pursuant hereto.

 



46

    

(b) Without limiting the foregoing, each of SST II and the
Surviving Entity agrees that all rights to indemnification and exculpation
from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the REIT
Merger Effective Time now existing in favor of the current or former managers,
directors, officers, partners, members, trustees, employees, agents,
fiduciaries or other individuals of SSGT or any of the SSGT Subsidiaries (the
" _Indemnified Parties_ ") as provided in (i) the SSGT Governing Documents or,
if applicable, similar organizational documents or agreements of any SSGT
Subsidiary (the " _SSGT Organizational Documents_ ") or (ii) indemnification
agreements of SSGT, shall survive the Mergers and shall continue in full force
and effect in accordance with their terms. For a period of six (6) years
following the REIT Merger Effective Time, the organizational documents of SST
II and the Surviving Entity and the organizational documents of any applicable
SST II Subsidiary or SSGT Subsidiary shall contain provisions no less
favorable to the Indemnified Parties with respect to indemnification and
limitations on liability than are set forth in the SSGT Organizational
Documents, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or
otherwise modified for a period of six (6) years following the REIT Merger
Effective Time in any manner that would affect adversely the rights thereunder
of individuals who, at or prior to the REIT Merger Effective Time, were
Indemnified Parties, unless such modification shall be required by applicable
Law and then only to the minimum extent required by applicable Law.

 

(c) For a period of six (6) years after the REIT Merger Effective Time, SST
II shall cause the Surviving Entity to maintain in effect SSGTs current
directors and officers liability insurance covering each Person currently
covered by SSGTs directors and officers liability insurance policies for
acts or omissions occurring prior to and through the REIT Merger Effective
Time; _provided_ , that in lieu of such obligation, (i) the Surviving Entity
may substitute therefor policies of an insurance company with the same or
better rating as SSGTs current insurance carrier the material terms of
which, including coverage and amount, are no less favorable in any material
respect to such directors and officers than SSGTs existing policies as of the
date hereof or (ii) in consultation with SST II, SSGT may obtain extended
reporting period coverage under SSGTs existing insurance programs (to be
effective as of the REIT Merger Effective Time) for a period of six (6) years
after the REIT Merger Effective Time for a cost not in excess of three times
the current annual premiums for such insurance; and _provided_ , _further_ ,
that in no event shall the Surviving Entity be required to pay annual premiums
for insurance under this _Section_ __ _ 7.7(c)_ in excess of 300% of the
most recent annual premiums paid by SSGT for such purpose, it being understood
that if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount, the
Surviving Entity shall nevertheless be obligated to provide such coverage as
may be obtained for such 300% amount.

(d) If SST II or the Surviving Entity or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges with or into
any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation,
partnership or other entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii)
liquidates, dissolves or winds-up, or transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, as a condition to the consummation of any such transaction,
the successors and assigns of SST II or the Surviving Entity, as applicable,
shall assume the obligations set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 7.7_.

 

(e) SST II shall cause the Surviving Entity to pay all reasonable expenses,
including reasonable attorneys fees, that may be incurred by any Indemnified
Party in enforcing the obligations provided in this _Section_ __ _ 7.7_.

 

(f) The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 7.7_ are intended to be for the
express benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party (each
of which is an intended third party beneficiary of this _Section_ __ _ 7.7_),
his or her heirs and his or her personal representatives, shall be binding on
all successors and assigns of SSGT, SST II and the Surviving Entity and shall
not be amended in a manner that is adverse to the Indemnified Party (including
his or her successors, assigns and heirs) without the prior written consent of
the Indemnified Party (including such successors, assigns and heirs) affected
thereby. The exculpation and indemnification provided for by this _Section_ __
_ 7.7_ shall not be deemed to be exclusive of any other rights to which an
Indemnified Party is entitled, whether pursuant to applicable Law, Contract
or otherwise.

 



47

    

Section 7.8 _Dividends_. In the event that a distribution with respect to
the shares of SSGT Common Stock permitted under the terms of this Agreement
has a record date prior to the REIT Merger Effective Time and has not been
paid prior to the Closing Date, such distribution shall be paid to the holders
of such shares of SSGT Common Stock on the Closing Date immediately prior to
the REIT Merger Effective Time.

 

Section 7.9 _Takeover Statutes_. The Parties shall use their respective
reasonable best efforts (a) to take all action necessary so that no Takeover
Statute is or becomes applicable to the Mergers or any of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (b) if any such Takeover
Statute is or becomes applicable to any of the foregoing, to take all action
necessary so that the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to eliminate or minimize the
effect of such Takeover Statute or the restrictions in the SSGT Charter or
the SST II Charter (" _Charter Restrictions_ ") on the Mergers and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. No Party shall take any action to
exempt any Person (other than the other Parties or their respective
Affiliates) from any Takeover Statute of any jurisdiction or the Charter
Restrictions that may purport to be applicable to the Mergers or any of the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or otherwise cause any
restrictions in any Takeover Statute or the Charter Restrictions not to apply
to any such Person.

 

Section 7.10 _Obligations of the Parties_. SSGT shall take all actions
necessary to cause the other SSGT Parties to perform their obligations under
this Agreement and to consummate the Mergers on the terms and conditions set
forth in this Agreement. SST II shall take all actions necessary to cause the
SST II Parties to perform their obligations under this Agreement and to
consummate the Mergers on the terms and conditions set forth in this
Agreement.

 

Section 7.11 _Certain Transactions_.

 

(a) Except as set forth in Section 7.11 of the SSGT Disclosure Letter, SSGT
shall cause all contracts (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the SSGT
Related Party Agreements) between any former or current officers, directors,
partners, stockholders, managers, members, affiliates or agents of SSGT or any
SSGT Subsidiary, on the one hand, and SSGT or any SSGT Subsidiary, on the
other hand, to be settled or terminated effective as of or prior to the
Closing, without any further obligations, liability or payments (other than
customary indemnification obligations) by or on behalf of SSGT as of the
Closing. For the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing shall not require the
settlement or termination of an agreement that is solely between SSGT and/or
any entities that will remain SSGT Subsidiaries after the Closing.

 

(b) SSGT shall take all actions necessary to terminate, effective as of or
prior to the Closing, the SSGT Equity Incentive Plan.

(c) SSGT shall take all actions necessary to terminate, effective as of or
prior to the Closing, the SSGT DRIP and the SSGT Share Redemption Program.

Section 7.12 _Tax Matters_.

 

(a) SSGT shall deliver to the legal counsel referred to in _Section_ __ _
8.3(e)_ tax representation letters, dated as of the Closing Date and signed
by an officer of SSGT and SSGT Operating Partnership, containing
representations of SSGT and SSGT Operating Partnership reasonably necessary or
appropriate to enable such counsel to render the tax opinions described in
_Section_ __ _ 8.3(e)_.

(b) SSGT and SST II shall reasonably cooperate in the preparation,
execution and filing of all returns, questionnaires, applications or other
documents regarding any real property transfer or gains, sales, use, transfer,
value added, stock transfer or stamp taxes, any transfer,
recording, registration and other fees and any similar taxes that become
payable in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(together with any related interest, penalties or additions to such taxes, "
_Transfer Taxes_ "), and shall reasonably cooperate in attempting to minimize
the amount of Transfer Taxes.

York time on April 1, 2019 (the " _Outside Date_ "); _provided_ , that the
right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 9.1(b)(i)_
shall not be available to any Party if the failure of such Party (and (A) in
the case of SSGT, including the failure of SSGT Operating Partnership, and (B)
in the case of SST II, including the failure of SST II Operating Partnership
and Merger Sub) to perform or comply in all material respects with the
obligations, covenants or agreements of such Party set forth in this Agreement

final and non-appealable; _provided_ , that the right to terminate this

(i) if a breach of any representation or warranty or failure to perform any
obligation, covenant or agreement on the part of any of the SST II Parties
set forth in this Agreement has occurred that would cause any of the

(ii) if SSGT has accepted a Superior Proposal by a Go Shop Bidder within
five (5) Business Days of the Go Shop Period End Time in accordance with the
provisions of _Section_ __ _ 7.3(c)_ herein; _provided_ , _however_ , that
this Agreement may not be so terminated unless concurrently with the
occurrence of such termination the payment required by _Section_ __ _ 9.3(b)_
is made in full to SST II and the definitive agreement relating to the
Superior Proposal is entered into, and in the event that such definitive
agreement is not concurrently entered into and such payment is not

receipt of the Stockholder Approval in accordance with the provisions of
_Section_ __ _ 7.3(d)_ herein; _provided_ , _however_ , that this Agreement

(iv) if, prior to receipt of the Stockholder Approval, an Intervening Event
has occurred and the SSGT Board has determined in good faith (based on the
recommendation of the SSGT Special Committee after consultation with its legal
and financial advisors) that the failure to terminate this Agreement would be
inconsistent with the directors duties under applicable Law; or

(v) if (A) all of the conditions set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 8.1_ and
_Section_ __ _ 8.3_ have been and continue to be satisfied or waived (other
than those conditions that by their nature cannot be satisfied other than at
Closing), (B) on or after the date the Closing should have occurred, SSGT has

Closing within three (3) Business Days after delivery of the notice
referenced in the preceding clause (B) (it being understood that during such
three (3) Business Day period, SST II shall not be entitled to terminate this
Agreement).

 

(d) by SST II (with the prior approval of the SST II Special Committee):

 

(i) if a breach of any representation or warranty or failure to perform any
obligation, covenant or agreement on the part of any of the SSGT Parties set
forth in this Agreement has occurred that would cause any of the conditions
set forth in _Section_ __ _ 8.3(a)_ or _Section_ __ _ 8.3(b)_ not to be
satisfied (a " _SSGT Terminating Breach_ "), which breach or failure to
perform cannot be cured, or, if capable of cure, has not been cured by the
earlier of twenty (20) days following written notice thereof from SST II to
SSGT and two (2) Business Days before the Outside Date; _provided_ , that SST
II shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 9.1(d)(i)_ if a SST II Terminating Breach shall have occurred
and be continuing at the time SST II delivers notice of its election to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 9.1(d)(i)_; or

 

(ii) if, at any time following the date that is five (5) Business Days
after the Go Shop Period End Time and prior receipt of the Stockholder
Approval, (A) the SSGT Board or any committee thereof, for any reason, shall
have effected an Adverse Recommendation Change, (B) the SSGT Board or any
committee thereof shall have approved, adopted or publicly endorsed or
recommended any Acquisition Proposal, (C) a tender offer or exchange offer for
any shares of SSGT Common Stock that constitutes an Acquisition Proposal

under _Section_ __ _ 7.3_, or shall be deemed pursuant to the last sentence
of _Section_ __ _ 7.3(b)_ to have materially violated any of its obligations
under _Section_ __ _ 7.3_ (other than any immaterial or inadvertent
violations thereof that did not result in an alternative Acquisition
Proposal).

Section 9.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this
Agreement as provided in _Section_ __ _ 9.1_, written notice thereof shall
forthwith be given to the other Parties specifying the provision hereof
pursuant to which such termination is made, and this Agreement shall

on the part of the SSGT Parties or the SST II Parties, except that the
Confidentiality Agreement and the provisions of  _Section_ __ _ 7.4_ (Public
Announcements), this _Section_ __ _ 9.2_, _Section_ __ _ 9.3_ (Fees and
Expenses), _Section_ __ _ 9.4_ (Amendment), and _Article X_
(General Provisions) of this Agreement shall survive the termination hereof;
_provided_ , that no such termination shall relieve any Party from any
liability or damages resulting from any fraud or willful and material breach
of any of its covenants, obligations or agreements set forth in this
Agreement.

Section 9.3 _Fees and Expenses_.

 

(a) Except as otherwise provided in this _Section_ __ _ 9.3_, all Expenses
shall be paid by the Party incurring such fees or expenses, whether or not
the Mergers are consummated; _provided_ , that the Parties will share equally
any HSR Act filing fees, if any, as may be required to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In the event the Mergers are
consummated, the SST II Parties agree to pay any Expenses of the SSGT Parties
that are not paid by the SSGT Parties.

 

(b) In the event that this Agreement is terminated:

 

(i) (A) (x) by SST II pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.1(d)(i)_, and after the
date hereof and prior to the breach or failure to perform giving rise to such
right of termination, a bona fide Acquisition Proposal (with, for all purposes
of this _Section_ __ _ 9.3(b)(i)_, all percentages included in the
definition of "Acquisition Proposal" increased to 50%) has been publicly
announced, disclosed or otherwise communicated to the SSGT Board or any Person
shall have publicly announced an intention (whether or not conditional) to
make such an Acquisition Proposal or (y) by SST II or SSGT pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 9.1(b)(iii)_, and prior to the Stockholders Meeting, an
Acquisition Proposal with respect to SSGT has been publicly announced,
disclosed or otherwise communicated to SSGTs stockholders (and not
withdrawn) or any Person shall have publicly announced an intention (whether
or not conditional) to make such an Acquisition Proposal, and (B) within
twelve (12) months after the date of such termination, a transaction in
respect of an Acquisition Proposal with respect to SSGT is consummated or SSGT
enters into a definitive agreement in respect of an Acquisition Proposal with
respect to SSGT that is later consummated, then SSGT shall pay to SST II the
SSGT Termination Payment.

(ii) by SSGT pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 9.1(c)(i)_, then SST II shall
pay to SSGT an amount equal to the Expense Reimbursement Payment.

 

(iii) by SSGT pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.1(c)(ii)_, then SSGT shall pay
to SST II an amount equal to the Go Shop Termination Payment.

(iv) by SSGT pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 9.1(c)(iii)_, then SSGT shall
pay to SST II an amount equal to the SSGT Termination Payment.

 

(v) by SSGT pursuant to Section 9.1(c)(iv), then SSGT shall pay to SST II
an amount equal to the SSGT Termination Payment.

 



53

    

(vi) by SSGT pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 9.1(c)(v)_, then SST II shall
pay to SSGT an amount equal to the SST II Termination Payment.

 

(vii) by SST II pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.1(d)(i)_ (other than as
described in  _Section_ __ _ 9.3(b)(i)_ above), then SSGT shall pay to SST
II an amount equal to the Expense Reimbursement Payment.

 

(viii) by SST II pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.1(d)(ii)_, then SSGT shall
pay to SST II an amount equal to the SSGT Termination Payment.

(ix) by SST II pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 9.1(b)(i)_ and at the time of
such termination SSGT would have been entitled to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.1(c)(v)_, then SST II shall pay to SSGT an
amount equal to the SST II Termination Payment.

(c) The Parties agree and acknowledge that in no event shall any Party be
required to pay a Termination Payment on more than one occasion. Payment of a
Termination Payment shall be made by wire transfer of same day funds to the
account or accounts designated by the Party entitled to payment thereof (the "
_Recipient_ ") (i) prior to or concurrently at the time of consummation of
any transaction contemplated by an Acquisition Proposal, in the case of a
Termination Payment payable pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.3(b)(i)_, (ii) prior
to or concurrently with termination of this Agreement, in the case of a
Termination Payment payable pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.3(b)(iii)_,
_Section_ __ _ 9.3(b)(iv)_ or _Section_ __ _ 9.3(b)(v)_, (iii) concurrently
with termination of this Agreement, in the case of a Termination Payment
payable pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.3(b)(ix)_, and (iv) as promptly as
reasonably practicable after termination (and, in any event, within two (2)
Business Days thereof), in the case of a Termination Payment payable pursuant
to any other provision of _Section_ __ _ 9.3(b)_.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in the
event that a Termination Payment becomes payable, then such payment shall be
the Recipients and its Affiliates sole and exclusive remedy as liquidated
damages for any and all losses or damages of any nature against the Party
obligated to pay the Termination Payment (the " _Payor_ ") and its
Subsidiaries and each of their respective Representatives in respect of this
Agreement, any agreement executed in connection herewith, and the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby, including for any loss or damage suffered as
a result of the termination of this Agreement, the failure of the Mergers to
be consummated or for a breach or failure to perform hereunder (whether
intentionally, unintentionally, or otherwise) or otherwise.

 

(e) Each of the Parties acknowledges that the agreements contained in this
_Section_ __ _ 9.3_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and that without these agreements, the other Parties would not
enter into this Agreement. In the event that the Payor shall fail to pay the
Termination Payment when due, the Payor shall reimburse the Recipient for all
reasonable costs and expenses actually incurred or accrued by the Recipient
(including reasonable fees and expenses of counsel) in connection with the
collection under and enforcement of this  _Section_ __ _ 9.3_. Further, if
the Payor fails to timely pay any amount due pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
9.3_, and, in order to obtain the payment, the Recipient commences a suit
which results in a judgment against the Payor for the payment set forth in
this _Section_ __ _ 9.3_, the Payor shall pay to the Recipient its reasonable
and documented costs and expenses (including reasonable and documented
attorneys fees) in connection with such suit, together with interest on such
amount at a rate per annum equal to the prime rate of Citibank, N.A. in effect
on the date such payment was required to be made through the date of payment.
If payable, the Termination Payment shall not be payable more than once
pursuant to this Agreement.

(f) The Payor shall deposit into escrow an amount in cash equal to the
Termination Payment with an escrow agent reasonably selected by the Recipient,
after reasonable consultation with the Payor, and pursuant to a written escrow
agreement (the " _Escrow Agreement_ ") reflecting the terms set forth in this
_Section_ __ _ 9.3(f)_ and otherwise reasonably acceptable to each of the
Parties and the escrow agent. The payment or deposit into escrow of the
Termination Payment pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 9.3(f)_ shall be made
by the Payor promptly after receipt of notice from the Recipient that the
Escrow Agreement has been executed by the parties thereto. The Escrow

  



54

    

 Agreement shall provide that the Termination Payment in escrow or the
applicable portion thereof shall be released to the Recipient on an annual
basis based upon the delivery by the Recipient to the escrow agent of any one
(or a combination) of the following:

(i) a letter from the Recipients independent certified public accountants
indicating the maximum amount that can be paid by the escrow agent to the
Recipient without causing the Recipient to fail to meet the requirements of
Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code for the applicable taxable year of the
Recipient determined as if the payment of such amount did not constitute
income described in Sections 856(c)(2)(A)-(H) or 856(c)(3)(A)-(I) of the Code
(such income, " _Qualifying REIT_   _Income_ "), in which case the escrow
agent shall release to the Recipient such maximum amount stated in the
accountants letter;

 

(ii) a letter from the Recipients counsel indicating that the Recipient
received a private letter ruling from the IRS holding that the receipt by the
Recipient of the Termination Payment would either constitute Qualifying REIT
Income or would be excluded from gross income within the meaning of Sections
856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code, in which case the escrow agent shall release
to the Recipient the remainder of the Termination Payment; or

 

(iii) a letter from the Recipients counsel indicating that the Recipient
has received a tax opinion from the Recipients outside counsel or
accountant, respectively, to the effect that the receipt by the Recipient of
the Termination Payment should either constitute Qualifying REIT Income or
should be excluded from gross income within the meaning of Section 856(c)(2)
and (3) of the Code, in which case the escrow agent shall release to the
Recipient the remainder of the Termination Payment.

 

The Parties agree to cooperate in good faith to amend this _Section_ __ _
9.3(f)_ at the reasonable request of the Recipient in order to (A) maximize
the portion of the Termination Payment that may be distributed to the
Recipient hereunder without causing the Recipient to fail to meet the
requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code, (B) improve
the Recipients chances of securing the favorable private letter ruling from
the IRS described in this _Section_ __ _ 9.3(f)_ or (C) assist the Recipient
in obtaining the favorable tax opinion from its outside counsel or accountant
described in this _Section_ __ _ 9.3(f)_. The Escrow Agreement shall provide
that the Recipient shall bear all costs and expenses under the Escrow
Agreement and that any portion of the Termination Payment held in escrow for
ten (10) years shall be released by the escrow agent to the Payor. The Payor
shall not be a party to the Escrow Agreement and shall not bear any liability,
cost or expense resulting directly or indirectly from the Escrow Agreement
(other than any Taxes imposed on the Payor in connection therewith). The
Recipient shall fully indemnify the Payor and hold the Payor harmless from and
against any such liability, cost or expense.

 

Section 9.4 _Amendment_. Subject to compliance with applicable Law, this
Agreement may be amended by mutual agreement of the Parties by action taken
or authorized by the SSGT Board (with the prior approval of the SSGT Special
Committee) and the SST II Board (with the prior approval of the SST II Special
Committee), respectively, at any time before or after receipt of the
Stockholder Approval and prior to the REIT Merger Effective Time; _provided_ ,
that after the Stockholder Approval has been obtained, there shall not be (i)
any amendment of this Agreement that changes the amount or the form of the
consideration to be delivered under this Agreement to the holders of SSGT
Common Stock, or which by applicable Law requires the further approval of the
stockholders of SSGT without such further approval of such stockholders,
or (ii) any amendment or change not permitted under applicable Law. This
Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed by each
of the Parties.

Section 10.3 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this
Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced under any
present or future Law, or public policy, (a) such term or other provision
shall be fully separable, (b) this Agreement shall be construed and enforced
as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision had never comprised a
part hereof, and (c) all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement
shall remain in full force and effect and shall not be affected by the
illegal, invalid or unenforceable term or other provision or by its severance
herefrom so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement is not affected in any manner materially
adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the Parties shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the Parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner
in order that transactions contemplated by this Agreement be consummated as
originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

 

Section 10.4 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original and all of which
together shall be deemed one and the same agreement, and shall become
effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the
Parties and delivered (by telecopy, electronic delivery or otherwise) to
the other Parties. Signatures to this Agreement transmitted by facsimile
transmission, by electronic mail in "portable document form" ("pdf"), or by
any other electronic means intended to preserve the original graphic and
pictorial appearance of a document, will have the same effect as physical
delivery of the paper document bearing the original signature.

 

Section 10.5 _Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This
Agreement (including the Exhibits, the Schedules, the SSGT Disclosure Letter
and the SST II Disclosure Letter) and the Confidentiality Agreement (a)
constitute the entire agreement and supersede all prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, between the Parties with respect to
the subject matter of this Agreement and, (b) except for the provisions of
_Article III_ (which (i) from and after the REIT Merger Effective Time shall
be for the benefit of holders of shares of SSGT Common Stock immediately
prior to the REIT Merger Effective Time, and (ii) from and after the
Partnership Merger Effective Time shall be for the benefit of holders of SSGT
OP Units and the holder of the SSGT Special Limited Partner Interest
immediately prior to the Partnership Merger Effective Time) and _Section_ __
_ 7.7_ (which, from and after the REIT Merger Effective Time shall be for the
benefit of the Indemnified Parties), are not intended to confer upon any
Person other than the Parties hereto any rights or remedies.

Section 10.6 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the REIT Merger
Effective Time, SSGT (with the prior approval of the SSGT Special Committee)
and SST II (with the prior approval of the SST II Special Committee) may, to
the extent legally allowed and except as otherwise set forth herein, (a)
extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of
the other Party, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and
warranties of the other Party contained in this Agreement or in any
document delivered

 



57

    

 pursuant to this Agreement or (c) subject to the requirements of applicable
Law, waive the other Partys compliance with any of the agreements or
conditions contained in this Agreement. Any agreement on the part of SSGT or
SST II, as applicable, to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if
set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such Party. The
failure of any Party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this
Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of those rights.

 

Section 10.7 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Venue_.

 

(a) Except to the extent that the Laws of the State of Delaware are
mandatorily applicable to the Partnership Merger, this Agreement, and all
claims or causes of actions (whether at Law, in contract or in tort) that may
be based upon, arise out of or related to this Agreement or the negotiation,
execution or performance of this Agreement, shall be governed by,
and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Maryland without
giving effect to its conflicts of laws principles (whether the State of
Maryland or any other jurisdiction that would cause the application of the
Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Maryland).

(b) Any and all disputes arising out of or relating to this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby shall be heard and determined
exclusively in a Maryland state or federal court located in Baltimore City
exercising jurisdiction over the subject matter of such dispute(s). Each of
the Parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally (i) submits to the
exclusive personal jurisdiction of any such Maryland state or federal court
located in Baltimore City for the purpose of any dispute arising out of or
relating to this Agreement brought by any Party, (ii) agrees not to commence
any such dispute except in such courts, (iii) agrees that any claim in respect
of any such dispute may be heard and determined in any such Maryland state or
federal court, (iv) waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and
effectively do so, any objection to such courts exercise of personal
jurisdiction over the Party in any such dispute, (v) waives, to the fullest
extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection which it may now
or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any such dispute, (vi) waives, to
the fullest extent permitted by Law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to
the maintenance of such dispute. Each of the Parties agrees that a final
judgment in any such dispute shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other
jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law
and (vii) agrees, with respect to any such action filed in such Maryland state
court, to jointly request an assignment to the Maryland Business and
Technology Case Management Program. Each Party irrevocably consents to service
of process in the manner provided for notices in _Section_ __ _ 10.2_.
Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right of any Party to serve process
in any other manner permitted by Law.

 

Section 10.8 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned or delegated,
in whole or in part, by operation of Law or otherwise by any of the Parties
without the prior written consent of the other Parties. This Agreement will be
binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the Parties and
their respective successors and assigns.

Section 10.9 _Specific Performance_. The Parties agree that irreparable
harm would occur to the non-breaching party if any of the provisions of this
Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or
were otherwise breached, and that monetary damages, even if available, would
not be an adequate remedy in the event of a breach. It is accordingly agreed
that, at any time prior to the termination of this Agreement pursuant to
_Article IX_ , each Party shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions
to prevent one or more breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement, and each Party hereby waives any
requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with such
remedy, this being in addition to any other remedy to which such Party is
entitled at Law or in equity.

 

Section 10.10 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE
FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL
BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY SUIT, ACTION OR OTHER PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF THIS
AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. EACH PARTY HEREBY AGREES
THAT IT WILL NOT, IN CONNECTION WITH ANY SUIT, COMPLAINT, CLAIM,
COUNTERCLAIM, THIRD-PARTY CLAIM,

 



58

    

 ANSWER, OR OTHER PLEADING OR PAPER ANCILLARY THERETO, DEMAND OR REQUEST A
TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY SUIT, ACTION OR OTHER PROCEEDING ARISING OUT
OF THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, AND FURTHER AGREES
THAT ANY SUCH DEMAND OR REQUEST WOULD BE VOID AB INITIO AND INVALID,
REGARDLESS OF WHICH PARTY MAY HAVE INITIATED SUCH DEMAND OR REQUEST. EACH
PARTY (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS
REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT
OF ANY ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND
(B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO
THIS AGREEMENT, BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVER AND CERTIFICATIONS
IN THIS _SECTION 10.10_.

 

Section 10.11 _Authorship_. The Parties agree that the terms and language
of this Agreement are the result of negotiations between the Parties and
their respective advisors and, as a result, there shall be no presumption that
any ambiguities in this Agreement shall be resolved against any Party. Any
controversy over construction of this Agreement shall be decided without
regard to events of authorship or negotiation.
