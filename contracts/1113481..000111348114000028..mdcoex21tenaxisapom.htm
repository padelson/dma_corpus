At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further action
on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any Company Stockholder:

(a) any shares of Company Capital Stock then held by the Company (or held in
the Company's treasury) shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to
exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor;

(b) each share of Company Series D Preferred Stock shall cease to be an
existing and issued share and be converted, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of the holders thereof, into the right to
receive (i) (x) $[**] (as adjusted for recapitalizations, stock splits and the
like) plus (y) the Per Share Initial Consideration, in cash payable to the
holder thereof, without interest, upon the surrender of the certificate
representing such shares in accordance with the terms hereof and in the manner
provided herein and subject to the deposits into the Escrow Funds and
Representative Reimbursement Fund as provided in Section 2.6(a), (ii) the Per
Share Adjustment Amount, if any, in cash payable to the holder thereof,
without interest, and (iii) the Per Share Contingent Consideration, in cash
payable to the holder thereof, without interest, upon and to the extent of the
Contingent Consideration becoming payable in accordance with Sections 2.1(b)
or 6.3(b) and subject to the deposit into the Escrow Fund to the extent
required in Section 2.6(b);



(c) each share of Company Capital Stock other than Company Series D Preferred
Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (except
for any Dissenting Shares), shall cease to be an existing and issued share and
be converted, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of
the holders thereof, into the right to receive (i) the Per Share Initial
Consideration, in cash payable to the holder thereof, without interest, upon
the surrender of the certificate representing such shares in accordance with
the terms hereof and in the manner provided herein and subject to the deposits
into the Escrow Funds and Representative Reimbursement Fund as provided in
Section 2.6(a), (ii) the Per Share Adjustment Amount, if any, in cash payable
to the holder thereof, without interest, and (iii) the Per Share Contingent
Consideration, in cash payable to the holder thereof, without interest, upon
and to the extent of the Contingent Consideration becoming payable in
accordance with Sections 2.1(b) or 6.3(b) and subject to the deposit into the
Escrow Fund to the extent required in Section 2.6(b).



2.3 Company Options; Company Warrants

(a) The Company will take all reasonably necessary and appropriate actions so
that each Company Option to purchase shares granted pursuant to option
agreements or otherwise, whether vested or unvested (the "Existing Cash-Out
Stock Option") that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time,
shall, as of the Effective Time, become fully vested and be converted into the
right to receive (i) at the Effective Time, an amount (the "Option Cash-Out
Amount"), payable in cash, equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x)
the total number of shares subject to such Existing Cash-Out

4 

Stock Option, with (y) the excess, if any, of the amount of the Per Share
Initial Consideration over the exercise price per share of the shares subject
to the Existing Cash-Out Stock Option (subject to the deposits into the Escrow
Funds and Representative Reimbursement Fund as provided in Section 2.6(a));
(ii) the Per Share Adjustment Amount, if any, multiplied by the total number
of shares subject to such Existing Cash-Out Stock Option, in cash payable to
the holder thereof, without interest, and (iii) the Per Share Contingent
Consideration, relating to Contingent Consideration paid within five (5) years
following the Closing Date, multiplied by the total number of shares subject
to such Existing Cash-Out Stock Option, in cash payable to the holder thereof,
without interest, upon and to the extent of the Contingent Consideration
becoming payable in accordance with Sections 2.1(b) or 6.3(b) and subject to
the deposit into the Escrow Fund to the extent required in Section 2.6(b).

(b) The Company will take all necessary and appropriate actions so that each
Company Warrant, whether vested or unvested, with an exercise price per share
less than the Per Share Initial Consideration (the "Existing Cash-Out
Warrant") that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall,
as of the Effective Time, become fully vested and be converted into the right
to receive (i) at the Effective Time, an amount (the "Warrant Cash-Out
Amount"), payable in cash, equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x)
the total number of shares subject to such Existing Cash-Out Warrant, with (y)
the excess of the amount of the Per Share Initial Consideration over the
exercise price per share of the shares subject to the Existing Cash-Out
Warrant (subject to the deposits into the Escrow Funds and Representative
Reimbursement Fund as provided in Section 2.6(a)); (ii) the Per Share
Adjustment Amount, if any, multiplied by the total number of shares subject to
such Existing Cash-Out Warrant, in cash payable to the holder thereof, without
interest, in accordance with Section 2.9(f), and (iii) the Per Share
Contingent Consideration multiplied by the total number of shares subject to
such Existing Cash-Out Warrant, in cash payable to the holder thereof, without
interest, upon and to the extent of the Contingent Consideration becoming
payable in accordance with Sections 2.1(b) or 6.3(b) and subject to the
deposit into the Escrow Fund to the extent required in Section 2.6(b).

(c) No option, warrant or similar right to purchase any Company Capital Stock
shall be assumed and/or substituted by Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving
Corporation, and all Company Options and Company Warrants not entitled to any
payments under Section 2.3(a) or (b), as applicable, will be automatically
cancelled without any consideration and shall not be included in the
calculation of Outstanding Shares. Prior to the Effective Time, and subject to
the reasonable review and reasonable approval of Parent, the Company shall
take all actions necessary to effect (i) the transactions contemplated by this
Section 2.3 under applicable law, the Company Option Plan, all Company Option
agreements, Company Warrant agreements and any other plan or arrangement of
the Company (whether written or oral, formal or informal), including
delivering all notices required thereby and (ii) the termination of the
Company Option Plan.



2.4 Closing of the Company's Transfer Books. At the Effective Time: (a) all
shares of Company Capital Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall

5 

automatically be canceled and extinguished and shall cease to exist, and all
holders of certificates representing shares of Company Capital Stock that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (each a "Company Stock
Certificate") shall cease to have any rights as stockholders of the Company,
and (b) the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed with respect
to all shares of such Company Capital Stock outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time. No further transfer of any such shares of Company Capital
Stock shall be made on such stock transfer books after the Effective Time. If,
after the Effective Time, a valid Company Stock Certificate is presented to
the Surviving Corporation or Parent, such Company Stock Certificate shall be
canceled and shall be exchanged as provided in Section 2.5.

2.5 Deposit and Disbursement of Merger Consideration; Surrender of
Certificates

(a) At the Closing, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with
the Paying Agent (i) the Initial Consideration, (ii) the Company Indebtedness,
(iii) the Company Merger Costs and (iv) the Change of Control Expenses, in
each case, as set forth in the Merger Consideration Spreadsheet. Parent shall
further deposit with the Paying Agent any amount which is due and payable in
accordance with Section 2.9(f). Parent shall deposit the Contingent
Consideration when such payment is due and payable, less any deposits required
to be made into the Escrow Fund under Section 2.6(b), which deposit shall,
subject to Section 2.6(f), be remitted to the Paying Agent upon and to the
extent of a release thereof. The cash so deposited with the Paying Agent is
referred to as the "Payment Fund."

(b) Parent shall instruct the Paying Agent to pay at Closing (i) the Company
Merger Costs and Change of Control Expenses payable at Closing and (ii) the
Company Indebtedness, in each case to the Persons to whom such amounts are
owed in accordance with the Merger Consideration Spreadsheet to be provided
under Section 2.8.

(c) Promptly after the Effective Time, and in any event within two (2)
business days thereafter, Parent shall instruct the Paying Agent to mail a
letter of transmittal in customary form, as reasonably approved by the Company
(a "Letter of Transmittal") to each Company Stockholder, together with
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of Company Stock Certificates
for the Merger Consideration payable pursuant to Section 2.2. Upon the Company
Stockholder's delivery to the Paying Agent, of a Company Stock Certificate (or
an affidavit of loss as described below), together with a duly executed Letter
of Transmittal and such other documents as the Parent and the Paying Agent may
reasonably request, the Paying Agent shall (i) promptly pay to such Company
Stockholder the amount such Company Stockholder is entitled to receive
pursuant to Section 2.2, (ii) upon receipt of any payment of Contingent
Consideration from the Company, promptly pay to such Company Stockholder the
amount such Company Stockholder is entitled to receive pursuant to Section
2.2, and (iii) upon receipt of any Escrow Fund or Representative Reimbursement
Fund from the Escrow Agent, promptly pay to such Company Stockholder the
amount of Escrow Fund or Representative Reimbursement Fund, as applicable,
such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to Section 2.2. The Company Stock

6



be canceled. From and after the Effective Time, each Company Stock Certificate
shall be deemed to represent only the right to receive the Merger
Consideration payable pursuant to Section 2.2, and the holder of each such
Company Stock Certificate shall cease to have any rights with respect to the
Company Capital Stock formerly represented thereby.

pursuant to Section 2.2 and 2.3 with respect to Company Capital Stock, Company
Options or Company Warrants, as applicable, such amounts as Parent or the
Surviving Corporation are required to deduct or withhold therefrom under the
Code or under any state local or foreign Tax law. To the extent such amounts
are so deducted or withheld, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes
under this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts
would otherwise have been paid.

(f) If applicable, any portion of the Payment Fund that remains undistributed
by the Paying Agent to Company Stockholders, Company Option Holders or Company
Warrant Holders as of the date that is 180 days after (i) the Closing Date,
(ii) the payment of Contingent Consideration, or (iii) the release of any
portion of the Escrow Funds or Representative Reimbursement Fund by the Escrow
Agent to the Paying Agent, as applicable, shall be delivered to Parent upon
demand, and any Company Stockholders, Company Option Holders or Company
Warrant Holders who have not received their payments, shall thereafter look
only to Parent for satisfaction of their claims for the Merger Consideration

Paying Agent, Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any
holder of a Company Stock Certificate or to any other Person for any amount
paid to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property laws,
escheat law or similar Legal Requirement. Any portion of the Payment Fund
remaining unclaimed by holders of Company Stock Certificates three (3) years
after the Effective Time (or such earlier date immediately prior to such time
as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any
Governmental Body and any portion of the Escrow Fund that remains
undistributed three (3) years after the deposit by the Escrow Agent of such
amount with the Paying Agent (or such earlier date immediately prior to such
time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any

Requirements, become the property of Parent.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, any
shares of Company Capital Stock that, as of the Effective Time, are or may
become



10 

Dissenting Shares shall not be converted into or represent the right to

the DGCL or, if applicable, Chapter 13 of the CCC; provided, however, that if
the status of any such shares as Dissenting Shares shall not be perfected, or

2.8 Merger Consideration Spreadsheet

(a) Parent, Paying Agent and the Securityholders' Representative shall be

setting forth:

(i) the name and address of each Company Stockholder, each Company Option

due at Closing to each recipient of Initial Consideration, and setting forth a
framework for calculating the amounts which shall be due to each recipient of
Contingent Consideration, if any, each as calculated in accordance with the
provisions of this Section 2.

2.9 Working Capital Adjustment

(a) No later than three (3) business days before the Closing Date, the Company
shall provide Parent with a preliminary written estimate of the Working
Capital as of the Closing Date, which shall set forth in reasonable detail the
Company's calculation of the Working Capital as of the Closing Date (the
"Estimated Working Capital Amount"). The estimate shall be prepared in good
faith by the Company and in accordance with this Section 2.9 and GAAP and
based on the same accounting principles, policies, practices, procedures,
classifications, judgments and estimation methodologies consistent with those
used in the preparation of the Company Financial Statements (the "Company
Accounting Policies"), but only to the extent such Company Accounting Policies
are in accordance with GAAP. For purposes of illustration, a calculation of
Working Capital as of the date of the Company Financial Statements using the
Company Accounting Policies is set forth in Section 2.9(a) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule. If Parent objects to the Estimated Working Capital Amount
as calculated by the Company, and provides its own calculations in reasonable
detail supporting that the Estimated Working Capital Amount should be at least
[**] Dollars ($[**]) less than estimated by the Company, the Company and
Parent will work together in good faith to resolve the issues in dispute.

(b) As soon as practicable (and in any event within ninety (90) days) after
the Closing Date, Parent shall prepare and deliver to the Securityholders'
Representative a schedule (the "Parent Working Capital Schedule") which shall
set forth in reasonable detail Parent's calculation of the Working Capital as
of the Closing Date (the "Parent Proposed Working Capital Amount"). The Parent
Working Capital Schedule shall be prepared in accordance with the Company
Accounting Policies (to the extent such Company Accounting Policies are in
accordance with GAAP).

(c) Following the delivery of the Parent Working Capital Schedule to the
Securityholders' Representative, Parent shall provide the Securityholders'
Representative and its accountants, at the request of the Securityholders'
Representative, with reasonable access during normal business hours to the
books and records of the Surviving Corporation as well as any relevant work
papers of Parent, the Company and their accountants generated in preparing the
Parent Working Capital Schedule as may reasonably be required for the review
of the calculation of the Parent Proposed Working Capital. All fees, costs and
expenses of the Securityholders' Representative relating to the review of the
Parent Working Capital Schedule shall be borne by the Company



12



Securityholders and taken out of the Company Merger Costs and Change of
Control Expenses Fund, and all fees, costs and expenses of Parent and the
Surviving Corporation relating thereto shall be borne by Parent.

(d) If the Securityholders' Representative has any objections to the Parent
Working Capital Schedule or the Parent Proposed Working Capital set forth
therein, it shall deliver to Parent a statement describing its objections with
respect thereto (the "Objection Notice") within thirty (30) days after the
Securityholders' Representative's receipt of the Parent Working Capital
Schedule. The Securityholders' Representative shall include in the Objection
Notice a reasonably detailed calculation of the Working Capital as of the
Closing Date as (the "Securityholders' Representative Proposed Working
Capital"), accompanied by a reasonably detailed description of the bases for
any variances between the Parent Proposed Working Capital and the
Securityholders' Representative Proposed Working Capital. If the
Securityholders' Representative fails to deliver an Objection Notice, the
Parent Proposed Working Capital shall be deemed the Final Working Capital
Amount (as defined below). If the Securityholders' Representative delivers the
Objection Notice to Parent, and Parent disagrees with the Securityholders'
Representative's objection, then Parent and the Securityholders'
Representative will, during the thirty (30) day period following the date of
the Objection Notice (the "Resolution Period"), use reasonable best efforts to
resolve any such objection themselves, it being understood that the Company
Accounting Policies (to the extent such Company Accounting Policies are in
accordance with GAAP) to be applied to the resolution of any such objection.

(e) If at the conclusion of the Resolution Period, the parties have not
reached an agreement on the Securityholders' Representative's objections set
forth in any Objection Notice, then all amounts and issues remaining in
dispute may, at the election of either party, be submitted by the
Securityholders' Representative or Parent to PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (the
"Neutral Auditor"). The fees and disbursements of the Neutral Auditor shall be
borne by Parent and the Securityholders' Representative on behalf of the
Company Securityholders in inverse proportion as they may prevail on the
matters resolved by the Neutral Auditor (and, with respect to the Company
Stockholders' portion, be taken out of the Company Merger Costs and Change of
Control Expenses Escrow Fund), which proportionate allocation shall be
determined by the Neutral Auditor at the time the determination of the Neutral
Auditor is rendered pursuant to this Section 2.9(e). The Neutral Auditor shall
act as an arbitrator to determine only the issues still in dispute. The
Neutral Auditor's determination shall be set forth in a written statement
delivered to Parent and the Securityholders' Representative and shall be
final, binding, conclusive and non-appealable for all purposes under this
Agreement. The term "Final Working Capital Amount" shall mean (A) if the
Securityholders' Representative fails to deliver an Objection Notice and
within the thirty(30) day period set forth in Section 2.9(d), the Parent
Proposed Working Capital Amount, and (B) if the Securityholders'
Representative delivers an Objection Notice within the thirty (30) day period
set forth in Section 2.9(d), (X) the definitive Working Capital agreed to by
the Securityholders' Representative and Parent in accordance with Section
2.9(d), or (Y) in the event Parent and Securityholders' Representative did not
agree to a definitive



13 

Working Capital in accordance with Section 2.9(d), the Working Capital
resulting from the determination made by the Neutral Auditor in accordance
with this Section 2.9(e).



(f) If the Final Working Capital Amount is greater than the Estimated Working
Capital Amount, then the amount by which the Final Working Capital Amount
exceeds the Estimated Working Capital Amount shall promptly be paid by Parent
to the Paying Agent for distribution to the Company Stockholders, Company
Option Holders and Company Warrant Holders entitled to receive payments
pursuant to Sections 2.2 and

2.3 of this Agreement in proportion to the Contingent Pro Rata Portion for
such Company Stockholders, Company Option Holders and Company Warrant Holders
under this Agreement.

(g) If the Final Working Capital Amount is less than the Estimated Working
Capital Amount, then the amount by which the Estimated Working Capital Amount
exceeds the Final Working Capital Amount shall promptly be paid to Parent out
of the General Escrow Fund by the Escrow Agent pursuant to Section 10 of this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement.

2.10 Further Action. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further
action is reasonably determined by Parent to be necessary or desirable to
carry out the purposes of this Agreement and any Related Agreement or to vest
the Surviving Corporation or Parent with full right, title and possession of
and to all rights and property of the Company, the officers and directors of
the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall be fully authorized (in the name of
the Company and otherwise) to take such action.

of a stock purchase, merger or otherwise; provided however that in each case
the unpaid Contingent Consideration shall not accelerate if such sale,
transfer, exchange, license or conveyance or other disposition of the Required
Company Technology is made to an Acquiring Entity that expressly assumes the
obligations hereunder to pay any remaining Contingent Consideration and use
Commercially Reasonable Efforts to achieve any remaining Milestone Approvals
and to maximize Net Sales where such acquirer is selling or begins selling its
own products. For the avoidance of doubt, the fact that the Acquiring Entity
or its Affiliates sell a Competing Product, shall not be a factor in
determining whether or not the Acquiring Entity is satisfying its Commercially
Reasonable Efforts obligation under the Agreement.

(c) In the event that Parent or its designee fails to fulfill at least twenty
percent (20%) (i.e. does not fulfill eighty-five percent (80%) or more) of the
orders for ArterX received and accepted within six (6) months of receipt by
Parent, its Affiliates, licensees or distributors during any calendar quarter
in accordance with the terms of such orders within more than thirty (30) days
after the delivery due date (such failure, a "Failure to Supply"), Parent
shall promptly provide the Securityholders' Representative with written notice
of such Failure to Supply, and Parent shall, to the extent that the Failure to
Supply is cured, add Net Sales related to such Failure to Supply to Net Sales
calculated for the Revenue Measurement Period during which the applicable
order was received. Parent shall keep the Securityholders' Representative
fully informed with respect to Parent's progress toward curing a Failure to
Supply, including by providing Securityholders' Representative with a monthly
written report of the quantity of orders received for ArterX and the
percentage of such orders that are fulfilled by Parent or its designee.

(d) Within ninety (90) calendar days after the end of each second and fourth
calendar quarter, during the Contingent Consideration Period, Parent shall
provide to the Securityholders' Representative a report of Net Sales for the
six (6) month period preceding such report, including, without limitation and
on a country-by-country basis, the Net Sales of ArterX sold (and, if
applicable, the Net Sales resulting from the sale of Combination Products and
the amount by which Net Sales have been reduced by the inclusion of Other
Products in the applicable Combination Product) and the exchange rates used
(the "Sales Report"). The Securityholders' Representative hereby agrees to
maintain in strictest confidence all information included in any reports it
receives pursuant to this Section 6.3(d); provided, however, that
notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, following Closing,
the Securityholders' Representative shall be permitted to disclose information
(i) as required by law, (ii) to employees, advisors or



53 

consultants of the Securityholders' Representative, and (iii) to the Company
Securityholders, in each case who have a need to know such information,
provided that such persons agree to observe the confidentiality obligations
contained herein.

(e) Parent shall maintain complete and accurate records of its Net Sales and
calculation of the Contingent Consideration for a period of three (3) years
after the end of each fiscal year to which such records pertain. Within
eighteen (18) months following the delivery of each Sales Report, the
Securityholders' Representative shall have the right to cause a nationally
recognized independent accounting firm reasonably satisfactory to Parent, to
audit the records pertaining to such Sales Report, upon reasonable written
notice to Parent. Any such audits shall be conducted at the Securityholders'
Representative's (solely on behalf of the Company Securityholders and taken
out of the Representative Reimbursement Fund) expense, unless the results of
such audit reveal an underpayment of more than five percent (5%) for any
period that is the subject of such audit, in which case Parent shall promptly
reimburse the Securityholders' Representative for the costs of such audit.

6.4 Public Announcements. (i) Neither the Company nor the Securityholders'
Representative shall (and the Company shall not permit any Representative of
the Company to) issue any press release or make any public statement regarding
this Agreement or the Merger, or regarding any of the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, without Parent's prior written consent and
(ii) the Parent shall not (and the Parent shall not permit any Representative
of the Parent to) issue any press release or make any public statement
regarding this Agreement or the Merger, or regarding any of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, without the Company's prior
written consent, provided, however, that nothing herein shall be deemed to
prohibit Parent from making any public disclosure Parent deems necessary or
appropriate under applicable Legal Requirements, including in its sole
discretion under any applicable federal or state securities laws.

6.5 Cooperation on Tax Matters. The Parent, Company, and the Securityholders'
Representative shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably
requested by the other party, in connection with the filing of Tax Returns and
any audit, litigation or other proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such
cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the other party's request)
the provision of records and information that are reasonably relevant to any
such audit, litigation or other proceeding and making employees or
knowledgeable agents available on a mutually convenient basis to provide
additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder. The
Parent, Company, and the Securityholders' Representative agree (i) to retain
all books and records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Company
relating to any taxable period beginning before the Closing Date until the
expiration of the statute of limitations (and, to the extent notified by the
Parent or the Securityholders' Representative, any extensions thereof) of the
respective taxable periods, and to abide by all record retention agreements
entered into with any taxing authority, and (ii) to give the other party
reasonable written notice prior to transferring, destroying or discarding any
such books and records and, if the other party so requests, the Parent, or the
Securityholders' Representative, as the case may be, shall allow the other
party, at such party's sole cost, to take possession or make copies of such
books and records. The Parent and the Securityholders' Representative further
agree, upon reasonable request, to use their commercially reasonable efforts
to obtain any certificate or other document

54 

from any Governmental Body or any other Person as may be necessary to
mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed (including, but
not limited to, with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby).

6.6 Company Directors and Officers.

(a) For a period of six (6) years following the Effective Time, Parent shall,
and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, indemnify and hold harmless each
person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date of this Agreement
or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, an officer or director of the
Company (the "Company Indemnified Parties") against all losses, claims,
damages, costs, expenses, liabilities or judgments or amounts that are paid in
settlement (the "Company Indemnified Liabilities") of or in connection with
any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation by reason of the fact
that such person is or was a director or officer of the Company (the "Company
Indemnified Proceedings"), whether pertaining to any matter existing or
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time and whether asserted or claimed
prior to, or at or after the Effective Time and all Company Indemnified
Liabilities based on, or relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby (to the extent that such losses, claims, damages, costs,
expenses, liabilities or judgments or amounts arose from or are related to
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby), in each case to the
fullest extent, and only to such extent, such Company Indemnified Parties are
indemnified and held harmless under the Company's certificate of incorporation
or bylaws, as the case may be, as set forth in Section 6.6(a) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule. In the event any Company Indemnified Party is or becomes
involved in any Company Indemnified Proceeding, Parent shall, or shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to, pay expenses in advance of the final disposition
of any such Company Indemnified Proceeding to each Company Indemnified Party
to the extent such Company Indemnified Party is entitled to the advancement of
expenses under, and the manner provided in, the Company's certificate of
incorporation or bylaws, as the case may be, as set forth in Section 6.6(a) of
the Company Disclosure Schedule.

(b) For a period of six (6) years following the Effective Time, Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to, fulfill and honor in all respects the
obligations of the Company pursuant to any indemnification agreements between
the Company and the Company Indemnified Parties set forth in Section 6.6(b) of
the Company Disclosure Schedule, subject to applicable Law. The Surviving
Corporation shall not take any action directly or indirectly to disaffirm or
adversely affect the provisions of the Company's certificate of incorporation
and bylaws the agreements disclosed in Section 6.6(b) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, as the case may be.

(c) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain the "tail"
directors' and officers' liability insurance policy for the Company and its
current and former directors, officers and employees purchased by Company
prior to the Closing (the costs and expenses of which constitute Company
Merger Costs), for six (6) years following the Effective Time of not less than
the existing coverage.



55



(d) This Section 6.6 is intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by the Company Indemnified Parties and their heirs and personal
representatives and shall be binding on Parent and the Surviving Corporation
and its successors and assigns.

6.7 Employee Benefits.

(a) Each employee of the Company who remains employed by Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or their respective Subsidiaries after the Effective Time (the
"Company Participants") shall have benefits that are substantially similar in
the aggregate to benefits provided to similarly situated employees of Parent.
To the extent Parent elects to have the Company Participants participate in
any of Parent's employee benefit plan (a "Parent Plan") following the Closing
Date, (i) each Company Participant will receive credit for purposes of
eligibility to participate and vesting under such Parent Plan for years of
service with the Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the Closing Date (other
than for accruals under any defined benefit pension plan or participation in
Parent's employee stock purchase plan) to the same extent that such service
was recognized under a similar Company Employee Plan, and (ii) Parent will use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause any and all pre-existing condition
limitations, eligibility waiting periods and evidence of insurability
requirements under any Parent Plans that are group health plans in which such
Company Participants will participate in to be waived. All vacation accrued by
Company Participants under the vacation policies of the Company prior to the
Effective Time shall be honored by Parent in accordance with applicable Legal
Requirements and Parent's policies, it being understood that any vacation
accruals after the Effective Time shall be subject solely to Legal
Requirements and Parent's policies. The foregoing requirements in this Section
6.7(a) are subject to: (i) any required transition period, (ii) any applicable
Parent Plan provisions, and (iii) the requirements of applicable Law. Nothing
contained in this Agreement shall constitute or be deemed an amendment to any
Parent Plan or any other compensation or benefit plan, program or arrangement.
Nothing in this Section 6.7(a) shall be construed to create a right in any
employee of the Company to employment with the Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries. In each case, while a Company
Employee remains employed, the base salary or regular wages as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall not be decreased for a period of one year
following the Effective Time for any Company Employee who continues to be
employed by the Parent, the Surviving Corporation or their respective
Subsidiaries during that period.

(b) Parent agrees that, from and after the Closing Date, the Company
Participants may participate in the employee stock purchase plan sponsored by
Parent (the "Parent ESPP"), subject to the eligibility terms and conditions of
the Parent ESPP.

(c) Parent shall assume any and all termination payments and obligations
relating to Parent declining to offer employees of the Company continued or
new employment with Parent or the Surviving Corporation, including but not
limited to, any severance, termination, change of control, bonus, vacation,
personal time off, sick time, or any other termination-related payment in
accordance with Parent's policies related thereto , which does not qualify as
a Change of Control Expense, it being understood that



56 

the provisions of this Section 6.7(c) shall not apply if Parent offers to an
employee of the Company continued or new employment with Parent or the
Surviving Corporation and such employee declines such offer.

6.8 Name Change. As soon as commercially reasonable after Parent's request,
the Company will file a a supplemental name change application to change the
Product's name as requested by Parent. In the event the transactions
contemplated under this Merger Agreement are not consummated, Parent will
reimburse the Company for all direct expenses incurred by the Company related
to such application as well as any costs incurred by the Company related to
withdrawing such application.

the Closing for eighteen (18) months, except that the representations and
warranties contained in (i) Sections 3.1 (Due Organization), 3.3.
(Capitalization), 3.4 (Authority; Binding Nature of Agreement) and 3.9 (Title

foregoing, if at any time prior to the end of the applicable survival period,
any Parent Indemnitee delivers to the Securityholders' Representative a
written notice alleging the existence of an inaccuracy in or a breach of any
of the representations and warranties made by the Company, then the
representation or warranty underlying the claim asserted in such notice shall
survive the end of the applicable survival period until such time as such
claim is fully and finally resolved. All of the covenants, agreements and
obligations of the parties contained in this Agreement or any other document,
certificate, schedule or instrument delivered or executed in connection
herewith shall survive the Closing.

(b) The representations, warranties, covenants and obligations of the Company,
and the rights and remedies that may be exercised by the Parent Indemnitees,
shall not be limited or otherwise affected by or as a result of any
information furnished to, or any investigation made by or Knowledge of, any of
the Parent Indemnitees or any of their Representatives. The waiver of any
condition based on the accuracy of any representation or warranty, or on the
performance of or compliance with any covenant or obligation, shall not affect
the right to indemnification or payment of Damages pursuant to this Section
10, or other remedy based on such representations, warranties, covenants, and
obligations.



62 

10.2 Indemnification by Company Securityholders.

(a) From and after the Closing Date (but subject to Section 10.1(a)), the
Company Securityholders (individually, an "Indemnitor", and collectively, the
"Indemnitors"), shall severally, but not jointly, hold harmless and indemnify
each Parent Indemnitee from and against, and shall compensate and reimburse
each Parent Indemnitee for, any Damages which are suffered or incurred by any
of the Parent Indemnitees or to which any Parent Indemnitee may otherwise
become subject (regardless of whether or not such Damages relate to any third-
party claim) and which arise from or as a result of:

(i) any inaccuracy in or breach or alleged breach of any representation or
warranty of the Company set forth in this Agreement, the Company Disclosure
Schedule or the Company Compliance Certificate;

(ii) any breach or alleged breach of any covenant or obligation of the Company
or the Securityholders' Representative set forth in this Agreement (including
the covenants set forth in Sections 5 and 6) or any other document,
certificate, schedule or instrument delivered or executed in connection
herewith;



(iii) any amount and fees, costs and expenses for which Parent is entitled to
indemnification pursuant to Section 2.9(g) or any Company Indebtedness to the
extent such Company Indebtedness was not discharged at or prior to Closing;
and



(iv) any demands by holders of Company Capital Stock under the DGCL or the
CCC, including, without limitation, for fees and costs incurred or expected to
be incurred, in connection with any appraisal proceedings and the extent, if
any, to which consideration is paid, or expected to be paid, to the holders of
Dissenting Shares in excess of the amounts otherwise payable to any such
holders of Company Capital Stock pursuant to this Agreement (the "Appraisal
Rights Indemnification Liability")



(v) any Company Merger Costs unpaid as of the Closing;

(vi) any Change of Control Expenses unpaid as of the Closing; and

(vii) any matters relating to or arising out of the Matrix Patent Termination
Agreements.



(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein: (i) no claim
may be made for any Loss related to or arising from (A) the amount or
availability of any Tax asset or attribute (including, but not limited to, net
operating loss carryforward or tax credit carryforward) of the Company or (B)
the ability of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or their Affiliates to
utilize such Tax asset or attribute following the Effective Time.



63



(c) Any indemnity payment made pursuant to Section 10 shall be treated as an
adjustment to the Merger Consideration for Tax purposes, unless a final
determination with respect to the Parent Indemnitee causes such payment to be
treated other than as an adjustment to the amount of the Merger Consideration
for federal income Tax purposes.

(d) In the event the Surviving Corporation suffers, incurs or otherwise
becomes subject to any Damages as a result of or in connection with any
inaccuracy in or breach or alleged breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or obligation, then (without limiting any of the rights of the
Surviving Corporation as a Parent Indemnitee) Parent shall also be deemed, by
virtue of its ownership of the stock of the Surviving Corporation, to have
incurred Damages as a result of and in connection with such inaccuracy or
breach.



10.3 Limitations.

(a) To the extent that Parent Indemnitees are entitled to seek recourse
against any future Contingent Consideration under this Section 10.3, Parent
Indemnitees may offset any Asserted Damages Amount against any Contingent
Consideration that becomes due and payable.

(b) Recourse against the General Escrow Fund shall be the sole and exclusive
remedy of the Parent Indemnitees with respect to any and all claims that any
of the Parent Indemnitees may have against the Company Securityholders under
Section 10.2.(a)(i), (ii), (iii) and (vii), except that for indemnification
claims either (i) under Section 10.2(a)(i) based on a breach of a Fundamental
Representation or any of the representations and warranties contained in
Section 3.13(j) or involving willful breach, fraud or intentional
misrepresentation or (ii) under Section 10.2(a)(vii), in each such case the
Parent Indemnitees shall be entitled to seek recourse also from any future
Contingent Consideration; provided however that the claim amount otherwise
available for recourse from future Contingent Consideration based on a breach
of the representations and warranties contained in Section 3.13(j) shall be
reduced by fifty percent (50%). In no event shall any paid Merger
Consideration and distributed amounts from the Escrow Fund received by any
Company Securityholders be subject to any clawback or recapture pursuant to
this Section 10, except in the case of fraud, by such Company Securityholder,
on which Parent has relied.

(c) Recourse against (i) first, the Appraisal Right Escrow Fund and (ii)
second, at Parent Indemnitees' choice, against the General Escrow Fund or
future Contingent Consideration or both, shall be the sole and exclusive
remedy of the Parent Indemnitees with respect to any and all claims that any
of the Parent Indemnitees may have against the Company Securityholders for
Appraisal Rights Indemnification Liability (Section 10.2(a)(iv)).

(d) Recourse against (i) first, the Company Merger Costs and Change of Control
Expenses Escrow Fund and (ii) second, at Parent Indemnitee's choice, against
the General Escrow Fund or future Contingent Consideration or both, shall be
the sole and exclusive remedy of the Parent Indemnitees with respect to any
and all claims that any of



64 

the Parent Indemnitees may have against the Company Securityholders for
Company Merger Costs (Section 10.2(a)(v)) or Change of Control Expenses
(Section 10.2(a)(vi)).

(e) The Company Securityholders shall only be obligated to indemnify Parent
Indemnitees pursuant to Section 10.2(a)(i) (except in the case of a breach of
a Fundamental Representation) for claims which individually involve Damages of
at least $25,000 ("Qualified Claims"), it being understood that, subject to
Section 10.3(f), Parent may recover the entire amount of any Qualified Claim.

(f) The Company Securityholders shall not be obligated to indemnify Parent
Indemnitees pursuant to Section 10.2(a)(i) (except in the case of a breach of
a Fundamental Representation) until the aggregate amount of Damages from
Qualified Claims equals $500,000 (in the aggregate) (the "Deductible Amount"),
whereupon the Company Securityholders shall be obligated to indemnify in
respect of aggregate Damages from Qualified Claims in excess of the Deductible
Amount.

(g) The limitations set forth in Section 10.3(a) through (f) against any
Company Securityholder shall not apply in the event of fraud by such Company
Securityholder.

(h) Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section 10.3 shall not limit Parent's
ability to enforce its rights under this Agreement by a decree of specific
performance or other equitable relief, and appropriate injunctive relief may
be applied for and granted in connection therewith.

(i) The amount of any Damages recoverable hereunder shall be reduced by the
amount of any Tax benefit realized by a Parent Indemnitee in connection with
such Damage or any insurance proceeds collected by such Parent Indemnitee in
connection with such Damage, net of (i) any increase in insurance premiums,
(ii) any applicable insurance deductibles and (iii) costs of collecting such
insurance proceeds.



10.4 No Contribution. The Company Securityholders shall not have and shall not
exercise or assert (or attempt to exercise or assert) any right of
contribution, right of indemnity or other right or remedy against the
Surviving Corporation in connection with any indemnification obligation or any
other liability to which such Company Securityholders may become subject under
or in connection with this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement.

10.5 Defense of Third Party Claims. A Parent Indemnitee shall give written
notice to the Securityholders' Representative of the commencement of any Legal
Proceeding initiated by a third party. Such notice shall be given within
thirty (30) days after receipt by the Parent Indemnitee of notice of such
Legal Proceeding; provided, however, that no delay or failure on the part of
the Parent Indemnitee in so notifying the Parent Indemnitee shall relieve the
Indemnitors of any liability or obligation hereunder except to the extent-such
failure has a material prejudicial effect on the defenses or other rights
available to the Indemnitors or the Securityholders' Representative with
respect to such Legal Proceeding. Within thirty (30) days after delivery of
such notification, the Securityholders' Representative may, upon written
notice thereof to the Parent Indemnitee and Parent, assume control of the
defense of such Legal

65 

Proceeding with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Parent unless the
Parent Indemnitee has notified the Securityholders' Representative that it has
determined in good faith that there is a reasonable probability that such
Legal Proceeding may adversely affect the Parent Indemnitees other than as a
result of monetary damages; provided that (i) the Securityholders'
Representative may only assume control of such defense if the Securityholders'
Representative has immediate access to sufficient financial means to fund the
defense thereof and (ii) the Securityholders' Representative conclusively, and
without qualification or reservation, acknowledges in writing that it has an
indemnification obligation pursuant to this Section 10 with respect to a
significant portion of the associated Damages. If the Securityholders'
Representative does not, or is not permitted under the terms hereof to, so
assume control of the defense of a Legal Proceeding, the Parent shall control
such defense. The Securityholders' Representative may participate in such
defense at its own expense on behalf of the Indemnitors. The Parent shall keep
the Securityholders' Representative advised of the status of such Legal
Proceeding and the defense thereof. The Securityholders' Representative shall
furnish Parent with such information as it may have with respect to such Legal
Proceeding (including copies of any summons, complaint or other pleading which
may have been served on such party and any written claim, demand, invoice,
billing or other document evidencing or asserting the same) and shall
otherwise fully cooperate, without delay, with and assist the Parent in the
defense of such Legal Proceeding. The fees and expenses of counsel to Parent
with respect to a Legal Proceeding shall be considered Damages for purposes of
this Agreement if (i) the Parent controls the defense of such Legal Proceeding
pursuant to the terms of this section or (ii) the Securityholders'
Representative assumes control of such defense and the Parent Indemnitee
reasonably concludes that the Securityholders' Representative and the Parent
Indemnitee have conflicting interests or different defenses available with
respect to such Legal Proceeding. The Securityholders' Representative shall
not agree to any settlement of, or the entry of any judgment arising from, any
Legal Proceeding without the prior written consent of the Parent, if such
settlement or judgment would result in (i) the imposition of a consent order,
injunction or decree that would restrict the future activity or conduct of any
Parent Indemnitee, (ii) a finding or admission of a violation of Law or
violation of any rights of any Person by any Parent Indemnitee, (iii) a
finding or admission that would have an adverse effect on other claims made or
threatened against any Parent Indemnitee or (iv) a judgment or settlement the
consequences of which would materially interfere with or adversely affect the
reputation or future business prospects of the Parent Indemnitees. Parent
shall not agree to any settlement of, or the entry of any judgment arising
from any Legal Proceeding without the prior written consent of the
Securityholders' Representative, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed.

10.6 Indemnification Claims.

(a) In order for any Parent Indemnitee to seek indemnification under this
Section 10, Parent shall deliver, in good faith, a written demand (an
"Indemnification Demand") to the Securityholders' Representative and the
Escrow Agent which contains

(i) a reasonably detailed description of the claims for which indemnification
is sought and the amount (the "Asserted Damages Amount") of any Damages
incurred or reasonably expected to be incurred by the Parent Indemnitee, (ii)
a statement that the Parent Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification under
this Section 10 for such Damages and a reasonable explanation of the basis
therefor, and (iii) a demand for payment of the Asserted Damages Amount.



66 

(b) Within forty-five (45) days after delivery of an Indemnification Demand to
the Securityholders' Representative, the Securityholders' Representative shall
deliver to Parent a written response (the "Response") in which the
Securityholders' Representative shall either: (i) agree that the Parent
Indemnitee is entitled to receive all of the Asserted Damages Amount, in which
case the Securityholders' Representative and Parent shall deliver to the
Escrow Agent, within five days following the delivery of the Response, a
written notice executed by both such parties instructing the Escrow Agent to
disburse the full Asserted Damages Amount to the extent of the remaining
amount in the applicable Escrow Fund to Parent; (ii) agree that the Parent
Indemnitee is entitled to receive part, but not all, of the Asserted Damages
Amount (such portion, the "Agreed Portion"), in which case the
Securityholders' Representative and Parent shall deliver to the Escrow Agent,
within five days following the delivery of the Response, a written notice
executed by both such parties instructing the Escrow Agent to disburse the
Agreed Portion to the extent of the remaining amount in the applicable Escrow
Fund to Parent; or (iii) dispute that the Parent Indemnitee is entitled to
receive any of the Asserted Damages Amount. If the Securityholders'
Representative does not so respond in writing, the Securityholders'
Representative shall be deemed to have agreed that the Parent Indemnitee is
entitled to receive all of the Asserted Damages Amount, in which case the
Parent shall deliver to the Escrow Agent a written notice executed by it
instructing the Escrow Agent to disburse the full Asserted Damages Amount to
the extent of the remaining amount in the applicable Escrow Fund to Parent.



(c) In the event that the Securityholders' Representative shall (i) dispute
that the Parent Indemnitee is entitled to receive any of the Asserted Damages
Amount, or (ii) agree that the Parent Indemnitee is entitled to only the
Agreed Portion of the Asserted Damages Amount, the Securityholders'
Representative and Parent shall attempt in good faith to agree upon the rights
of the respective parties with respect to each of the indemnification claims
that comprise the Asserted Damages Amount (or the portion of the Asserted
Damages Amount not comprising the Agreed Portion). If the Securityholders'
Representative and Parent should so agree, a memorandum setting forth such
agreement shall be prepared and signed by both such parties and shall be
promptly furnished to the Escrow Agent. If no such agreement can be reached
after good faith negotiation within thirty (30) days after delivery of a
Response, either Parent or the Securityholders' Representative may seek a
resolution of the dispute under Section 11.8.



SECTION 11.

MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS

11.1 Securityholders' Representative.

(a) The Company Securityholders, by approving this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, hereby irrevocably appoint Fortis Advisors
LLC as Securityholders' Representative in accordance with the terms of the
securityholders' representative agreement attached hereto as Exhibit I (the
"Securityholders' Representative Agreement"), including to act as their agent
and attorney-in-fact for purposes of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement,
consent to the taking by the

67 

Securityholders' Representative of any and all actions and the making of any
decisions required or permitted to be taken by it under this Agreement and the
Escrow Agreement (including the exercise of the power to authorize delivery to
Parent of the Escrow Funds in satisfaction of claims by Parent or otherwise,
agree to, negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises of and demand
arbitration, and comply with orders of courts and awards of arbitrators with
respect to such claims or otherwise, resolve any claims made pursuant to
Section 10 and the Escrow Agreement, and to take all actions necessary or
appropriate in the judgment of the Securityholders' Representative for the
accomplishment of the foregoing) and waive any and all defenses which may be
available to contest, negate or disaffirm the action of the Securityholders'
Representative taken in good faith under this Agreement or the Escrow
Agreement. Parent shall be entitled to deal exclusively with the
Securityholders' Representative on all matters relating to this Agreement and
the Escrow Agreement, and shall be entitled to rely conclusively (without
further evidence of any kind whatsoever) on any document executed or purported
to be executed on behalf of any Company Securityholder by the Securityholders'
Representative, and on any other action taken or purported to be taken on
behalf of any Company Securityholder by the Securityholders' Representative,
as fully binding upon such Company Securityholder. The rights and obligations
of the Securityholders' Representative shall be as set forth herein and in the
Securityholders' Representative Agreement. If the Securityholders'
Representative shall become unable to fulfill its responsibilities as agent of
the Company Securityholders, then the Company Securityholders who held a
majority of the voting Company Capital Stock immediately prior to the Merger
(the "Requisite Former Company Securityholders") are authorized and shall,
within 10 days after disability or resignation, appoint a successor agent and,
promptly thereafter, shall notify Parent of the identity of such successor.
Any such successor shall become the "Securityholders' Representative" for
purposes of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement. If for any reason there
is no Securityholders' Representative at any time, all references herein to
the Securityholders' Representative shall be deemed to refer to the Requisite
Former Company Securityholders.

(b) The Escrow Agent shall hold the Representative Reimbursement Fund in trust
for the benefit of the Company Securityholders. The Securityholders'
Representative shall be permitted to withdraw funds from the Representative
Reimbursement Fund to reimburse it for any Representative Expenses or Damages
incurred hereunder. If the Representative Reimbursement Fund is insufficient
to cover such Representative Expenses or Damages, the Securityholders'
Representative shall, at its election, recover such amounts from any
distribution of the Escrow Funds or Contingent Consideration otherwise
distributable to the Company Securityholders at the time of distribution, or
directly from the Company Securityholders in accordance with their Initial Pro
Rata Portion. Upon the termination of the Contingent Consideration Period (or
such later date as is reasonably determined by the Securityholders'
Representative), the Escrow Agent shall transfer to the Paying Agent, for
distribution to the Company Securityholders in accordance with their Initial
Pro Rata Portion, all amounts then remaining in the Representative
Reimbursement Fund. The Company Securityholders acknowledge that the
Securityholders' Representative shall not be required to expend or risk its
own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in the exercise or
performance of any of its powers, rights, duties or privileges or
administration

68 

of the Securityholders' Representative's duties. For the avoidance of doubt,
under no circumstances shall the Company, Parent or any of their Affiliates be
liable, directly or indirectly, for (i) any costs, expenses or fees incurred
by, or any Damages suffered or incurred by, the Securityholders'
Representative, or (ii) any Damages suffered or incurred by any Person arising
out of or related to the Securityholders' Representative actions or failures
to act.

11.2 Further Assurances. Each party hereto shall execute and cause to be
delivered to each other party hereto such instruments and other documents, and
shall take such other actions, as such other party may reasonably request
(prior to, at or after the Closing) for the purpose of carrying out or
evidencing any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

11.3 Fees and Expenses. Each party to this Agreement shall bear and pay all
fees, costs and expenses (including legal fees and accounting fees) that have
been incurred or that are incurred by such party in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including all fees, costs and
expenses incurred by such party in connection with or by virtue of

(a) the investigation and review conducted by Parent and its Representatives
with respect to the Company's business (and the furnishing of information to
Parent and its Representatives in connection with such investigation and
review), (b) the negotiation, preparation and review of this Agreement
(including the Company Disclosure Schedule) and all agreements, certificates,
opinions and other instruments and documents delivered or to be delivered in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (c) the
preparation and submission of any filing or notice required to be made or
given in connection with any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and the obtaining of any Consent required to be obtained in
connection with any of such transactions, and (d) the consummation of the
Merger, provided that to the extent such fees, costs and expenses constitute
Company Merger Costs, they shall be disbursed by the Paying Agent as provided
under this Agreement.

11.4 Notices. Any notice or other communication required or permitted to be
delivered to any party under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be
deemed properly delivered, given and received when delivered (by hand, by
registered mail, by courier or express delivery service, or by facsimile) to
