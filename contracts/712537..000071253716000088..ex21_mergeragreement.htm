with Buyer (the "Company Voting Agreements"), pursuant to which each such
director, executive officer and entity has agreed, among other things, to vote
all shares of common stock of Company owned by such person and their related
entities in favor of the approval of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in

reorganization" for purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of the Code and

agreements in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe certain

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants, representations,
warranties and agreements contained herein, and intending to be legally bound
hereby, the parties agree as follows:

Time, the Company shall merge with and into Buyer, the separate corporate
existence of the Company shall cease and Buyer shall survive and continue its

Amended and Restated Bylaws and the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
(Buyer, as the surviving corporation in the Merger, being sometimes referred
to herein as the "Surviving Corporation").

1.2. Effective Time. On the Closing Date, as promptly as practicable after all

consummated at a closing (the "Closing") that will take place remotely via

the parties, which shall be no later than three (3) Business Days after all of
the conditions to the Closing set forth in Article VII (other than conditions
to be satisfied at the Closing, which shall be satisfied or waived at the
Closing) have been satisfied or waived in accordance with the terms hereof
and, in no event, earlier than April 1, 2017 (the "Closing Date").

interest in, to or under any of the rights, properties or assets of the
Company, or (b) otherwise carry out the purposes of this Agreement, the
Company and its officers and directors shall be deemed to have granted to
Buyer an irrevocable power of attorney to execute and deliver, in such 

official corporate capacities, all such deeds, assignments or assurances in
law or any other acts as are necessary or desirable to (x) vest, perfect or

ARTICLE II.

MERGER CONSIDERATION; EXCHANGE PROCEDURES

2.1. Merger Consideration. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, at the
Effective Time, automatically by virtue of the Merger and without any action
on the part of Buyer, the Company, any shareholder of the Company or any
shareholder of Buyer:

(a) Each share of common stock, par value $1.00 per share, of Buyer ("Buyer
Common Stock") that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall remain issued and outstanding following the Effective
Time and shall be unchanged by the Merger.

(b) Each common share, no par value, of the Company ("Company Common Stock")
held as Treasury Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
cancelled and retired at the Effective Time without any conversion thereof,
and no payment shall be made with respect thereto.

(c)Subject to Section 2.3, each share of Company Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Treasury Stock
and Dissenting Shares) shall become and be converted into, as provided in and
subject to the limitations set forth in this Agreement, the right to receive,
either (i) the right to receive 1.427 shares the "Exchange Ratio") of Buyer
Common Stock (the "Share Option") or (ii) a cash payment in the amount of
$14.50 (the "Cash Option") (collectively, the "Merger Consideration"). Subject
to the provisions and limitations of Section 2.6, a holder of Company Common
Stock shall be entitled to elect the Share Option for all shares held of
record, the Cash Option for all shares held of record, or the Share Option for
a portion of the shares held of record and the Cash Option for a portion of
the Shares held of record.

2.2. Rights as Shareholders; Stock Transfers. All Company Common Stock, when
converted as provided in Section 2.1(c), shall no longer be outstanding and
shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist at the
Effective Time, and each certificate (each, an "Old Certificate" it being
understood that any reference herein to "Old Certificate" shall be deemed to
include references to book-entry account statements relating to the ownership
of shares of Company Common Stock) previously evidencing such shares shall
thereafter represent only the right to receive for each such share of Company
Common Stock, the Merger Consideration and, if applicable, any cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Buyer Common Stock in accordance with Section 2.3. At the
Effective Time, holders of Company Common Stock shall cease to be, and shall
have no rights as, shareholders of the Company, other than the right to
receive the Merger Consideration and cash in lieu of fractional shares of
Buyer Common Stock as provided under this ARTICLE II. After the Effective
Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company
of shares of Company Common Stock, other than transfers of Company Common
Stock that have occurred prior to the Effective Time.

2.3. Fractional Shares. Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, no
fractional shares of Buyer Common Stock and no certificates or scrip therefor,
or other evidence of ownership thereof, will be issued in the Merger. In lieu
thereof, Buyer shall pay to each holder of a fractional share of Buyer Common
Stock an amount of cash (without 

interest) determined by multiplying the fractional share interest to which
such holder would otherwise be entitled by the average of the daily closing
prices during the regular session of Buyer Common Stock on the New York Stock
Exchange ("NYSE") (as reported in The Wall Street Journal or, if not reported
therein, in another authoritative source) for the five (5) consecutive trading
days ending on the Business Day immediately prior to the Closing Date, rounded
to the nearest whole cent (the "Buyer Share Closing Price").

2.4. Dissenters Rights. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, any issued and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock held by a
person (a "Dissenting Shareholder") who has not voted in favor of, or
consented to, the adoption of this Agreement and has complied with all the
provisions of the OGCL concerning the rights of holders of shares of Company
Common Stock to require payment of fair cash value of such Company Common
Stock (the "Dissenting Shares"), in accordance with Section 1701.84 and
1701.85 of the OGCL, shall not be converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration as described in Section 2.1(c), but shall become the
right to receive such consideration as may be determined to be due to such
Dissenting Shareholder pursuant to the procedures set forth in Section 1701.85
of the OGCL. If such Dissenting Shareholder withdraws its demand for fair cash
value or fails to perfect or otherwise loses its rights as a dissenting
shareholder, in any case under the OGCL, each of such Dissenting Shareholder's
shares of Company Common Stock shall thereupon be treated as though such
shares of Company Common Stock had been converted into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1(c). The Company shall notify
Buyer of each shareholder who asserts rights as a Dissenting Shareholder
promptly following receipt of such Shareholder's written demand delivered as
provided in Section 1701.85 of the OGCL. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Buyer, voluntarily
make any payment, or settle or commit to settle or offer to settle any rights
of a Dissenting Shareholder asserted under Section 1701.85 of the OGCL.

2.5. Election. An election form (the "Election Form") shall be mailed to each
record holder of Company Common Stock as of the record date (the "Special
Record Date") fixed for the Company Meeting (as defined below). In addition,
commercially reasonable efforts will be made to make the Election Form
available to all persons who become shareholders of the Company between the
Special Record Date and the Election Deadline (as defined below). The deadline
for receipt of such Election Forms shall be the close of business on the
Business Day immediately prior to the Company Meeting, or such other later
date mutually agreed to by the Company and Buyer (the "Election Deadline").
The Election Forms shall be mailed to each record holder of Company Common
Stock as of the Special Record Date to elect, subject to Section 2.6, to have
all of such holder's shares exchanged in the Merger into either the Share
Option, the Cash Option, or a combination of the Share Option and the Cash
Option. An election shall be duly made by completing the Election Form and any
other required documents in accordance with the instructions set forth therein
and delivering them on or before 5:00 p.m., Eastern time, on the Election
Deadline to the Exchange Agent or to such other person or persons mutually
agreed upon by the Company and Buyer to receive elections. Shares of Company
Common Stock as to which the Stock Option have been elected are referred to
herein as "Stock Election Shares." Shares of Company Common Stock as to which
the Cash Option has been elected are referred to as "Cash Election Shares."
Shares of Company Common Stock as to which no valid election has been made by
the Election Deadline are referred to as "Non-Election Shares."

2.6. Diversity of Payments.

(a) In the event the number of Cash Election Shares would entitle the holders
of such shares (and shareholders of the Company receiving cash payments for
fractional shares) to receive $21,283,773 (the "Cash Payment Target") in cash,
then all Share Option and Cash Option elections of the holders of Company
Common Stock shall be honored (and each in its entirety) and all Non-Election
Shares shall be treated as Stock Election Shares. For purposes of this
determination, any Dissenting Shares shall be counted as though they were Cash
Election Shares.

(b) In the event that the amount of cash to be received by holders of Cash
Election Shares (including Dissenting Shares) and shareholders of the Company
receiving cash payments for fractional shares pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement would result in cash payments of more than the Cash Payment Target,
then:

(i)the Non-Election Shares shall be treated as Stock Election Shares; and 

(ii)the Cash Election Shares (not including any Dissenting Shares) shall be
converted into Stock Election Shares pro rata (based on the total number of
Stock Election Shares),

until the total remaining number of Cash Election Shares is such that the
Merger will (A) result in cash payments (including Dissenting Shares and
fractional shares) of equal or as nearly equal as possible to the Cash Payment
Target and (B) satisfy the "continuity of interest" requirement applicable to
tax-free reorganizations under the Code.

(c) In the event that the amount of cash to be received by holders of Cash
Election Shares (including Dissenting Shares) and shareholders of the Company
receiving cash payments for fractional shares pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement would result in cash payments of less than the Cash Payment Target,
then:

(i) First, the Non-Election Shares shall be treated as Cash Election Shares or
Stock Election Shares, as necessary, pro rata (based on the total number of
Cash Election Shares); and

(ii) Second, the Stock Election Shares (not including any Dissenting Shares)
shall be converted into Cash Election Shares pro rata (based on the total
number of Cash Election Shares),

until the total remaining number of Cash Election Shares is such that the
Merger will (A) result in cash payments (including Dissenting Shares and
fractional shares) of equal or as nearly equal as possible to the Cash Payment
Target and (B) satisfy the "continuity of interest" requirement applicable to
tax-free reorganizations under the Code.

(d)Buyer and the Company shall mutually determine the validity of elections
submitted by shareholders of the Company.

(e)A holder of Company Common Stock that is a bank, trust company, security
broker-dealer, or other recognized nominee, may submit one or more Election
Forms for the persons for whom it holds shares as nominee provided that such
bank, trust company, security broker-dealer or nominee certifies to the
satisfaction of Buyer and the Company the names of persons for whom it is so
holding shares (the "Beneficial Owners"). In such case, each Beneficial Owner
for whom an Election Form is submitted shall be treated as a separate owner
for purposes of the election procedures and allocation of shares set forth
herein.

(f)Buyer and the Company may, upon mutual agreement, apply the adjustments set
forth in this Section 2.6 only to such extent and to such number of
shareholders of the Company as is necessary to accomplish the objectives of
this Section 2.6 and to otherwise assure that the Merger will qualify as a
tax-free reorganization.

2.7. Exchange Procedures.

(a) At or before the Effective Time, for the benefit of the holders of Old
Certificates, (i) Buyer shall cause to be delivered to a bank or trust company
designated by Buyer and reasonably satisfactory to the Company (the "Exchange
Agent"), for exchange in accordance with this ARTICLE II, certificates
representing the shares of Buyer Common Stock issuable pursuant to this
ARTICLE II ("New Certificates") and (ii) Buyer shall deliver, or shall cause
to be delivered, to the Exchange Agent an aggregate amount of cash sufficient
to pay the Cash Option (the "Cash Consideration") and the estimated amount of
cash to be paid in lieu of fractional shares of Buyer Common Stock (such New
Certificates and cash hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Fund").

(b) As promptly as practicable following the Effective Time, but in no event
later than seven (7) Business Days thereafter, and provided that the Company
has delivered, or caused to be delivered, to the Exchange Agent all
information which is necessary for the Exchange Agent to perform its
obligations as specified herein, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder
of record of an Old Certificate or Old Certificates representing shares of
Company Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time that have been
converted at the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration pursuant to this Agreement, a form of letter of transmittal
(which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the Old Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Old
Certificates to the Exchange Agent) and instructions for use in effecting the 

surrender of the Old Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration to
which such holder of Company Common Stock shall have become entitled to
receive in accordance with, and subject to Section 2.1 and Section 2.3 of this
Agreement. Upon proper surrender of an Old Certificate for exchange and
cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with a properly completed letter
of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such Old Certificate shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor, as applicable, (i) a New Certificate
representing that number of shares of Buyer Common Stock, if any, to which
such former holder of Company Common Stock shall have become entitled pursuant
to this Agreement and (ii) a check representing (1) the Cash Consideration,
(2) the amount of cash (if any) payable in lieu of a fractional share of Buyer
Common Stock which such former holder has the right to receive in respect of
the Old Certificate surrendered pursuant to this Agreement and (3) any
dividends or distributions which the holder thereof has the right to receive
pursuant to Section 2.7(c), and the Old Certificate so surrendered shall
forthwith be cancelled. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section
2.7(b), each Old Certificate (other than Old Certificates representing
Treasury Stock and subject to Section 2.4) shall be deemed at any time after
the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender
the Merger Consideration provided in Section 2.1 and Section 2.3 and any
unpaid dividends and distributions thereon as provided in Section 2.7(c). No
interest shall be paid or accrued on (x) the Cash Consideration (y) any cash
in lieu of fractional shares or (z) any such unpaid dividends and
distributions payable to holders of Certificates.

(c) No dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective
Time with respect to Buyer Common Stock shall be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered Old Certificate until the holder thereof shall surrender such
Old Certificate in accordance with this Section 2.7. After the surrender of an
Old Certificate in accordance with this Section 2.7, the record holder thereof
shall be entitled to receive any such dividends or other distributions,
without any interest thereon, which theretofore had become payable with
respect to shares of Buyer Common Stock represented by such Old Certificate.

(d) The Exchange Agent and Buyer, as the case may be, shall not be obligated
to deliver a New Certificate or New Certificates representing shares of Buyer
Common Stock and/or the Cash Consideration (or any cash in lieu of fractional
shares) to which a holder of Company Common Stock would otherwise be entitled
as a result of the Merger until such holder surrenders the Old Certificate or
Old Certificates representing the shares of Company Common Stock for exchange
as provided in this Section 2.7, or an appropriate affidavit of loss and
indemnity agreement and/or a bond in an amount as may be required in each case
by Buyer. If any New Certificates evidencing shares of Buyer Common Stock are
to be issued in a name other than that in which the Old Certificate evidencing
Company Common Stock surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it shall
be a condition of the issuance thereof that the Old Certificate so surrendered
shall be properly endorsed or accompanied by an executed form of assignment
separate from the Old Certificate and otherwise in proper form for transfer,
and that the Person requesting such exchange pay to the Exchange Agent any
transfer or other tax required by reason of the issuance of a New Certificate
for shares of Buyer Common Stock in any name other than that of the registered
holder of the Old Certificate surrendered or otherwise establish to the
satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid or is not
payable.

(e) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the
shareholders of the Company for one (1) year after the Effective Time (as well
as any interest or proceeds from any investment thereof) shall be delivered by
the Exchange Agent to Buyer. Any shareholders of the Company who have not
theretofore complied with Section 2.7(b) shall thereafter look only to the
Surviving Corporation for the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect of
each share of Company Common Stock such shareholder holds as determined
pursuant to this Agreement, in each case without any interest thereon. If
outstanding Old Certificates for shares of Company Common Stock are not
surrendered or the payment for them is not claimed prior to the date on which
such shares of Buyer Common Stock or cash would otherwise escheat to or become
the property of any governmental unit or agency, the unclaimed items shall, to
the extent permitted by abandoned property and any other applicable law,
become the property of Buyer (and to the extent not in its possession shall be
delivered to it), free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled to such property. Neither the Exchange Agent nor any party
to this Agreement shall be liable to any holder of shares of Company Common
Stock represented by any Old Certificate for any consideration paid to a
public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
laws. Buyer and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to rely upon the stock
transfer books of the Company to establish the identity of those Persons
entitled to receive the Merger Consideration specified in this Agreement, 

which books shall be conclusive with respect thereto. In the event of a
dispute with respect to ownership of any shares of Company Common Stock
represented by any Old Certificate, Buyer and the Exchange Agent shall be
entitled to deposit any Merger Consideration represented thereby in escrow
with an independent third party and thereafter be relieved with respect to any
claims thereto.

(f) Buyer (through the Exchange Agent, if applicable) shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from any amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock such amounts as
Buyer is required to deduct and withhold under applicable law. Any amounts so
deducted and withheld shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the holder of Company Common Stock in respect of which
such deduction and withholding was made by Buyer.

(g) In the event any Old Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming
such Old Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if requested by
Buyer, the posting by such person of a bond in such amount as Buyer may
determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be
made against it with respect to such Old Certificate, the Exchange Agent or
Buyer, as applicable, will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Old Certificate the Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of
fractional shares deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

2.8. Anti-Dilution Provisions. In the event Buyer or the Company changes (or
establishes a record date for changing) the number of, or provides for the
exchange of, shares of Buyer Common Stock or Company Common Stock issued and
outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a result of a stock split, reverse
stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, reorganization,
reclassification, or similar transaction with respect to the outstanding Buyer
Common Stock or Company Common Stock and the record date therefor shall be
prior to the Effective Time, or there is any special or extraordinary dividend
or distribution, the Exchange Ratio and, if appropriate, Cash Option shall be
proportionately and appropriately adjusted.

2.9. Equity Based Awards.

(a) As of the Effective Time, all restricted shares of Company Common Stock
granted under the Company's 2014 Restricted Stock Plan shall vest in full so
as to no longer be subject to any forfeiture or vesting requirements pursuant
to the terms of the 2014 Restricted Stock Plan, and all such shares of Company
Common Stock shall be considered outstanding shares for all purposes of this
Agreement, including, without limitation, for purposes of the right to receive
the Merger Consideration with respect thereto. The Company Board (or, if
appropriate, any committee thereof administering the 2014 Restricted Stock
Plan) shall adopt such resolutions or take such other actions as may be
required to effect the foregoing.

(b) As of the Effective Time, each option granted by the Company to purchase
shares of Company Common Stock under the DCB Financial Corp 2004 Long-Term
Stock Incentive Plan that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to
the Effective Time (a "Company Stock Option"), whether or not vested or
exercisable, shall be cancelled and cease to represent an option to purchase
Company Common Stock and shall be converted automatically into the right to
receive a cash payment from the Buyer in an amount equal to the product of (i)
the positive difference, if any, between the Per Company Share Cash Equivalent
Consideration (as defined below) and the exercise price of such Company Stock
Option and (ii) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such
Company Stock Option (the "Option Consideration"). If the exercise price of a
Company Stock Option exceeds the Per Company Share Cash Equivalent
Consideration, then at the Effective Time such Company Stock Option shall be
cancelled without any payment made in exchange therefor. The payment of the
Option Consideration referred to above shall be subject to each such option
holder executing such instruments of cancellation as Company and Buyer may
reasonably deem appropriate. The Company shall make the necessary tax
withholdings from the Option Consideration as required by law.

(c) For purposes of this Agreement, "Per Company Share Cash Equivalent
Consideration" means an amount equal to the amount in cash, without interest,
rounded to the nearest cent, equal to the (i) the Buyer Share Closing Price
multiplied by (ii) the Exchange Ratio. 

2.10. Reservation of Right to Revise Structure. Buyer may at any time change
the method of effecting the business combination contemplated by this
Agreement if and to the extent that it deems such a change to be desirable;
provided, however, that no such change shall (a) alter or change the amount of
the consideration to be issued to holders of Company Common Stock as merger
consideration as currently contemplated in this Agreement, (b) reasonably be
expected to materially impede or delay consummation of the Merger, (c)
adversely affect the federal income tax treatment of holders of Company Common
Stock in connection with the Merger, or (d) require submission to or approval
of the Company's shareholders after the plan of merger set forth in this
Agreement has been approved by the Company's shareholders. In the event that
Buyer elects to make such a change, the parties agree to execute appropriate
documents to reflect the change.

qualification.

(d) Each Company Employee Program is and has been operated in substantial
compliance with applicable laws and regulations and is and has been

benefit to any employee, officer, director or other service provider of the

any of its ERISA Affiliates to amend, merge, terminate or receive a reversion

independent contractors all persons whom it has designated to be independent
contractors rather than employees and (2) the Company and each of its

unfavorable features.

3.24. Investment Securities. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has good
title to all securities owned by it (except those sold under repurchase
agreements or held in any fiduciary or agency capacity), free and clear of any
Liens, except to the extent such securities are pledged in the ordinary course
of business to secure obligations of the Company or its Subsidiaries. Such

the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any agreement with any
individual or group regarding CRA matters and the Company has no Knowledge of,

reason to believe (because of the Company Bank's Home Mortgage Disclosure Act
data for the year ended December 31, 2015, filed with the FDIC, or otherwise)
that any facts or circumstances exist, which would cause the Company Bank: (a)
to be deemed not to be in satisfactory compliance with the CRA, and the
regulations promulgated thereunder, or to be assigned a rating for CRA
purposes by federal or state bank regulators of lower than "satisfactory"; (b)
to be deemed to be operating in violation of the federal Bank Secrecy Act, as

between the Company and any of its Affiliates comply, to the extent
applicable, with Regulation W of the FRB.

effect that, as of the date of such opinion, and based upon and subject to the
factors, assumptions and limitations set forth therein, the Merger
Consideration to be received by the common shareholders of the Company
pursuant to the Merger is fair from a financial point of view to such
shareholders, and such opinion has not been amended or rescinded, and remains
in full force and effect. The Company has been authorized by the Financial
Advisor to permit the inclusion of such opinion in its entirety in the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus.

existing discussions, negotiations, and communications with any Persons with
respect to any existing or potential Acquisition Proposal.

For purposes of this Agreement, "Acquisition Proposal" shall mean any inquiry,
offer or proposal (other than an inquiry, offer or proposal from Buyer),
whether or not in writing, contemplating, relating to, or that could
reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Transaction. For purposes of
this Agreement, "Acquisition Transaction" shall mean (A) any transaction or
series of transactions involving any merger, consolidation, recapitalization,
share exchange, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries; (B) any transaction pursuant to which any
third party or group acquires or would acquire (whether through sale, lease or
other disposition), directly or indirectly, any assets of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries representing, in the aggregate, 25% or more of the assets
of the Company and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis; (C) any issuance,
sale or other disposition of (including by way of merger, consolidation, share
exchange or any similar transaction) securities (or options, rights or
warrants to purchase or securities convertible into, such securities)
representing 25% or more of the votes attached to the outstanding securities
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; (D) any tender offer or exchange
offer that, if consummated, would result in any third party or group
beneficially owning 25% or more of any class of equity securities of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries; or (E) any transaction which is similar in
form, substance or purpose to any of the foregoing transactions, or any
combination of the foregoing. 



(b) Notwithstanding Section 6.5(a), prior to the date of the Company Meeting,
the Company may take any of the actions described in clause (ii) of Section
6.5(a) if, but only if, (i) the Company has received a bona fide unsolicited
written Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a breach of this Section
6.5; (ii) the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with
and having considered the advice of its outside legal counsel and a nationally
recognized, independent financial advisor, that (A) such Acquisition Proposal
constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal and (B) it
is required to take such actions to comply with its fiduciary duties to the
Company's shareholders under applicable law; (iii) the Company has provided
Buyer with at least three (3) Business Days' prior notice of such
determination; and (iv) prior to furnishing or affording access to any
information or data with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
otherwise relating to an Acquisition Proposal, the Company receives from such
Person a confidentiality agreement with terms no less favorable to the Company
than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement. The Company shall
promptly provide to Buyer any non-public information regarding the Company or
its Subsidiaries provided to any other Person which was not previously
provided to Buyer, such additional information to be provided no later than
the date of provision of such information to such other party.

For purposes of this Agreement, "Superior Proposal" shall mean any bona fide
written proposal (on its most recently amended or modified terms, if amended
or modified) made by a third party to enter into an Acquisition Transaction on
terms that the Company Board determines in its good faith judgment, after
consultation with and having considered the advice of outside legal counsel
and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation (x) would, if
consummated, result in the acquisition of all, but not less than all, of the
issued and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock or all, or substantially
all, of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated
basis; (y) would result in a transaction that (A) involves consideration to
the holders of the shares of Company Common Stock that is more favorable, from
a financial point of view, than the consideration to be paid to the Company's
shareholders pursuant to this Agreement, considering, among other things, the
nature of the consideration being offered and any material regulatory
approvals (including timing of such regulatory approvals) or other risks
associated with the timing of the proposed transaction beyond or in addition
to those specifically contemplated hereby, and which proposal is not
conditioned upon obtaining financing and (B) is, in light of the other terms
of such proposal, more favorable to the Company's shareholders than the Merger
and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and (z) is reasonably
likely to be completed on the terms proposed, in each case taking into account
all legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of the proposal.

(c) The Company shall promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) notify Buyer
in writing if any proposals or offers are received by, any information is
requested from, or any negotiations or discussions are sought to be initiated
or continued with, the Company or the Company Representatives, in each case in
connection with any Acquisition Proposal, and such notice shall indicate the
name of the Person initiating such discussions or negotiations or making such
proposal, offer or information request and the material terms and conditions
of any proposals or offers (and, in the case of written materials relating to
such proposal, offer, information request, negotiations or discussion,
providing copies of such materials (including e-mails or other electronic
communications) except to the extent that such materials constitute
confidential information of the party making such offer or proposal under an
effective confidentiality agreement). The Company agrees that it shall keep
Buyer informed, on a current basis, of the status and terms of any such
proposal, offer, information request, negotiations or discussions (including
any amendments or modifications to such proposal, offer or request).

(d) Neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw,
qualify, amend or modify, or propose to withdraw, qualify, amend or modify, in
a manner adverse to Buyer in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (including the Merger), the Company Recommendation, fail to
reaffirm the Company Recommendation within five (5) Business Days following
receipt of an Acquisition Proposal, or make any statement, filing or release,
in connection with the Company Meeting or otherwise, inconsistent with the
Company Recommendation (it being understood that taking a neutral position or
no position with respect to an Acquisition Proposal shall be considered an
adverse modification of the Company Recommendation); (ii) approve or
recommend, or propose to approve or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal; or
(iii) enter into (or cause the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter
into) any letter of intent, agreement in 

principle, acquisition agreement or other agreement (A) related to any
Acquisition Transaction (other than a confidentiality agreement entered into
in accordance with the provisions of Section 6.5(b) or (B) requiring the
Company to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the Merger or any other
transaction contemplated by this Agreement.

(e) Notwithstanding Section 6.5(d), prior to the date of the Company Meeting,
the Company Board may withdraw, qualify, amend or modify the Company
Recommendation (a "Company Subsequent Determination") after the fifth Business
Day following Buyer's receipt of a notice (the "Notice of Superior Proposal")
from the Company advising Buyer that the Company Board has decided that a bona
fide unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal that it received (that did not
result from a breach of this Section 6.5) constitutes a Superior Proposal if,
but only if, (i) the Company Board has reasonably determined in good faith,
after consultation with and having considered the advice of outside legal
counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation, that it
is required to take such actions to comply with its fiduciary duties to the
Company's shareholders under applicable law, (ii) during the five (5) Business
Day period after receipt of the Notice of Superior Proposal by Buyer (the
"Notice Period"), the Company and the Company Board shall have cooperated and
negotiated in good faith with Buyer to make such adjustments, modifications or
amendments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement as would enable the
Company to proceed with the Company Recommendation without a Company
Subsequent Determination; provided, however, that Buyer shall not have any
obligation to propose any adjustments, modifications or amendments to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement and (iii) at the end of the Notice
Period, after taking into account any such adjusted, modified or amended terms
as may have been proposed by Buyer since its receipt of such Notice of
Superior Proposal, the Company Board has again in good faith made the
determination (A) in clause (i) of this Section 6.5(e) and (B) that such
Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal. In the event of any
material revisions to the Superior Proposal, the Company shall be required to
deliver a new Notice of Superior Proposal to Buyer and again comply with the
requirements of this Section 6.5(e), except that the Notice Period shall be
reduced to three (3) Business Days.

(f) Nothing contained in this Section 6.5 shall prohibit the Company or the
Company Board from complying with the Company's obligations required under
Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act; provided, however, that any
such disclosure relating to an Acquisition Proposal (other than a "stop, look
and listen" or similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f)
under the Exchange Act) shall be deemed a change in the Company Recommendation
unless the Company Board reaffirms the Company Recommendation in such
disclosure.

6.6. Takeover Laws. No party shall take any action that would cause the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be subject to requirements
imposed by any Takeover Laws, as applicable, and each party shall take all
necessary steps within its control to exempt (or ensure the continued
exemption of) the transactions contemplated by this Agreement from, or if
necessary challenge the validity or applicability of, any applicable Takeover
Laws, as now or hereafter in effect, that purports to apply to this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby.

6.7. Shares Listed. Prior to the Effective Time, to the extent required by
NYSE, Buyer shall file a notice of additional listing of shares with NYSE with
respect to the shares of Buyer Common Stock to be issued to the holders of the
Company Common Stock in the Merger.

6.8. Regulatory Applications; Filings; Consents. Buyer and the Company and
their respective Subsidiaries shall cooperate and use their respective
reasonable best efforts (a) to promptly prepare all documentation, effect all
filings and obtain all permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all
third parties and Governmental Authorities, including, without limitation, the
Regulatory Approvals and the Bank Merger Approvals, necessary to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including, without
limitation, the Merger and the Bank Merger), and (b) to comply with the terms
and conditions of such permits, consents, approvals and authorizations;
provided, however, nothing contained herein shall be deemed to require the
Buyer, the Company or their Subsidiaries to take any action, or commit to take
any action, or agree to any condition or restriction, in connection with
obtaining the foregoing permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of any
third parties and Governmental Authorities that would reasonably be expected
to have a Company Material Adverse 

Effect or Buyer Material Adverse Effect, after giving effect to the
transaction contemplated by this Agreement (together, the "Burdensome
Conditions"). Provided that the Company has cooperated as required above,
Buyer agrees to file the requisite applications to be filed by it with the
FRB, the FDIC and the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities (the
"PDBS") and, if necessary, any other Governmental Authority including
Governmental Authorities of the states in which Buyer, the Company and their
respective Subsidiaries operate. Each of Buyer and the Company shall have the
right to review in advance, and to the extent practicable each will consult
with the other, in each case subject to applicable laws relating to the
exchange of information, with respect to, all material written information
submitted to any third party or any Governmental Authority in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In exercising the foregoing
right, each of the parties hereto agrees to act reasonably and as promptly as
practicable. Each party hereto agrees that it will consult with the other
party hereto with respect to the obtaining of all material permits, consents,
approvals and authorizations of all third parties and Governmental Authorities
necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and each party will keep the other party reasonably apprised of the
status of material matters relating to completion of the transactions
contemplated hereby.

6.9. Indemnification; Directors' and Officers' Insurance.

(a) Buyer agrees that all rights to indemnification and all limitations of
liability existing in favor of any director or officer of the Company or its
Subsidiaries (the "Indemnified Parties") as provided in the Company's Articles
of Incorporation or Code of Regulations or in the similar governing documents
of the Company's Subsidiaries as in effect as of the date hereof with respect
to matters occurring on or prior to the Effective Time shall survive the
Merger and shall continue in full force and effect for a period of six (6)
years from the Effective Time; provided, however, that all rights to
indemnification in respect of any claim asserted or made within such period
shall continue until the final disposition of such claim.

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company, in consultation with and subject
to the approval by Buyer, shall purchase an extended reporting period
endorsement under the Company's existing directors' and officers' liability
insurance coverage for the Company's directors and officers in a form
acceptable to the Company which shall provide such directors and officers with
coverage for six (6) years following the Effective Time of not less than the
existing coverage under, and have other terms not materially less favorable
to, the insured persons than the directors' and officers' liability insurance
coverage presently maintained by the Company, so long as the aggregate cost is
less than 200% of the annual premium currently paid by the Company for such
insurance (the "Premium Limit"). In the event that the Premium Limit is
insufficient for such coverage, the Company may enter into an agreement to
spend up to that amount to purchase such lesser coverage as may be obtained
with such amount.

(c) In the event Buyer or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates
with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii)
transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to
any Person, then, and in each such case, to the extent necessary, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Buyer shall
assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.9.

(d) The provisions of this Section 6.9 are intended to be for the benefit of,
and to grant third party rights to, and shall be enforceable by, each
Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives.

6.10. Employees and Benefit Plans.

(a) Following the Effective Time and until December 31, 2017 (the
"Continuation Period"), Buyer shall provide the individuals who are employed
by Company or any of its Subsidiaries immediately before the Effective Time
(the "Company Employees") and who continue employment during such time period
with (i) annual base compensation no less than the annual base compensation
provided to such Company Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time;
(ii) target incentive opportunities that are no less than the target incentive
amounts provided to such Company Employees immediately prior to the Effective
Time; and (iii) other employee benefits (which shall not include severance
benefits) that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to the 

employee benefits provided to Buyer's and its ERISA Affiliates' similarly-
situated employees after the Effective Time; provided, however, that until
such time as Buyer fully integrates the Company Employees into its plans,
participation in Company Employee Programs shall be deemed to satisfy the
foregoing standards, and with it being understood that the Company Employees
may commence participating in the plans of Buyer on different dates after the
Effective Time with respect to Buyer's and its ERISA Affiliates' different
plans.

(b) Without limiting the generality of subsection (a) above, from and after
the Effective Time, Buyer shall assume, honor and continue during the
Continuation Period or, if later, until all obligations thereunder have been
satisfied, all of Company's employment, retention, termination and change in
control plans, policies, programs, agreements, arrangements, and other Company
Employee Programs (which shall not include severance benefits) maintained by
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, in each case, as in effect at the
Effective Time, including with respect to any payments, benefits or rights
arising as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (either
alone or in combination with any other event), without any amendment or
modification, other than any amendment or modification required to comply with
applicable law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer may amend or terminate
any such arrangement to the extent that such amendment or termination is
permitted by the terms of the applicable arrangement as of the Effective Time.

(c) With respect to all plans maintained by Buyer in which the Company
Employees are eligible to participate after the Closing Date (including any
vacation, paid time-off and severance plans) for purposes of determining
eligibility to participate, level of benefits and vesting (but not for benefit
accrual under any defined benefit pension plan), each Company Employee's
service with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (as well as service with
any predecessor employer of the Company or any such Subsidiary, to the extent
service with the predecessor employer is recognized by the Company or such
Subsidiary) shall be treated as service with Buyer to the extent such service
would have been recognized by Company or its Subsidiaries under analogous
Company Employee Programs prior to the Effective Time; provided, however, that
such service need not be recognized to the extent that such recognition would
result in any duplication of benefits for the same period of service or result
in violations of applicable law.

(d) Without limiting the generality of subsection (a) above, Buyer shall use
all commercially reasonable efforts to waive any pre-existing condition
limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and waiting periods
under any welfare benefit plan maintained by Buyer in which Company Employees
(and their eligible dependents) will be eligible to participate from and after
the Effective Time, except to the extent that such pre-existing condition
limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and waiting periods
would not have been satisfied or waived under the comparable Company Employee
Program immediately prior to the Effective Time. Buyer shall use all
commercially reasonable efforts to recognize the dollar amount of all co-
payments, deductibles and similar expenses incurred by each Company Employee
(and his or her eligible dependents) during the calendar year in which the
Effective Time occurs for purposes of satisfying such year's deductible and
co-payment limitations under the relevant welfare benefit plans in which they
will be eligible to participate from and after the Effective Time. After the
Effective Time, Buyer shall be responsible for providing continuation coverage
required under Section 4980B of the Code and Title I, Part 6 of ERISA to all
former employees of Company who terminated employment on or before such date
and to all persons who are considered "MandA qualified beneficiaries" as defined
under Treas. Reg. Section 54.4980B-9 in connection with this transaction

(e) If requested by Buyer in writing at least sixty (60) days prior to the
Effective Time, Company shall cause any 401(k) plan sponsored or maintained by
Company (the "Company 401(k) Plan") to be terminated effective as of the day
immediately prior to the Effective Time and contingent upon the occurrence of
the Closing. In the event that Buyer requests that any Company 401(k) Plan be
terminated, the Company Employees shall be eligible to participate, effective
as of the Effective Time, in a 401(k) plan sponsored or maintained by Buyer (a
"Buyer 401(k) Plan"). Company and Buyer shall take any and all actions as may
be required, including amendments to the Company 401(k) Plan and Buyer 401(k)
Plan to permit the Company Employees who are then actively employed to make
rollover contributions to the Buyer 401(k) Plan of "eligible rollover
distributions" (within in the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code) in
the form of cash, notes (in the case of loans), or a combination thereof.
Company shall provide Buyer with evidence reasonably satisfactory to Buyer
that the Company 401(k) Plan has been terminated or amended, as applicable, in
accordance with this 

subsection; provided, however, that prior to amending or terminating the
Company 401(k) Plan, Company shall provide the form and substance of any
applicable resolutions or amendments to Buyer for review and approval (which
review shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed).

(f) Buyer agrees to honor the severance guidelines attached as Schedule
6.10(f) of the Buyer Disclosure Schedule in connection with the termination of
employment of any Company Employee, in such amounts, at such times and upon
such conditions as set forth on said Schedule.

(g) Prior to the Effective Time, the parties shall allocate the dollar amount
as set forth on Schedule 6.10(g) of the Company Disclosure Schedule (the
"Employee Retention Amount") among certain employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as shall be determined by Buyer's Chief Executive Officer (it
being understood and agreed that no amounts shall be allocated to any employee
with a severance or change in control agreement with the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries). Each portion of the Employee Retention Amount that is so
allocated will be paid in such amounts, at such times and upon such conditions
as shall be set forth in letter agreements with each such Company Employee, in
such form as mutually agreed upon by Buyer and the Company.

(h) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company may allocate the dollar amount as
set forth on Schedule 6.10(h) of the Company Disclosure Schedule (the
"Discretionary Bonus Amount") among certain employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as shall be determined by the Compensation Committee of the
Company Board. Each portion of the Discretionary Bonus Amount that is so
allocated will be paid by the Company on the Closing Date.

(i) The Company and Buyer shall use reasonable efforts to consult with each
other, and will consider in good faith each other's advice, prior to sending
any notices or other communication materials to the employees of the Company
and its Subsidiaries regarding this Agreement, the Merger or the effects
thereof on the employment, compensation or benefits of such employees and, in
any case, any such notice or communication materials shall comply with
applicable law.

(j) Notwithstanding anything else contained herein to the contrary, nothing in
this Section 6.10 shall be construed to create any third party beneficiary
rights in any Person who is not a party to this Agreement.

6.11. Notification of Certain Matters. Each of Buyer and the Company shall
give prompt notice to the other of any fact, event or circumstance known to it
that (a) is reasonably likely, individually or taken together with all other
facts, events and circumstances known to it, to result in any condition set
forth in ARTICLE VII not being satisfied, or (b) notwithstanding the standards
set forth in Section 9.1, would cause or constitute a material breach of any
of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained herein.
No such notice by Buyer or the Company shall affect or be deemed to modify or
waive any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement in this Agreement,
or the conditions to Buyer's or the Company's obligations to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

6.12. Financial Statements and Other Current Information. As soon as
reasonably practicable after they become available, but in no event more than
thirty (30) days after the end of each calendar month ending after the date of
this Agreement, the Company shall furnish to Buyer (a) consolidated financial
statements (including balance sheets, statements of operations and
shareholders' equity) of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries as of and
for such month then ended, (b) internal management financial control reports
showing actual financial performance against plan and previous period and (c)
any reports provided to the Company Board or any committee thereof relating to
the financial performance and risk management of the Company and its
Subsidiaries. All information furnished by the Company to Buyer pursuant to
this Section 6.12 shall be held in confidence to the same extent of Buyer's
obligations under Section 6.4(b).

6.13. Confidentiality Agreement. The Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in
full force and effect after the date hereof in accordance with its terms. 

6.14. Certain Tax Matters. During the period from the date of this Agreement
to the Effective Time, the Company shall, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to: (a) timely file (taking into account any extensions of time
within which to file) all Tax Returns required to be filed by it, and such Tax
Returns shall be prepared in a manner reasonably consistent with past
practice; (b) timely pay all Taxes shown as due and payable on such Tax
Returns that are so filed; (c) establish an accrual in its books and records
and financial statements in accordance with past practice for all Taxes
payable by it for which a Tax Return is due prior to the Effective Time; and
(b) promptly notify Buyer of any suit, claim, action, investigation,
proceeding or audit pending against or with respect to the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries in respect of any Tax matter, including, without limitation,
Tax liabilities and refund claims. The Chief Financial Officer of the Company
shall execute and deliver to Squire Patton Boggs (US) LLP and Porter, Wright,
Morris and Arthur, LLP certificates substantially in the form agreed to by the
Company and such firms at such time as may reasonably be requested by such
firms in connection with such firms' respective delivery of its tax opinions
pursuant to Section 7.2(b) and Section 7.3(b). All parties hereto shall report
the Merger as a reorganization within the meaning of Code Section 368(a)
unless otherwise required pursuant to a "determination" within the meaning of
Section 1313(a) of the Code.

6.15. Certain Litigation. The Company shall provide Buyer the opportunity to
participate at its own expense in the defense or settlement of any shareholder
litigation against the Company and/or its directors relating to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and no such settlement shall be
agreed to without Buyer's prior written consent (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

6.16. Classified Loans. The Company shall promptly after the end of each
quarter after the date hereof and upon Closing provide Buyer with a complete
and accurate list, including the amount, of all Loans subject to each type of
classification of the Classified Loans.

6.17. Charitable Commitments. Buyer is committed to supporting charitable
activities in the communities which the Company serves consistent with the
Company's past practices and agrees that it will honor all charitable
commitments of the Company as of the Effective Time and, for a period of three
(3) years following the Effective Time, Buyer will continue the Company's
charitable giving in the region currently served by the Company at an annual
level as set forth on Schedule 6.17 of the Company Disclosure Schedule.
Determinations regarding the allocation of these funds shall be made by Buyer.

9.7. Understanding; No Third Party Beneficiaries. Except for the
Confidentiality Agreement, which shall remain in effect, this Agreement
represents the entire understanding of the parties hereto with reference to
the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby and supersedes any and all
other oral or written agreements heretofore made. Except for Section 6.9
(Indemnification; Directors' and Officers' Insurance), nothing in this
Agreement, including the documents and instruments referred to herein,
expressed or implied, is intended to confer upon any person, other than the
parties hereto or their respective successors, any rights, remedies,
obligations or liabilities under or by reason of this Agreement, including the
right to rely upon the representations and warranties set forth herein. The
representations and warranties in this Agreement are the product of
negotiations among the parties hereto and are for the sole benefit of such
parties. Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are subject
to waiver by the parties hereto in accordance herewith without notice or
liability to any other person. In some instances, the representations and
warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation among the parties
hereto of risks associated with particular matters regardless of the knowledge
of any of the parties hereto. Consequently, persons other than the parties
hereto may not rely upon the representations and warranties in this Agreement
as characterizations of actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this
Agreement or as of any other date.

9.8. Assignability; Binding Effect. Prior to the Closing, this Agreement may
not be assigned by Buyer without the written consent of the Company and no
such assignment shall release Buyer of its obligations hereunder. After the
Closing, Buyer's rights and obligations hereunder shall be freely assignable.
This Agreement may not be assigned by the Company without the prior written
consent of Buyer. This Agreement shall be binding upon and enforceable by, and
shall inure to the benefit of, the parties hereto and their respective
successors and permitted assigns. 

9.9. Headings; Interpretation. The headings contained in this Agreement are
for reference purposes only and are not part of this Agreement. The word
"including" and words of similar import when used in this Agreement shall mean
"including, without limitation," unless the context otherwise requires or
unless otherwise specified. Words of number may be read as singular or plural,
as required by context.

9.10. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to constitute an original.

9.11. Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by, and interpreted in
accordance with, the laws of the State of Ohio, without regard to the conflict
of law principles thereof (except to the extent that mandatory provisions of
the PBCL are applicable). Each of the parties hereto (a) consents to submit
itself to the personal jurisdiction of the Court of Common Pleas of Delaware
County, Ohio, or if that court does not have jurisdiction, a federal court
sitting Columbus, Ohio in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating
to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
(b) agrees that all claims in respect of such action or proceeding may be
heard and determined in any such court, and (c) agrees that it will not
attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other
request for leave from any such court. Each of the parties hereto waives any
defense of inconvenient forum to the maintenance of any action or proceeding
so brought and waives any bond, surety or other security that might be
required of any other party with respect thereto. To the extent permitted by
applicable law, any party hereto may make service on another party by sending
or delivering a copy of the process to the party to be served at the address
and in the manner provided for the giving of notices in Section 9.6. Nothing
in this Section 9.11, however, shall affect the right of any party to serve
legal process in any other manner permitted by law. EACH OF BUYER AND THE
COMPANY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHTS TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION,
PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE)
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY.

9.12. Specific Performance. The parties agree that irreparable damage would
occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with its specific terms or were otherwise breached.
Each party agrees that, in the event of any breach or threatened breach by any
other party of any covenant or obligation contained in this Agreement, the
non-breaching party shall be entitled to seek (a) a decree or order of
specific performance to enforce the observance and performance of such
covenant or obligation, and (b) an injunction restraining such breach or
threatened breach.
