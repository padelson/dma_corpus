commercially reasonable efforts to provide earlier notice of the scheduled Merger Closing Date; and <I>provided further</I>, that the Issuer may delay from time to time the scheduled Merger Closing Date up to five (5)&nbsp;business days following

time is otherwise agreed by the Issuer), to be held in escrow until the Subscription Closing, the Purchase Price for the Acquired Shares by wire transfer of U.S. dollars in immediately available funds to the account specified by the Issuer in the
Closing Notice. Such funds shall be held on behalf of Subscriber until the Subscription Closing in an escrow account by an escrow agent selected by the Issuer, subject to such escrow agent meeting any requirements specified by Subscriber to the
Issuer prior to the date hereof. On the Merger Closing Date, the Issuer shall deliver to Subscriber (i)&nbsp;the Acquired Shares in book-entry form, free and clear of any liens or other restrictions whatsoever (other than those arising under state

Issuer&#146;s transfer agent (the &#147;<B>Transfer Agent</B>&#148;) showing Subscriber (or such nominee or custodian) as the owner of the Acquired Shares on and as of the Merger Closing Date. If the Merger Closing does not occur on the same day as

after the Merger Closing Date identified in the Closing Notice)) return the Purchase Price to Subscriber by wire transfer of U.S. dollars in immediately available funds to the account specified by Subscriber, and any book-entries shall be deemed
