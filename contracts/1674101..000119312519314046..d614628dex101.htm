RECITALS

WHEREAS, the Issuer, substantially concurrently with the execution of this
Subscription Agreement, shall enter into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (as
it may be amended or supplemented from time to time, the "Agreement and Plan
of Merger"), by and among the Issuer, Crew Merger Sub I LLC, a Delaware
limited liability company and a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of the Issuer,
Crew Merger Sub II LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and a direct,
wholly-owned subsidiary of the Issuer, Vertiv Holdings, LLC, a Delaware

Subscriber;

 

WHEREAS, in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Agreement and
Plan of Merger (collectively, the "Transactions"), Subscriber desires to
subscribe for and purchase from the Issuer that number of shares of Class A
common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the "Class A Shares"), of
the Issuer set forth on the signature page hereto (the "Acquired Shares") for
a purchase price of $10.00 per share (the "Per Share Purchase Price"), and for
the aggregate purchase price set forth on the signature page hereto (the
"Purchase Price"), and the Issuer desires to issue and sell to Subscriber the
Acquired Shares in consideration for the payment of the Purchase Price by or
on behalf of Subscriber to the Issuer on or prior to the Subscription Closing
(as defined below); and

WHEREAS, in connection with the Transactions, certain other
"accredited investors" (as defined in Rule 501 under the Securities Act of
1933, as amended (the "Securities Act")), have entered into separate
subscription agreements with the Issuer (the "Other Subscription
Agreements"), pursuant to which such investors have, together with Subscriber
pursuant to this Subscription Agreement, agreed to purchase on the Merger
Closing Date (as the term Closing Date is defined in the Agreement and Plan of
Merger) an aggregate of 123,900,000 Class A Shares at the Per Share Purchase
Price.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual
representations, warranties and covenants, and subject to the conditions,
herein contained, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto
hereby agree as follows:

 

1\. _Subscription_. Pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth herein, Subscriber hereby agrees to subscribe for and purchase from the
Issuer, and the Issuer hereby agrees to issue and sell to Subscriber, upon the
payment of the Purchase Price, the Acquired Shares (such subscription and
issuance, the "Subscription").

   

2\. _Subscription Closing_.

 

(a) The closing of the Subscription contemplated hereby (the "Subscription
Closing") is intended to occur on the Merger Closing Date substantially
concurrent with the Merger Closing (as the term Closing is defined in the
Agreement and Plan of Merger) and is contingent upon the occurrence of the
Merger Closing. Not less than five (5) business days prior to the scheduled
Merger Closing Date, the Issuer shall provide written notice to Subscriber
(the "Closing Notice") of such scheduled Merger Closing Date; _provided_ ,
that to the extent practicable, the Issuer shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to provide earlier notice of the scheduled Merger Closing
Date; and _provided further_ , that the Issuer may delay from time to time the
scheduled Merger Closing Date up to five (5) business days following the
original scheduled Merger Closing Date identified in the Closing Notice, or
such Merger Closing Date as it may be delayed, by written notice to Subscriber
if it provides Subscriber with notice of the revised Merger Closing Date no
later than twenty-four (24) hours prior to the then scheduled Merger Closing
Date. Subscriber shall deliver to the Issuer at least two (2) business days
prior to the then scheduled Merger Closing Date identified in the Closing
Notice (unless a later time is otherwise agreed by the Issuer), to be held in
escrow until the Subscription Closing, the Purchase Price for the Acquired
Shares by wire transfer of U.S. dollars in immediately available funds to the
account specified by the Issuer in the Closing Notice. Such funds shall be
held on behalf of Subscriber until the Subscription Closing in an escrow
account by an escrow agent selected by the Issuer, subject to such escrow
agent meeting any requirements specified by Subscriber to the Issuer prior to
the date hereof. On the Merger Closing Date, the Issuer shall deliver to
Subscriber (i) the Acquired Shares in book-entry form, free and clear of any
liens or other restrictions whatsoever (other than those arising under
state or federal securities laws or as set forth herein), in the name of
Subscriber (or its nominee in accordance with its delivery instructions) or to
a custodian designated by Subscriber, as applicable, and (ii) a copy of the
records of the Issuers transfer agent (the "Transfer Agent") showing
Subscriber (or such nominee or custodian) as the owner of the Acquired Shares
on and as of the Merger Closing Date. If the Merger Closing does not occur on
the same day as the Subscription Closing, the Issuer shall promptly (but not
later than one (1) business day thereafter (or two (2) business days
thereafter if the Issuer reasonably believes the Merger Closing will occur
within two (2) business days after the Merger Closing Date identified in the
Closing Notice)) return the Purchase Price to Subscriber by wire transfer of
U.S. dollars in immediately available funds to the account specified by
Subscriber, and any book-entries shall be deemed cancelled; _provided_ , that
the return of the funds shall not terminate this Subscription Agreement or
otherwise relieve any party of any of its obligations hereunder (including
Subscribers obligation to purchase the Acquired Shares at the Subscription
Closing).

(b) The Subscription Closing shall be subject to the conditions that, on the
Merger Closing Date:

 

(i) no suspension by the New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE") of the
qualification of the Acquired Shares for offering or sale or trading in the
United States, or initiation or threatening of any proceedings for any of such
purposes, shall have occurred;

 



2

    

(ii) all conditions precedent to the closing of the Transactions shall
have been satisfied or waived provided that any such waiver is not materially
adverse to Subscriber (in its capacity as such) (other than (A) those
conditions that by their nature may only be satisfied at the closing of the
Transactions, but subject to the satisfaction of such conditions as of the
closing of the Transactions, (B) the condition pursuant to Section 8.1(f) of
the Agreement and Plan of Merger (solely with respect to the Issuer receiving
the proceeds of the Acquired Shares) and (C) the condition pursuant to
Section 8.1(g) of the Agreement and Plan of Merger (solely with respect to the
Issuer receiving the proceeds of the Acquired Shares));

 

(iii) the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger shall not have been
amended, and the rights of the Issuer, Crew Merger Sub I LLC and Crew Merger
Sub II LLC thereunder shall not have been waived, in a manner that is
materially adverse to Subscriber (in its capacity as such);

 

(iv) solely with respect to Subscribers obligation to close, all
representations and warranties made by the Issuer in this Subscription
Agreement shall be true and correct in all material respects as of the Merger
Closing Date (other than (i) those representations and warranties expressly
made as of an earlier date, which shall be true and correct in all material
respects as of such date and (ii) those representations and warranties that
are already qualified by materiality or the absence of a Material Adverse
Effect (as defined below), which shall be true and correct as of the Merger
Closing Date), in each case without giving effect to the consummation of the
Transactions;

(v) solely with respect to the Issuers obligation to close, all
representations and warranties made by Subscriber in this Subscription
Agreement shall be true and correct in all material respects as of the Merger
Closing Date (other than (i) those representations and warranties expressly
made as of an earlier date, which shall be true and correct in all material
respects as of such date and (ii) those representations and warranties that
are already qualified by materiality or the absence of a Subscriber Material
Adverse Effect (as defined below), which shall be true and correct as of the
Merger Closing Date), in each case without giving effect to the consummation
of the Transactions;

 

(vi) solely with respect to Subscribers obligation to close, the Issuer shall
have performed, satisfied and complied in all material respects with all
covenants, agreements and conditions required by this Subscription Agreement
to be performed, satisfied or complied with by it at or prior to the
Subscription Closing; and

 

(vii) no governmental authority shall have enacted, issued, promulgated,
enforced or entered any material judgment, order, law, rule or regulation
(whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) which is then in effect and has
the effect of making consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
illegal or otherwise preventing or prohibiting consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby and no governmental authority shall have
threatened in writing a proceeding seeking to impose any such restraint or
prohibition.

(c) At the Subscription Closing, the parties hereto shall make reasonable
efforts to execute and deliver such additional documents and take such
additional actions as the parties reasonably may deem to be necessary in order
to consummate the Subscription as contemplated by this Subscription Agreement.

 

(d) For purposes of this Subscription Agreement, "business day" shall mean any
day other than (i) any Saturday or Sunday or (ii) any other day on which
banks located in New York, New York are required or authorized by applicable
law to be closed for business.

have been issued in violation of or subject to any preemptive or similar
rights created under the Issuers certificate of incorporation and bylaws or
under the Delaware General Corporation Law.

(c) This Subscription Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and
delivered by the Issuer and, assuming that this Subscription Agreement
constitutes the valid and binding agreement of Subscriber, is the valid and
binding obligation of the Issuer, enforceable against the Issuer in accordance
with its terms, except as may be limited or otherwise affected by (i)
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization,
moratorium or other laws relating to or affecting the rights of creditors
generally, and (ii) principles of equity, whether considered at law or
equity.

(d) Subject to obtaining the Required Approvals, the execution, delivery and
performance by the Issuer of this Subscription Agreement (including
compliance by the Issuer with all of the provisions hereof), and the issuance
and sale by the Issuer of the Acquired Shares, will not conflict with or
result in a breach or violation of any of the terms or provisions of,
or constitute a default under, or result in the creation or imposition of any
lien, charge or encumbrance upon any of the property or assets of the Issuer
pursuant to the terms of (i) any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan
agreement, lease, license or other agreement or instrument to which the
Issuer is a party or by which the Issuer is bound or to which any of the
property or assets of the Issuer is subject, which would be reasonably likely
to have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on the
business, properties, financial condition, stockholders equity or results of
operations of the Issuer (a "Material Adverse Effect") or materially affect
the validity of the Acquired Shares or the legal authority of the Issuer to
comply in all material respects with the Issuers obligations under this
Subscription Agreement; (ii) the organizational documents of the Issuer; or
(iii) any statute or any judgment, order, rule or 

 



4

    

 regulation of any court or governmental agency or body, domestic or foreign,
having jurisdiction over the Issuer or any of its properties that would be
reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect or materially affect the validity of the Acquired Shares or the
legal authority of the Issuer to comply in all material respects with the
Issuers obligations under this Subscription Agreement.

 

(e) Other than the Issuers Class B common stock, par value $0.0001 per share
(the "Class B Shares"), there are no securities or instruments issued by or
to which the Issuer is a party containing anti-dilution or similar provisions
that will be triggered by the issuance of (i) the Acquired Shares or (ii) the
shares to be issued pursuant to any Other Subscription Agreement that have
not been or will not be validly waived on or prior to the Merger Closing Date;
_provided_ , that the holders of the Class B Shares will waive any such anti-
dilution or similar provisions in connection with the Transactions.

(f) The Issuer is not in default or violation (and no event has occurred
which, with notice or the lapse of time or both, would constitute a default
or violation) of any term, condition or provision of (i) the organizational
documents of the Issuer, (ii) any loan or credit agreement, note, bond,
mortgage, indenture, lease or other agreement, permit, franchise or license
to which the Issuer is now a party or by which the Issuers properties or
assets are bound or (iii) any statute or any judgment, order, rule or
regulation of any court or governmental agency or body, domestic or foreign,
having jurisdiction over the Issuer or any of its properties, except, in the
case of clauses (ii) and (iii), for defaults or violations that have not had
and would not be reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate,
a Material Adverse Effect.

(g) The Issuer is not required to obtain any consent, waiver, authorization or
order of, give any notice to, or make any filing or registration with, any
court or other federal, state, local or other governmental authority, self-
regulatory organization or other person in connection with the execution,
delivery and performance by the Issuer of this Subscription Agreement
(including, without limitation, the issuance of the Acquired Shares), other
than (i) filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the
"Commission"), (ii) filings required by applicable state securities laws,
(iii) filings required in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 9(o)_ of this
Subscription Agreement; (iv) filings required by the NYSE, including with
respect to obtaining stockholder approval; and (v) the failure of which to
obtain would not be reasonably likely to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

stock of the Issuer consists of (i) 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par
value $0.0001 per share ("Preferred Shares"), (ii) 500,000,000 Class A Shares,

(i) The Issuer has not received any written communication from a governmental
entity that alleges that the Issuer is not in compliance with or is in
default or violation of any applicable law, except where such non-compliance,
default or violation would not be reasonably likely to have, individually or
in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. 

 



5

    

(j) The issued and outstanding Class A Shares are registered pursuant
to Section 12(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
"Exchange Act"), and are listed for trading on the NYSE under the symbol
"GSAH". There is no suit, action, proceeding or investigation pending or, to
the knowledge of the Issuer, threatened against the Issuer by the NYSE or the
Commission, respectively, to prohibit or terminate the listing of the Class A
Shares on the NYSE or to deregister the Class A Shares under the Exchange
Act. The Issuer has taken no action that is designed to terminate the
registration of the Class A Shares under the Exchange Act.

(k) Assuming the accuracy of Subscribers representations and warranties set
forth in _Section_ __ _ 4_ of this Subscription Agreement, no registration
under the Securities Act is required for the offer and sale of the
Acquired Shares by the Issuer to Subscriber.

(l) Neither the Issuer nor anyone acting on its behalf has offered the Class A
Shares or any similar securities for sale to, or solicited any offer to buy
any of the same from, or otherwise approached or negotiated in respect thereof
with, any person other than Subscriber and other accredited investors, each of
which has been offered Class A Shares at a private sale for investment.

(m) None of the Issuer nor any of its affiliates has offered Class A Shares
or any similar securities during the six months prior to the date hereof to
anyone other than in connection with the Transactions and to Subscriber and
other investors in connection with the Other Subscription Agreements. Other
than the foregoing, the Issuer has no intention to offer Class A Shares or
any similar security during the six months from the date hereof other than in
connection with the Transactions, including any transactions referenced in the
Agreement and Plan of Merger.

 

(n) Neither the Issuer nor any person acting on its behalf has offered or sold
the Acquired Shares by any form of general solicitation or general
advertising, including, but not limited to, the following: (1) any

general advertising.

registration statement and other document, if any, filed by the Issuer with
the Commission since its initial registration of the Class A Shares under the
Exchange Act (the "SEC Documents") is available to Subscriber via the
Commissions EDGAR system. None of the SEC Documents contained, when filed
or, if amended, as of the date of such amendment with respect to those
disclosures that are amended, any untrue statement of a material fact or
omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading; _provided_ , that with respect to the
information about the Company and its affiliates contained in the Schedule 14A
and related proxy materials (or other SEC document) to be filed by the Issuer
the representation and warranty in this sentence is made to the Issuers
knowledge. The Issuer has timely filed each report, statement, schedule,
prospectus, and registration statement that the Issuer was required to file
with the Commission since its initial registration of the Class A Shares under
the Exchange Act. There are no material outstanding or unresolved comments in
comment letters from the staff of the Division of Corporation Finance (the
"Staff") of the Commission with respect to any of the SEC Documents.

(p) Except for such matters as have not had and would not be reasonably likely
to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect, there
is no (i) action, suit, claim or other proceeding, in each case by or before
any governmental authority pending, or, to the knowledge of the Issuer,
threatened against the Issuer or (ii) judgment, decree, injunction, ruling or
order of any governmental entity or arbitrator outstanding against the Issuer.

 

(q) Other than the Agent (as defined below), the Issuer has not dealt with any
broker, finder, commission agent, placement agent or arranger in connection
with the sale of the Acquired Shares, and the Issuer is not under any
obligation to pay any brokers fee or commission in connection with the sale
of the Acquired Shares other than to the Agent. Neither the Issuer nor any of
its affiliates nor any other person acting on its behalf (other than its
officers acting in such capacity) has solicited offers for, or offered or
sold, the Acquired Shares other than through the Agent.

 

(r) Other than the Other Subscription Agreements, the Issuer has not entered
into any side letter or similar agreement with any subscriber in connection
with such subscribers direct or indirect investment in the Issuer or with or
any other investor, and such Other Subscription Agreements have not been
amended in any material respect following the date of this Subscription
Agreement and reflect the same Per Share Purchase Price and terms with
respect to the purchase of the Acquired Shares that are no more favorable to
such subscriber thereunder than the terms of this Subscription Agreement,
except, in each case, for agreements with Goldman Sachs and Co. LLC and David
M. Cote, and certain of their respective affiliates and related persons.

4.  _Subscriber Representations and Warranties_. Subscriber represents and
warrants that:

(a) If Subscriber is not a natural person, (i) Subscriber has been duly
organized, formed or incorporated, as the case may be, and is validly existing

Agreement is genuine and Subscriber has duly executed and delivered this
Subscription Agreement, and (iii) Subscriber has all requisite legal
competence and capacity to acquire and hold the Acquired Shares and to
execute, deliver and comply with the terms of this Subscription Agreement.

 



7

    

(c) Assuming that this Subscription Agreement constitutes the valid and
binding agreement of the Issuer, this Subscription Agreement is the valid and
binding obligation of Subscriber, enforceable against Subscriber in accordance
with its terms, except as may be limited or otherwise affected by (i)
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization,
moratorium or other laws relating to or affecting the rights of creditors
generally, and (ii) principles of equity, whether considered at law or equity.

 

(d) The execution, delivery and performance by Subscriber of this Subscription
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated herein will
not conflict with or result in a breach or violation of any of the terms or
provisions of, or constitute a default under, or result in the creation or
imposition of any lien, charge or encumbrance upon any of the property or
assets of Subscriber or, to the best of Subscribers knowledge, any of its
subsidiaries, if applicable, pursuant to the terms of (i) any indenture,
mortgage, deed of trust, loan agreement, lease, license or other agreement or
instrument to which Subscriber or, if applicable, any of its subsidiaries is
a party or by which Subscriber or, if applicable, any of its subsidiaries is
bound or to which any of the property or assets of Subscriber or, if
applicable, any of its subsidiaries is subject, which would be reasonably
likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on
the business, properties or financial condition of Subscriber, or, if
applicable, the stockholders equity or results of operations of Subscriber
or, if applicable, any of its subsidiaries, taken as a whole (a "Subscriber
Material Adverse Effect"), or materially affect the legal authority of
Subscriber to comply in all material respects with Subscribers obligations
under this Subscription Agreement, (ii) the organizational documents of
Subscriber if Subscriber is not a natural person, or (iii) any statute or any
judgment, order, rule or regulation of any court or governmental agency or
body, domestic or foreign, having jurisdiction over Subscriber or, if
applicable, any of its subsidiaries or any of their respective properties that
would be reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate,
a Subscriber Material Adverse Effect or materially affect the legal authority
of Subscriber to comply in all material respects with Subscribers obligations
under this Subscription Agreement.

 

(e) Subscriber is an accredited investor, satisfying the applicable
requirements set forth on _Schedule A_. Subscriber represents that it is
purchasing the Acquired Shares for its own account (and not for the account of
others) or for one or more separate accounts maintained by it as a fiduciary
or agent for the benefit of one or more other accredited investors and not
with a view to the distribution thereof in violation of the securities laws;
_provided_ , that the disposition of Subscribers property shall at all times
be within Subscribers control. Subscriber understands that the Acquired
Shares have not been registered under the Securities Act and may be resold
only if registered pursuant to the provisions of the Securities Act or if an
exemption from registration is available, except under circumstances where
neither such registration nor such an exemption is required by law, and that
the Issuer is not required to register the Acquired Shares other than as
provided for in _Section_ __ _ 5_ of this Subscription Agreement. Subscriber
further represents and warrants that it will not sell, transfer or otherwise
dispose of the Acquired Shares or any interest therein except in a registered
transaction or in a transaction exempt from or not subject to the registration

and conditions of this Subscription Agreement. Subscriber acknowledges that
the Acquired Shares will be subject to transfer restrictions as set forth on
_Exhibit A_ to this Subscription Agreement.

through anyone other than the Issuer or the Agent.

(g) Subscriber acknowledges that the Acquired Shares will not be eligible for
resale pursuant to Rule 144A promulgated under the Securities Act. Subscriber
understands and agrees that the Acquired Shares will be subject to transfer
restrictions as set forth on _Exhibit A_ to this Subscription Agreement,
unless and until such transfer restrictions have been removed in accordance
with _Section_ __ _ 5_ of this Subscription Agreement and, as a result of
these transfer restrictions, Subscriber may not be able to readily resell the
Acquired Shares and may be required to bear the financial risk of an
investment in the Acquired Shares for an indefinite period of time. Subscriber
understands that it has been advised to consult legal counsel prior to making
any offer, resale, pledge or transfer of any of the Acquired Shares.

(h) Subscriber understands and agrees that Subscriber is purchasing the
Acquired Shares directly from the Issuer. Subscriber further acknowledges
that there have been no representations, warranties, covenants and agreements
made to Subscriber by the Issuer, Subscriber or any of its officers, directors
or representatives, expressly or by implication, other than those
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements made by the Issuer in
this Subscription Agreement.

(i) In making its decision to purchase the Acquired Shares, Subscriber
represents that it has relied solely upon independent investigation made by
Subscriber. Subscriber acknowledges and agrees that Subscriber has received
such information as Subscriber deems necessary in order to make an investment
decision with respect to the Acquired Shares, including with respect to the
Issuer, the Transactions and the Company. Subscriber represents and warrants
that Subscriber and Subscribers professional advisor(s), if any, were given
the opportunity to ask questions and receive answers concerning the terms and
conditions of the Subscription and to obtain any additional information which
the Issuer possessed or could acquire without unreasonable effort or
expense. Subscriber acknowledges and agrees that it has not relied on the
Agent or any of the Agents affiliates with respect to its decision to
purchase the Acquired Shares.

 

(j) Subscriber became aware of the offering of the Acquired Shares solely by
means of direct contact between Subscriber and the Issuer or by means of
contact from Goldman Sachs and Co. LLC, acting as a placement agent for the
Issuer (the "Agent"), and the Acquired Shares were offered to Subscriber
solely by direct contact between Subscriber and the Issuer or by contact
between Subscriber and the Agent. Subscriber did not become aware of this
offering of the Acquired Shares, nor were the Acquired Shares offered to
Subscriber, by any other means. Subscriber acknowledges that the Issuer
represents and warrants that the Acquired Shares (i) were not offered by any
form of general solicitation or general advertising and (ii) are not being
offered in a manner involving a public offering under, or in a distribution in
violation of, the Securities Act, or any state securities laws.

(k) Subscriber acknowledges that it is aware that there are substantial risks
incident to the purchase and ownership of the Acquired Shares. Subscriber has
such knowledge and experience in financial and business matters as to be
capable of evaluating the merits and risks of an investment in the Acquired
Shares, and Subscriber has sought such accounting, legal and tax advice as
Subscriber has considered necessary to make an informed investment decision.

 



9

    

(l) Alone, or together with any professional advisor(s), Subscriber represents
and acknowledges that Subscriber has adequately analyzed and fully considered
the risks of an investment in the Acquired Shares and determined that the
Acquired Shares are a suitable investment for Subscriber and that Subscriber
is able at this time and in the foreseeable future to bear the economic risk
of a total loss of Subscribers investment in the Issuer. Subscriber
acknowledges specifically that a possibility of total loss exists.

 

(m) Subscriber understands and agrees that no federal or state agency has
passed upon or endorsed the merits of the offering of the Acquired Shares or
made any findings or determination as to the fairness of this investment.

(n) Subscriber represents and warrants that neither Subscriber nor, in the
case Subscriber is not a natural person, any of its officers, directors,
managers, managing members, general partners or any other individual acting in
a similar capacity or carrying out a similar function, is (i) a person or
entity named on the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List,
the Foreign Sanctions Evaders List, the Sectoral Sanctions Identification

subject to substantial trade restrictions by the United States, the European
Union or any individual European Union member state, including the United
Kingdom; (iv) a Designated National as defined in the Cuban Assets Control
Regulations, 31 C.F.R. Part 515; or (v) a non-U.S. shell bank or providing
banking services indirectly to a non-U.S. shell bank (collectively, a
"Prohibited Investor"). Subscriber represents that if it is a financial
institution subject to the Bank Secrecy Act (31 U.S.C. Section 5311 et seq.)
(the "BSA"), as amended by the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 (the "PATRIOT Act"),
and its implementing regulations (collectively, the "BSA/PATRIOT Act"), that
Subscriber maintains policies and procedures reasonably designed to comply
with applicable obligations under the BSA/PATRIOT Act. Subscriber also
represents that it maintains policies and procedures reasonably designed to
ensure compliance with sanctions administered by the United States, the
European Union, or any individual European Union member state, including the
United Kingdom. Subscriber further represents that the funds held by
Subscriber and used to purchase the Acquired Shares were legally derived and
were not obtained, directly or indirectly, from a Prohibited Investor.

practicable but no later than (i) forty-five (45) calendar days following the
Merger Closing Date and (ii) ninety (90) calendar days following the Issuers
most recent fiscal year end (the date the Registration Statement (as defined
below) is actually filed, the "Filing Date"), the Issuer will file with the
Commission (at the Issuers sole cost and expense) a registration statement
registering the resale of the Acquired Shares (the "Registration Statement"),
and the Issuer shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to have the
Registration Statement declared effective as soon as practicable after the
filing thereof, but no later than the earlier of (i) the 90th calendar day
following the Filing Date if the Commission notifies the Issuer that it will
"review" the Registration Statement and (ii) the 10th business day after the

Statement will not be "reviewed" or will not be subject to further review
(such earlier date, the "Effectiveness Date"); _provided, however_ , that the

Statement are contingent upon Subscriber furnishing in writing to the Issuer
such information regarding Subscriber, the securities of the Issuer held by
Subscriber and the intended method of disposition of the Acquired Shares as
shall be reasonably requested by the Issuer to effect the registration of the
Acquired Shares, and Subscriber shall use reasonable efforts to execute such
documents in connection with such registration as the Issuer may reasonably
request that are customary of a selling stockholder in similar situations,
including providing that the Issuer shall be entitled to postpone and suspend
the effectiveness or use of the Registration Statement during any customary
blackout or similar period or as permitted hereunder. Following the
Effectiveness Date, if the transfer restrictions as set forth on _Exhibit A_

any applicable state securities laws, upon request of Subscriber, the Issuer
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with Subscriber to
have such transfer restrictions removed, including providing authorization to
the Issuers transfer agent.

(i) _[Requests for Underwritten Shelf Takedowns_. Subject to  _Section_ __ _
5(c)_, at any time and from time to time when an effective Registration
Statement is on file with the Commission, Subscriber and, pursuant to
corresponding rights under the Other Subscription Agreements with
Eligible Subscribers (as defined below) (the "Other Eligible Subscription
Agreements"), the Eligible Subscribers party to such Other Eligible
Subscription Agreements (collectively with Subscriber, the "Eligible
Subscriber Holders"), may request (the requesting Eligible Subscriber Holder,
as applicable, a "Demanding Holder") to sell all or any portion of its
Registrable Securities (as defined below) in an underwritten offering that is
registered pursuant to the Registration Statement (an "Underwritten Shelf
Takedown"); _provided_ that the Issuer shall only be obligated to effect an
Underwritten Shelf Takedown if such offering shall include either (x)
Registrable Securities proposed to be sold by Subscriber, together with other
Demanding Holder(s), with a total offering price reasonably expected to
exceed, in the aggregate, $100 million, or (y) all remaining
Registrable Securities held by such Demanding Holder ((x) or (y), as
applicable, the "Minimum Takedown Threshold"). All requests for Underwritten
Shelf Takedowns shall be made by giving written notice to the Issuer, which
shall specify the approximate number of Registrable Securities proposed to be
sold in the Underwritten Shelf Takedown. Subject to _Section_ __ _ 5(a)(iv)_,
the Demanding Holder(s) shall have the right to select the underwriters for
such offering (which shall consist of one or more reputable nationally
recognized investment banks), subject to the Issuers prior approval (which
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). The Eligible
Subscriber Holder(s) in the aggregate may demand no more than two (2)
Underwritten Shelf Takedowns pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 5(a)(i)_ in any
twelve (12) month period.

 

(1) _Reduction of Underwritten Offering_. If the managing underwriter or
underwriters in an Underwritten Shelf Takedown, in good faith, advises the
Issuer, the Demanding Holders(s) and any persons requesting piggyback rights,
including, without limitation, under the AandR Registration Rights Agreement (as
defined below), this Subscription Agreement or Other Eligible
Subscription Agreements, or other separate contractual arrangements with
persons or entities (collectively, the "Requesting Piggyback Holders"), with
respect to such Underwritten Shelf Takedown (if any) in writing that the
dollar amount or number of Registrable Securities that the Demanding Holders
desire to sell, taken together with all other Class A Shares or other equity
securities that the Requesting Piggyback Holders (if any) and the Issuer
desire to sell, exceeds the maximum dollar amount or maximum number of equity
securities that can be sold in the underwritten offering without adversely
affecting the proposed offering price, the timing, the distribution method, or
the probability of success of such offering (such maximum dollar amount or
maximum number of such securities, as applicable, the "Maximum Number of
Securities"), then the Issuer shall include in such underwritten offering,
before including any Class A Shares or other equity securities proposed to be
sold by Issuer or by other holders of Class A Shares or other equity
securities: (i) first, the aggregate amount or number of Registrable
Securities of the Demanding Holders (pro rata based on the 

 



12

    

 respective number of Registrable Securities that each Demanding Holder has
requested be included in such Underwritten Shelf Takedown) which can be sold
without exceeding the Maximum Number of Securities; (ii) second, to the
extent that the Maximum Number of Securities has not been reached under the
foregoing clause (i), the aggregate amount or number of Class A Shares or
other equity securities, if any, as to which registration or a registered
offering has been requested by Requesting Piggyback Holders pursuant to the
registration rights set forth in the AandR Registration Rights Agreement (any
persons requesting or demanding registration rights pursuant to the
AandR Registration Rights Agreement, the "Requesting AandR Holders") which can be
sold without exceeding the Maximum Number of Securities; (iii) third, to the
extent that the Maximum Number of Securities has not been reached under the
foregoing clauses (i) and (ii), Class A Shares or other equity securities, if
any, of Requesting Piggyback Holders exercising their registration rights
pursuant to this Subscription Agreement or Other Eligible Subscription
Agreements (any persons requesting or demanding registration rights pursuant
to this Subscription Agreement or Other Eligible Subscription Agreements, the
"Requesting Eligible Subscriber Holders") (pro rata based on the respective
number of registrable securities that each such other Requesting Piggyback
Holder has requested be included in such Underwritten Shelf Takedown) which
can be sold without exceeding the Maximum Number of Securities; (iv) fourth,
to the extent that the Maximum Number of Securities has not been reached
under the foregoing clauses (i), (ii) and (iii), the Class A Shares or other
equity securities that the Issuer desires to sell which can be sold that can
be sold without exceeding the Maximum Number of Securities; and (v) fifth, to
the extent that the Maximum Number of Securities has not been reached under
the foregoing clauses (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv), Class A Shares or other
equity securities, if any, of Requesting Piggyback Holders exercising their
registration rights pursuant to other separate contractual arrangements with
persons or entities (any persons requesting or demanding registration rights
pursuant to such other arrangements, the "Requesting Other Holders") (pro
rata based on the respective number of registrable securities that each such
other Requesting Piggyback Holder has requested be included in such
Underwritten Shelf Takedown) which can be sold without exceeding the
Maximum Number of Securities.

(2) _Underwritten Offering Withdrawal_. Prior to the filing of the applicable
"red herring" prospectus or prospectus supplement used for marketing such
Underwritten Shelf Takedown, any Demanding Holder initiating an Underwritten
Shelf Takedown shall have the right to withdraw from such Underwritten Shelf
Takedown for any or no reason whatsoever upon written notification (a
"Withdrawal Notice") to the Issuer and the underwriter or underwriters (if
any) of their intention to withdraw from such Underwritten Shelf Takedown;
_provided_ that any remaining Demanding Holders may elect to have the Issuer
continue an Underwritten Shelf Takedown if the Minimum Takedown Threshold

 



13

    

 would still be satisfied by the Registrable Securities proposed to be sold
in the Underwritten Shelf Takedown by such remaining Demanding Holders. If
withdrawn, a demand for an Underwritten Shelf Takedown shall constitute a
demand for an Underwritten Shelf Takedown by the withdrawing Demanding Holder
for purposes of _Section_ __ _ 5(a)(i)_, unless such withdrawing Demanding
Holder reimburses the Issuer for all Registration Expenses (as defined below)
with respect to such Underwritten Shelf Takedown (or, if there is more than
one withdrawing Demanding Holder, a pro rata portion of such Registration
Expenses based on the respective number of Registrable Securities that each
withdrawing Demanding Holder has requested be included in such Underwritten
Shelf Takedown); _provided_ that, if any remaining Demanding Holders elect to
continue such Underwritten Shelf Takedown pursuant to the proviso in the
immediately preceding sentence, such Underwritten Shelf Takedown shall count
as an Underwritten Shelf Takedown demanded by such remaining Demanding Holders
for purposes of _Section_ __ _ 5(a)(i)_. Following the receipt of any
Withdrawal Notice, the Issuer shall promptly forward such Withdrawal Notice
to any other persons that had elected to participate in such Underwritten
Shelf Takedown. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
the Issuer shall be responsible for the Registration Expenses incurred in
connection with an Underwritten Shelf Takedown prior to its withdrawal under
this _Section_ __ _ 5(a)(i)(2)_, other than if a Demanding Holder elects to
reimburse the Issuer for such Registration Expenses pursuant to the second
sentence of this _Section_ __ _ 5(a)(i)(2)_.

(ii)  _Piggyback Rights_. Subject to _Section_ __ _ 5(c)_, if the Issuer
proposes to conduct a registered offering of, or if the Issuer proposes to
file a registration statement under the Securities Act with respect to
the registration of, equity securities, or securities or other obligations
exercisable or exchangeable for, or convertible into equity securities, for
its own account or for the account of stockholders of the Issuer, including,
without limitation, pursuant to demands under _Section_ __ _ 5(a)(i)_ of
this Subscription Agreements, under any Other Eligible Subscription Agreement,
under the AandR Registration Rights Agreement or under any other separate
contractual arrangement with other persons or entities (or by the Issuer and
by the stockholders of the Issuer including, without limitation, an
Underwritten Shelf Takedown), other than a registration statement (or any
registered offering with respect thereto) (i) filed in connection with any
employee stock option or other benefit plan, (ii) pursuant to a registration
statement on Form S-4 (or similar form that relates to a transaction subject
to Rule 145 under the Securities Act or any successor rule thereto), (iii)
for an offering of debt that is convertible into equity securities of the
Issuer, (iv) for a dividend reinvestment plan or (v) for a Block Trade (as
defined below), then the Issuer shall give written notice of such proposed
offering to all of the Eligible Subscriber Holders of Registrable Securities
as soon as practicable but not less than ten (10) days before the anticipated
filing date of such Registration Statement or, in the case of an underwritten
offering pursuant to a shelf registration, the applicable "red herring"
prospectus or prospectus supplement used for marketing such offering, which
notice shall (A) describe the amount and type of securities to be included in
such offering, the intended method(s) of distribution, and the name of the
proposed managing

 



14

    

 underwriter or underwriters, if any, in such offering, and (B) offer to all
of the Eligible Subscriber Holders of Registrable Securities the opportunity
to include in such registered offering such number of Registrable Securities
as such Eligible Subscriber Holders may request in writing within five (5)
days after receipt of such written notice (such registered offering, a
"Piggyback Registration"). Subject to _Section_ __ _ 5(a)(ii)(1)_, the
Issuer shall, in good faith, cause such Registrable Securities to be included
in such Piggyback Registration and, if applicable, shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the managing underwriter or underwriters of such
Piggyback Registration to permit the Registrable Securities requested by the
Eligible Subscriber Holders pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 5(a)(ii)_ to be
included therein on the same terms and conditions as any similar securities
of the Issuer included in such registered offering and to permit the sale or
other disposition of such Registrable Securities in accordance with the
intended method(s) of distribution thereof. The inclusion of any Eligible
Subscriber Holders Registrable Securities in a Piggyback Registration shall
be subject to such Eligible Subscriber Holders agreement to enter into an
underwriting agreement in customary form with the underwriter(s) selected for
such underwritten offering.

(1) _Reduction of Piggyback Registration_. If the managing underwriter
or underwriters in an underwritten offering that is to be a Piggyback
Registration, in good faith, advises the Issuer and the Requesting Piggyback
Holders pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 5(a)(ii)_ in writing that the dollar
amount or number of Class A Shares or other equity securities that the Issuer
desires to sell, taken together with the Class A Shares or other equity
securities, if any, as to which registration or a registered offering has been
demanded or requested by Requesting AandR Holders, Requesting Eligible
Subscriber Holders, including pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 5(a)(ii)_, and
Requesting Other Holders, as applicable, exceeds the Maximum Number of

Securities; and (IV) fourth, to the extent that the Maximum Number of
Securities has not been reached under the foregoing clauses (I), (II) and
(III), the registrable securities of Requesting Other Holders (pro rata, based

Holder has requested be included in such underwritten offering and the

without exceeding the Maximum Number of Securities; and  
---|--- 



     | (B) |

if the registration or registered offering is pursuant to a request by a
Eligible Subscriber Holder of Registrable Securities pursuant to _Section_ __
_ 5(a)(i)_ hereof, then the Issuer shall include in any such registration or
registered offering securities in the priority set forth in _Section_ __ _
5(a)(i)(1)_; and 

---|---|--- 



     | (C) |

if the registration or registered offering is not undertaken for the Issuers
or a Eligible Subscriber Holders account but is undertaken pursuant to a
request or demand by other holders, including under the AandR Registration
Rights Agreement (the "Other Demanding Holders"): (I) first, the Class A
Shares or other equity securities, if any, of such Other Demanding Holders
which can be sold without exceeding the Maximum Number of Securities; (II)
second, if the Other Demanding Holders are not Requesting AandR Holders, to the
extent that the Maximum Number of Securities has not been reached under the
foregoing clause (I), the aggregate amount or number of Class A Shares or

respective number of registrable securities that each such Requesting Other
Holder has requested be included in such underwritten offering and the

have requested to be included in such underwritten offering) which can be
sold without exceeding the Maximum Number of Securities. 
---|--- 

(2) _Piggyback Registration Withdrawal_. Any Eligible Subscriber Holder of
Registrable Securities (other than a Demanding Holder, whose right to withdraw
from an Underwritten Shelf Takedown, and related obligations, shall be
governed by  _Section_ __ _ 5(a)(i)(2)_) shall have the right to withdraw
from a Piggyback Registration for any or no reason whatsoever upon written
notification to the Issuer and the underwriter or underwriters (if any) of
his, her or its intention to withdraw from such Piggyback Registration prior
to the effectiveness of the registration statement filed with the Commission
with respect to such Piggyback Registration or, in the case of a Piggyback
Registration pursuant to a shelf registration, the filing of the applicable
"red herring" prospectus or prospectus supplement with respect to such
Piggyback Registration used for marketing such transaction. The Issuer
(whether on its own good faith determination or as the result of a request
for withdrawal by persons pursuant to separate written contractual
obligations) may withdraw a registration statement filed with the Commission
in connection with a Piggyback Registration (which, in no circumstance, shall
include the Registration Statement) at any time prior to the effectiveness of
such registration statement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Section 5 (other than _Section_ __ _ 5(a)(i)(2)_), the Issuer shall
be responsible for the Registration Expenses incurred in connection with the
Piggyback Registration prior to its withdrawal under this _Section_ __ _
5(a)(ii)(2)_.

 



17

    

(3) _Unlimited Piggyback Registration Rights_. For purposes of clarity,
subject to  _Section_ __ _ 5(a)(i)(2)_, any Piggyback Registration effected
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 5(a)(ii)_ hereof shall not be counted as a demand
for an Underwritten Shelf Takedown under  _Section_ __ _ 5(a)(i)_ hereof.

(4) _Subscriber Information_. Notwithstanding anything in this  _Section_ __
_ 5_ to the contrary, Subscriber may not participate in any underwritten
offering pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 5(a)(ii)_ unless Subscriber (x)
agrees to sell Subscribers securities on the basis provided in any
underwriting arrangements approved by the Issuer and (y) completes and
executes all customary questionnaires, powers of attorney, indemnities, lock-
up agreements, underwriting agreements and other customary documents as may
be reasonably required under the terms of such underwriting arrangements.

 

(iii) _Market Stand-off_. In connection with any underwritten offering
of Class A Shares or other equity securities of the Issuer (other than a
Block Trade (as defined below)), each Eligible Subscriber Holder that is an
executive officer or director of the Issuer or the beneficial owner of more
than five percent (5%) of the outstanding Class A Shares of the Issuer,
agrees not to, and to execute a customary lock-up agreement (in each case on
substantially the same terms and conditions as all such Eligible
Subscriber Holders) in favor of the underwriters to not, sell or dispose of
any Class A Shares or other equity securities of the Issuer (other than those
included in such offering), without the prior written consent of the Issuer,
during the ninety (90)-day period (or such shorter time agreed to by the
managing underwriters) beginning on the date of pricing of such offering,
except as expressly permitted by such lock-up agreement and in the event the
managing underwriters otherwise agree by written consent.

(iv) _Block Trades_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this _Section_ __
_ 5_, but subject to _Section_ __ _ 5(c)_, at any time and from time to time
when an effective Registration Statement is on file with the Commission, if
a Demanding Holder wishes to engage in a Block Trade that includes either (x)
Registrable Securities proposed to be sold by such Demanding Holder with a
total offering price reasonably expected to exceed $100 million, or (y)
all remaining Registrable Securities held by such Demanding Holder, then such
Demanding Holder only needs to notify the Issuer of the Block Trade at least
five (5) business days prior to the day such offering is to commence and the
Issuer shall as expeditiously as possible use its commercially reasonable
efforts to facilitate such Block Trade; _provided_ that the Demanding Holders
representing a majority of the Registrable Securities wishing to engage in the
Block Trade shall use commercially reasonable efforts to work with the Issuer
and any underwriters prior to making such request in order to facilitate
preparation of the registration statement, prospectus and other offering
documentation related to the Block Trade. Prior to the filing of the
applicable "red herring" prospectus or prospectus supplement used in
connection with a Block Trade, any Demanding Holder initiating such Block
Trade shall have the right to submit a Withdrawal Notice to the Issuer
and the underwriter or underwriters (if any) of their intention to withdraw
from such Block Trade. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in _Section_
__ _ 5(a)_, the Issuer shall be responsible for the Registration Expenses
incurred in

 



18

    

 connection with a Block Trade prior to its withdrawal under this _Section_
__ _ 5(a)(iv)_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, 
_Section_ __ _ 5(a)(ii)_ shall not apply to a Block Trade initiated by a
Demanding Holder. The Demanding Holder in a Block Trade shall have the right
to select the underwriters for such Block Trade (which shall consist of one
or more reputable nationally recognized investment banks). The Eligible
Subscriber Holder(s) in the aggregate may demand no more than two (2) Block
Trades pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 5(a)(iv)_ in any twelve (12)
month period. For the avoidance of doubt, any Block Trade effected pursuant
to this _Section_ __ _ 5(a)(iv)_ shall not be counted as a demand for an
Underwritten Shelf Takedown pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 5(a)(i)_ hereof.

(v) All Registration Expenses shall be borne by the Issuer. It is acknowledged
that Subscriber shall bear, with respect to Subscribers Registrable
Securities being sold, all underwriters commissions and discounts, brokerage
fees and, other than as set forth in the definition of "Registration
Expenses," all reasonable fees and expenses of any legal counsel representing
Subscriber.

(vi) As used in this _Section_ __ _ 5_, the following terms shall have the
following meanings:

Agreement and Plan of Merger.

(2) "Block Trade" means an underwritten registered offering not involving
a "roadshow," commonly known as a "block trade."

(3) "Eligible Subscriber" means a subscriber that, together with its
Affiliates (as defined herein), purchased pursuant to this Subscription
Agreement or any Other Subscription Agreement, Class A Shares with an
aggregate purchase price in excess of $100 million.

 

(4) "Registration Expenses" shall mean the out-of-pocket expenses of a
Registration, including, without limitation, the following: (A) all

Securities); (C) printing, messenger, telephone and delivery expenses; (D)

fees and disbursements of all independent registered public accountants of the
Issuer incurred specifically in connection with such registration; and (F)

Demanding Holders in an underwritten Offering.

 



19

    

(5) "Registrable Security" shall mean any of the Acquired Shares until
the earliest to occur of: (A) a registration statement with respect to the
sale of any such Acquired Shares shall have become effective under the
Securities Act and such securities shall have been sold, transferred, disposed
of or exchanged in accordance with such registration statement; (B) any such
Acquired Shares shall have ceased to be outstanding; (C) any such Acquired
Shares have been sold without registration pursuant to Rule 144 (or any
successor rule promulgated thereafter by the Commission); and (D) any such

(b) _Registration Cooperation_. At its expense the Issuer shall: 

(i) except for such times as the Issuer is permitted hereunder to suspend the
use of the prospectus forming part of a Registration Statement, use its
commercially reasonable efforts to keep such registration, and any
qualification, exemption or compliance under state securities laws which the
Issuer determines to obtain, continuously effective with respect
to Subscriber, and to keep the applicable Registration Statement or any
subsequent shelf registration statement free of any material misstatements or
omissions, until the earlier of the following: (i) Subscriber ceases to hold
any Registrable Securities, and (ii) two (2) years from the Effectiveness
Date; provided that the provisions under Section 5(a)(i)-(iv) of this
Subscription Agreement shall terminate on the first anniversary of the Merger
Closing Date. The period of time during which the Issuer is required
hereunder to keep a Registration Statement effective is referred to herein as
the "Registration Period";

 

(ii) advise Subscriber within two (2) business days:

 

(1) when a Registration Statement or any amendment thereto has been filed with
the Commission and when such Registration Statement or any post-effective
amendment thereto has become effective;

(2) of any request by the Commission for amendments or supplements to
any Registration Statement or the prospectus included therein or for
additional information;

(3) of the issuance by the Commission of any stop order suspending the
effectiveness of any Registration Statement or the initiation of any
proceedings for such purpose;

occurrence of any event that requires the making of any changes in any
Registration Statement or prospectus so that, as of such date, the statements
therein are not misleading and do not omit to state a material fact required
to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein (in the case
of a prospectus, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made)
not misleading.

 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, the Issuer shall
not, when so advising Subscriber of such events, provide Subscriber with any
material, nonpublic information regarding the Issuer other than to the extent
that providing notice to Subscriber of the occurrence of the events listed in
(1) through (5) above constitutes material, nonpublic information regarding
the Issuer;

(iii) use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the withdrawal of any
order suspending the effectiveness of any Registration Statement as soon as
reasonably practicable;

(iv) upon the occurrence of any event contemplated in _Section_ __ _
5(b)(ii)(5)_, except for such times as the Issuer is permitted hereunder to
suspend, and has suspended, the use of a prospectus forming part of a
Registration Statement, the Issuer shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to as soon as reasonably practicable prepare a post-effective
amendment to such Registration Statement or a supplement to the related
prospectus, or file any other required document so that, as thereafter
delivered to purchasers of the Acquired Shares included therein, such
prospectus will not include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light
of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading;

(v) use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause all Acquired Shares to be
listed on each national securities exchange (within the meaning of the
Exchange Act), if any, on which the Class A Shares issued by the Issuer have

(vi) use its commercially reasonable efforts to take all other steps necessary
to effect the registration of the Acquired Shares as required hereby;

or (z) in the case of clauses (1), (2), (3) and (5) below, a sale by an
Eligible Subscriber Holder effected or executed through a broker, placement
agent or sales agent (subject to such broker, placement agent or sales agent
providing such certifications or representations reasonably requested by the
Issuers independent registered public accountants and the Issuers counsel):
(1) request the Issuers independent registered public accountants to provide

 satisfactory to a majority-in-interest of the participating Eligible

addressed to the participating Eligible Subscriber Holders and to the broker,
placement agent or sales agent, if any, and the underwriters, if any, covering

such broker, placement agent, sales agent or underwriters, may reasonably

(c) _Suspension Event_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Subscription Agreement, the Issuer shall be entitled to delay or postpone the
effectiveness of the Registration Statement and any other registration
statement referred to in this _Section_ __ _ 5_, and from time to time to
require Subscriber not to sell under the Registration Statement or such other
registration statement, as applicable, or to suspend the effectiveness
thereof, if the negotiation or consummation of a transaction by the Issuer or
its subsidiaries is pending or an event has occurred, which negotiation,
consummation or event the Issuers board of directors reasonably believes,
upon the advice of legal counsel, would require additional disclosure by the
Issuer in the Registration Statement of material information that the Issuer
has a bona fide business purpose for keeping confidential and the non-
disclosure of which in the Registration Statement would be expected, in
the reasonable determination of the Issuers board of directors, upon the
advice of legal counsel, to cause the Registration Statement or such other
registration statement, as applicable, to fail to comply with applicable
disclosure requirements (each such circumstance, a "Suspension Event");
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Issuer may not delay or suspend a particular
registration statement on more than two (2) occasions, for more than
sixty (60) consecutive calendar days, or more than ninety (90) total calendar
days, in each case during any twelve-month period. Upon receipt of any written
notice from the Issuer of the happening of any Suspension Event during the
period that the Registration Statement or such other registration statement,
as applicable, is effective or if as a result of a Suspension Event the
Registration Statement or such other registration statement or related
prospectus contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state
any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein (in the case of a prospectus, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made) not misleading, Subscriber agrees
that (i) it will immediately discontinue offers and sales of the Acquired
Shares under the Registration

22

    

 Statement or such other registration statement (excluding, for the avoidance
of doubt, sales conducted pursuant to Rule 144) until Subscriber receives
copies of a supplemental or amended prospectus (which the Issuer agrees to
promptly prepare) that corrects the misstatement(s) or omission(s) referred to
above and receives notice that any post-effective amendment has become
effective or unless otherwise notified by the Issuer that it may resume such
offers and sales, and (ii) it will maintain the confidentiality of any
information included in such written notice delivered by the Issuer unless
otherwise required by law or subpoena. If so directed by the Issuer,
Subscriber will deliver to the Issuer or, in Subscribers sole discretion
destroy, all copies of the prospectus covering the Acquired Shares in
Subscribers possession; _provided, however_ , that this obligation to deliver
or destroy all copies of the prospectus covering the Acquired Shares shall
not apply (i) to the extent Subscriber is required to retain a copy of such
prospectus (a) in order to comply with applicable legal, regulatory, self-
regulatory or professional requirements or (b) in accordance with a bona fide
pre-existing document retention policy or (ii) to copies stored electronically
on archival servers as a result of automatic data back-up.

(d) _Opt-Out Notice_. Subscriber may deliver written notice (including via
email in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 9(l)_ of this Subscription Agreement)
(an "Opt-Out Notice") to the Issuer requesting that Subscriber not receive
notices from the Issuer otherwise required by this _Section_ __ _ 5_;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Subscriber may later revoke any such Opt-Out
Notice in writing. Following receipt of an Opt-Out Notice from Subscriber
(unless subsequently revoked), (i) the Issuer shall not deliver any such
notices to Subscriber and Subscriber shall no longer be entitled to the rights
associated with any such notice and (ii) each time prior to Subscribers
intended use of an effective registration statement, Subscriber will notify
the Issuer in writing at least two (2) business days in advance of such
intended use, and if a notice of a Suspension Event was previously delivered
(or would have been delivered but for the provisions of this _Section_ __ _
5(d)_) and the related suspension period remains in effect, the Issuer will so
notify Subscriber, within one (1) business day of Subscribers notification
to the Issuer, by delivering to Subscriber a copy of such notice of Suspension
Event that would have been provided, and thereafter will provide Subscriber
with the related notice of the conclusion of such Suspension Event
immediately upon its availability, and Subscriber shall comply with any
restrictions on using such Registration Statement during such Suspension
Event.

 

(e) _Subscriber Indemnification_. The Issuer agrees to indemnify and hold
Subscriber, each person, if any, who controls Subscriber within the meaning
of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act,
and each affiliate of Subscriber within the meaning of Rule 405 under the
Securities Act, and each underwriter pursuant to the applicable underwriting
agreement with such underwriter, and each broker, placement agent or sales
agent to or through which Subscriber effects or executes the resale of any
Acquired Shares (collectively, the "Subscriber Indemnified
Parties"), harmless against any and all losses, claims, damages and
liabilities (including, without limitation, any legal or other expenses
reasonably incurred in connection with defending or investigating any such
action or claim) incurred by Subscriber directly that are caused by any
untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in
the Registration Statement or any other registration statement which covers
Registrable Securities of Subscriber (including, in each case, the prospectus
contained therein) or any amendment thereof (including the prospectus
contained therein) or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state
therein a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein (in
the case of a prospectus, in the light of the circumstances under which they
were made), not misleading, except insofar as the same are caused by or
contained in any information or affidavit so furnished in writing to the
Issuer by Subscriber expressly for use therein.

 



23

    

(f) _Issuer Indemnification_. Subscriber agrees to, severally and not jointly
with any other accredited investor that is a party to the Other Subscription
Agreements, indemnify and hold harmless the Issuer, each person, if any, who
controls the Issuer within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities
Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, and each affiliate of the Issuer
within the meaning of Rule 405 under the Securities Act, and each underwriter
pursuant to the applicable underwriting agreement with such underwriter, and
each broker, placement agent or sales agent to or through which Subscriber
effects or executes the resale of any Acquired Shares (collectively, the
"Issuer Indemnified Parties"), harmless against any and all losses, claims,
damages and liabilities (including, without limitation, any legal or other
expenses reasonably incurred in connection with defending or investigating any
such action or claim) incurred by the Issuer directly that are caused by any
untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in
the Registration Statement or any other registration statement which covers
Registrable Securities of Subscriber (including, in each case, the prospectus
contained therein) or any amendment thereof (including the prospectus
contained therein) or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state
therein of a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein
(in the case of a prospectus, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made), not misleading, insofar as the same are caused by or contained in
any information or affidavit so furnished in writing to the Issuer by
Subscriber expressly for use therein. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Subscribers indemnification obligations under this _Section_ __ _ 5(f)_, in
the aggregate, will not exceed the Purchase Price.

6.  _Termination_. This Subscription Agreement shall terminate and be void
and of no further force and effect, and all rights and obligations of the
parties hereunder shall terminate without any further liability on the part of
any party in respect thereof, upon the earliest to occur of (a) such date and
time as the Agreement and Plan of Merger is terminated in accordance with its
terms, (b) upon the mutual written agreement of each of the parties hereto to
terminate this Subscription Agreement, (c) if any of the conditions to the
Subscription Closing set forth in _Section_ __ _ 2_ of this Subscription
Agreement are not satisfied on or prior to the Subscription Closing and, as a
result thereof, the transactions contemplated by this Subscription Agreement
are not consummated at the Subscription Closing, (d) the Outside Date (as
defined in the Agreement and Plan of Merger and as may be extended as
described therein) if the Merger Closing has not occurred on or before such
date and (e) the first anniversary of the date of this Subscription Agreement
if the Merger Closing and the Subscription Closing have not occurred on or
before such first anniversary; _provided_ , that nothing herein will relieve
any party from liability for any willful breach hereof prior to the time of
termination, and each party will be entitled to any remedies at law or in
equity to recover losses, liabilities or damages arising from such breach.
The Issuer shall promptly notify Subscriber of the termination of the
Agreement and Plan of Merger (other than such a termination as a result of the
Merger Closing thereunder).

 

7\. _Trust Account Waiver_. Subscriber acknowledges that the Issuer is a blank
check company with the powers and privileges to effect a merger, share
exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar
business combination involving the Issuer and one or more businesses.
Subscriber further acknowledges that, as described in the Issuers
prospectus 

 



24

    

 relating to its initial public offering dated June 7, 2018, available at
www.sec.gov, substantially all of the Issuers assets consist of the cash
proceeds of the Issuers initial public offering and private placements of
its securities, and substantially all of those proceeds have been deposited in
a trust account (the "Trust Account") for the benefit of the Issuer, its
public stockholders and the underwriters of the Issuers initial public
offering. For and in consideration of the Issuer entering into this
Subscription Agreement, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged, Subscriber, on behalf of itself and its affiliates and
representatives, hereby irrevocably waives any and all right, title and
interest, or any claim of any kind they have or may have in the future as a
result of, or arising out of, this Subscription Agreement, in or to any monies
held in the Trust Account, and agrees not to seek recourse or make or bring
any action, suit, claim or other proceeding against the Trust Account as a
result of, or arising out of, this Subscription Agreement, the transactions
contemplated hereby or the Acquired Shares, regardless of whether such claim
arises based on contract, tort, equity or any other theory of legal liability.
Subscriber acknowledges and agrees that it shall not have any redemption
rights with respect to the Acquired Shares pursuant to the Issuers
organizational documents in connection with the Transactions or any other
business combination, any subsequent liquidation of the Trust Account or the
Issuer or otherwise. In the event Subscriber has any claim against the Issuer
as a result of, or arising out of, this Subscription Agreement, the
transactions contemplated hereby or the Acquired Shares, it shall pursue such
claim solely against the Issuer and its assets outside the Trust Account and
not against the Trust Account or any monies or other assets in the Trust
Account; _provided_ , however, that nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 7_ shall
be deemed to limit Subscribers right, title, interest or claim to the Trust
Account by virtue of Subscribers record or beneficial ownership of Class A
Shares of the Issuer acquired by any means other than pursuant to this
Subscription Agreement.

 

8\. _Issuer s Covenants_. With a view to making available to Subscriber the
benefits of Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act or any other
similar rule or regulation of the Commission that may at any time permit
Subscriber to sell securities of the Issuer to the public without
registration, the Issuer agrees, until the Acquired Shares are sold by
Subscriber, to:

 

(a) make and keep public information available, as those terms are understood
and defined in Rule 144;

 

(b) file with the Commission in a timely manner all reports and other
documents required of the Issuer under the Securities Act and the Exchange
Act so long as the Issuer remains subject to such requirements and the filing
of such reports and other documents is required for the applicable provisions
of Rule 144;

 

(c) furnish to Subscriber so long as it owns the Acquired Shares, as promptly
as practicable upon request, (x) a written statement by the Issuer, if true,
that it has complied with the reporting requirements of Rule 144, the
Securities Act and the Exchange Act, (y) a copy of the most recent annual or
quarterly report of the Issuer and such other reports and documents so filed
by the Issuer with the Commission and (z) such other information as may be
reasonably requested to permit Subscriber to sell such securities pursuant to
Rule 144 without registration; and

 



25

    

(d) in connection with a sale by Subscriber pursuant to Rule 144, if the
transfer restrictions as set forth on _Exhibit A_ to this Subscription
Agreement are no longer required by the Securities Act or any applicable state
securities laws, upon request of Subscriber, the Issuer shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with Subscriber to have such
transfer restrictions removed, including providing authorization to the
Issuers transfer agent.

 

9\. _Miscellaneous_.

acknowledges that Subscriber and others will rely on the acknowledgments,
understandings, agreements, representations and warranties contained in this

other terms and conditions; and (iii) after the Subscription Closing, the
Subscribers rights pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 5_, _Section_ __ _ 8_ and
_Section_ __ _ 9_ of this Subscription Agreement to any purchaser of the
Acquired Shares that receives the Acquired Shares without the removal of the

and their respective successors and assigns; _provided_ , that the parties
acknowledge and agree that the Subscriber Indemnified Parties and the Issuer
Indemnified Parties shall each be a third-party beneficiary to this
Subscription Agreement with respect to _Section_ __ _ 5(e)_ and _Section_ __
_ 5(f)_, respectively, of this Subscription Agreement, and that the Agent

(m) This Subscription Agreement, and any action, suit, dispute, controversy or
claim arising out of this Subscription Agreement or the validity,
interpretation, breach or termination of this Subscription Agreement, shall be
governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of
Delaware regardless of the law that might otherwise govern under applicable
principles of conflicts of law thereof.

out of this Subscription Agreement, agrees that process may be served upon
them in any manner authorized by the laws of the State of Delaware for such
person and waives and covenants not to assert or plead any objection which
they might otherwise have to such manner of service of process. Each party and
any person asserting rights as a third-party beneficiary may do so only if
he, she or it hereby waives, and shall not assert as a defense in any legal
dispute, that: (a) such person is not personally subject to the jurisdiction
of the above named courts for any reason; (b) such Legal Proceeding (as
defined in the Agreement and Plan of Merger) may not be brought or is not
maintainable in such court; (c) such persons property is exempt or immune

other action seeking or intending to cause the transfer or

 



28

    

 removal of any such action, claim, cause of action or suit to any court
other than one of the above-named courts, whether on the grounds of
inconvenient forum or otherwise. Each party hereby consents to service of
process in any such proceeding in any manner permitted by Delaware law, and
further consents to service of process by nationally recognized overnight
courier service guaranteeing overnight delivery, or by registered
or certified mail, return receipt requested, at its address specified

Notwithstanding the foregoing in this _Section_ __ _ 9(n)_, any party
may commence any action, claim, cause of action or suit in a court other than
the above-named courts solely for the purpose of enforcing an order or
judgment issued by one of the above-named courts.

 

TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW WHICH CANNOT BE WAIVED, EACH OF
THE PARTIES AND ANY PERSON ASSERTING RIGHTS AS A THIRD-PARTY BENEFICIARY MAY
DO SO ONLY IF HE, SHE OR IT IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT
TO TRIAL BY JURY ON ANY CLAIMS OR COUNTERCLAIMS ASSERTED IN ANY LEGAL DISPUTE
RELATING TO THIS SUBSCRIPTION AGREEMENT AND FOR ANY COUNTERCLAIM
RELATING THERETO, IN EACH CASE WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER ARISING. IF
THE SUBJECT MATTER OF ANY SUCH LEGAL DISPUTE IS ONE IN WHICH THE WAIVER OF
JURY TRIAL IS PROHIBITED, NO PARTY NOR ANY PERSON ASSERTING RIGHTS AS A THIRD-
PARTY BENEFICIARY SHALL ASSERT IN SUCH LEGAL DISPUTE A NONCOMPULSORY
COUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS SUBSCRIPTION AGREEMENT.
FURTHERMORE, NO PARTY NOR ANY PERSON ASSERTING RIGHTS AS A THIRD-PARTY
BENEFICIARY SHALL SEEK TO CONSOLIDATE ANY SUCH LEGAL DISPUTE WITH A SEPARATE
ACTION OR OTHER LEGAL PROCEEDING IN WHICH A JURY TRIAL CANNOT BE WAIVED.

issuance of the Disclosure Document, to the Issuers knowledge, Subscriber
shall not be in possession of any material, non-public information received
from the Issuer or any of its officers, directors or employees.

the other party hereto it will not publicly make reference to such other
party or any of its affiliates (i) in connection with the Transactions or this

_Exhibit A_

 

NO TRANSFER, SALE, ASSIGNMENT, PLEDGE, HYPOTHECATION OR OTHER DISPOSITION OF
THE ACQUIRED SHARES OR ANY INTEREST OR PARTICIPATION THEREIN MAY BE MADE
EXCEPT (A) PURSUANT TO AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT UNDER THE
SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 (THE "ACT") OR (B) PURSUANT TO AN EXEMPTION FROM
REGISTRATION UNDER THE ACT AND APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS AND, IN THE
CASE OF CLAUSE (B), UNLESS, IF THE ISSUER REQUESTS, THE ISSUER RECEIVES AN
OPINION OF COUNSEL IN FORM AND SUBSTANCE REASONABLY SATISFACTORY TO THE ISSUER
TO THE EFFECT THAT REGISTRATION IS NOT REQUIRED UNDER THE ACT.

 

Any transferee of the Acquired Shares or any interest therein, by its
acceptance thereof, shall be deemed to have made the representations
set forth in _Section_ __ _ 4_ of the Subscription Agreement (other than the
representations set forth in _Section_ __ _ 4(f)_, the first two sentences of
_Section_ __ _ 4(j)_ and  _Section_ __ _ 4(p)_). The Issuer shall not be
required to register the transfer of any Acquired Shares to any transferee
unless the Issuer receives from the proposed transferee a written instrument
in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Issuer in which such
transferee makes the representations and warranties set forth in _Section_ __
_ 4_ of the Subscription Agreement (other than the representations set forth
in  _Section_ __ _ 4(f)_, the first two sentences of _Section_ __ _ 4(j)_
and _Section_ __ _ 4(p)_) and, if the Issuer so requests, an opinion of
counsel in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Issuer to the
effect that registration under the Securities Act is not required in
connection with such transfer; _provided_ , that no opinion of counsel will be
required for a pledge of the Acquired Shares if the Issuer receives
a representation from the pledgor and pledgee that the pledge is a bona fide
pledge and, in the event that the pledgee acquires the shares that are the
subject of the pledge, the pledgee agrees to the representations and
warranties set forth in Section 4 of the Subscription Agreement. The
foregoing shall not apply to any sale of the Acquired Shares made in
accordance with Rule 144; _provided_ , that the transferor of the Acquired
Shares provides to the Issuer such representations with respect to compliance
as is reasonably requested by the Issuer.
