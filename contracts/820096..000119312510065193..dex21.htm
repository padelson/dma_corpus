Closing Balance Sheet and Parents calculation of the Proposed Closing Net
Working Capital, Proposed Closing Cash Amount and Proposed Closing Debt
Amount. If the Stakeholders Representative disagrees with Parents
calculation of the Proposed Closing Net Working Capital, Proposed Closing Cash
Amount and/or Proposed Closing Debt Amount as set forth on the Proposed
Closing Net Working Capital Statement, the Stakeholders Representative shall,
within forty-five (45) days after the Stakeholders Representatives receipt
of the Proposed Closing Net Working Capital Statement, notify Parent in
writing of such disagreement by setting forth the Stakeholders
Representatives calculation of the Net Working Capital as of the Balance
Sheet Time, the amount of Cash of the Companies and their Subsidiaries as of
the Balance Sheet Time and/or the Debt Amount as of the Balance Sheet Time and
describing in reasonable detail the basis for such disagreement (an "
_Objection Notice_ "). If no Objection Notice is delivered on or prior to the
forty-fifth (45th) day after the Stakeholders Representatives receipt of the
Proposed Closing Net Working Capital Statement, Parents calculation of the
Proposed Closing Net Working Capital, Proposed Closing Cash Amount and the
Proposed Closing Debt Amount shall be deemed to be conclusive and binding on
the parties hereto. If an Objection Notice is timely delivered to Parent, then
(i) the Stakeholders Representative shall be deemed to have agreed with
Parents calculation of the Proposed Closing Net Working Capital, Proposed
Closing Cash Amount and/or the Proposed Closing Debt Amount to the extent not
set forth in the Objection Notice (to the extent the amounts not being
disputed by the Stakeholders Representative in this clause (i) results in
Parent being entitled to payment from the Working Capital Escrow Amount (which
amount shall be credited against the amount Parent may otherwise be entitled
to pursuant to Section 2.8(g)(i), as indicated by the parenthetical therein),
Parent and the Stakeholders Representative shall cause the Escrow Agent to
promptly release from the Working Capital Escrow Amount sub-account to Parent
an amount equal to such undisputed amount (the " _Parent Undisputed Working
Capital Amount_ ")) and (ii) Parent and the Stakeholders Representative shall
negotiate in good faith to resolve their disagreements with respect to the
computation of the Proposed Closing Net Working Capital, the Proposed Closing
Cash Amount and/or Proposed Closing Debt Amount. In the event that Parent and
the Stakeholders Representative are unable to resolve any such disagreements
within fifteen (15) days after Parents receipt of such Objection Notice (or
such longer period as both parties mutually agree in writing), Parent and the
Stakeholders Representative shall submit any remaining disagreements to
Deloitte and Touche LLP or another independent, nationally recognized
accounting firm mutually acceptable to Parent and the Stakeholders
Representative (the " _Auditor_ ") for resolution in accordance with Section
2.8(e).

(d) [INTENTIONALLY OMITTED.]

(e) Parent and the Stakeholders Representative shall use their respective
reasonable efforts to cause the Auditor to resolve all remaining disagreements
with respect to the computation of the Proposed Closing Net Working Capital,
Proposed Closing Cash Amount and/or Proposed Closing Debt Amount as soon as
practicable, but in any event shall direct the 



 

21  Auditor to render a determination within forty-five (45) days after its
retention. The Auditor shall consider only those items and amounts in Parents
and the Stakeholders Representatives respective calculations of the
Proposed Closing Net Working Capital, Proposed Closing Cash Amount and/or
Proposed Closing Debt Amount that are identified as being items and amounts to
which Parent and the Stakeholders Representative have been unable to agree.
In resolving any disputed item, the Auditor may not assign a value to any item
greater than the greatest value for such item claimed by either party or less
than the smallest value for such item claimed by either party. The Auditors
determination of the Proposed Closing Net Working Capital, Proposed Closing
Cash Amount and/or Proposed Closing Debt Amount shall be based solely on
written materials submitted by Parent and the Stakeholders Representative
(i.e., not on oral testimony or independent review) and on the definitions of
" _Net Working Capital_ ", " _Cash_ " and " _Debt Amount_ " included herein.
The determination of the Auditor shall set forth in a written statement
delivered to Parent and the Stakeholders Representative and shall be
conclusive and binding upon the parties hereto. As used herein, (i) the "
_Final Closing Net Working Capital_ " shall mean the Proposed Closing Net
Working Capital as finally determined pursuant to Section 2.8(c) or (e), as
the case may be; (ii) the " _Final Closing Cash Amount_ " shall mean the
Proposed Closing Cash Amount as finally determined pursuant to Section 2.8(c)
or (e), as the case may be; (iii) the " _Final Closing Debt Amount_ " shall
mean the Proposed Closing Debt Amount as finally determined pursuant to
Section 2.8(c) or (e), as the case may be; and (iv) the " _Final Post-Closing
Adjustment_ " shall mean an amount equal to (A) (x) the Final Closing Net
Working Capital _minus_ (y) the Estimated Net Working Capital, _plus_ (B) (x)
the Final Closing Cash Amount _minus_ (y) the Estimated Cash Amount, _minus_
(C) the Final Closing Debt Amount _minus_ the Estimated Debt Amount.

(f) The costs and expenses of the Auditor in determining the Proposed Closing
Net Working Capital, Proposed Closing Cash Amount and/or Proposed Closing Debt
Amount shall be borne by Parent and the Stakeholders Representative in
inverse proportion as they may prevail on matters resolved by the Auditor, and
such proportionate allocation shall also be determined by the Auditor when its
determination is rendered on the merits of the matter submitted.

(g) Within five (5) Business Days after the determination of the Final Closing
Net Working Capital, the Final Closing Cash Amount and the Final Closing Debt
Amount:

(i) if the Final Post-Closing Adjustment is a negative amount, the Surviving
Entities, the Stakeholders Representative and Parent shall cause the Escrow
Agent to promptly pay to an account or accounts designated by Parent an amount
in cash equal to the absolute value of the Final Post-Closing Adjustment
(less any Parent Undisputed Working Capital Amount paid from the Working
Capital Escrow Amount pursuant to Section 2.8(c)); _provided_ , that Parents
right to payment under this Section 2.8(g)(i) shall be limited solely to the
Working Capital Escrow Amount and Parent shall not have any claim to any
excess of the Final Post-Closing Adjustment or part thereof over the Working
Capital Escrow Amount from the Stakeholders Representative or any other
Person; and

(ii) if the Final Post-Closing Adjustment is a positive amount, Parent shall
promptly pay to the Stockholders, Unitholders, Optionholders and Appreciation
Rights Holders, an amount in cash equal to the Final Post-Closing Adjustment,
in proportion to the 



 

22  payments made to such Persons pursuant to this Article II and as indicated
on the Transaction Consideration Disbursement Schedule by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the accounts designated by the Stakeholders
Representative.

(h) All payments made pursuant to Section 2.8(g) shall be treated by all
parties hereto for Tax purposes as adjustments to the Aggregate Merger
Consideration.

actions described therein) shall not restrict Parents right to assert a
claim, seek indemnification or obtain reimbursement of Losses under Article

foreign securities laws. Parent qualifies as an "accredited investor" as such

Securities Act. Parent is acquiring the Common Stock and Units for its own
account for investment, without a view to, or for a resale in connection with,

warranties expressly made by Parent and the Merger Subs in this Agreement or
in any certificate or other 



 

49  document delivered pursuant to this Agreement, neither Parent, the Merger
Subs nor any other Person make any express or implied representation or
warranty on behalf of or with respect to any of Parent or the Merger Subs,
and Parent and the Merger Subs hereby disclaim any representation or warranty
not contained in this Agreement or in any certificate or other document
delivered pursuant to this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the

projections or other predictions that may be contained or referred to in the
Parent Disclosure Schedule or elsewhere, as well as any information, documents
or other materials reviewed by the Companies and their Subsidiaries pursuant

(a) issue any note, bond, or other debt security in a significant amount or

Section 5.3 _Employment Matters_.

(a) For a period of one (1) year following the Closing Date, the Companies
shall (i) continue to employ, in substantially the same employment position
and with substantially the same duties as immediately prior to the Closing
Date, those persons who are employees of the Companies on the Closing Date and
(A) whose principal place of employment is at the Companies facilities in
Arkansas or Virginia (other than Manning who shall not be considered an
Affected Employee for any purpose hereunder) or (B) who are set forth in
Section 5.3(a) of the Companies Disclosure Schedule, including any such
employees not actively at work due to injury, vacation, military
duty, disability or other leave of absence (the " _Affected Employees_ "),
and (ii) provide or cause to be provided to each such Affected Employee, (A) a
salary or wage level and cash bonus opportunity substantially comparable
in the aggregate to the salary or wage level and cash bonus opportunity to
which such Affected Employee was entitled to receive immediately prior to the
Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that the aggregate cash bonus
opportunities available to the Affected Employees, as a group, during the
one-year period following the Closing shall not exceed 15% of the aggregate
base salaries of all of the Affected Employees (the " _Bonus Opportunities
Pool_ ") during such period (it being understood that certain Affected
Employees may receive cash bonuses in excess of 15% of his or her base salary,
so long as the aggregate cash bonus opportunities available to the Affected
Employees, as a group, does not exceed the Bonus Opportunities Pool, unless
Parent, in its sole discretion, determines to make payments in excess of the
Bonus Opportunities Pool), and (B) employee benefits (excluding benefits
provided pursuant to a defined benefit plan) that are substantially
comparable, in the aggregate, to those provided pursuant to Company Plans as
in effect on the date of this Agreement; provided, however, in the event that
the employment of any Affected Employee is terminated prior to the
first anniversary of the Closing Date other than (1) by the Companies for
"cause" (as defined in any Company Plan set forth in Section 3.11(a) of the
Companies 



 

53  Disclosure Schedule applicable to such Affected Employee) or (2) voluntarily
by the Affected Employee, unless such voluntary termination is due to a
relocation of such Affected Employees principal place of employment by more
than fifty (50) miles, the Companies shall provide or cause to be provided to
such Affected Employee, until the first anniversary of the Closing Date, the
payments and benefits set forth in subsection (ii) of this Section 5.3(a);
_provided_ , that the cash bonus opportunity available to such Affected
Employee shall be prorated based on the amount of time the Affected Employee
is employed by Parent during that year. Periods of employment with the
Companies (including, without limitation, any current or former Affiliate of
the Companies or any such predecessor, to the extent previously recognized
under the Company Plans), shall be taken into account for purposes of
determining, as applicable, the eligibility for participation and vesting of
any Affected Employee under employee benefit plans offered by Parent or an
Affiliate of Parent to Affected Employees after the Closing to the extent such
periods of employment would be recognized under similar Company Plans in
which such Affected Employee participated or was eligible to participate
immediately prior to the Closing; _provided_ , for the avoidance of doubt,
that the foregoing shall not apply to the extent that its application would
result in a duplication of benefits with respect to the same period of
service. Parent shall (i) waive any limitation on medical coverage of Affected
Employees due to pre-existing conditions under the applicable group health
plan of Parent or an Affiliate of Parent to the extent such limitations would
have been waived under a group health plan of the Companies or their
Affiliates immediately prior to the Closing Date, and (ii) credit
each Affected Employee with all deductible payments and co-payments paid by
such employee under the group health plan of the Companies or their Affiliates
prior to the Closing Date during the year in which the Closing occurs for the
purpose of determining the extent to which any such employee has satisfied
his or her deductible and whether he or she has reached the out-of-pocket
maximum under any group health plan of Parent or an Affiliate of Parent for
such year.

(b) Except for the payment obligations in Section 5.3(a), nothing contained in
this Section 5.3 or elsewhere in this Agreement, express or implied, shall
(i) limit the right of Parent or its Affiliates to terminate the employment or
services of, or to reassign or otherwise alter the status of, any Affected
Employee or contractor or consultant of the Companies and their Subsidiaries
after the Closing, or to change in any manner the terms and conditions of his
or her employment or other service to or engagement by the Companies and their
Subsidiaries, (ii) be construed to prevent, and no action by the Companies or
their Subsidiaries prior to the Closing Date shall limit the ability of,
Parent or its Affiliates from terminating or modifying to any extent or in any
respect any employee benefit plan that Parent or its Affiliates may establish
or maintain or (iii) be construed as amending any Company Plan as in effect
immediately prior to the Closing.

Section 5.4  _Fees and Expenses_. At the Closing, Parent shall, on behalf of
the Companies and their equity holders, pay in full the Fees and Expenses in
the amounts, and to the parties set forth on, the Transaction Consideration
Disbursement Schedule. 

Section 5.5 _Publicity_. Parent and the Companies agree that the initial press
release with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall
be a joint press release, to be reasonably agreed upon by Parent and the
Companies. Parent and the Companies further agree to communicate with each
other and reasonably cooperate with each other prior to any other public
disclosure of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Parent and the
Companies agree that no public release or announcement concerning the terms of
the 



 

54  transactions contemplated hereby shall be issued without the prior written
consent of the other party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned, or delayed more than twenty-four (24) hours), except as such
release or announcement (including in any current report on Form 8-K,
quarterly report on Form 10-Q or annual report on Form 10-K required to be
filed with the SEC) may be required by Law, any Contract to which any party
is subject or the rules or regulations of any United States or foreign
securities exchange or other Governmental Entity, in which case the party
required to make the release or announcement shall allow the other party
reasonable time to comment on such release or announcement in advance of such
issuance.

Section 5.6 _Confidentiality_. Parent and the Companies and their respective
Representatives (as such term is defined in the Confidentiality Agreements)
shall treat all nonpublic information provided by or obtained from the
Companies (in the case of Parent) or from Parent (in the case of the
Companies) in connection with this Agreement (including in connection with the
access provisions of Section 5.7 hereof) and the transactions contemplated
hereby as confidential in accordance with the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreements to the extent such information constitutes
Evaluation Material under the Confidentiality Agreements. The terms of the
Confidentiality Agreements are hereby incorporated by reference and shall
continue in full force and effect until the Closing, at which time such
Confidentiality Agreements shall terminate. In the event of a conflict or
inconsistency between the terms of this Agreement and the Confidentiality
Agreements, the terms of this Agreement will govern. If this Agreement is,
for any reason, terminated prior to the Closing, the Confidentiality
Agreements shall continue in full force and effect, subject to Section 7.3
hereof.

Section 5.7 _Access to Information_. Subject to Section 5.6 hereof, prior to
the Closing, the Companies shall, and shall cause their Subsidiaries and their
respective officers, directors, managers, employees, auditors and other
agents to, upon reasonable advance notice, afford the officers, directors,
managers, employees, auditors and other agents of Parent or its Affiliates
reasonable access during normal business hours, in such a manner as to not
materially interfere with normal operation of the Companies and their
Subsidiaries, to the officers, directors, managers, employees, properties,
offices and other facilities of the Companies and their Subsidiaries and
to the books and records thereof, and shall furnish Parent with all
reasonably available and existing financial, operating and other data and
information with respect to the Business of the Companies and their
Subsidiaries as Parent, through its officers, directors, managers, employees,
auditors or other agents, or as Parents financing sources (through a request
to Parent); _provided_ , _however_ , that (a) the foregoing shall not require
the Companies or their Subsidiaries to provide any such access or furnish any
such information that in their reasonable judgment would violate any Law or
violate any obligations with respect to confidentiality or, in the reasonable
judgment of the Companies, compromise or constitute a waiver of any attorney-
client privilege of the Companies or their Subsidiaries and (b) if any the
Companies or their Subsidiaries does not provide any such access or
information pursuant to the immediately preceding clause (a), the Companies
shall inform Parent in writing of their determination, and the basis thereof,
not to provide such access or information, including a reasonably detailed
description of the nature of the information withheld.

Section 5.8 _Stockholder and Unitholder Approval_. Promptly following the
execution of this Agreement, the Companies shall obtain, and deliver to
Parent within twenty-four (24) hours following the date hereof, (a) written
consents from the Stockholders 



 

55  representing 100% of the votes associated with the outstanding Voting Common

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
Parent, on the one hand, and the Companies, on the other hand, shall each use
their reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and
to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with each of the other
parties in doing, all things necessary, proper and advisable to consummate
and make effective, as promptly as practicable, but in no event later than the

purposes of this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
subject to the proviso below, Parent shall:

(i) at Parents sole cost, as required in order to comply with any
restrictions and conditions imposed or required by any Antitrust Authority
with respect to Antitrust Laws in connection with granting any necessary
clearance or terminating any applicable waiting period, (x) agree to sell,
divest, hold separate, license, cause a third party to acquire, or otherwise
dispose of, any Subsidiary, operations, divisions, businesses, product lines,

their Subsidiaries contemporaneously with or after the Closing and regardless
as to whether a third party purchaser has been identified or approved prior to
the Closing (each a " _Divestiture_ "), (y) take or commit to take such other
actions that may limit Parents, its Subsidiaries or any of the Companies
and their Subsidiaries freedom of action with respect to, or their ability to

products lines, customers or assets (each a " _Limitation_ "), and (z) enter
into any order, consent decree or other agreement to effectuate any of the
foregoing; and

(ii) oppose any request for, the entry of, and seek to have vacated or
terminated, any order or ruling of any Antitrust Authority that

56 _provided_ , _however_ , that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, Parent shall not be required to (x) agree to or make any Divestiture
or Limitation if such Divestiture or Limitation would, taken individually or
in the aggregate, (A) in the case of a Divestiture or Limitation affecting the
Companies, their Subsidiaries or the Business, have or reasonably be expected
to have, following the Effective Time, a Company Material Adverse Effect or
(B) in the case of a Divestiture or Limitation affecting Parent, its

(c) Each of Parent and the Companies shall (i) respond as promptly as
practicable to all inquiries and requests received from the Antitrust
Authorities in connection with Antitrust Laws or other applicable Laws and
(ii) not extend any waiting period under any Antitrust Laws or enter into any

consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except with the
prior written consent of Parent or the Companies, as applicable. Parent
shall, in consultation with the Companies, negotiate in good faith with all
Antitrust Authorities and third parties in connection with a Divestiture or
Limitation or any other matter referred to in Section 5.9(a) in order to
consummate, as promptly as practicable, the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (and shall keep the Companies informed on a substantive and current
basis of the status of such negotiations); and provided further that, without
the consent of Parent, the Companies will not offer or propose any
Divestiture or Limitation to any Antitrust Authorities and third parties with
respect to any matter referred to in Section 5.9.

in any such meeting, telephone call or discussion, and (iii) furnish the other
party with copies of all material correspondence, filings, and written

other hand, with respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby; _provided_ , _however_ , that a party may designate such

Section 5.10 _Director and Officer Liability; Indemnification_.

(a) If the Closing occurs, Parent and the Companies agree that all rights to
indemnification and all limitations on liability (including obligations to
advance funds for expenses) now existing in favor of any officer, director or
manager of the Companies and their Subsidiaries, in each case that is an
individual (collectively, the " _Company_ _Indemnitees_ "), as provided in
the applicable Company Organizational Documents shall survive the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby and continue in full force and effect
and shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely
affect any right thereunder of any Company Indemnitee to whom this Section
5.10(a) applies for a period of not less than six (6) years from the Effective
Time.

(b) Parent will purchase, effective as of the Closing, a tail insurance policy
to the current policy of directors and officers liability insurance
maintained by the Companies, which tail policy shall be effective for a
period from the Closing through and including the sixth (6th) anniversary of
the Closing Date with respect to claims arising from facts or events that
occurred before the Closing, and which tail policy shall contain
substantially the same coverage and amounts as, and contain terms and
conditions no less advantageous than, in the aggregate, the coverage currently
provided by such current policy; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event
shall Parent be required to expend, for the entire tail policy, in excess of
250% of the last annual premium paid by the Companies for their current policy
of directors and officers liability insurance; and, _provided_ , _further_
, that, if the premium of such insurance coverage exceeds such amount, Parent
shall be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for
a cost not exceeding such amount. In the event that any Company Indemnitee is
entitled to coverage under an officers and directors liability insurance
policy pursuant to this Section 5.10(b) and such policy has lapsed,
terminated, been repudiated or is otherwise in breach or default as a result
of a Companys failure to maintain and fulfill its obligations pursuant to
such policy as provided in this Section 5.10(b), Parent shall pay to the
Company Indemnitee such amounts and provide any other coverage or benefits as
the Company Indemnitee shall have received pursuant to such policy.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if
any Action (whether based on facts, events or circumstances occurring before,
at or after the Closing) is made against any Company Indemnitee on or prior to
the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Closing Date, the provisions of this
Section 5.10 shall continue in effect until the final disposition of such
Action.

(d) In the event Parent, the Companies or any of their respective successors
or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not
be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person, then and in each such case, proper 



 

58  provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the
Companies (or their respective successors and assigns), shall assume the
obligations set forth in this Section 5.10.

(e) The obligations of Parent under this Section 5.10 shall survive the
Closing and shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to affect
adversely any Company Indemnitee to whom this Section 5.10 applies without the
consent of such affected Company Indemnitee, unless such termination or
modification is required by Law (it being expressly agreed that the Company
Indemnitees to whom this Section 5.10 applies shall be third party
beneficiaries of this Section 5.10, each of whom may enforce the provisions of
this Section 5.10).

Section 5.11 _Financing_. Parent shall use its best efforts to (a) ensure that
the proceeds of the Financing are available at the Closing and (b) in the
event the Financing is required by Parent in order to consummate the Mergers
and/or to pay the fees and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement
and the Financing, (A) satisfy on a timely basis all conditions to the
Financing applicable to Parent or any of its Affiliates to the extent within
its control, (B) enter into definitive agreements with respect thereto on the
terms and conditions contained in the Commitment Letter and provide to the
Companies a copy thereof substantially concurrently with such execution, and
(C) consummate the Financing at the Closing. Parent shall maintain the
Commitment Letter in full force and effect and comply with its
obligations thereunder. Parent shall give the Companies prompt notice upon
becoming aware of any termination or threatened termination, in whole or in
part, of the Commitment Letter and of the occurrence of any event or
circumstance that would reasonably be expected to prevent Parent from
satisfying one or more of the conditions that would result in the Financing,
or any portion thereof, not being available to Parent at Closing. Parent shall
be responsible for the payment of all fees and expenses incurred by the
Company and its Subsidiaries at the request of Parent in connection with any
of the financing activities undertaken in connection with the Mergers and the
transactions contemplated hereby. In the event that Parent undertakes or
plans to undertake a financing or financings in lieu of all or a portion of
the Financing, then it shall keep the Companies reasonably informed of all
such financing activities.

Section 5.12 _Tax Matters_.

(a) _Preparation and Filing of Tax Returns_.

(i) The Companies shall prepare and timely file (or cause to be prepared and
timely filed), all Tax Returns required to be filed by the Companies or any of
their Subsidiaries on or before the Closing Date (taking into account any
valid extensions).

(ii) Parent shall (A) prepare pro-forma Tax Returns for all partnership or S
corporation income Tax Return required to be filed by the Companies or any of

Tax Returns, " _Stakeholders  Representative Filed Tax Returns_"), (B)
deliver such pro-forma Stakeholders Representative Filed Tax Returns to the
Stakeholders Representative at least forty-five (45) Business Days prior to
the due date for filing such Tax Return (after taking into account any
applicable extensions or waivers), (C) incorporate Stakeholders
Representatives comment on such pro-forma Stakeholders Representative Filed
Tax Returns to the extent consistent with applicable Tax Law and past 



 

59  practice (other than a deviation from past practice resulting from the

such other assistance as may be reasonably requested by the Stakeholders
Representative in writing in connection with the preparation of the
Stakeholders Representative Filed Tax Returns. The Stakeholders
Representative shall timely file (or cause to be timely filed)

shall be responsible for 50% of the third-party out-of-pocket costs incurred
by Parent following the Closing in preparing the Stakeholders Representative
Filed Tax Returns.

(iii) Parent shall prepare and timely file (or cause to be so prepared and
timely filed) all Tax Returns required to be filed by the Companies or any of
their Subsidiaries after the Closing Date (such as sales and use or real
property Tax Returns) and timely withhold and pay all Taxes set forth on such
Tax Returns, except for any Stakeholders Representative Filed Tax Returns ("
_Parent Filed Tax Returns_ "). Parent shall provide Stakeholders
Representative for its review and comment a copy of any material Parent Filed
Tax Return for any Pre-Closing Period or for any taxable period that begins
on or before the Closing Date and ends after the Closing Date (a " _Straddle
Period_ ") at least twenty (20) Business Days prior to the due date (to the
extent reasonably practicable, or, if not, as reasonably practicable prior to
such due date) for filing such Tax Return (after taking into account any
applicable extensions or waivers), (B) the Stakeholders Representative shall
provide Parent with its reasonable comments to such Tax Return, if any, at
least ten (10) Business Days prior to such due date (or, if the Tax Return was
provided less than twenty (20) Business Days prior to such due date, as soon
as reasonably practicable prior to such due date), and (C) Parent may accept
or reject such comments in its sole discretion.

(b) _Tax Cooperation_. Stakeholders Representative and Parent agree to
furnish or cause to be furnished to each other, upon reasonable request, as
promptly as practicable, such information (including access to books and

Claims with respect to Stakeholders Representative Filed Tax Returns, which
shall be controlled by the Stakeholders Representative. The party controlling
any Tax Claim shall have all rights to settle, compromise and/or concede such
asserted liability and the other party shall reasonably cooperate; _provided_
, _however_ , that (A) the Stakeholders Representative, at its sole cost and
expense, shall have the right to participate in any material Tax Claim
controlled by Parent, and (B) Parent shall not settle, compromise and/or
concede such asserted liability without the consent of the Stakeholders
Representative, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, 



 

60  delayed or conditioned, in each case, to the extent such Tax Claim may (x)
result in an indemnification by any of the Companies Holders pursuant to
Article VIII hereby, or (y) influence Tax items that flow through to any
Stockholder and/or Unitholder and (B) the Stakeholders Representative shall
not settle, compromise and/or concede such asserted liability without the
consent of Parent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned.

(d) _Transfer Taxes_. The Companies Holders shall be responsible for
fifty percent (50%) of any Transfer Taxes and Parent shall be responsible for
and shall pay or cause to be paid the remaining fifty percent (50%) of all
Transfer Taxes. Parent shall be responsible for preparing and timely filing

expense in preparing and filing) any Tax Returns with respect to any such
Transfer Taxes that Parent is required to file under applicable Law, and the
Stakeholders Representative shall be responsible for preparing and timely
filing (and Parent shall cooperate with the Stakeholders Representative at
the Stakeholders Representatives expense in preparing and filing) any such
Tax Returns that the Companies Holders are required to file under applicable
Law. Parent and the Stakeholders Representative shall each provide the other

the timely filing thereof. The Person required to file such Tax Return, to
the extent reasonably practical, shall provide the Stakeholders
Representative or Parent, as the case may be, at least five (5) Business Days
prior to the due date for timely filing thereof, copies of any such Tax
Return.

(e) _Section 338 Elections; Election Allocations_.

(i) The Stakeholders Representative will cause each Stockholder to join with
Parent in making an election under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code (and any

"). 

(ii) At the Closing, the Stakeholders Representative will deliver to Parent a
fully executed Internal Revenue Service Form 8023 reflecting the Section

Law shall be provided by the Stakeholders Representative by the later of the
Closing or ten (10) Business Days following Parents written request for such
form. As reasonably requested from time to time by Parent or the Stakeholders
Representative (whether before, at or after the Closing), each party shall
assist (and shall cause the Stockholders or their Affiliates, as applicable,
to assist) the other party in, and shall provide the necessary information to
the other party, in connection with the preparation of any form or document
required to effect a valid and timely Section 338(h)(10) Election, including
Internal Revenue Service Form 8883, any similar form under state or local Law
and any schedules or attachments thereto (collectively, " _Section 338
Forms_").

(iii) Within 120 days following the Closing Date, Parent shall deliver to the
Stakeholders Representative a schedule calculating, in reasonable detail,
(A) the aggregate deemed sales price at which Holdings is deemed to have sold
its assets for Tax purposes as a result of a Section 338(h)(10) Election ("
_ADSP_ ") and (B) the allocation of ADSP among the assets of Holdings, and
(C) all applicable Section 338 Forms (collectively, the " _Election
Allocations_ "). The Election Allocations shall be determined in accordance
with Section 338 of the Code and the applicable Treasury regulations
thereunder and shall be amended to the extent 



 

61  required under applicable Tax law to reflect any adjustment to the Aggregate
Merger Consideration. The Stakeholders Representative shall have 30 days
following receipt of the Election Allocation or any amendment thereto during
which to dispute any item contained therein. If the Stakeholders
Representative fails to notify Parent of any such dispute within such 30-day
period, the Election Allocation shall be deemed to have been accepted by the
Stakeholders Representative. If the Stakeholders Representative timely
notifies Parent of any such dispute, and Parent and the Stakeholders
Representative cannot resolve any such dispute within 30 days of receipt by
Parent of such notice, the parties shall jointly retain an independent,
nationally recognized law or accounting firm (the " _Tax Arbitrator_ ") to act
as an arbitrator in order to resolve the dispute. The Tax Arbitrators
determination shall be made in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and
shall be final and binding on the parties and not subject to collateral attack
for any reason (other than manifest error). All fees and expenses of the Tax
Arbitrator shall be shared equally by each of Parent and the Stakeholders
Representative. Except as may be required by Law, Parent and Stockholders will
(1) file or cause to be filed all Tax Returns in a manner consistent with
the Election Allocations and (2) not take any action inconsistent therewith.
If the Election Allocation is deemed accepted by the Stakeholders
Representative or upon resolution of any dispute with respect thereto pursuant
to this Section 5.12(e), the Stakeholders Representative shall cause any
Section 338 Forms delivered to it by Parent, which are consistent with such
Election Allocation or resolution, to be duly and promptly executed by all
Stockholders and shall deliver such executed Section 338 Forms to Parent.

(f) _Termination of Tax Sharing Agreements_. Any and all Tax allocation or
sharing agreements or arrangements binding the Companies and/or any Subsidiary
(other than any such agreement or arrangement solely between the Companies and
any of their Subsidiaries) shall be terminated with respect to the Company
and any such Subsidiary as of the day before the Closing Date and, from and
after the Closing Date, no Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be
obligated to make any payment to any Person or Taxing Authority pursuant to
any such agreement or arrangement for any past or future period.

(g) _Tax Treatment of Indemnification Payments_. Except as otherwise required
by applicable Tax Law, the parties shall treat any indemnification payment
made hereunder as an adjustment to purchase price.

(h) _Acquisition of Nutritionals_. For Tax purposes, Unitholders will be
treated as selling the Units of the Nutritionals and Parent will be treated as
buying the assets of the Nutritionals. The consideration allocated to the
assets of Nutritionals shall be allocated in accordance with the respective
fair market values of such assets pursuant to an allocation schedule prepared
by Parent after the Closing in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code and
the regulations adopted thereunder (the " _Asset Allocation_ "). Within 120
days following the Closing Date, Parent shall submit to the Stakeholders
Representative a schedule calculating, in reasonable detail, such Asset
Allocation (the " _Asset Allocation Schedule_ "). The Asset Allocation
Schedule shall be amended to the extent required under applicable Tax law to
reflect any adjustment to the Aggregate Merger Consideration. Stakeholders
Representative shall have 30 days following receipt of the Asset Allocation
Schedule or any amendment thereto during which to dispute any item contained
therein. If Stakeholders Representative fails to notify Parent of any such
dispute within such 30-day period, the Asset Allocation Schedule shall be
deemed to have been accepted by Stakeholders Representative. If Stakeholders
Representative 



 

62  timely notifies Parent of any such dispute, and Parent and Stakeholders
Representative cannot resolve any such dispute within 30 days of receipt by
Parent of such notice, the parties shall jointly retain the Tax Arbitrator to
resolve the dispute. The Tax Arbitrators determination shall be made in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement and shall be final and binding on
the parties and not subject to collateral attack for any reason (other than
manifest error). All fees and expenses of the Tax Arbitrator shall be shared
equally by each of Parent and the Stakeholders Representative. Except as may
be required by Law, Parent and the Unitholders will (1) file or cause to be
filed all Tax Returns in a manner consistent with the Asset Allocation
Schedule and (2) not take any action inconsistent therewith.

(i) _Employee Benefits Items_. The parties agree that (i) all Tax deductions
or other Tax benefits resulting from amounts payable pursuant to this
Agreement on or prior to the Closing Date, amounts treated as an adjustment
to the Aggregate Merger Consideration for Tax purposes under Section 2.8 or
Section 8.1(b) and distributions payable pursuant to the Escrow Agreement to
Optionholders, Appreciation Rights Holders or other current or former
employees shall be allocated solely to partnership and S Corporation income
Tax Returns of the Companies and their Subsidiaries for Pre-Closing Periods,
and (ii) neither party shall take, or permit any of its Affiliates to take,
any position on any Tax Return, in connection with any Tax Claim or otherwise
that is inconsistent with such allocation.

Section 5.13 _Resignations_. On the Closing Date, the Companies shall cause to
be delivered to Parent duly signed resignations (including releases),
effective as of the Closing, of such directors, managers and officers of the
Companies and any of its Subsidiaries as are designated by Parent.

Section 5.14  _Exclusivity_. Except to the extent required by applicable Law
(until such time as the Stockholder and Unitholder Approvals are received),
from and after the date hereof and up to and including the date of termination
of this Agreement pursuant to Article VII, the Companies shall not, and shall
cause their Subsidiaries and each of their respective directors, officers,
managers, employees, Affiliates and representatives (including any investment
banking, legal or accounting firm retained by any of them) not to: (a)
initiate, solicit or seek, directly or indirectly, any inquiries or the making
or implementation of any proposal or offer (including any proposal or offer to
its Stockholders or Unitholders, as the case may be, or any of them) with
respect to a merger, acquisition, consolidation, recapitalization,
liquidation, dissolution, equity investment or similar transaction involving,
or any purchase of all or any substantial portion of the assets or any equity
securities of, any of the Companies or their Subsidiaries (any such proposal
or offer, a " _Proposal_ "); (b) engage in any negotiations concerning, or
provide any confidential information or data to, or have any substantive
discussions with, any Person relating to a Proposal; (c) otherwise cooperate
in any effort or attempt to make, implement or accept a Proposal; or (d) enter
into a Contract with any Person relating to a Proposal. If any
inquiry, proposal or offer related to a Proposal is received, the Companies
shall notify Parent of such inquiry, offer or proposal (including the terms
and conditions thereof and the identity of the Person making it) within forty-
eight (48) hours of receipt thereof.

Section 5.15 _Related Party and Other Arrangements_. Prior to the
Closing, (a) the Companies shall, and shall cause their Subsidiaries and
Affiliates to, cause all Contracts set forth on _Exhibit 4_ to be terminated

other company of which Manning is a controlling shareholder and which Parent
is not acquiring pursuant to this Agreement, and (d) the Companies shall,
through the transmittal letter to be used in connection with the distribution
of funds to the Companies Holders (which transmittal letter will be reasonably
acceptable to Parent) , use their reasonable best efforts to cause the
Stockholders and Unitholders to release and forever discharge Parent, the
Companies and their Subsidiaries (individually, a " _Releasee_ " and
collectively, " _Releasees_ ") from any and all claims, demands, Actions,
Orders, Contracts, Indebtedness, Encumbrances and liabilities whatsoever,
whether or not known or suspected, at law or in equity, that such Person has,
has ever had or may hereafter have against the respective Releasees arising on
or before the Closing Date or on account of or arising out of any matter,
cause or event occurring on or before the Closing Date; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that nothing contained herein will operate to release any
obligations of Parent or the Merger Subs arising under this Agreement or the
other Transaction Documents. Each Employee Loan will be paid in full by
Parent by deducting from the aggregate amount payable to the employee to which
the Employee Loan relates pursuant to Sections 2.3 and 2.4 the aggregate
amount (including all accrued interest) outstanding with respect to
the applicable Employee Loan.

Gordonsville Lease and (iii) as of the date on which Mannings employment by
the Companies terminates for any reason, the building located at 204 North

dated November 1, 2001, between Gordonsville Realty Investments, Inc., as
landlord, and Holdings, successor-in-interest to PBM Products, Inc., as
tenant, as amended.

(b) _Lease Termination_. Prior to the 30th day following the date on which
Mannings employment with Parent terminates for any reason, Parent and Manning
shall (i) mutually agree on which one additional building that is currently
leased by the Companies or their Subsidiaries in Gordonsville, VA may be
retained by Manning, and (ii) amend or terminate, as applicable, the lease
relating to such property. At the Closing, the Companies and Manning shall
execute a mutually agreeable bill of sale pursuant to which the Companies
will transfer to Manning the furniture contained at the premises located at

64 Section 5.18 _Covington, Ohio_.

(a) _Sale of Covington Facility_. In the event that the property located at
400 Hazel Street, Covington, Ohio is sold to a third party buyer within
eighteen (18) months after the Closing Date, the Stockholders and the
Unitholders, shall, collectively, be entitled to receive at the closing of

minus (b) the sum of (i) the aggregate of all expenditures by Parent
following the Closing with respect to such property, plus (ii) the fair market
value of any and all retained liabilities with respect to such property, plus
(iii) all transactional costs incurred in connection with such
closing, including but not limited to brokerage commission, applicable
transfer taxes, title and survey costs and attorneys fees. Promptly following
the closing of such sale, Parent shall pay to the Stakeholders
Representative, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the
account designated by the Stakeholders Representative, an amount in cash
equal to the Covington Sale Amount, which amount shall be disbursed by the
Stakeholders Representative to the Companies Holders in proportion to the
payments made to such Persons pursuant to Article II and as indicated on the
Transaction Disbursement Schedule.

(b) _Sale of Covington Farm Land_. If, at any time during the period
commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the tenth (10th) anniversary
thereof, Gordonsville Realty Investments, Inc. (" _Gordonsville Realty_ ")
desires to sell, transfer or convey to a third party purchaser Lots 30 and 31
of Plat 75 (comprising 23 acres of farmland) in Covington Ohio (the "
_Covington Farm Land_ "), Gordonsville Realty shall be required, prior to
commencing negotiations with any other Person, to give Parent a written notice
stating its bona fide intention to sell, transfer or convey the Covington Farm
Land. During the thirty (30) day period following Parents receipt of such
notice from Gordonsville Realty, Parent and Gordonsville Realty shall
negotiate in good faith to reach agreement on the price and other sale terms
and conditions for the Covington Farm Land. If Parent and Gordonsville Realty
do not reach agreement with respect to the sale of the Covington Farm Land
during such thirty (30) day period, Gordonsville Realty may sell the Covington
Farm Land to any other Person; _provided_ , _however_ , that if Gordonsville
Realty does not sell the Covington Farm Land to another Person within the
twelve (12) month period following the expiration of such thirty (30) day
period, Gordonsville Realty shall again be subject to this right of
first negotiation, but in no event will the term of this right of first
negotiation extend beyond ten (10) years.

Section 5.19 _Transitional Services_. Prior to the Closing, the parties hereto
shall, in good faith, negotiate a transition services agreement pursuant to
which Parent shall cause the Companies to continue to provide at cost to the
Companies set forth in Section 3.14(a)(v) of the Companies Disclosure Schedule
of which Manning is a controlling shareholder post-Closing (i) the services,
access to facilities, equipment and/or other assistance described in items
1-6 (other than the 401(k) plan, which Parent will not continue to provide to
the employees of such companies post-Closing) in Section 3.21(b) of the
Companies Disclosure Schedule in a manner consistent with past practice
and (ii) reasonable access to the employees listed in item 7 in Section
3.21(b) of the Companies Disclosure Schedule, in each case, for a period of up
to six (6) months immediately following the Closing. Such transition services
agreement shall contain reasonable and customary terms and conditions (for a
transition services agreement of the type 



 

65  entered into in the context of a transaction of the type contemplated by
this Agreement, considering the type of services being provided) mutually
agreed upon by the parties. In the event that the transition services
agreement has not been entered into at or prior to the Closing, Parent shall
cause the Companies to continue to provide at cost to such companies the
services, access to facilities, equipment and/or other assistance
described in items 1-6 (other than the 401(k) plan, which Parent will not
continue to provide to the employees of such companies post-Closing) in
Section 3.21(b) of the Companies Disclosure Schedule to the extent Parent is
able to provide such transition services and reasonable access to the
employees listed in item 7 in Section 3.21(b) of the Companies Disclosure
Schedules, and Parent and the Stakeholders Representative shall continue to
negotiate an appropriate transition services agreement for entry as soon as
reasonably practicable following the Closing, but in no event will Parent
provide such transition services for more than three (3) months following the

consistent with past practice) as of December 31, 2009 and the related
audited combined statements of income and cash flows for the fiscal year then
ended (including any notes thereto), together with the auditors audit report
relating thereto, (collectively, the " _2009 Audited Financial Statements_
"). The 2009 Audited Financial Statements and any required unaudited interim
financial statements shall be prepared in a manner consistent with past
practice and the Companies will reasonably cooperate with Parent to permit
Parent to prepare and file, in compliance with SEC reporting requirements
(Rule 3-05), a current report on Form 8-K with respect to the Mergers. In
addition, the Companies will reasonably cooperate with Parent to provide the
information necessary for the Parents preparation of pro forma financial
statements specified and described in Article 11 of Regulation S-X of the

the written request of Parent in connection with the cooperation contemplated

Indebtedness under the Credit Facility and terminate the commitments and
agreements evidencing the Credit Facility at or before the Closing. In
connection therewith, the Companies and Parent shall take all actions
reasonably required to facilitate such prepayment and termination, which
actions shall include, without limitation, the following: Parent shall deposit
or cause to be deposited, not later than at the Effective Time, with
Wachovia Bank, National Association, as administrative agent under the Credit
Facility (the " _Credit Facility Agent_ ") all amounts specified by the Credit
Facility Agent as being necessary to cash collateralize any letters of
credit outstanding under the Credit Facility and to prepay the Indebtedness
under the Credit Facility (including any fees, expenses, costs, commitment
fees, penalties, and other amounts payable to the Credit Facility Agent or
lenders identified as lenders under the Credit Facility (the " _Credit
Facility Lenders_ ") under the Credit Facility). In the event that the actual
date of such repayment and termination does not occur on 



 

66  the date set forth in notice of prepayment delivered by the Companies under
the Credit Facility (the " _Anticipated_ _Prepayment Date_ "), whether as a
result of any delay or failure to occur of the Effective Time for any reason
or for any other cause whatsoever (other than as a result of actions taken or
omitted to be taken by Parent in breach of this Agreement), the Companies
shall be solely responsible for any actual costs or expenses that the
Companies and any of their Subsidiaries or parent companies sustain or incur
as a consequence of the failure of the Companies to so repay such Indebtedness
and terminate such commitments on the Anticipated Prepayment Date, including
any costs and expenses charged by the Credit Facility Agent or the Credit
Facility Lenders under the Credit Facility.

Section 5.23 _Redemption of the Notes_. The Companies, with immediately
available funds provided by Parent at or before the Effective Time in

Notes pursuant to Section 4.04 of the Investment Agreement and the Consent and
Waiver, dated March 18, 2010, among the Companies and the investors party to
the Investment Agreement (the " _Subordinated Consent_ "). In connection
therewith, the Companies and Parent shall take all actions reasonably required
to facilitate such redemption (including without limitation payment of the
Amendment Fee, as defined in the Subordinated Consent). Parent shall deposit
or cause to be deposited with the Companies at or before the Effective Time
(which shall occur not later than 9 a.m. Eastern Time on the Closing Date)
immediately available funds equal to the Redemption Price (as defined in the
Investment Agreement) of the Notes (including accrued and unpaid interest on
the Notes to but excluding the redemption date) plus the Amendment Fee.

Section 5.24 _PBM Name_.

(a) Effective as of the Closing, Parent, on behalf of itself and
its Affiliates, hereby grants to Manning and its Affiliates, for a period of
six (6) months after the Closing, a non-exclusive, worldwide, and royalty-free
license to use the logo of the Companies containing "PBM" as it exists as of
the Closing set forth on Section 3.15(a) of the Companies Disclosure Schedule
(the " _PBM Logo_ ") in connection with the business of PBM Pharmaceuticals
and PBM Ventures to facilitate the transition by Manning and its Affiliates to
a new logo for or containing "PBM" (and any other name and mark). As soon as
reasonably practicable after the Closing, Manning and its Affiliates shall
phase out use of the PBM Logo, and, except as permitted in Section 5.24(e),
shall destroy (to the extent reasonably practicable) and make no further use
of any materials containing the PBM Logo within six (6) months after the
Closing. During the license period, Manning and its Affiliates shall use the
PBM Logo at a level of quality equivalent in all material respects to that in
effect for the PBM Logo as of the Closing.

(b) Parent, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates, hereby acknowledges and
agrees that, effective as of the Closing and notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, Manning and its Affiliates shall own and have the
perpetual, worldwide, royalty-free right to use in any manner, and to license
and otherwise exploit, the initials "PBM" in connection with any business or
other purpose except (i) during the Companies Non-Competition Period (as
defined in the Manning Non-Competition Agreement) and in connection with a
business that directly competes with the Companies Business (as defined in
the Manning Non-Competition Agreement) or (ii) in (A) a logo that is
confusingly similar to the PBM Logo or business name that is confusingly
similar to any business name of the Companies as of the Closing; or (B) an 



 

67  Internet domain name that is confusingly similar to an Internet domain name
of the Companies set forth on Section 3.15(a) of the Companies Disclosure
Schedule (a " _Permitted New PBM Logo_ "); _provided_ , in determining what
constitutes a logo, business name or Internet domain name confusingly similar
to the PBM Logo, business name or Internet domain name of the Companies,
respectively, the presence of the initials "PBM" (and generic words,
including "Company", "Inc.", ".com", etc.) shall not render such logo,
business name or Internet domain name confusingly similar to the PBM Logo,
business name or Internet domain name of the Companies, respectively. Subject
to Section 5.24(c), Manning acknowledges and agrees that, as of the Closing,
Parent and or its Affiliates shall be the owner of and have the right to use,
license, and otherwise exploit the initials "PBM" and the PBM Logo in
connection with the Companies Business (as defined in the Manning Non-
Competition Agreement). For avoidance of doubt and without limiting the
foregoing, Manning may use, and license the use of, any of the business names
as identified in Section 5.24 of the Companies Disclosure Schedule in a manner
that does not violate the Manning Non-Competition Agreement. Each of (i)
Parent and its Affiliates, on the one hand, and (ii) Manning and its
Affiliates, on the other, shall indemnify and defend the other party and its
Affiliates against, and shall hold them harmless from, any and all Losses
resulting from a third party claim to the extent arising out of or incurred in
connection with such indemnifying partys or its Affiliates use of the
initials "PBM" in a business name.

(c) In the event that Parent or its Affiliates do not, for any consecutive
twelve (12) month period after the Closing, make active and bona fide
commercial use of the initials "PBM" in connection with the Companies
Business (as defined in the Manning Non-Competition Agreement), Parent, on
behalf of itself and its Affiliates shall, upon Mannings written request and
without any payment or any further action required by Manning, irrevocably
assign and transfer all of their right, title and interest in and to the PBM
Logo and the initials "PBM" to Manning and, notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, Manning shall thereafter have the right to use,
license, or otherwise exploit the foregoing in any manner and for any
purpose.

(d) Parent shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, require any Person to
whom they assign or otherwise transfer the PBM Logo and/or the initials "PBM"
to agree in writing to be bound by this Section 5.24, and any such assignment
or other transfer without such agreement in writing shall be void _ab initio_.

(e) For purposes of clarity, nothing in this Section 5.24 shall preclude any
uses of the PBM Logo by Manning and its Affiliates that are required or
otherwise not prohibited under applicable Law, including uses of the PBM Logo
not in commerce, uses that would not cause confusion as to the origin of a
good or service, and references to the PBM Logo in historical, tax, and
similar records.

been satisfied.

(b) _No Injunctions or Restraints_. No Restraints shall be in effect

to prevent the entry of any such Order.

(c) _Filings; Consents; Waiting Period_. The waiting period applicable to the

satisfied if such failure was caused by such partys breach of any provision
of this Agreement.

ARTICLE VII

TERMINATION

Section 7.1 _Termination of Agreement_. This Agreement may be terminated,
whether before or after receipt of the Stockholder or Unitholder Approval, as
follows:

(a) by mutual written consent of Parent and the Companies at any time prior
to the Closing Date;

(b) by the written notice of Parent or the Companies to the other parties if
the Closing shall not have occurred on or prior to June 14, 2010 (the "
_Outside Date_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that the right to terminate this
Agreement under this Section 7.1(b) shall not be available to any party whose
failure to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement shall have been the
cause of, or shall have resulted in, the failure of the Closing to occur on or
prior to such date; _provided_ , _further_ , that the Outside Date shall be
extended for six (6) months if the failure of the Closing to occur on or
prior to such date is due only to the failure to receive approval of any
Antitrust Authority required in order to satisfy the conditions set forth in
Sections 6.1(c) and 6.2(c); 

(c) by the written notice of the Companies to Parent ( _provided_ that the
Companies are not then in material breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or other agreement contained herein) if Parent shall have breached or
failed to perform in any material respect its representations, warranties,
covenants or other agreements contained herein, which breach or failure to
perform (i) would (if it occurred or was continuing as of the Closing Date)
result in a failure of the conditions set forth in Sections 6.2(a)(i) and
6.2(a)(ii) to be satisfied and (ii) (A) is not cured within thirty (30) days
(or by the Outside Date, if written notice is provided within thirty (30) days
of the Outside Date) following written notice to Parent of such breach or
failure or (B) such breach, by its nature, cannot be cured prior to
the Outside Date;

(d) by the written notice of Parent to each of the Companies ( _provided_ that
Parent is not then in material breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or other agreement contained herein) if the Companies shall have
breached or failed to perform in any material respect their representations,
warranties, covenants or other agreements contained herein, which breach or
failure to perform (i) would (if it occurred or was continuing as of the
Closing Date) result in a failure of the conditions set forth in Sections
6.1(a)(i) or 6.1(a)(ii) to be satisfied and (ii) (A) is not cured within
thirty (30) days (or by the Outside Date, if written notice is 



 

71  provided within thirty (30) days of the Outside Date) following written
notice to each of the Companies of such breach or failure or (B) such breach,
by its nature, cannot be cured prior to the Outside Date;

(e) by the written notice of Parent to each of the Companies if either of the
Companies are in breach of any of the covenants contained in Section 5.8;

(f) by written notice of the Companies to Parent if the Closing has not
occurred on or before the later of (i) the third (3rd) Business Day after all
of the conditions set forth in Sections 6.1 and 6.2(b) and (c) have been
satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that by their nature are to
be satisfied by actions taken at the Closing), and (ii) May 17, 2010; or

(g) by the written notice of Parent or the Companies to the other parties if
there shall be any Law that makes consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement illegal or otherwise prohibited or if any
Restraint enjoining Parent or the Companies from consummating
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is entered and such Restraint
shall become final and nonappealable; _provided_ , _however_ , that the right
to terminate this Agreement under this Section 7.1(g) is not available to a
party that has not fulfilled its obligations under Section 5.9.

Section 7.2 _Certain Fees and Expenses_. 

(a) If this Agreement is terminated by (i) Parent or the Companies pursuant to
Section 7.1(b) and if at the time of such termination, the conditions set
forth in Sections 6.1 and 6.2 have been satisfied or waived (other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied by actions taken at the
Closing) or (ii) by the Companies pursuant to Sections 7.1(c) or 7.1(f), then
(x) Parent will pay the Companies an amount equal to (A) $32,000,000 _plus_
(B) the Companies reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred
in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby on
or prior to the date of such payment, not to exceed $3,000,000 (the "
_Termination Fee_ "), which fee shall be payable by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account specified by the Companies within
three (3) Business Days after receipt or delivery, as applicable, by Parent of
the termination notice, and (y) the Parent Non-Competition Agreement shall
remain in full force and effect, in accordance with the terms thereof.

(b) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the agreements contained in
this Section 7.2 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the parties would not
enter into this Agreement. If Parent fails to promptly pay the amount due to
the Companies pursuant to Section 7.2(a), interest shall accrue on such
amount from the date such payment was required to be paid pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement until the date of payment at the "prime rate" as
published in the Wall Street Journal, Eastern Edition on the date
such payment becomes due. If, in order to obtain such payment, the Companies
commence a suit and are entitled to reimbursement of costs and expenses
pursuant to Section 9.16, such costs and expenses shall be payable by Parent
whether or not, when aggregated with the expenses contemplated by Section
7.2(a)(x)(B), such aggregate amount would exceed $3,000,000 (and/or when
aggregated with the amounts set forth in Section 



 

72  7.2(a)(x)(A) and (B), such aggregate amount would exceed $35,000,000). Each
of the parties further acknowledges that the payment of the amounts by Parent
specified in Section 7.2(a) is not a penalty, but is liquidated damages in a
reasonable amount that will compensate the Companies in the circumstances in
which such fees are payable for the efforts and resources expended and the
opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on
this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate
with precision. In no event shall Parent be required to pay the
Termination Fee more than once.

(c) The Companies agree that the right to the payment of the Termination Fee
pursuant to Section 7.2(a) shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the
Companies, its Subsidiaries, the Stockholders, the Unitholders, the
Optionholders, the Appreciation Rights Holders, their respective Affiliates,
officers, directors, employees or representatives against Parent, the Merger
Subs or any of their respective Subsidiaries, stockholders, Affiliates,
officers, directors, employees or representatives, and in no event will the
Companies seek to recover any other money damages or seek any other remedy
based on a Claim in law or equity with respect to, (i) any Loss suffered as a
result of the failure of the Mergers to be consummated, (ii) the termination
of this Agreement, (iii) any liabilities or obligations arising under this
Agreement, or (iv) any Claim or Actions arising out of or relating to any
breach, termination or failure of or under this Agreement. For the avoidance
of doubt, the termination of this Agreement shall not limit, in any manner,
the Companies rights pursuant to the Parent Non-Competition Agreement and the
Confidentiality Agreements.

Section 7.3 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this
Agreement by a party hereto pursuant to Section 7.1 hereof, written notice
thereof shall forthwith be given by the terminating party to the
other parties hereto, and this Agreement shall thereupon terminate and become
void and have no effect, and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be
abandoned without further action by the parties hereto, except that the
provisions of Section 5.5, Section 5.6 and Article VII, and Article IX shall
survive the termination of this Agreement; provided, however, that upon such
termination, the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreements shall
automatically be extended and remain in full force and effect without any
further action by the Companies or Parent for the longer of (i) one year
following such termination or (ii) the remaining term under the
Confidentiality Agreements. For the avoidance of doubt, the termination of
this Agreement shall not limit, in any manner, any of the Companies rights
pursuant to the Parent Non-Competition Agreement. In the event of the
termination of this Agreement by Parent pursuant to Section 7.1(e),
the Companies shall pay to Parent within two (2) Business Days of such
termination, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, an amount equal
to Parents, the Merger Subs and their Affiliates out-of-pocket
expenses (including all fees, commitment fees and expenses of counsel,
accountants, commercial and investment bankers, lenders, experts and
consultants) incurred in connection with the authorization, preparation,
negotiation, execution and performance of this Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents and all other matters related to the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.



 

73 ARTICLE VIII

INDEMNIFICATION

Section 8.1  _Indemnification_.

(a) If the Closing occurs, the Companies Holders shall (which, with respect to
the indemnification matters in Sections 8.1(a)(i) and 8.1(a)(ii), shall be
limited to amounts held and remaining in escrow as described in Section
8.2(a)), subject to the limitations set forth in this Article VIII and Section
9.4, severally and not jointly, indemnify and defend Parent and its
Affiliates (including following the Closing, the Companies and their
Subsidiaries) and their respective managers, officers, directors, employees,
agents, successors and assigns (the " _Parent Indemnified Parties_ ")
against, and shall hold them harmless from, any and all Losses resulting from,
arising out of, or incurred in connection with (or with regard to the
indemnified items set forth in 8.1(a)(iv) and 8.1(a)(v) below, payments made
with respect to):

(i) any breach of, or inaccuracy in, any of the representations or warranties
of the Companies contained in Article III of this Agreement or in any
certificate delivered pursuant to this Agreement;

(ii) the breach of any covenant, undertaking, agreement or other obligation
of the Companies contained in this Agreement;

(iii) the matters set forth in Section 8.1(a)(iii) of the Companies
Disclosure Schedule and all claims, counterclaims, appeals or similar matters
relating thereto regardless of whether the expense is incurred or accrued
before or after the Closing (the " _Specified Litigation Matters_ ");

(iv) the obligations relating to the payment of the Arla Earnout Indemnity
Amount regardless of whether the expense is incurred or accrued before or
after the Closing;

(v) the Companies Holders portion of (A) the cost incurred by Parent in
preparing the Stakeholders Representative Filed Tax Returns and (B) the
Transfer Taxes; or

(vi) any transaction bonus payments paid to employees of the Companies
pursuant to Section 2.6(f) resulting in any liability pursuant to Section
280G(b)(1) of the Code.

(b) If the Closing occurs, Parent and the Merger Subs (the " _Parent
Indemnifying Parties_ ") shall, subject to the limitations set forth in this
Article VIII and Section 9.4, jointly and severally indemnify and defend the
Companies Holders and their respective managers, officers, directors,
employees, agents, successors and assigns (the " _Equityholder_ _ Indemnified
Parties_ ") against, and shall hold them harmless from, any and all Losses
resulting from, arising out of, or incurred in connection with any breach of,
or inaccuracy in, any of the representations or warranties of Parent or
the Merger Subs contained in Article IV of this Agreement or in any
certificate delivered pursuant to this Agreement.



 

74 Section 8.2 _Limitations on Indemnification_.

(a) _Escrow as Sole and Exclusive Remedy_. Subject to the further limitations
set forth in this Article VIII, (i) the right of the Parent Indemnified
Parties to recover for any indemnifiable Losses pursuant to Sections 8.1(a)(i)
and 8.1(a)(ii) (and, for the avoidance of doubt, recovery for costs and
expenses pursuant to Section 9.16) shall be limited solely and exclusively to
the Indemnification Escrow Amount held in a sub-account pursuant to the Escrow
Agreement (such amount, including all income accrued thereon, if any, pursuant
to the terms of the Escrow Agreement, collectively, the " _Indemnification
Escrow Funds_ ") to the extent then held in such sub-account, and (ii) in no
event shall any Companies Holder be personally liable for any payment or be
required to provide indemnification under Sections 8.1(a)(i) and 8.1(a)(ii)
to the Parent Indemnified Parties other than to the extent of such Companies
Holders Pro Rata Portion of the Indemnification Escrow Amount to the extent
then held in such sub-account.

(b) _Basket Amount_. None of the Parent Indemnified Parties nor the
Equityholder Indemnified Parties (as applicable, an " _Indemnified Party_ _"_
) shall be entitled to indemnification for any Losses under Sections 8.1(a)(i)
or (ii) or Section 8.1(b), as applicable, unless and until the aggregate
amount of Losses suffered, sustained or incurred by all of the Parent
Indemnified Parties, collectively, under Sections 8.1(a)(i) and (ii) or all of
the Equityholder Indemnified Parties, collectively, under Section 8.1(b), as
applicable, that would otherwise be indemnifiable exceeds $8,080,000 (the "
_Basket Amount_ "), in which case the obligations to provide indemnification
to the applicable Indemnified Party shall only apply to amounts in excess of
the Basket Amount.

(c) _Cap Amount_. The maximum aggregate liability of the Companies Holders or
Parent Indemnifying Parties (as applicable, the " _Indemnifying Parties_ ")
to any Parent Indemnified Party or Equityholder Indemnified Party, as
applicable, for any Losses under Sections 8.1(a)(i), 8.1(a)(ii) or 8.1(b), as
applicable, shall not exceed $80,800,000 (the " _Cap Amount_ "); _provided_
_that_ , with respect to the indemnification obligations of the Companies
Holders under this Agreement (other than for Indemnifiable Losses under
Sections 8.1(a)(iii), 8.1(a)(iv), 8.1(a)(v) or 8.1(a)(vi)), the ability of
the Parent Indemnified Parties to recover for any indemnifiable Losses shall
be limited solely to the Indemnification Escrow Funds to the extent then held
in the Indemnification Escrow Funds sub-account (which at any time may contain
an amount more or less than the Cap Amount); therefore, to the extent that
the amount of the Indemnification Escrow Funds is at any time, or from time to
time, less than the Cap Amount (whether or not giving effect to any portion of
the Indemnification Escrow Funds that may have been released pursuant to the
Escrow Agreement to the Parent Indemnified Parties in respect of an
indemnifiable claim), there shall in no event be any obligation whatsoever for
any Companies Holder or any other Person to contribute proceeds to the Escrow
Account or otherwise increase the amount of Indemnification Escrow Funds at
any given time except as set forth in the Escrow Agreement.

(d) _Additional Limitations_.

(i) The amount of any Losses incurred by any Indemnified Parties shall be
reduced by the amount recovered by such Indemnified Parties (after deducting
all attorneys fees, expenses and other costs of recovery) from any insurer
(less the amount of any 



 

75  increases in premiums relating to the applicable insurance coverage as a
result of such recovery) or other Person then liable for such Losses.

(ii) Any entitlement of any Indemnified Party to make a claim for
indemnification under this Agreement shall be determined without duplication
of recovery by reason of the state of facts giving rise to such claim
constituting a breach of more than one representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement.

(iii) The Parent Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to indemnification
for any Losses hereunder to the extent such item or matter was included in the
calculation of the Final Net Working Capital Amount, the Final Closing Debt
Amount or the Final Closing Cash Amount.

(iv) The amount of any Losses sustained by any Indemnified Parties shall be
reduced by the amount of any Tax Benefit actually realized with respect to
such Losses, which shall be paid by Parent to the Stakeholders Representative
within ten (10) Business Days following the filing date of any Tax Return
(including any adjustment thereto or an amended Tax Return) that reflects such
Tax Benefit. A " _Tax Benefit_ " shall mean, with respect to any person, the
Tax savings, net of any Tax detriment, attributable to any deduction,
expense, loss, credit or refund to such Person as a result of such Losses.

(v) The Indemnified Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
collect any amounts available under insurance coverage, or from any other
Person known to the applicable Indemnified Party to be liable for his, her or
its Losses.

(vi) The Indemnified Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
mitigate Losses in accordance with the common law.

(e) For purposes only of measuring Losses incurred with respect to a breach of
any representation or warranty (other than Section 3.14(a)) contained in this
Agreement or in any certificate delivered pursuant to this Agreement, but not
for purposes of determining whether any such breach has in fact occurred, each
such representation or warranty shall be read without reference to
"materiality," "Company Material Adverse Effect" or "Parent Material Adverse
Effect" (it being understood that the foregoing read out of such qualifiers
does not apply in determining whether any representation or warranty has been
breached).

Section 8.3 _Claim Procedure_.

(a) _Non-Third Party Claims_. If a claim for Losses (a " _Claim_ ") is to be
made by any Indemnified Party pursuant to Section 8.1, such Indemnified Party
shall give written notice (a " _Claim Notice_ ") to the Stakeholders
Representative if the Claim Notice is being given by a Parent Indemnified
Party and to Parent if the Claim Notice is being given by an Equityholder
Indemnified Party, in each case, reasonably promptly after such Indemnified
Party becomes aware of any fact, condition or event giving rise to Losses for
which indemnification may be sought under Section 8.1, which Claim Notice
shall specify in reasonable detail, to the extent known at such time, the
amount of the Claim, the date (if any) such item was incurred or suffered and
the basis for indemnification under this Article VIII. The failure of
any Indemnified Party to give timely notice hereunder shall not affect such
Indemnified Partys rights to 



 

76  indemnification hereunder, except to the extent the applicable Indemnifying
Parties are actually and materially prejudiced by such delay or failure. If
the applicable Indemnifying Parties notify the Indemnified Party in writing
that they do not dispute the claim described in such Claim Notice or fail to
notify the Indemnified Party in writing within thirty (30) days following
receipt of the Claim Notice that they dispute the Claim described in such
Claim Notice, the Losses identified in the Claim Notice will be conclusively
deemed a liability of the Indemnifying Party under Sections 8.1(a) or (b), as
applicable, and, in the case of a Claim Notice delivered by the
Parent Indemnified Parties, the Parent shall be entitled to instruct the
Escrow Agent to release to the Parent Indemnified Parties the amount of such
Losses pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement. If the applicable
Indemnifying Parties have timely disputed their liability with respect to
such Claim or the estimated amount of such Losses pursuant to this Section
8.3, the parties shall attempt in good faith to resolve such dispute;
_provided_ that if such dispute has not been resolved within fifteen (15)
days after receipt by the applicable Indemnified Party of notice of such
dispute, then the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party may seek legal
redress in accordance with Article IX. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained herein, this Section 8.3(a) shall not apply with
regard to the Specified Litigation Matters or reimbursement of an amount paid
with respect to Section 8.1(a)(iv) or 8.1(a)(v).

(b) _Third Party Claims_. If any Indemnified Party receives notice of the
assertion of any Claim or the commencement of any Action by a third party
with respect to a matter subject to indemnity hereunder, notice thereof (a "
_Third Party Notice_ ") shall promptly be given to the Stakeholders
Representative if the Third Party Notice is being given by a Parent
Indemnified Party and to Parent if the Third Party Notice is being given by an
Equityholder Indemnified Party, which Third Party Notice shall specify in
reasonable detail, to the extent known, the amount of the Claim, the date (if
any) such item was incurred or suffered and the basis for indemnification
under this Article VIII, and will include copies of all notices and documents
(including court papers) served on or received by the Indemnified Party in
connection with such Claim. The failure of any Indemnified Party to give
timely notice hereunder shall not affect such Indemnified Partys rights to
indemnification hereunder, except to the extent such delay or failure actually
and materially prejudices the Indemnifying Parties ability to defend such
Claim or Action. After receipt of a Third Party Notice, the Indemnifying
Parties shall have the right, but not the obligation, by providing written
notice to the Indemnified Party acknowledging their obligation to indemnify
the Indemnified Party pursuant to Section 8.1, to (i) take control of the
defense and investigation of such Claim or Action, (ii) employ and engage
attorneys of his own choice (subject to the approval of the
Indemnified Party, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed) to handle and defend the same, at the Indemnifying Parties sole
cost and expense, and (iii) compromise or settle such claim, which compromise
or settlement shall be made only with the written consent of the Indemnified
Party, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed;
_provided_ , that such consent will not be required (other than with respect
to an item relating to Taxes) if such settlement includes an unconditional
release of the Indemnified Party and otherwise provides solely for payment of
monetary damages for which the Indemnified Party will be indemnified in full.
The Indemnified Party shall, at the expense of the Indemnifying Parties,
cooperate in all reasonable respects with the Indemnifying Parties and their
attorneys in the investigation, trial and defense of such Claim or Action and
any appeal arising therefrom, including, if reasonably appropriate in the
opinion of the Indemnifying Partys counsel, and related to the Third Party
Claim in question, in making at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying
Party any 



 

77  counterclaim against the third party claimant, or any cross complaint
against any Person. The Indemnified Party may, at its own sole cost and
expense, monitor and further participate in (but not control) the
investigation, trial and defense of such Claim or Action and any appeal
arising therefrom; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the Indemnifying Parties
elect not to assume such defense and investigation or do not acknowledge
in writing within a reasonable period (in light of the circumstances), not to
exceed thirty (30) days, after receipt of the Third Party Notice (or such
earlier date, if the failure to assume the defense on such earlier date would
materially impair the ability of such Indemnified Party to defend such claim)
their obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party against any Losses arising
from such Action, the Indemnified Party may (upon delivering notice to such
effect to the Indemnifying Parties) retain separate counsel and defend such
Claim or Action (all at the cost and expense of the Indemnifying Parties);
_provided_ that the Indemnifying Parties shall have the right to participate
therein at their own sole cost and expense. Notwithstanding the Indemnifying
Parties election to assume the defense of such Claim or Action or anything to
the contrary herein, the Indemnified Party shall have, upon giving prior
written notice to the Indemnifying Parties, the right to employ separate
counsel and to participate in the defense of such Action, and the Indemnifying
Parties shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate
counsel for the Indemnified Party in each jurisdiction if, but only if,
the Indemnified Party shall have reasonably concluded in good faith that (x)
an actual or potential conflict of interest (including one or more legal
defenses or counterclaims available to it or to other Indemnified Parties
which are different from or additional to those available to the Indemnifying
Parties) makes it inappropriate in the reasonable judgment of the Indemnified
Party (upon and in conformity with the advice of counsel) for the same counsel
to represent both the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Parties or (y)
the claim seeks nonmonetary relief which, if granted, could materially and
adversely affect the Indemnified Party or its Affiliates. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, whether or not the Indemnifying Party shall
have assumed the defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall
not settle or compromise any Third Party Claim for which it seeks
indemnification hereunder without the prior written consent of the
Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, this Section 8.3(b) shall not apply with regard to the Specified
Litigation Matters or reimbursement of an amount paid with respect to Section
8.1(a)(iv) or 8.1(a)(v).

(c) _Specified Litigation Matters; Arla Earnout Indemnity Amount; Tax-Related
Payments._

(i) If, at any time from and after the Closing, a Claim is to be made by
any Parent Indemnified Party pursuant to Section 8.1(a)(iii), or
reimbursement of an amount paid is sought with respect to Section 8.1(a)(v),
such Parent Indemnified Party shall provide a Claim Notice or evidence of
payment, as the case may be, to the Stakeholders Representative reasonably
promptly after such Parent Indemnified Party becomes aware of any fact,
condition or event giving rise to Losses or reimbursement obligations for
which indemnification may be sought under Section 8.1(a)(iii) or 8.1(a)(v),
which Claim Notice or payment request shall be accompanied by evidence of the
amount of such Losses in form reasonably acceptable to the Stakeholders
Representative. The failure of any Parent Indemnified Party to give timely
notice hereunder shall not affect such Parent Indemnified Partys rights to
indemnification hereunder, except to the extent the Companies Holders are
actually and materially prejudiced by such delay or failure. Upon receipt of
the Claim Notice or payment request by the Stakeholders 



 

78  Representative, the Stakeholders Representative shall promptly pay to the
Parent Indemnified Party on behalf of the Companies Holders, the amount of
such Losses.

(ii) During the period commencing immediately following the Closing and ending
thirty (30) days after the fifth anniversary of the date of this Agreement,
Parent shall invoice the Stakeholders Representative, on a quarterly basis,
for reimbursement of any amounts paid with respect to Section 8.1(a)(iv). Upon
receipt by the Stakeholders Representative of any such quarterly invoice,
each of which shall be accompanied by evidence of the amount or amounts paid
with respect to Section 8.1(a)(iv) in a form reasonably acceptable to the
Stakeholders Representative, the Stakeholders Representative shall pay to
the Parent Indemnified Party on behalf of the Companies Holders, the amount or
amounts specified in such quarterly invoice within forty-five (45) days of
receipt of such invoice.

(iii) The Stakeholders Representative shall have the right to control the
defense, investigation or prosecution of the Specified Litigation Matters and
may employ and engage attorneys of its own choice to handle the same. To the
extent that the Companies or Parent incur any expenses with respect to the
Specified Litigation Matters, the Stakeholders Representative shall promptly
reimburse the Companies for such expenses. The Stakeholders Representative
shall consult with Parent periodically regarding the status of the Specified
Litigation Matters and shall respond to reasonable requests by Parent
for information regarding the Specified Litigation Matters as promptly as
reasonably practicable. The Stakeholders Representative shall not compromise
or settle any Claim relating to a Specified Litigation Matter without the
prior written consent of Parent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. Parent shall, at the expense of the Companies Holders,
cooperate in all reasonable respects with the Stakeholders Representative and
its attorneys in the investigation, trial and defense or prosecution of any
Specified Litigation Matter. Without limiting the foregoing, Parent shall, and
shall cause the Companies, to provide all reasonable cooperation in the
administration and settlement of any such claims (including assisting with
any insurance recoveries).

(iv) Any proceeds (net of any amounts due to any Parent Indemnified Party
under this Section 8.3(c)) of any amounts actually recovered by the
Stakeholders Representative in connection with a Specified Litigation Matter
shall be paid promptly to the Stakeholders Representative but in any event
no later than ten (10) Business Days after receipt of such proceeds. The
Stakeholders Representative shall disburse such amount (net of any costs and
expenses incurred by the Stakeholders Representative in connection with

Delaware Court of Chancery and any state appellate court therefrom within the
State of Delaware (or, only if the Delaware Court of Chancery declines
to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any state or federal court
within the State of Delaware), and each party waives any requirement for the
securing or posting of any bond in connection with any such remedy.

(ii) The parties further agree that (A) by seeking the remedies provided for
in Section 9.15(a), a party shall not in any respect waive its right to seek
any other form of relief that may be available to a party under this
Agreement, including monetary damages in the event that this Agreement has
been terminated or in the event that the remedies provided for in Section
9.15(a) are not available or otherwise are not granted and (B) nothing
contained in this Section 9.15 shall require any party to institute any Action
for (or limit any partys right to institute any Action for)
specific performance under this Section 9.15 before exercising any
termination right under Article VII (and pursuing damages after such
termination pursuant to the limitations set forth in Sections 7.1(b) and (c))
nor shall the commencement of any Action pursuant to this Section 9.15 or
anything contained in Section 9.15 restrict or limit any partys right to
terminate this Agreement in accordance with the terms of Article VII or pursue
any other remedies under this Agreement that may be available then or
thereafter.

(c) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, neither
the Companies nor the Stakeholders Representative on behalf of the Companies
nor any other Person (other than Parent and Merger Subs) shall be entitled to
specific performance as a remedy for breach of this Agreement.

Section 9.16 _Reimbursement of Expenses_. If, in order to enforce its rights
under this Agreement, a party commences a suit that results in a judgment for
such party, the party against whom the judgment is issued shall (subject, in
the case of Parent, to the limitations set forth in Section 8.2(a)) reimburse
the other party for its reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses
(including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) incurred in connection
with such suit.

Parent, Pine Holdings Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Holdings
Merger Sub"), Pine Nutritionals Merger Sub, LLC, a Delaware limited liability
company ("Nutritionals Merger Sub"), and the Stakeholders Representative have
entered into that certain Merger Agreement, dated as of March 22, 2010 (as may
be amended from time to time, the "Merger Agreement"), which provides for,
among other things, subject to the terms and conditions therein, the merger of
Holdings Merger Sub with and into Holdings and the merger of Nutritionals
Merger Sub with and into Nutritionals (the "Mergers"); and

WHEREAS, Section 2.6(b) of the Merger Agreement contemplates the
establishment of separate escrow funds to (i) satisfy the payment obligations,
if any, to Parent under Section 2.8(g)(i) of the Merger Agreement and (ii)
satisfy and secure the indemnification obligations, if any, of the Companies
Holders to the Parent Indemnified Parties under Article VIII of the Merger
Agreement (excluding Sections 8.1(iii), (iv) and (v) thereof).

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing premises and of the
covenants and agreements set forth herein and in the Merger Agreement, and
intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto agree as follows:

1\. _Definitions_. Capitalized terms used but not defined herein have the
respective meanings set forth on _Exhibit A_ hereto.

2\. _Appointment of Escrow Agent_. Parent and the Stakeholders Representative
hereby appoint and designate the Escrow Agent as escrow agent hereunder, and
the Escrow Agent hereby agrees to act as escrow agent hereunder, to hold and
release the Escrow Funds in accordance with the terms hereof. 3\. _Escrow Deposit; Investment of Escrow Fund_.

(a) At the Closing, Parent shall, by wire transfer of immediately available
funds, deposit with the Escrow Agent on behalf of the Companies Holders, and
upon such deposit the Escrow Agent shall acknowledge receipt of:

(i) $6,000,000 (such amount, together with all income accrued thereon which
has not been distributed pursuant to this Agreement, the "Working Capital
Escrow Funds"); and

(ii) $80,800,000 (such amount, together with all income accrued thereon which
has not been distributed pursuant to this Agreement, the "Indemnification
Escrow Funds" and, together with the Working Capital Escrow Funds and the
Indemnification Escrow Funds, the "Escrow Funds").

(b) The Escrow Agent shall hold the Working Capital Escrow Funds and the
Indemnification Escrow Funds in separate and distinct accounts (each, an
"Escrow Account," and together, the "Escrow Accounts"). All income earned on
the Working Capital Escrow Funds shall be credited to the Working Capital
Escrow Funds and be deemed to be a part of the Working Capital Escrow Funds
for any and all purposes hereunder and all income earned on the
Indemnification Escrow Funds shall be credited to the Indemnification Escrow

and all purposes hereunder. The Escrow Funds shall not be subject to any lien,

instituted by the Escrow Agent, other than the lien indicated in Section 10\.
The Escrow Agent agrees to hold, invest and distribute the Escrow Funds and to
act as escrow agent in accordance with all the terms, conditions
and provisions of this Agreement. The Escrow Agent in its capacity as escrow
agent hereunder shall not have any liability for any loss sustained as a
result of any investment made pursuant hereto or as a result of any
liquidation of any investment prior to its maturity or for the failure of the
Parties to give the Escrow Agent instructions to invest or reinvest the Escrow
Funds, in each case, except for such losses that may result from its own gross
negligence or willful misconduct.

(c) During the term of this Agreement, the Escrow Funds shall be invested and
reinvested by the Escrow Agent in the Wells Fargo Money Market Deposit
Account (the "MMDA"), further described herein on _Exhibit B_ , unless
otherwise instructed in writing by Parent and the Stakeholders
Representative. The Parties acknowledge that they have read and understand 
_Exhibit B_. The MMDA will have rates of compensation that may vary from time
to time based upon market conditions. At any time after the date hereof,
pursuant to written instructions from Parent and the Stakeholders
Representative to the Escrow Agent, the Escrow Funds may be invested by the
Escrow Agent in any one or more of the following investments:

(i) direct obligations of the United States of America;



 

2 (ii) obligations for which the full faith and credit of the United States of
America is ledged to provide for the payment of principal and interest;

(iii) money market deposit account in or certificates of deposit of any bank
organized under the laws of the United States (including the Escrow Agent), or
of any state, with a capital and surplus of at least $1,000,000,000;

(iv) money market funds that invest substantially all of their assets in
securities of the types described in clause (i) through (iii) above or which
are rated in the highest money market rating category by Standard and Poors
Corporation or Moodys Investor Services, Inc.; and

(v) such other investments as Parent and the Stakeholders Representative may
from time to time mutually agree upon in written instructions executed and
delivered by Parent and the Stakeholders Representative to the Escrow Agent.

(d) The Escrow Agent is hereby authorized to execute purchases and sales of
investments through the facilities of its own trading or capital markets
operations or those of any of its Affiliates. Monthly statements will be
provided to the Parties reflecting transactions executed on behalf of and
related to the Escrow Funds. The Escrow Agent shall have the right to
liquidate any investments held in order to provide funds necessary to make
required payments under this Agreement. The Parties acknowledge that the
Escrow Agent is not providing investment supervision, recommendations or
advice.

4\. _Tax Matters_.

(a) For tax reporting purposes, all interest or other income earned with
respect to any portion of the Working Capital Escrow Funds or the
Indemnification Escrow Funds in any tax year shall be reported at year end as
allocated to Parent. Any other tax returns required to be filed will be
prepared and filed by the Parties with the Internal Revenue Services ("IRS")
and any other taxing authority as required by law. The Parties acknowledge and
agree that the Escrow Agent shall have no responsibility for the preparation
and/or filing of any income, franchise or any other tax return with respect to
the Escrow Funds or any income earned by the Escrow Funds. In addition, the
Escrow Agent shall withhold any taxes it deems appropriate, including but not
limited to, required withholding in the absence of proper tax documentation,
and shall remit such taxes to the appropriate authorities. Any amounts
withheld by the Escrow Agent pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be
treated for all other purposes under this Agreement as distributed to the
Companies Holders. Simultaneously with the execution of this Agreement, the
Stakeholders Representative shall instruct each of the Companies Holders
to execute and deliver any documents reasonably requested by the Escrow Agent
in connection therewith (including, without limitation, a fully executed W-8
or W-9 IRS form, which shall include TIN data, from each of the Companies
Holders).

 



 

3 (b) To the extent that the Escrow Agent becomes liable for the payment of any
taxes in respect of income derived from the investment of the Escrow Funds,
the Escrow Agent shall satisfy such liability to the extent possible from the
Escrow Funds. The parties, jointly and severally, shall indemnify, defend and
hold the Escrow Agent harmless from and against any tax, late payment,
interest, penalty or other cost or expense that may be assessed against the
Escrow Agent on or with respect to the Escrow Funds and the investment thereof
unless such tax, late payment, interest, penalty or other expense was
directly caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Escrow
Agent. The indemnification provided by this Section 4(b) shall survive the
resignation or removal of the Escrow Agent and the termination of this
Agreement.

5\. _Procedure for Indemnification Claims_.

(a) _Claim Notice_. Concurrently with or promptly following the delivery of a
Claim Notice by a Parent Indemnified Party to the Stakeholders
Representative, Parent, on behalf of any such Parent Indemnified Party, shall

specify the amount (the "Owed Amount") that such Parent Indemnified Party is
seeking from the Indemnification Escrow Funds pursuant to Article VIII of the
Merger Agreement (excluding Sections 8.1(iii), (iv) and (v) thereof). The
Stakeholders Representative and the Escrow Agent must receive any Claim
Notices with respect to the Indemnification Escrow Funds from Parent before
5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on or prior to [], 20111 (the "Indemnification Escrow
Termination Date") and any Claim Notice received thereafter shall be null and
void in its entirety.

(b) _Objection_. Within thirty (30) days after receipt by the Stakeholders
Representative of a Claim Notice, the Stakeholders Representative may deliver
to Parent and the Escrow Agent a written objection to all or any part of the
Claim Notice (an "Objection").

(c) _Failure to Object_. If the Stakeholders Representative fails to deliver
an Objection by 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on the thirtieth (30th) day
following the receipt by the Stakeholders Representative of a Claim Notice,
the Escrow Agent shall pay to Parent out of the Indemnification Escrow Funds
an amount equal to the Owed Amount pursuant to such Claim Notice, up to a
maximum, in the aggregate, of the Indemnification Escrow Funds. Any such
payment shall be made on or before the third (3rd) Business Day following the
expiration of such 30-day period.

(d) _Mutual Instructions; Judgment Notice_. If the Stakeholders
Representative delivers a timely Objection with respect to all or any portion

Stakeholders Representative, an amount equal to its unreimbursed fees and
expenses incurred in connection with its duties as
Stakeholders Representative and (ii) then to the Companies Holders,
including the Stakeholders Representative if at such time, it is also a

respect to each release of Indemnification Escrow Funds contemplated by this

Indemnification Escrow Funds and the amounts payable to each such Companies

8\. _The Escrow Agent_.

(a) The Escrow Agent shall have no duties or obligations hereunder except
those specifically set forth herein and such duties and obligations shall be
determined solely by the express provisions of this Agreement and no duties
shall be implied. The Escrow Agent shall have no liability under and no duty
to inquire as to the provisions of any agreement other than this Agreement. In
connection with its duties hereunder, the Escrow Agent shall be protected in
acting or refraining from acting upon any written notice, request, consent,
certificate, order, affidavit, letter, telegram or other document furnished to
it hereunder and reasonably believed by it to be genuine and to have been
signed or sent by the proper party or parties, and the Escrow Agent shall not
be liable for anything it may do or refrain from doing in connection with its
duties hereunder, except to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction
determines that the Escrow Agents gross negligence or willful misconduct was
the primary cause of any loss to the parties. In the administration of the
Escrow Account, the Escrow Agent may execute any of its powers and perform its
duties hereunder directly or through agents or attorneys (and shall be liable
only for the careful selection of any such agent or attorney) and may consult
with counsel, accountants and other skilled persons to be selected and
retained by it.

(b) In the event the Escrow Agent shall be uncertain as to its duties or
rights under this Agreement or shall receive any instruction, claim or demand
that, in the opinion of the Escrow Agent, is in conflict with the provisions
of this Agreement (any of the foregoing, an "Escrow Agent Dispute"), the
Escrow Agent shall be entitled to refrain from taking any action with respect
to such Escrow Agent Dispute and its sole obligation shall be to keep safely
all property held under the terms of this Agreement until it shall be directed
otherwise by a final and nonappealable order of a court of competent
jurisdiction or by an instrument signed by both Parties. In the event of any
Escrow Agent Dispute, the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to petition a court
of competent jurisdiction in the State of Delaware to resolve such Escrow
Agent Dispute, and each of the Parties consent to the jurisdiction of any
such court with respect to any such Escrow Agent Dispute.

(c) The Escrow Agent shall be reimbursed for all reasonable fees and out-of
pocket expenses, including without limitation those fees set forth on
_Schedule IV_ hereto and reasonable outside counsel fees and other out-of-
pocket disbursements, incurred by the Escrow Agent in connection with the
performance of its duties and obligations under this Agreement (all 



 

8  such fees, expenses and disbursements are collectively referred to herein as
the "Escrow Agent Fees and Expenses"). Each of Parent and the Stakeholders
Representative shall be responsible for fifty percent (50%) of all Escrow
Agent Fees and Expenses. The Parties shall be jointly and severally liable for
the payment of all Escrow Agent Fees and Expenses, except for those incurred
by the Escrow Agent due to (i) the failure of a Party to comply with any of
its obligations hereunder or (ii) the requirement by an Escrow Party that the
Escrow Agent perform duties outside the scope of this Agreement, which Escrow
Agent Fees and Expenses set forth in the immediately preceding clause (i)
shall be paid by the non-complying Escrow Party and which Escrow Agent Fees
and Expenses set forth in the immediately preceding clause (ii) shall be paid
by the Escrow Party that caused the Escrow Agent to perform duties outside
the scope of this Agreement.

(d) The Escrow Agent may resign at any time by giving at least thirty (30)
days prior written notice to the Parties or the Parties may, by joint written
notice to the Escrow Agent, request the resignation of the Escrow Agent, which
resignation in either case shall become effective upon the acceptance of
appointment by a successor escrow agent as provided in this _Section 8(d)_.
The Parties shall appoint a successor escrow agent. If a successor escrow
agent shall not have been appointed within twenty (20) days after such notice
of resignation, the Escrow Agent or any Party may apply to any court of
competent jurisdiction to appoint a successor escrow agent. The Escrow Agents
sole responsibility after such thirty (30) day notice period expires shall be
to hold the Escrow Fund (without any obligation to reinvest the same) and to
deliver the same to the successor escrow agent, if any, or in accordance with
the directions of a final order or judgment of a court of competent
jurisdiction, at which time of delivery the Escrow Agents obligations
hereunder shall cease and terminate, subject to the provisions of _Sections 7
and 15_ hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any successor escrow agent
shall be a financial institution organized under the laws of the United
States of America and having a combined capital and surplus of not less than
Two Hundred Fifty Million Dollars ($250,000,000). Any successor escrow agent,
however appointed, shall execute and deliver to the predecessor Escrow Agent,
with a copy to each of the Parties, an instrument accepting such appointment,
and thereupon such successor escrow agent shall, without further act, become
fully vested with all the rights, powers, obligations and duties of
the predecessor Escrow Agent hereunder with the same effect as if originally
named the escrow agent herein. The Escrow Agent shall have the right to
withhold an amount equal to any amount due and owing to the Escrow Agent, plus
any reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the Escrow Agent in connection
with termination of this Agreement.

9\. _Patriot Act Disclosure_. Section 326 of the Uniting and Strengthening
America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct
Terrorism Act of 2001 ("USA PATRIOT Act") requires the Escrow Agent to
implement reasonable procedures to verify the identity of any person that
opens a new account with it. Accordingly, the parties acknowledge that Section
326 of the USA PATRIOT Act and the Escrow Agents identity verification
procedures require the Escrow Agent to obtain information that may be used to
confirm the parties identities, including, without limitation, name, address
and organizational documents ("identifying information"). The Parties agree to
provide the Escrow Agent with and consent to the Escrow Agent obtaining from
third parties any such identifying information required as a 



 

9  condition of opening an account with or using any service provided by the
Escrow Agent.

10\. _Indemnification_. The Parties shall jointly and severally indemnify,
defend and hold harmless the Escrow Agent and its directors, officers, agents
and employees (the "indemnitees") from any loss, claim, liability or expense
incurred by the Escrow Agent (including the reasonable fees of outside counsel
and other out-of-pocket disbursements) arising out of or in connection with
(a) its performance of this Agreement, except to the extent that such loss,
liability or expense is due to the gross negligence or willful misconduct of
any such indemnitees, or (b) its following any instructions or other
directions from the Parties that have been given in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
in no event shall the Escrow Agent be liable for special, incidental,
indirect, consequential or punitive loss or damage of any kind whatsoever
(including but not limited to lost profits), even if the Escrow Agent has been
advised of the likelihood of such loss or damage and regardless of the form of
action. The Parties acknowledge that the indemnities set forth in this
_Section 10_ shall survive the resignation or removal of the Escrow Agent and
the termination of this Agreement. The Parties hereby grant the Escrow Agent a
lien on, right of set-off against and security interest in the Escrow
Fund for the payment of any claim for indemnification, compensation, expenses
and amounts due hereunder.

11\. _Successor Corporations_. Any corporation into which the Escrow Agent in
its individual capacity may be merged or converted or with which it may be
consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger, conversion or
consolidation to which the Escrow Agent in its individual capacity shall be a
party, or any corporation to which substantially all the corporate trust
business of the Escrow Agent in its individual capacity may be transferred,
shall constitute the Escrow Agent under this Agreement without further act.

12\. _Reliance_. The Escrow Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or
not taken by it in accordance with the direction or consent of the Parties or
their respective agents, representatives, successors, or assigns that have
been given in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. The Escrow Agent
shall not be liable for acting or refraining from acting upon any notice,
request, consent, direction, requisition, certificate, order, affidavit,
letter, or other paper or document believed by it to be genuine and correct
and to have been signed or sent by the proper person or persons, without
further inquiry into the persons or persons authority. Concurrent with the
execution of this Escrow Agreement, the Parties shall deliver to the Escrow
Agent an authorized signers list in the form of _Schedule V_ to this
Agreement.

13\. _Force Majeure_. In the event that the Escrow Agent is unable to perform
its obligations under the terms of this Agreement because of acts of God,
war, terrorism, floods, electrical outages, strikes, equipment or transmission
failure or damage reasonably beyond its control or other cause reasonably
beyond its control, the Escrow Agent shall not be liable for damages to the
Parties for any unforeseeable damages resulting from such failure to perform
or otherwise from such causes. In such event, performance by the Escrow Agent
under this Agreement shall resume when the Escrow Agent is able to perform
substantially its duties.



 

10 14\. _Compliance with Court Orders_. In the event that any escrow property
shall be attached, garnished or levied upon by any court order, or the
delivery thereof shall be stayed or enjoined by an order of a court, or any
order, judgment or decree shall be made or entered by any court order
affecting the property deposited under this Agreement, the Escrow Agent is
hereby expressly authorized, in its sole discretion, to obey and comply with
all writs, orders or decrees so entered or issued, which it is advised by
legal counsel of its own choosing is binding upon it, whether with or without
jurisdiction, and in the event that the Escrow Agent obeys or complies with
any such writ, order or decree it shall not be liable to any of the parties
hereto or to any other person, entity, firm or corporation, by reason of
such compliance notwithstanding such writ, order or decree being subsequently
reversed, modified, annulled, set aside or vacated.

15\. _Term_. This Agreement shall continue in full force and effect until all
cash and other assets comprising the Escrow Funds have been distributed or
released in accordance with Section 6 hereof.

ARTICLE 6 NOTICES

6.1 Notices.

(a) Except as otherwise specifically provided herein or required by law, all
notices required to be given to any stockholder, director, officer, employee
or agent, shall be in writing and may in every instance be effectively given
by hand delivery to the recipient thereof, by depositing such notice in the
mails, postage paid, or by sending such notice by means of
electronic transmission. Any such notice shall be addressed to such
stockholder, director, officer, employee, or agent at his or her last known
address as the same appears on the books of the corporation. The time when
such notice is received, if hand delivered, or dispatched, if delivered
through the mails or by electronic transmission, shall be the time of the
giving of the notice.

(b) Notice given pursuant to this section shall be deemed given by electronic
transmission: (1) if by facsimile telecommunication, when directed to a number
at which the stockholder or director has consented to receive notice; (2) if
by electronic mail, when directed to an electronic mail address at which the
stockholder or director has consented to receive notice; (3) if by a posting
on an electronic network together with separate notice to the stockholder
or director of such specific posting, upon the later of (A) such posting and
(B) the giving of such separate notice; and (4) if by any other form of
electronic transmission, when directed to the stockholder or director. An
affidavit of the Secretary or other agent of the corporation that the notice
has been given by a form of electronic transmission shall, in the absence of
fraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein.

6.2 Waivers. A written waiver of any notice, signed by a stockholder,
director, officer, employee or agent, whether before of after the time of the
event for which notice is to be given, shall be deemed equivalent to the
notice required to be given to such stockholder, director, officer, employee
or agent. Neither the business nor the purpose of any meeting need be
specified in such a waiver.

Section 145 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware, as the same may be
amended and supplemented, indemnify any and all persons whom it shall have
power to indemnify under said section from and against any and all of the

exclusive of any other rights to which those indemnified may be entitled under
any bylaw, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or
otherwise, both as to action in his or her official capacity and as to action
in another capacity while holding such office, and shall continue as to a
person who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and shall
inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a
person.
