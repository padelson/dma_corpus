Statement, including the Revised Adjustment Amount (or any

employees and representatives of Purchaser reasonably requested by Sellers to
evaluate and assess the calculation of the Revised Adjustment Amount, Revised

(c) Within thirty (30) days following receipt of the Revised Statement,
Sellers shall deliver to Purchaser in writing either their (i) agreement as

such dispute, (B) each item of the Revised Statement with which Sellers
disagree, (C) the bases for each such disagreement and (D) Sellers
calculation of the proper amount of each such disputed item (a " _Dispute

notice to Purchaser, Purchaser and Sellers shall attempt in good faith to
resolve any such dispute and finally determine the final Adjustment Amount,
Revised Closing Cash, Revised Closing Indebtedness and Revised Trayport
Transaction Expenses (if any). If, at the end of such thirty (30)-day period,
Purchaser and Sellers have failed to reach an agreement with respect to the
final Adjustment Amount, the matter shall be submitted to KPMG LLP, which
shall act as arbitrator solely with respect to determining the disputed items.
If KPMG LLP is unable to serve, Purchaser and Sellers shall jointly select
another nationally recognized accounting firm that is not the independent
auditor for either Sellers or Purchaser and is otherwise neutral and impartial
to act as such arbitrator; _provided_ , _however_ , that if Sellers and
Purchaser are unable to select such other accounting firm within thirty (30)
days after delivery of a Dispute Notice, each of Purchaser and Sellers shall
cause its respective selected nationally recognized accounting firm to select
another firm meeting the requirements set forth above or a neutral and
impartial certified public accountant with significant relevant experience to
act as such arbitrator. The accounting firm or accountant so selected shall be
referred to herein as the " _Accountant_." The Accountant shall determine the
final Adjustment Amount, final Closing Cash, final Closing Indebtedness and
final Trayport Transaction Expenses (if any) in accordance with the terms and
conditions of this Agreement. In making its determinations, the Accountant
shall not assign a value to any disputed item that is greater than the highest
value attributed to such item, or that is less than the lowest value
attributed to such disputed item, in the Revised Statement and the Dispute
Notice, respectively. The Accountant shall deliver to Sellers and Purchaser,
as promptly as practicable and in any event within thirty (30) days after its
appointment, a written report setting forth the resolution of the final
Adjustment Amount, final Closing Cash, final Closing Indebtedness and final
Trayport Transaction Expenses (if any). Such report shall be final and binding
upon the Parties to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law and may be
enforced in any court having jurisdiction. Each of Purchaser and Sellers
shall bear all the fees and costs incurred by it in connection with this
arbitration, except that all fees and expenses relating to the foregoing work
by the Accountant shall be borne by Purchaser, on the one hand, and Sellers,
on the other hand, in inverse proportion as they may prevail on the matters
resolved by the Accountant, which proportionate allocation will also be
determined by the Accountant and be included in the Accountants
written report.

 



19 (d) On the fifth (5th) Business Day after Purchaser and Sellers agree to the
final Adjustment Amount, final Closing Cash, final Closing Indebtedness and
final Trayport Transaction Expenses (if any) (or after Purchaser and Sellers
receive notice of any final determination of the final Adjustment Amount,
final Closing Cash, final Closing Indebtedness and final Trayport Transaction
Expenses (if any) pursuant to the procedures set forth in _Section 3.7(c)_),
then:

 

(i) (A) if the final Adjustment Amount shall exceed the Estimated Adjustment
Amount, then Purchaser shall pay to Sellers an amount of cash in dollars
equal to such excess and (B) if the Estimated Adjustment Amount shall exceed
the final Adjustment Amount, then Sellers shall pay to Purchaser an amount of
cash in dollars equal to such excess;

 

(ii) (A) if the final Closing Cash shall exceed the Estimated Closing Cash,

Closing Cash, then Sellers shall pay to Purchaser an amount of cash in dollars
equal to such excess;

 

(iii) (A) if the Estimated Closing Indebtedness shall exceed the final Closing
Indebtedness, then Purchaser shall pay to Sellers an amount of cash in
dollars equal to such excess and (B) if the final Closing Indebtedness shall
exceed the Estimated Closing Indebtedness, then Sellers shall pay to Purchaser
an amount of cash equal to such excess;

 

(iv) (A) if the Estimated Trayport Transaction Expenses shall exceed the final
Trayport Transaction Expenses, then Purchaser shall pay to Sellers an amount
of cash in dollars equal to such excess and (B) if the final Trayport
Transaction Expenses shall exceed the Estimated Trayport Transaction Expenses,
then Sellers shall pay to Purchaser an amount of cash in dollars equal to
such excess; and

in each of cases (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv), plus interest on such amount from
the Closing Date up to but excluding the date on which such payment is made
at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate as of the Closing Date,
calculated on the basis of a year of three-hundred sixty (360) days and the
actual number of days elapsed. Any such payment shall be made by federal
funds wire transfer of immediately available dollars (with amounts denominated
in currencies other than dollars being converted to dollars in accordance with
_Section 1.2(d)_) to the account(s) of the Party entitled to receive such
payment, which account(s) shall be identified by Purchaser to Sellers or by
Sellers to Purchaser, as the case may be, not less than two (2) Business Days
prior to the date such payment would be due.

 

SECTION 3.8 _Withholding_. The Purchaser will be entitled to deduct and
withhold, or cause to be deducted and withheld, from any amounts payable
pursuant to or as contemplated by this Agreement any withholding Taxes or
other amounts required under the Code or any applicable Law to be deducted and
withheld. The Purchaser and the Sellers hereby acknowledge that, absent a
change in applicable Law after the date hereof, provided that Sellers have
satisfied their obligations under _Section 3.4_, the Purchaser shall not
deduct or withhold any U.S. federal Taxes or U.K. Taxes from the payment of
the Closing Payment under _Section 3.3_ of

 



20  this Agreement. In any case where such withholding or deduction is required,
the Purchaser shall use reasonable efforts to provide notice to the Sellers at
least ten (10) Business Days prior to withholding any amount pursuant to this
_Section 3.8_, and the parties shall use reasonable efforts to reduce or
avoid such withholding where possible. To the extent that any such amounts are
so deducted or withheld, such amounts will be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made. The Sellers and the Purchaser shall
cooperate in completing any procedural formalities necessary for
the Purchaser to obtain authorization to make payments under this Agreement
without any withholding or deduction for or on account of Tax. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, any compensatory amounts subject
to payroll reporting and withholding payable pursuant to or as contemplated
by this Agreement shall be payable in accordance with the payroll procedures
of the applicable Trayport Company.

(a) From the date hereof until the earlier of the Closing and termination of
this Agreement in accordance with its terms, subject to applicable Law, (i)
Sellers shall, and shall cause the Trayport Companies to, permit Purchaser and
its agents and representatives to have reasonable access, during regular
business hours and upon reasonable advance notice for purposes
reasonably consistent with this Agreement, to their respective properties,
premises, facilities, employees and representatives and books and records of
the Trayport Companies (and the Sellers, to the extent related to the Sale),
and (ii) Sellers shall, and shall cause the Trayport Companies to, direct
their respective employees, agents and representatives and shall cause their
respective employees, agents and representatives, to cooperate fully with
Purchaser and its agents and representatives to the extent related to the
Sale; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing herein shall obligate Sellers or
their Affiliates to take any actions that would (A) unreasonably interrupt the
normal course of their businesses or (B) result in any waiver of attorney-
client privilege or violate any Laws or the terms of any Contract to which
Sellers or their Affiliates is a party or to which any of their respective
assets are subject; _provided_ , _however_ , that Sellers shall give notice
to Purchaser of the fact that it is withholding information or documents
pursuant to this clause (B) and Sellers shall use their reasonable best
efforts to cause such information or

  



45  documents to be provided in a manner that would not reasonably be expected
to waive such privilege or result in such a violation. Purchaser shall comply,
and shall cause its representatives to comply, with all safety, health and
security rules applicable to the premises being visited. In each case,
Purchaser and its agents and representatives shall comply with the
confidentiality obligations contained herein.

 

(b) Each Party hereto shall preserve and keep all books and records and all
information relating to the accounting, business and financial affairs that
are retained by Sellers or their Affiliates or obtained by Purchaser
hereunder, as the case may be, which information relates to the Trayport
Companies prior to the Closing, for five (5) years after the Closing Date, or
for any longer period as may be (i) required by any Governmental Authority or
(ii) reasonably necessary with respect to the prosecution or defense of any
legal action that is then pending or threatened or audit and with respect to
which the requesting Party has notified the other Party as to the need to
retain such books, records or information. Notwithstanding the foregoing
provisions of this _Section 6.2(b)_, the provisions of _Article VIII_ shall
govern the preservation, retention and sharing of Tax Returns and Tax work
papers. After the Closing Date, Purchaser, on the one hand, and Sellers and
GFI, on the other hand, shall, and shall cause their Affiliates, including in
the case of Purchaser, the Trayport Companies, to permit the other Parties,
their Affiliates and their representatives to have reasonable access to, and
to inspect and copy, all materials referred to in this _Section 6.2(b)_ and
to meet with officers and employees of such other Parties on a mutually
convenient basis during normal business hours to obtain explanations with
respect to such materials, to obtain additional information in connection with
the preparation of any financial statements or Tax Returns of such other
Parties or their Affiliates.

(c) _Confidentiality_.

 

(i) All information provided or obtained in connection with the Sale
(including pursuant to subsection (a) above) will be held by Purchaser in
accordance with the Non-Disclosure Agreement, dated May 6, 2015, between
Purchaser and GFI and amended on August 7, 2015 (as amended, the " _Non-
Disclosure Agreement_ "). In the event of a conflict or inconsistency between
the terms of this Agreement and the Non-Disclosure Agreement, the terms of
this Agreement will govern. GFI hereby assigns in part, effective as of
Closing, to Purchaser or the Trayport Companies, as specified by Purchaser,
the rights that GFI or its Affiliates may have under any other
confidentiality agreements entered into with respect to any potential
alternative transaction similar to the Sale, to the extent assignment is
permitted thereby only to the extent that such rights relate to (i) the
confidentiality obligations of the counterparty to such agreements with
respect to the Trayport Companies and/or (ii) the non-solicitation and/or non-
hire obligations of the counterparty to such agreements with respect to the
Trayport Companies.

(ii) Each Seller acknowledges that the success of the Trayport Companies and
the Business after the Closing depends upon the continued preservation of the
confidentiality of certain information possessed by such Persons and their
Affiliates, that the preservation of the confidentiality of such information
by such Persons and their Affiliates is an essential premise of the bargain
between Sellers and Purchaser, and that Purchaser would be unwilling to enter
into this Agreement in the absence of this

 



46   _Section 6.2(c)(ii)_. Accordingly, each Seller shall not, and shall
procure that its representatives, Affiliates and Affiliates representatives
will not, directly or indirectly, without the prior written consent of
Purchaser, disclose to a third party, any information involving or relating to
the Business or any Trayport Company; _provided_ , that the information
subject to this _Section 6.2(c)(ii)_ will not include any information that
(A) is or becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of
a disclosure in violation hereof; (B) is or becomes available to such Person
on a non-confidential basis from a source so long as such Person does not
know or have reason to believe that the source was prohibited by a
contractual, legal, or fiduciary obligation to any Trayport Company from
disclosing such information; (C) is independently developed, conceived,
or discovered by such Person; _provided_ , _further_ , that the provisions of
this _Section 6.2(c)(ii)_ will not prohibit any retention of copies of
records or disclosure (I) required by any applicable Law so long as
prior notice, when reasonably practicable, is given to Purchaser of such
disclosure and a reasonable opportunity is afforded Purchaser to contest the
same at Purchasers sole cost and expense (it being agreed that the disclosure
of financial or other information regarding the Trayport Companies as
required by GFIs or BGCPs public reporting obligations, shall not require
any prior notice or right of Purchaser to contest); _provided_ that if, in the
absence of a protective order, GFI, each Seller, their Affiliates and their
Affiliates representatives, as applicable, is, in the opinion of counsel
(which may be internal counsel), compelled as a matter of law to disclose such
information, such Person may disclose only that part of the information as
required to be disclosed, (II) made in connection with the defense of any
claim or enforcement of any right or remedy relating to this Agreement or the
Sale, or (III) if requested by any Governmental Authority having jurisdiction
over such Person or (D) relates to Sellers or any of their respective
Affiliates status as a customer of the Business or becomes available to
Sellers or any of their respective Affiliates in such persons capacity as a
customer of the Business.

SECTION 6.3 _Efforts; Filings_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of GFI,
Sellers and Purchaser shall use their reasonable best efforts to take, agree
to take, or cause to be taken, any and all actions and to do, or cause to be
done, any and all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law
or otherwise, including taking actions to avoid the imposition of an Order
preventing or delaying the consummation of the Sale, so as to, as promptly as
practicable, consummate the Sale, and each shall, and shall cause its
respective Affiliates to, cooperate fully to that end. Subject to _Section
6.2_ and the Non-Disclosure Agreement, each Party shall (i) permit the other
Parties to review and discuss in advance, and consider in good faith the views
of the other Parties in connection with, any proposed written (or any material
proposed oral) communication with any Governmental Authority regarding the
Sale and (ii) promptly inform the other Parties (and if in writing, provide
the other Parties or their counsel with copies of) all correspondence, filings
and communications between the Party and any Governmental Authority regarding
the Sale. The Parties may, as each deems advisable and necessary, reasonably
designate any competitively sensitive material provided to the other Parties
under this _Section 6.3_ as "outside counsel only." Such materials and the
information contained therein shall be given only to the outside legal counsel
of the recipient and will not be disclosed by such outside counsel to
employees, officers or directors of the recipient unless 

 



47  express permission is obtained in advance from the source of the materials
(Purchaser or Sellers, as the case may be) or its legal counsel; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that materials provided pursuant to this _Section 6.3_ may be
redacted (A) to remove references concerning the valuation of the Trayport
Companies, (B) as necessary to comply with contractual arrangements, or (C) as
necessary to address reasonable legal privilege concerns.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in _Section 6.3(a)_, Purchaser
shall not be required to (and Sellers shall not and shall not permit the
Trayport Companies to) (i) agree to sell, divest, hold separate, license or
otherwise dispose of assets or businesses of Purchaser or its Subsidiaries or
Affiliates (including the Trayport Companies) (each, a " _Divestiture_ ") or
(ii) otherwise take or commit to take actions (each, an " _Action_ ") that
after the Closing Date would limit the Purchasers or its Subsidiaries
or Affiliates (including the Trayport Companies) freedom of action with
respect to, or its ability to retain, one or more of its or its Subsidiaries
(which term shall include the Trayport Companies) or Affiliates
businesses, product lines or assets, in each case, in order to avoid the
entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any injunction, temporary
restraining order or other order in any suit or proceeding that would
otherwise have the effect of preventing or materially delaying the Closing;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Purchaser shall be required to agree to such
Divestitures or Actions pursuant to this _Section 6.3_, if such Divestitures
or Actions (individually or in the aggregate) relate only to the Trayport
Entities and would not be reasonably likely to reduce (A) the combined annual
revenues of the Trayport Entities by twenty million ($20 million) or more or
(B) the combined annual EBITDA of the Trayport Entities by ten million
dollars ($10 million) or more, in each case in any twelve month period;
_provided_ , _further_ , that the consummation of any such Divestiture or
Action shall be contingent upon the consummation of the Sale.
Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 6.3_, Purchaser shall not be
required to initiate or defend any litigation with regard to any Order issued
or requested by a Governmental Authority.

 

(c) No Party shall participate in any meeting with any Governmental Authority
in connection with this Agreement (or make oral submissions at meetings or in
telephone or other conversations) unless it consults with the other Parties in
advance and, to the extent not prohibited by such Governmental Authority,
gives the other Parties the opportunity to attend and participate thereat.

 

(d) Each of Sellers and Purchaser agrees to, and to cause their respective
Affiliates to, use their respective reasonable best efforts to prepare all
documentation, to effect all filings and to obtain all permits, consents,
clearances, approvals and authorizations of all Governmental Authorities and
other Persons necessary to consummate the Sale (or permit the Business to be
operated in the same manner following the Sale) as promptly as practicable,
in particular, each Party shall, and shall procure that its Subsidiaries and
Affiliates (including the Trayport Companies) will, as promptly as
practicable, provide the other Parties all such assistance and information as
may reasonably be required. In furtherance and not in limitation of the
foregoing, (i) each of Sellers and Purchaser agree to make an appropriate
filing of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the Hart-Scott-Rodino
Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (" _HSR Act_ ") with respect to
Sellers receipt of the Aggregate Share Consideration as promptly as
practicable, and in any event within ten (10) Business Days after the
execution of this Agreement, and to take all other actions necessary to cause
the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR
Act (the " _HSR Approval_ ") as soon 

 



48  as practicable, and (ii) Purchaser agrees to submit advanced draft
notifications with any applicable Governmental Authority listed in _Section
6.3(d)_ of the Purchaser Disclosure Letter as promptly as practicable, and in
any event within ten (10) Business Days after the execution of this Agreement.
If the Parties receive any request for information or documentary materials
from any Governmental Authority, the Parties will use their respective
reasonable best efforts to respond to such request as promptly as possible and
counsel for the Parties will reasonably cooperate during the entirety of any
such process. Purchaser shall be responsible for all filing fees under the
HSR Act and other Regulatory Laws applicable to the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.

(e) Purchaser shall not, and shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries or
Affiliates to, acquire or agree to acquire by merging or consolidating with,
or by purchasing a substantial portion of the assets of or equity in, or by
any other manner, any business or any corporation, partnership, association
or other business organization or division thereof, or otherwise acquire or
agree to acquire any assets or take any other action if the entering into of a
definitive agreement relating to the consummation of such acquisition,
merger, consolidation or other action could reasonably be expected to (i)
impose any significant delay in the obtaining of or significantly increase the
risk of not obtaining, any authorizations, consents, orders, declarations
or approvals of any Governmental Authority necessary to consummate the Sale
or the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period, (ii)
significantly increase the risk of any Governmental Authority entering an
order prohibiting the consummation of the Sale, (iii) significantly increase
the risk of not being able to remove any such order on appeal or otherwise, or
(iv) significantly delay or prevent the consummation of the Sale.

 

SECTION 6.4 _Non-Competition_.

 

(a) From the Closing Date until the two-year anniversary thereof, without the
prior written consent of Purchaser, and subject to  _Section 6.4(b)_,
Sellers shall not, and shall procure that their Subsidiaries will not,
directly or indirectly, own, control, manage or operate any business that
provides software (and related support, hosting and maintenance) to
operate trading networks connecting brokers, traders and/or exchanges for the
power, natural gas, coal, emissions, freight, oil and iron ore markets in
Europe, in each case substantially as conducted at Closing by the Trayport
Companies (a " _Competing Business_ ").

(b) Nothing in _Section 6.4(a)_ shall preclude Sellers or any of their
Affiliates from: 

(i) collectively owning ten percent (10%) or less of the outstanding
securities of any Person;

 

(ii) acquiring and, after such acquisition, owning an interest in any Person
(or its successor) that, together with its Subsidiaries, is engaged, directly
or indirectly, in a Competing Business if such Competing Business generated
less than ten percent (10%) of such Persons consolidated annual revenues in
the last completed fiscal year of such Person;

  



49 (iii) acquiring and, after such acquisition, owning an interest in any Person
(or its successor) that, together with its Subsidiaries, is engaged, directly
or indirectly, in a Competing Business if such Competing Business generated
more than ten percent (10%), but less than twenty percent (20%), of such
Persons consolidated annual revenues in the last completed fiscal year of
such Person; _provided_ that Sellers shall enter into a definitive agreement
to cause the divestiture of the Competing Business within one (1) year after
the consummation of such acquisition and has completed such disposition
within eighteen (18) months of the date of such definitive agreement (the "
_Divestiture Period_ "); _provided_ , _further_ , that if such divestiture has
not been consummated due to (x) any applicable waiting period (including
extension thereof) applicable to such divestiture under any Regulatory Law, or
under any other applicable Law not having expired or been terminated, or (y)
the failure to procure or obtain any required governmental or regulatory
consents, approvals, permits or authorizations applicable to such divestiture,
then the Divestiture Period will automatically be extended so that it expires
one (1) week following the later of the expiration or termination of such
waiting period and the procurement or obtainment of such consents, approvals,
permits and authorizations; _provided_ that in no event shall the Divestiture
Period extend beyond thirty (30) months following the acquisition of the
Competing Business;

(iv) engaging in any activity that constitutes an immaterial, or non-
recurring inadvertent, breach or violation of its obligations pursuant to
_Section 6.4(a)_; _provided_ that, upon receiving notice of any such breach,
the breaching party promptly ceases the activity causing such breach; and

 

(v) directly or indirectly, conducting or engaging in any brokerage business,
trading business and/or an exchange, or owning, controlling, managing or
operating any business that such Person (other than the Trayport Companies)
owns, controls, manages or operates as of the date hereof.

 

(c) GFI and Sellers acknowledge and agree that the remedy at law for any
breach, or threatened breach, of any of the provisions of  _Section 6.4(a)_
will be inadequate, and, accordingly, Sellers hereby acknowledge and agree
that Purchaser shall be entitled to equitable relief, including injunctive
relief, and to the remedy of specific performance with respect to any breach
or threatened breach of _Section 6.4(a)_.

(d) Sellers and Purchaser agree that the terms of the covenants in  _Section
6.4(a)_, as modified by _Section 6.4(b)_ are fair and reasonable with respect
to their duration, geographical area and scope, including in light of
Purchasers plans for the Trayport Companies, are necessary to protect the
value of the Trayport Companies (including the goodwill related thereto) and
were a material and necessary inducement for Purchaser and Sellers to agree to
the Sale. If any provision contained in _Section 6.4(a)_, as modified by
_Section 6.4(b)_ shall be determined by any court of competent jurisdiction
or any Governmental Authority to be unenforceable for any reason whatsoever
(including in relation to duration, geographic area or the scope of the
activities covered thereby), then the Parties agree that the maximum subject
matter, duration, scope, geographic area or other restrictions deemed
reasonable under such circumstances by such court shall be substituted for the
stated subject matter, duration, scope, geographic area or other
restrictions, with it being specifically acknowledged and agreed by Purchaser,
GFI and Sellers that it is their continuing desire that each covenant in
_Section 6.4(a)_, as modified by  _Section 6.4(b)_, be enforced to the full
extent of its terms and conditions.

 



50 (e) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Sellers ownership of
shares of Purchaser Common Stock shall not constitute a breach of this
_Section 6.4_.

SECTION 6.5 _Further Assurances_. After the Closing Date, each of GFI and
Sellers and Purchaser shall use their commercially reasonable efforts from
time to time to do, make, execute and deliver, or cause to be done, made,
executed and delivered, at the reasonable request of the other Party, such
further acts, assurances, additional documents and instruments (including any
assignments, bills of sale, assumption agreements, consents and other similar
instruments in addition to those required by this Agreement) as may be
reasonably required to give effect to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, and to provide whatever documents or other evidence of
ownership as may be reasonably requested by Purchaser to confirm Purchasers
ownership of the Trayport Companies.

SECTION 6.6 _Intercompany Agreements; Intercompany Accounts_.

 

(a) Except as set forth in _Section 6.6_ of the Sellers Disclosure Letter or
as otherwise expressly set forth in this Agreement or the Related Agreements,
GFI and Sellers shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to,
immediately prior to the Closing, execute and deliver such releases,
termination agreements and discharges (in forms reasonably acceptable to
Purchaser) as are necessary to release and discharge each Trayport Company
from any and all Liabilities owed to GFI, any Seller or any Affiliate thereof
(other than any Trayport Company). In addition, GFI and Sellers shall, and
shall cause their respective Affiliates to, immediately prior to the Closing,
execute and deliver such releases, termination agreements and discharges (in a
form reasonably acceptable to Purchaser) as are necessary to (i) release and
discharge GFI, each Seller and each Affiliate thereof (other than the
Trayport Companies) from any and all obligations owed to any Trayport Company
that is set forth on _Section 6.6_ of the Sellers Disclosure Letter and (iii)
terminate all arrangements, commitments, contracts and understandings among
any Seller and any Affiliate, on the one hand, and any Trayport Company, on
the other hand that is set forth on _Section 6.6_ of the Sellers Disclosure
Letter.

 

(b) On or prior to the Closing Date, all intercompany accounts between any
Seller and/or any of its Subsidiaries (other than any Trayport Company), on
the one hand, and any Trayport Company, on the other hand, shall be settled or
otherwise eliminated (other than intercompany accounts that (i) constitute
ordinary course trade payables and receivables, (ii) arise out of services
performed within ninety (90) days prior to the Closing pursuant to Contracts
identified in _Section 4.15(a)(xiv)_ of the Sellers Disclosure Letter, (iii)
have not been invoiced as of the Closing Date and (iv) do not, in the
aggregate, exceed one million dollars ($1,000,000), which shall remain
outstanding in accordance with their terms). Intercompany accounts between and
among the Trayport Companies shall not be affected by this provision.

 

SECTION 6.7 _Employee Matters_

 

(a) For the one year period following the Closing Date, Purchaser will
provide, or cause one of its Affiliates to provide, each Business Employee
who is employed as of the

 



51  Closing (each a " _Continuing Employee_ "), for so long as he/she remains
employed with Purchaser or one of its Affiliates (including any Trayport
Company) during such one year period, with (A) base salary at least equal to
the base salary provided to the Continuing Employees immediately prior to the
Closing and (B) benefits (other than equity compensation or defined benefit
pension benefits) that, taken as a whole, are comparable in the aggregate to
those provided to Continuing Employees immediately prior to the Closing.

(b) Except to the extent necessary to avoid the duplication of benefits,
Purchaser shall recognize the service of each Continuing Employee with any
Trayport Company before the Closing Date as if such service had been performed
with Purchaser or its Affiliates (i) for all purposes under the Company
Benefit Plans maintained by Purchaser or its Affiliates after the Closing Date
(to the extent such plans, programs, or agreements are delivered to Continuing
Employees), (ii) for purposes of eligibility and vesting under any employee
benefit plans and programs of Purchaser or its Affiliates other than the
Company Benefit Plans (the " _New Benefit Plans_ ") in which the Continuing
Employee participates after the Effective Time, and (iii) for benefit accrual
purposes under any New Benefit Plan that is a vacation or severance plan in
which the Continuing Employee participates after the Closing Date.

 

(c) With respect to any welfare plan maintained by Purchaser or its Affiliates
in which Continuing Employees are eligible to participate after the Closing,
Purchaser and its Affiliates shall use commercially reasonable efforts to (i)
waive all limitations as to preexisting conditions and exclusions with respect
to participation and coverage requirements applicable to such employees
to the extent such conditions and exclusions were satisfied or did not apply
to such employees under the welfare plans maintained by the Trayport Companies
prior to the Closing and (ii) provide each Continuing Employee with credit for
any co-payments and deductibles paid prior to the Closing in satisfying any
analogous deductible or out-of-pocket requirements to the extent applicable

other action to enforce any provision in this Agreement as an amendment to
any such plan, and (ii) such provision is deemed to be an amendment to such
plan even though not explicitly designated as such in this Agreement, then,

SECTION 6.8 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_.

Company as of the date hereof and anyone who becomes a director or officer of
any Trayport Company during the period from the date of this Agreement through
the Closing (in such capacities) (the " _D andO Indemnified Persons_") for all
acts and omissions occurring at or prior to the Closing to the same extent
such DandO Indemnified Persons are indemnified or have the right to advancement
of expenses as of the date of this Agreement by the Trayport Companies
pursuant to the organizational documents of any applicable Trayport Company as
in existence on the date hereof, in each case, to the fullest extent that such
indemnification and advancement is permitted by applicable Law. Purchaser
shall cause the organizational documents of the Trayport Companies to contain
provisions with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses and
limitation of director and officer liability that are no less favorable to
the DandO Indemnified Persons with respect to acts or omission occurring at or
prior to the Closing than those set forth in the organizational documents of
the Trayport Companies as of the date of this Agreement, which provisions
thereafter shall, subject to applicable Law, not be amended, repealed or
otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely affect the rights
thereunder of any DandO Indemnified Persons for a period of six (6) years
from and after the Closing. From and after the Closing, Purchaser shall cause
the Trayport Companies to honor, in accordance with their respective terms,
each of the covenants contained in this _Section 6.8_.

Purchaser shall cause the Trayport Companies as of or following the Closing
to, purchase a six (6) year prepaid "tail" policy covering those persons
covered by the current policies of directors and officers, employed lawyers
liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by the
Trayport Companies with respect to claims arising from facts or events that
occurred on or before the Closing (including for acts or omissions occurring
in connection with the approval of this Agreement and the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby) (the " _D andO Insurance_"); provided
that the Trayport Companies shall not pay, and the Trayport Companies shall
not be required to pay, for such "tail" policy more than 300% of the
current annual premium paid by the Trayport Companies for such DandO Insurance.
If such DandO Insurance has been obtained by Sellers or the Trayport Companies
prior to the Closing, Purchaser shall cause such DandO Insurance to be
maintained in full force and effect, for its full term, and cause all
obligations thereunder to be honored by the Trayport Companies. If Sellers or
the Trayport Companies shall for any reason fail to obtain such "tail" policy,
the Trayport Companies or Purchaser shall maintain for a period of six years
after the Closing such DandO Insurance (provided that the Trayport Companies or
Purchaser (or any successor) may substitute therefor policies of at least the
same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions which are, in the
aggregate, no less advantageous to the insured); _provided_ that in no event
shall the Trayport Companies or Purchaser be required to pay in any one year
more than 200% of the current annual premium paid by the Trayport Companies
for such DandO Insurance; _provided_ , _further_ ,

 



53  that if the annual premiums of such DandO Insurance exceed such amount, the
Trayport Companies or Purchaser shall be obligated to obtain a policy with the
greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding such amount.

assigns (i) shall consolidate with or merge into any other Person and shall
not be the continuing or surviving corporation or other entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) shall transfer all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, in each such case, proper
provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Purchaser or
the Trayport Companies, as the case may be, shall assume all of the
obligations set forth in this _Section 6.8_.

 

(d) The obligations of Purchaser, the Trayport Companies and any successors
thereto under this _Section 6.8_ shall not be terminated or modified in such
a manner as to adversely affect any DandO Indemnified Person to whom this
_Section 6.8_ applies without the consent of such affected DandO Indemnified
Person (it being expressly agreed that the DandO Indemnified Persons to whom
this _Section 6.8_ applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this
_Section 6.8_).

 

SECTION 6.9 _Guarantees; Commitments_.

 

(a) Purchaser shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to promptly
substitute itself or have one of its Affiliates to be substituted for Sellers
and any of their Affiliates, and for Sellers and any of their Affiliates to be
released, effective as of the Closing, in respect of all obligations of
Sellers and any of their Affiliates under the London Lease and any guarantees,
indemnities and letters of credit entered into by Sellers or their Affiliates

promptly substitute themselves or have one of their Affiliates be substituted
for the Trayport Companies, and for the Trayport Companies to be released,

into by a Trayport Company and securing any obligation of a Seller or one of
its Affiliates (other than the Trayport Companies) (collectively, the "
_Upstream Guarantees_ ").

 

(c) If, as of the Closing, Purchaser or one of its Affiliates shall not have
substituted itself for Sellers and any of their Affiliates under, and caused
Sellers and their Affiliates to be released from, any Downstream Guarantee,
(i) Purchaser shall continue to use commercially reasonable efforts to cause
itself or one of its Affiliates to be substituted for Sellers and any of
their Affiliates, and for Sellers and any of their Affiliates to be released,
in respect of all obligations of Sellers and any of their respective
Affiliates under any Downstream Guarantee and (ii) Purchaser shall indemnify
and hold harmless Sellers and their Affiliates against any Damages that
Sellers or any of their Affiliates suffer, incur or are liable for by reason
of or arising out of or in consequence of such Downstream Guarantee.

 



54 (d) If, as of the Closing, Sellers or one of their respective Affiliates shall
not have substituted themselves for the Trayport Companies under, and caused
Sellers and their Affiliates to be released from, any Upstream Guarantee, (i)

themselves or one of their respective Affiliates to be substituted for the
Trayport Companies, and for the Trayport Companies to be released, in respect
of all obligations of the Trayport Companies under any Upstream Guarantee and

any Damages that the Trayport Companies suffer, incur or are liable for by
reason of or arising out of or in consequence of such Upstream Guarantee.

Affiliates (including the Trayport Companies) in connection with the
negotiation, execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of

may continue to act as legal counsel to Sellers and their Affiliates after the

privilege attaching to communications between Sellers, Sellers Affiliates or
the Trayport Companies, on the one hand, and WLRK, on the other hand, to the

belong to and be controlled by the Sellers, and following the Closing, none of
Purchaser nor its Affiliates (which Affiliates shall include the Trayport

communications.

sales of inventory in the Ordinary Course) or any similar transaction or any
other alternative to the Sale or (b) participate in any discussions or
negotiations regarding, furnish any information with respect to, assist or
participate in, or facilitate in any other manner, any effort or attempt by
any Person to do or seek any of the foregoing. GFI and Sellers shall,
and shall cause their Affiliates and their and their Affiliates
representatives, to immediately discontinue any conduct that would if
continued after the date hereof violate any aspect of the immediately
preceding sentence.

 

SECTION 6.12 _No Purchaser Stockholder Approval_. Purchaser shall not take any

responsible (and which liability is actually satisfied by the Sellers),
Purchaser, the Trayport Companies or any of their respective Subsidiaries or
Affiliates receives a Tax Benefit, then Purchaser shall pay to Sellers the
amount of such Tax Benefit within fifteen (15) days of filing the Tax Return
in which such Tax Benefit is actually realized or utilized.

 

(b) Sellers shall be entitled to any Tax Benefit arising from any deduction
arising in respect of any Trayport Transaction Expenses that are borne or
paid by Sellers, and Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that it will pay
Sellers the amount of any Tax Benefit that results from such deduction on a
Tax Return of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including the Trayport
Companies) when such Tax Benefit is actually realized or utilized.

SECTION 8.9 _Coordination_. Claims for indemnification with respect to
Taxes shall be governed by this _Article VIII_ and _Section 10.8_ (but not
by any other provision of _Article X_, unless explicitly provided for in this
_Article VIII_).

 

SECTION 8.10 _Tax Treatment of Payments_. Sellers, Purchaser and their
respective Affiliates shall treat any and all payments under this Agreement
(including for breach of warranty or representation) as an adjustment to the
Closing Payment for Tax purposes unless they are required to treat such
payments otherwise by applicable Tax Laws. Accordingly, any reference in
this Agreement to an indemnity in respect of a liability for the Trayport
Entities (or their Subsidiaries) or any obligation of the Parties to make a
payment in respect of the Trayport Entities (or their Subsidiaries) shall be
construed as a reference to a covenant by Seller (for itself and on behalf of
its Affiliates) to pay Purchaser (for itself and on behalf of its Affiliates)
an amount equal to such liability or payment.

 

SECTION 8.11 _Sales and Transfer Taxes_. Purchaser shall pay and be
responsible for all sales, use, value-added, business, goods and services,
transfer, stamp duty (including UK stamp duty), documentary, conveyancing or
similar taxes or expenses that may be imposed as a result of the Sale,
together with any and all penalties, interest and additions to tax with
respect thereto (" _Transfer Taxes_ "), and Sellers and Purchaser shall
cooperate in timely making all filings, returns, reports and forms as may be
required to comply with the provisions of such Tax Laws.

Covenant, dated as of January 31, 2008 (the " _Tax Deed_ ") pursuant to which

(c) Purchaser hereby acknowledges and agrees, on behalf of itself and its
Affiliates, from and after the effective time of the assignment pursuant to
_Section 8.12(b)_, that neither Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates shall be
entitled to or receive any indemnity (under this Agreement or otherwise),
recovery or payment from GFI or Sellers in respect of the Released Tax
Claims, and Purchaser and its Affiliates shall only seek recovery from the
2008 Sellers for such matters. Further, Purchaser, on behalf of itself and its
Affiliates, hereby waives, releases, forever discharges, and agrees not to
sue GFI and the Sellers, or any of their respective equity holders, former
equity holders, Affiliates, related entities, or subsidiaries, and their
respective members, partners, directors, officers, agents, employees,
attorneys, and the predecessors, successors, and assigns of each of them
(collectively, the " _Released Parties_ ") with respect to any claims or
causes of action, whether known or unknown, that Purchaser and its Affiliates
now has, ever had, or will ever have or may allege to have, against the
Released Parties for or related in any way to the Released Tax Claims.

election under any applicable state, local or foreign income Tax law
(collectively, the " _Section 338(h)(10) Election_ ") with respect to
Purchasers purchase of the equity of Trayport Inc, contemplated herein. Such
common parent shall include any income, gain, loss, deduction, or other tax
item resulting from the Section 338(h)(10) Elections on its respective Tax
Returns to the extent required by applicable Law.

TERMINATION

 

SECTION 9.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated and the
transactions contemplated hereby may be abandoned at any time prior to the
Closing:

(a) by the mutual written consent of Purchaser and Sellers;

 



63 (b) (i) by either Purchaser or Sellers, upon written notification of the non-
terminating Party by the terminating Party, if any Order permanently
prohibiting consummation of the Sale shall have been issued and shall have
become final and non-appealable or (ii) by Sellers, upon written notification
of Purchaser by Sellers, if a Governmental Authority issues an Order that
prohibits the consummation of the Sale (other than where such Order is of an
interim or temporary nature), and Purchaser does not seek to overturn such
Order within thirty (30) days of its issuance;  _provided_ , _however_ , that
a Party shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
_Section 9.1(b)_ if the failure by such Party or of any of its Affiliates to
perform any of its material covenants or obligation under this Agreement has
been the cause of, or has resulted in, such Order;

(c) by either Purchaser or Sellers, if the Closing has not occurred by May
15, 2016 or, in the circumstances and as by the date, in each case as detailed
in _Section 9.1(c)_ of the Purchaser Disclosure Letter, if Purchaser elects
to extend such date in writing (the " _Extension Election_ ") (such date, as
it may be so extended, the " _Outside Date_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that
neither Purchaser nor Sellers shall have the right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this  _Section 9.1(c)_ if its (or GFIs, in the case of Sellers)
failure to perform or breach of any of its (or GFIs, in the case of Sellers)
material covenants, representations, warranties or obligations under this
Agreement has been the cause of, or has resulted in, the failure of the Sale
to occur on or before such date;

(d) by Sellers, if Purchaser shall have breached any of its representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement that would
give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in _Section 7.3(a)_ or
_Section 7.3(b)_, which breach cannot be or has not been cured within sixty
(60) Business Days after the giving of written notice by Sellers to Purchaser
specifying such breach (provided that in no event shall such 60 Business Day
period extend beyond the Outside Date and provided that Purchaser is not then
in material breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements contained in this Agreement); or

 

(e) by Purchaser, if Sellers or GFI shall have breached any of their
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in
this Agreement that would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth
in _Section 7.2(a)_ or _Section 7.2(b)_, which breach cannot be or has not
been cured within sixty (60) Business Days after the giving of written
notice by Purchaser to Sellers specifying such breach (provided that in no
event shall such 60 Business Day period extend beyond the Outside Date and
provided that Purchaser is not then in material breach of any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement).

SECTION 9.2 _Purchaser Termination Fee_. Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, in the event that this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to (a) _Section 9.1(b)_, if (i) such Order is
promulgated or requested to be promulgated under or with respect to a
Regulatory Law (other than the HSR Act to the extent applicable to Sellers
acquisition of Purchaser Common Stock) and (ii) at the time of such
termination, the conditions set forth in _Sections 7.2(a)_, _7.2(b)_ and
_7.2(e)_ have been satisfied or waived (other than those conditions which by
their nature could not be satisfied until the Closing, but which conditions at
the time of termination are capable of being satisfied) or (b) _Section
9.1(c)_ if, at the time of such termination, (i) the condition set forth in
_Section 7.1(a)_ (if such Order is promulgated under or

 



64  with respect to a Regulatory Law other than the HSR Act to the extent
applicable to Sellers acquisition of Purchaser Common Stock) or _Section
7.1(b)_ has not been satisfied (except for the lack of HSR Approval to the
extent applicable to Sellers acquisition of Purchaser Common Stock) and (ii)
the conditions set forth in _Sections 7.2(a)_, _7.2(b)_ and _7.2(e)_ have
been satisfied or waived (other than those conditions which by their nature
could not be satisfied until the Closing, but which conditions at the time of
termination were capable of being satisfied), then, in each case Purchaser
shall promptly, but in no event later than two (2) Business Days after the
date of termination of this Agreement, (A) pay by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to accounts designated by Sellers, an amount in cash equal to
twenty five million dollars ($25,000,000), (B) deliver to Sellers evidence of
book-entry shares representing a number of shares of Purchaser Common Stock
equal to (I) fifty million dollars ($50,000,000) _divided by_ (II) the
arithmetic average of the daily intra-day volume-weighted average price of
one share of Purchaser Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange during the
regular trading session (and excluding pre-market and after-hours trading)
over the ten (10) consecutive trading days ending the second (2nd) trading
day prior to the day on which this Agreement is terminated as contemplated in
clause (a) or (b) above, which shares of Purchaser Common Stock shall be free
and clear of all Liens, and (C) deliver a counterpart of the Registration
Rights Agreement duly executed by Purchaser, to Sellers (the " _Purchaser
Termination Fee_ "); _provided_ that if the Extension Fee was previously paid,
the Purchaser Termination Fee shall be deemed paid at the time of such
termination and no further payment shall be required in connection with such
termination. Purchaser acknowledges that the agreement contained in this
_Section 9.2_ is an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and that, without this agreement, the Sellers would not have entered
into this Agreement. Accordingly, if Purchaser fails to promptly pay any
amount due pursuant to this _Section 9.2_, and in order to obtain such
payment, the Sellers commence a suit that results in a judgment against
Purchaser for such payment, Purchaser shall pay to each of the Sellers their
expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) in connection
with such suit, together with interest on the amount of the applicable fee at
the prime lending rate as published in _The Wall Street Journal_ , in effect
on the date such payment is required to be made. Subject to _Section 9.3_ and
the right of specific performance pursuant to _Section 11.13_, the payment
by Purchaser of the Reverse Termination Fee in the circumstances under which
such fee is payable shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Sellers and GFI
for any damages suffered by Sellers, GFI and the Trayport Companies as a
result of the failure of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be
consummated, and upon such payment pursuant to this _Section 9.2 _in the
circumstances under which such fee is payable, Purchaser shall not have any
further liability or obligation related to or arising out of this Agreement.

 

SECTION 9.3 _Effect of Termination_. If this Agreement is terminated, no Party
hereto (or any of its Affiliates, directors, officers, representatives or
agents) will have any liability to any other Party to this Agreement, except
for any liability arising out of any knowing or willful breach of this
Agreement prior to such termination and except for the obligations set forth
in _Section 6.2(c)(i)_, _Section 9.2_ and _Article XI_, which shall survive
termination.

SECTION 10.1 _Survival of Representations and Warranties and Covenants_.

 

(a) The right to commence any claim for indemnification hereunder with respect
to the representations and warranties set forth in  _Article IV_ or in any
certificate delivered hereunder by Sellers shall survive until the date that
is twelve (12) months after the Closing Date. The representations and
warranties set forth in _Article V_ shall not survive beyond the Closing and
there shall be no liability in respect thereof, whether such liability has
accrued prior to or after Closing; _provided_ that the Seller Indemnified
Parties shall have a right to commence any claim for
indemnification hereunder with respect to the representations and warranties
set forth in _Article V,_ or in any certificate delivered hereunder by
Purchaser with respect to such representations and warranties, from the
Closing Date until the latest of (i) the fifteenth (15th) trading day after
Registrable Securities (as defined in the Registration Rights Agreement) are
first subject to an effective registration statement filed by Purchaser with
the SEC and (ii) if a Blackout Period (as defined in the Registration Rights
Agreement) occurs during such fifteen (15) day period, the trading day
immediately after the last day of such Blackout Period. Notwithstanding the
foregoing sentences, the right to commence any claim with respect to the
representations and warranties contained in _Section 4.1_ (Organization and
Good Standing), _Section 4.2(a)_ and _(b)_ (Trayport Entities and
Subsidiaries), _Section 4.3(a)_ and  _(b)_ (Title), _Section 4.4_
(Authorization), _Section 4.7(a)_ (Transactions with Affiliates) and _Section
4.12_ (No Brokers or Finders) (as the same may be confirmed or repeated in any
certificate delivered hereunder) (the " _Seller Fundamental Representations_
") and the representations and warranties contained in _Section 5.1_
(Organization and Good Standing), _Section 5.2_ (Authorization) and _Section
5.12_ (No Brokers or Finders) (as the same may be confirmed or repeated in
any certificate delivered hereunder) (the " _Purchaser Fundamental
Representations_ ") and any claim based on fraud will survive indefinitely;
_provided_ ,  _further_ that the right to commence any claim with respect to
the representations and warranties contained in _Section 4.18_ (Taxes) will
survive until the date that is thirty (30) days following the expiration of
the applicable statute of limitations.

(b) The covenants and agreements that contemplate actions (or inaction) to be
taken (or not taken) after the Closing shall survive in accordance with their
terms. The covenants and agreements that contemplate action (or inaction) to
be taken (or not taken) between the date hereof and the Closing shall survive
until the date that is twelve (12) months after the Closing Date.

(c) Notwithstanding _Section 10.1(a)_ and _Section 10.1(b)_, in the event
written notice of any _bona fide_ claim for indemnification under _Section
10.2(a)_, _Section 10.2(b)_, _Section 10.3(a)_ or _Section 10.3(b)_ shall
have been given in accordance herewith within the applicable survival period
setting forth in reasonable detail the legal and factual basis for such claim
(in light of the facts then known), the indemnification claim shall survive
until such time as such claim is fully and finally resolved. Neither Purchaser
nor Sellers shall have any liability pursuant to this Agreement with respect
to any indemnification claim for a breach of representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement first asserted after the survival period specified for
such representation, warranty, covenant or agreement in _Section 10.1(a)_ or
_Section 10.1(b)_, as applicable.

 



66 SECTION 10.2 _Indemnification of Purchaser_. Subject to _Section10.1_ and 
_Section 10.5_, from and after the Closing Date, Sellers shall, jointly and
severally, indemnify, defend, save and hold harmless Purchaser, its
Affiliates, including, following the Closing each Trayport Company, and their
respective officers, directors, employees, agents and representatives in
their capacities as such (collectively, the " _Purchaser Indemnified Parties_
"), from and against (whether in connection with a Third Party Claim or a
direct claim) any and all Damages to the extent resulting from, arising out
of or relating to:

(a) any breach by Sellers of any representation or warranty under this
Agreement or any certificate delivered pursuant to this Agreement ( _provided_
that, in each case, assuming that all qualifications contained in such
representation or warranty, and the underlying representations and warranties
in this Agreement referred to in any such certificate delivered at Closing,
as to materiality, including each qualifying reference to the phrases
"Business Material Adverse Effect," the words "material" and "materially" and
all similar materiality qualifiers, shall be disregarded, other than with
respect to (i) _Section 4.9_, _Section 4.14(c)_, _Section 4.15(a)_, and
_Section 4.20(c)_ and (ii) representations and warranties requiring lists of
material items); and

(b) the failure by Sellers to perform any of their covenants or agreements
contained in this Agreement.

SECTION 10.3 _Indemnification of Sellers_. Subject to _Section 10.1_ and
_Section 10.5_ hereof, from and after the Closing, Purchaser hereby agrees
to indemnify, defend, save and hold harmless Sellers, their Affiliates,
officers, directors, employees, agents and representatives in their capacities
as such (collectively, the " _Seller Indemnified Parties_ " and together with
the Purchaser Indemnified Parties, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") from and
against (whether in connection with a Third Party Claim or a direct claim) any
and all Damages to the extent resulting from, arising out of or relating to:

(a) any breach by Purchaser of any representation or warranty under
this Agreement ( _provided_ that, in each case, assuming that all
qualifications contained in such representation or warranty, and the
underlying representations and warranties in this Agreement referred to in any
such certificate delivered at Closing, as to materiality, including each
qualifying reference to the phrases "Purchaser Material Adverse Effect," the
words "material" and "materially" and all similar materiality qualifiers,
shall be disregarded other than with respect to (i) _Section 5.6_ and (ii)
representations and warranties requiring lists of material items); and

 

(b) the failure by Purchaser to perform any of its covenants or agreements
contained in this Agreement.

 

SECTION 10.4 _Claims_.

 

(a) _Third Party Claims_. Upon receipt by an Indemnified Party of notice of
any action, suit, proceeding, audit, claim, demand, investigation or
assessment made or brought by an unaffiliated third party (a " _Third Party
Claim_ ") with respect to a matter for which such Indemnified Party is
indemnified under this _Article X_ which has or is expected to give rise to
a claim for Damages, the Indemnified Party shall promptly (but in any event
within ten (10)

 



67  Business Days of receipt of such Third Party Claim), in the case of a
Purchaser Indemnified Party, notify Sellers, and in the case of a Seller
Indemnified Party, notify Purchaser (Sellers or Purchaser, as the case may
be, the " _Indemnifying Party_ "), in writing, indicating the nature of such
Third Party Claim and, to the extent known, the basis therefor; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that any delay or failure by the Indemnified Party to give notice
to the Indemnifying Party shall relieve the Indemnifying Party of its
obligations hereunder only to the extent, if at all, that it is prejudiced by
reason of such delay or failure. Such written notice (a " _Claim Notice_ ")
shall set forth (i) the facts and circumstances giving rise to such claim for
indemnification, to the extent then known by the Indemnified Party, including
copies of all material written evidence thereof, (ii) the nature of the
Damages suffered or incurred or expected to be suffered or incurred, to the
extent then known by the Indemnified Party, (iii) a reference to the
provisions of this Agreement in respect of which such Damages have
been suffered or incurred or are expected to be suffered or incurred, and
(iv) the amount of Damages actually suffered or incurred, to the extent then
known by the Indemnified Party, and, to the extent the Damages have not yet
been suffered or incurred, a good-faith estimate, to the extent then
reasonably estimable, of the amount of Damages that could reasonably be
expected to be suffered or incurred. The Indemnifying Party shall have thirty
(30) days after receipt of the Claim Notice to elect, at its option, to
assume and control the defense of, at its own expense and by its own counsel
(which counsel shall be reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party), any
such Third Party Claim and shall be entitled to assert any and all defenses
available to the Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law so long as (A) the Indemnifying Partys written notice of its
election to assume the defense of such Third Party Claim states that
the Indemnifying Party will, and thereby covenants to, indemnify pursuant to,
and subject to the limitations contained in, this _Article X_ and, (B) the
Indemnified Party has not been advised by counsel that an actual or
potential conflict exists between the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying
Party in connection with the defense of such Third Party Claim and (C) the
Third Party Claim does not relate to any criminal or regulatory enforcement
Proceeding;  _provided_ , that, if the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense
of a Third Party Claim and (x) the Indemnified Party subsequently discovers
that the facts presented at the time the Indemnifying Party assumed control of
the defense were not accurate or incomplete, and (y) the Indemnifying Party
reasonably determines that the new information is reasonably likely to mean
that the Indemnifying Party does not have an indemnification obligation in
respect of such Third Party Claim, then the Indemnifying Party shall provide
the Indemnified Party written notice of the same and shall cooperate with the
Indemnified Party to transfer control back to the Indemnified Party and the
acknowledgement referred to in _clause (A)_ of this sentence shall be null
and void and have no further force or effect. If the Indemnifying Party shall
undertake to compromise or defend any such Third Party Claim, it shall
promptly notify the Indemnified Party of its intention to do so, and the
Indemnified Party agrees to, and to cause its Affiliates to, cooperate with
the Indemnifying Party and its counsel in the compromise of, or defense
against, any such Third Party Claim, including by furnishing non-privileged
books and records, personnel and witnesses, as appropriate for any defense of
such Third Party Claim ; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnifying Party
shall not settle, compromise or discharge, or admit any liability with respect
to, any such Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Party (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld) unless the
relief (I) consists solely of money damages, (II) results in the full and
general release of all Indemnified Parties named in such Third Party Claim
from all liabilities arising or relating to, or in connection with, such Third
Party Claim and (III) involves no finding or admission of

 



68 any fault or violation of applicable Law. Notwithstanding an election to
assume the defense of such action or proceeding, the Indemnified Party shall
have the right to employ separate counsel and to participate in the defense of
such action or proceeding, and the Indemnifying Party shall bear the
reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel if (x) the
Indemnified Party shall have been advised by counsel that a conflict of
interest makes representation by the same counsel or the counsel selected by
the Indemnifying Party inappropriate or (y) the Indemnifying Party shall
have authorized in writing the Indemnified Party to employ separate counsel
at the Indemnifying Partys expense. In any event, the Indemnified Party and
Indemnifying Party and their counsel shall cooperate in the defense of any
Third Party Claim subject to this _Article X_ and keep such Persons informed
of all developments relating to any such Third Party Claims, and provide
copies of all relevant correspondence and documentation relating thereto. The
Indemnified Party shall have the right at its own expense to participate in
the defense of such asserted liability. If the Indemnifying Party receiving
such notice of Third Party Claim does not timely elect to defend such Third
Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall have the right, at the Indemnifying
Partys expense, to defend such Third Party Claim; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the Indemnified Party shall not settle, compromise or discharge, or admit
any liability with respect to, any such Third Party Claim without the prior
written consent of the Indemnifying Party (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld).

(b) _Direct Claims_. As promptly as is reasonably practicable after becoming
aware of a claim for indemnification under this Agreement not involving a
Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall provide a Claim Notice to the
Indemnifying Party of such claim; _provided_ , that any delay or failure by
the Indemnified Party to provide such Claim Notice shall not relieve the
Indemnifying Party of its obligations hereunder except to the extent, if at
all, that it is prejudiced by reason of such delay or failure. Each Party
hereto also agrees that any direct claim which such Party may bring against
any other Party hereto under the provisions of this Agreement shall be
governed exclusively by the provisions of this _Article X_, other than
_Section 10.4(a)_.

SECTION 10.5 _Limitations_.

 

(a) To avoid any duplicative recovery, in no event shall Sellers or Purchaser
be required to provide indemnification to any Purchaser Indemnified Party or
Seller Indemnified Party, respectively, pursuant to _Section 10.2_ or _10.3_
for any amount that is included in the final Adjustment Amount, final Closing
Cash or final Closing Indebtedness.

 

(b) In no event shall (i) Sellers be required to provide indemnification to
any Purchaser Indemnified Party for any claim (with all claims arising out of
substantially the same events or circumstances being aggregated for such
purposes) under _Section 10.2_ or (ii) Purchaser be required to provide
indemnification to any Seller Indemnified Party for any claim (with all
claims arising out of substantially the same events or circumstances being
aggregated for such purposes) under _Section 10.3_, in each of cases (i) and
(ii), if the amount of such claim or aggregated claims is equal to or
less than seventy-five thousand dollars ($75,000) (" _De Minimis Claims_ ");
_provided_ , _however_ , that the limitation set forth in this _Section
10.5(b)_ shall not apply to any breach of the covenants or obligations
set forth in _Section 3.3_ (Closing Payment) or _Section 3.7_ (Post-Closing
Adjustment).

 



69 (c) Sellers shall not be liable for any amounts for which Purchaser
Indemnified Parties are otherwise entitled to indemnification pursuant to
_Section 10.2(a)_ until the aggregate amount of all Damages exceeds, on a
cumulative basis, nine million seven hundred fifty thousand dollars
($9,750,000) (the " _Threshold_ "), and then the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties shall be entitled to indemnification pursuant to _Section 10.2(a)_
for all of their Damages (excluding any Damages with respect to De Minimis
Claims) in excess of such Threshold, subject to the other limitations set
forth in this _Article X_; _provided_ , _however_ , that the limitation set
forth in this _Section 10.5(c)_ shall not apply to any breach of any of the
Seller Fundamental Representations or claims based upon fraud. Purchaser
shall not be liable for any amounts for which Seller Indemnified Parties are
otherwise entitled to indemnification pursuant to _Section 10.3(a)_ until the
aggregate amount of all Damages exceeds, on a cumulative basis, the
Threshold, and then the Seller Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to
indemnification pursuant to _Section 10.3(a)_ for all of their Damages
(excluding any Damages with respect to De Minimis Claims) in excess of such
Threshold, subject to the other limitations set forth in this _Article X_;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the limitation set forth in this _Section
10.5(c)_ shall not apply to any breach of any of the Purchaser Fundamental
Representations or claims based upon fraud.

(d) In no event shall Sellers aggregate liability pursuant to _Section
10.2(a)_ exceed an amount equal to sixty five million dollars ($65,000,000)
(the " _Cap_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that the limitation set forth in
this _Section 10.5(d)_ shall not apply to a breach of any of the Seller
Fundamental Representations or claims based upon fraud. In no event shall
Purchasers aggregate liability pursuant to _Section 10.3(a)_ exceed an
amount equal to the Cap; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the limitation set
forth in this _Section 10.5(d)_ shall not apply to any breach of any of the
Purchaser Fundamental Representations or claims based upon fraud. Claims for
indemnification pursuant to any other provision of _Section 10.2_ or
_Section 10.3_ are not subject to the limitations set forth in _Section
10.5(c)_ and _(d)_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, in no event shall Sellers or Purchasers aggregate liability under
this _Article X_ exceed the Closing Purchase Price, subject to any final
adjustments to the components therein in accordance with _Section 3.7_.

 

(e) Purchaser and Sellers acknowledge and agree that, following the Closing,
except in the case of fraud, the indemnification provisions of  _Section
8.1_, _Section 10.2_ and _Section 10.3_ shall be the sole and exclusive
monetary remedies of Sellers and Purchaser, respectively, for any Damages
(including any Damages from claims for breach of contract, warranty, tortious
conduct (including negligence) or otherwise and whether predicated on common
law, statute, strict liability, or otherwise) that each Party may at any time
suffer or incur, or become subject to, as a result of or in connection
with this Agreement, or the transaction contemplated by this Agreement,
including any breach of any representation or warranty in this Agreement by
any Party, or any failure by any Party to perform or comply with any covenant
or agreement that, by its terms, was to have been performed, or complied
with, under this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
from and after the Closing, the Parties hereto hereby irrevocably waive any
right of rescission they may otherwise have or to which they may become
entitled other than in the case of fraud.

SECTION 10.6 _Tax Benefit and Insurance_. Notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary, Damages shall be (a) net of any Tax Benefit and (b) net of any
insurance or other recoveries actually received by the Indemnified Party or
its Affiliates in connection with the facts 

 



70  giving rise to the right of indemnification. The Indemnified Party shall
use, and cause its Affiliates to use, commercially reasonable efforts to seek
full recovery under all insurance and indemnity provisions covering such
Damages to the same extent as it would if such Damages were not subject to
indemnification hereunder.

 

SECTION 10.7 _Additional Limitations on Damages_. In no event shall any
Indemnifying Party have any liability for punitive, exemplary, special or
speculative damages or any consequential damages that are not reasonably
foreseeable (in each case other than damages payable to third parties that may
be imposed or otherwise incurred).

 

SECTION 10.8 _Tax Indemnification_. Other than _Section 10.1(a)_, _Section
10.6_ and this  _Section 10.8_, the foregoing provisions of this _Article
X_ shall not apply to indemnification with respect to matters relating to
Taxes, which shall be governed exclusively by _Article VIII_.

 

SECTION 10.9 _Mitigation_. Each of the Parties agrees to use its commercially
reasonable efforts to mitigate its respective Damages upon and after becoming
aware of any event or condition that would reasonably be expected to give rise
to any Damages that are indemnifiable hereunder. Subject to all applicable
legal and contractual restrictions, upon making any payment to
the Indemnified Party for any indemnification claim pursuant to this _Article
X_, the Indemnifying Party shall be subrogated, to the extent of such payment,
to any rights which the Indemnified Party may have against any third parties
with respect to the subject matter underlying such indemnification claim, and
the Indemnified Party shall assign any such rights to the Indemnifying Party
to the extent such rights are assignable.

MISCELLANEOUS

SECTION 11.1 _Payments_.

(a) Any payments to be made under this Agreement shall be made by wire
transfer in dollars (with amounts denominated in currencies other than
dollars being converted to dollars in accordance with _Section 1.2(d)_) on
the relevant due date with value on that date in immediately available funds
and without deducting costs. Payments to Sellers shall be made to such bank
account in the United States hereafter designated by Sellers to Purchaser
(such account, the " _Sellers  Bank Account_") and payments to Purchaser
shall be made to such bank account in the United States hereafter designated
by Purchaser to Sellers (such account, the " _Purchaser s Bank Account_").

(b) If this Agreement provides that Purchaser shall make a payment or part of
a payment in Purchaser Common Stock (a " _Stock Payment_ "), then Purchaser
may at its option make such Stock Payment in whole or in part in cash. If

intra-day volume-weighted average price of one share of Purchaser Common
Stock on the New York Stock Exchange during the regular trading session (and
excluding pre-market and after-hours trading)

 



71  over the ten (10) consecutive trading days ending on the second (2nd)
trading day prior to the day on which such Stock Payment would be due
_multiplied by_ (B) by the number of shares of Purchaser Common Stock
Purchaser would otherwise have to be delivered to Sellers.

SECTION 11.2 _Notices_. All notices, demands, and other communications
required or permitted to be given to any Party under this Agreement shall be

72 SECTION 11.3 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York applicable to
agreements made and to be performed entirely within such State, without regard
to the conflict of laws principles of such State (other than §§ 5-1401 and
5-1402 of the New York General Obligations Law).

SECTION 11.4 _Jurisdiction; Venue; Consent to Service of Process_.

 

(a) Each Party hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for itself and
its property, to the exclusive jurisdiction of courts of the State of New
York, County of New York, including the Federal courts located therein, should
Federal jurisdiction requirements exist for any action arising out of or
relating to this Agreement. Each of the Parties consents to the jurisdiction
of such courts (and of the appropriate appellate courts) in any such action
or proceeding and waives any objection to venue laid therein. In addition,
each of the Parties hereto irrevocably and unconditionally waives and agrees
not to assert by way of motion, as a defense or otherwise (i) any claim that
it is not subject to the jurisdiction of the above courts, (ii) that its
property is exempt or immune from attachment or execution in any such action
or proceeding in the above-named courts, (iii) that such action or proceeding
is brought in an inconvenient forum, and (iv) that such action or proceeding
should be transferred or removed to any court other than one of the above-
named courts, or should be stayed by reason of the pendency of some other
proceeding in any other court other than one of the above-named courts, or
that this Agreement or the subject matter hereof may not be enforced in or by
such courts. Each of the Parties hereto hereby agrees not to commence any
such action or proceeding other than before one of the above-named courts.
Each of the Parties hereto also hereby agrees that any final and unappealable
judgment against a Party in connection with any such action or proceeding
shall be conclusive and binding on such Party and that such judgment may be
enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction, either within or outside of
the United States. A certified or exemplified copy of such award or judgment
shall be conclusive evidence of the fact and amount of such award or
judgment. The foregoing consent to jurisdiction shall not (A) constitute
submission to jurisdiction or general consent to service of process in the
State of New York, County of New York, for any purpose except with respect to
any action or proceeding resulting from, relating to or arising out of this
Agreement or (B) be deemed to confer rights on any Person other than the
respective Parties to this Agreement.

 

(b) To the extent that any Party has or hereafter may acquire any immunity
from jurisdiction of any court or from any legal process (whether through
service or notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of
execution, execution or otherwise) with respect to itself or its property,
each of such Seller or Purchaser hereby irrevocably waives such immunity in
respect of its obligations with respect to this Agreement.

(c) Each Party irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner
provided for the giving of notices pursuant to _Section 11.1_ of this
Agreement. Nothing in this _Section 11.4_ shall affect the right of any Party
to serve process in any other manner permitted by Law.

 



73 SECTION 11.5 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or
more counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same effect
as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument, and
shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each
of the Parties and delivered (by telecopy, electronic delivery or otherwise)
to the other Parties. Signatures to this Agreement transmitted by facsimile
transmission, by electronic mail in "portable document format" (".pdf") form,
or by any other electronic means intended to preserve the original graphic
and pictorial appearance of a document, will have the same effect as physical
delivery of the paper document bearing the original signature.

 

SECTION 11.6 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, together with the Related
Agreements, the Disclosure Letters and the Non-Disclosure Agreement and all
annexes and exhibits hereto and thereto, embody the entire agreement of the
Parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all
prior agreements with respect thereto.

 

SECTION 11.7 _Amendment, Modification and Waiver_. No amendment to this
Agreement shall be effective unless it shall be in writing and signed by each
Party hereto. Any failure of a Party to comply with any obligation, covenant,
agreement or condition contained in this Agreement may be waived by the Party
entitled to the benefits thereof only by a written instrument duly executed
and delivered by the Party granting such waiver, but such waiver or failure to
insist upon strict compliance with such obligation, covenant, agreement or
condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any
prior, subsequent or other failure of compliance.

SECTION 11.8 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement or the
application of any such provision is invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any
jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect
any other provision of this Agreement or invalidate or render unenforceable
such provision in any other jurisdiction. In the event that any provision
hereof would be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, the Parties intend that such provision will be construed by
modifying or limiting it so as to be valid and enforceable to the maximum
extent compatible with, and possible under, applicable Law, and the Parties
agree, to the extent lawful and practicable, use their reasonable efforts to
enter into arrangements to reinstate the intended benefits, net of the
intended burdens, of any such provision held invalid, illegal or
unenforceable.

SECTION 11.9 _Successors and Assigns; No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This
Agreement and all its provisions shall be binding solely upon and inure solely
to the benefit of the Parties and their respective permitted successors and
assigns, each of which such successors and permitted assigns will be deemed
to be a party hereto for all purposes hereof. Nothing in this Agreement,
whether expressed or implied, will confer on any Person, other than the
Parties hereto or their respective permitted successors and assigns, any
rights, remedies or Liabilities; _provided_ , that (a) the provisions of
_Article X_ will inure to the benefit of the Indemnified Parties, (b) the
provisions of _Section 6.8_ will inure to the benefit of the DandO Indemnified
Parties and (c) the provisions of _Section 6.9_ will inure to the benefit of
Sellers Affiliates. No Party may assign its rights or obligations under this
Agreement without the prior written consent of the other Parties hereto and
any purported assignment without such consent shall be void; _provided_ , that
Purchaser may, without the consent of Sellers, assign any or all of its rights
or obligations hereunder to any of its Subsidiaries that is wholly owned by
the Purchaser (although no such assignment shall relieve Purchaser of its
obligations to Sellers or any Seller Indemnified Party hereunder).

 



74 SECTION 11.10 _Publicity_. With respect to any information in respect of
the transactions contemplated hereby which shall not have been previously
issued or disclosed, except as required by Law (including the rules and
regulations of any applicable stock exchange), each of Sellers and Purchaser
agrees that neither it nor any of its Affiliates will issue a press release
or make any other public statement or release any public communication with
respect thereto without the prior consultation with the other Party. Purchaser
and Sellers agree, to the extent possible and legally permissible, to notify,
cooperate and consult with, the other Party prior to issuing or making any
such public statement (and be provided a reasonable opportunity to comment on
such public statement).

 

SECTION 11.11 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW,
EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN
ANY ACTION, SUIT, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT OF, IN WHOLE OR IN
PART, OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE SALE.

 

SECTION 11.12 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise expressly stated in this
Agreement, any costs, expenses, or charges incurred by any of the Parties
hereto shall be borne by the Party incurring such cost, expense or charge, in
each case, whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby shall be
consummated. Except as otherwise provided herein, if the Sale is consummated,
all costs, expenses and charges incurred and payable by any of the Trayport
Companies in connection with the negotiation, preparation, execution and
delivery of this Agreement and the Related Agreements and the consummation of
the Sale will be Trayport Transaction Expenses.

SECTION 11.13 _Specific Performance and Other Equitable Relief_. The Parties
hereby expressly recognize and acknowledge that immediate, extensive and
irreparable damage would result, no adequate remedy at law would exist and
damages would be difficult to determine if any provision of this Agreement is
not performed in accordance with its specific terms or is otherwise breached.
Each Party further acknowledges that a breach or violation of this Agreement
cannot be sufficiently remedied by money damages alone and, accordingly, each
Party shall be entitled, without the need to post a bond or other security,
in addition to damages and any other remedies provided at law or in equity, to
specific performance, injunctive and other equitable relief to enforce or
prevent any violation. Each Party agrees not to oppose the granting of
such equitable relief, and to waive, and to cause its representatives to
waive, any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection
with such remedy.

 

SECTION 11.14 _Guarantee_. As a material inducement to Purchaser to enter into
this Agreement and in recognition of substantial direct and indirect benefits
to GFI and BGCP therefrom, GFI and BGCP, jointly and severally, hereby
absolutely, irrevocably and unconditionally guarantee to Purchaser and the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties the due and punctual performance by Sellers of
all of Sellers obligations and liabilities under or in respect of this
Agreement including all of Sellers payment obligations hereunder and any
obligations or

 



75  liabilities of Sellers arising from any breach of this Agreement. GFIs and
BGCPs liabilities hereunder are absolute, unconditional, irrevocable and
continuing irrespective of any modification, amendment or waiver of or any
consent to departure from the terms and conditions of this Agreement that may
be agreed to by Sellers hereto in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.
GFI and BGCP agree that their obligations hereunder shall not be released or
discharged, in whole or in part, or otherwise affected by (a) the failure or
delay on the part of Purchaser to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any
right or remedy against Sellers or (b) any insolvency, bankruptcy,
reorganization or other similar proceeding instituted by or against Sellers.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this _Section 11.14_ or
otherwise, Purchaser hereby agrees that GFI and BGCP shall have all defenses
to their obligations under this guarantee that would be available to Sellers
in respect of this Agreement whether pursuant to the terms of this Agreement
or pursuant to any applicable Law in connection therewith.
