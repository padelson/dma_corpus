any other situation or in any other jurisdiction. If the final judgment of a court of competent
jurisdiction or other authority declares that any term or provision hereof is invalid, void or
unenforceable, the Parties agree that the court making such determination shall have the power to
reduce the scope, duration, area or applicability of the term or provision, to delete specific

provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the
invalid or unenforceable term or provision.
