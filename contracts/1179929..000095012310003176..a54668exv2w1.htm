 Section 2.6 _Shared Business Contracts_. If requested by Buyer, prior to the Closing and for a period of nine (9) months following the Closing (or, if applicable, such longer period specified in Section 2.8), the Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts (i) to cause any Business Contracts that are not exclusively related to the Business and other contracts listed on  _Schedule 2.6_ (the " _Shared Business Contracts_ ") to be split into separate contracts between the appropriate third party and Buyer (with respect to the portion of the Shared Business Contracts that does relate to the Business) or between the appropriate third party and Seller (with respect to the portion of the Shared Business Contracts that does not relate to the Business), (ii) to cause the third party to the Shared Business Contract to enter a new contract with Buyer replacing the portion of the Shared Business Contract that does relate to the Business, or (iii) to cause a license or purchase order issued under a Shared Business Contract to be moved from that contract to a contract between the applicable third party and Buyer (the actions in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) shall be referred to as a " _Contract Separation_ "). In the event and to the extent the Parties are unable to complete a Contract Separation with respect to a Shared Business Contract, then (x) the Parties shall use their commercially reasonable efforts in good faith to complete the Contract Separation as promptly as practicable, and (y) if such separation is not obtained, the Parties shall reasonably cooperate in any alternative lawful arrangement designed to provide for Buyer the benefits after Closing that it would have received, and to subject Buyer directly to the Liabilities, as if such Contract Separation had occurred, and the Parties shall execute and deliver such documents and other papers and take such further actions as may be reasonably required to effectuate the foregoing. In connection with its efforts under this Section, Seller shall not be required to make any payment or financial or other accommodations or grants to any third party, other than as mutually agreed in writing by the Parties. 

  

 Section 2.7 _Missed or Unscheduled Contracts_. In the event of a breach of the representations in Section 5.11 other than in the first sentence thereof, if the applicable Required Asset is a contract with a third party, such contract shall constitute a "Business Contract" solely for purposes of Sections 2.5 and 2.6 hereof and the definition of "Consent Costs"; provided, however, with respect to any such contracts only, the applicable time periods in Sections 2.5 and 2.6 shall be twenty-one (21) months from the Closing Date (instead of nine months). In addition, the applicable time periods in Sections 2.5 and 2.6 shall be twenty-one (21) months from the Closing Date (instead of nine months) for any Business Contract not listed in a Schedule to this Agreement. 

  

 Section 2.8 _Names and Marks_. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that neither this Agreement nor the sale of the Assets grants Buyer any right, title or interest whatsoever in or to 

   #####

In consideration of the sale, transfer, assignment, conveyance and delivery of the Assets, and subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Buyer shall, in addition to BuyerÂ’s assumption of the Assumed Liabilities, pay to Seller an aggregate amount equal to One Hundred Thirty Five Million Dollars ($135,000,000) in cash (the " _Initial Purchase Price_ "), subject to any adjustment as provided for in Section 3.2 (as finally adjusted, the " _Purchase Price_ "). Buyer shall pay the Closing Date Purchase Price to Seller by wire transfer of immediately available funds, to such bank account(s) as shall be specified in writing by Seller prior to the Closing. 

  

 Section 3.2 _Adjustment to Purchase Price_. 

  

 (a) At least two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, using then available information, and deliver to Buyer a statement, together with the detailed work papers which support such statement, setting forth in reasonable detail SellerÂ’s good faith estimate of the Closing Date Net Working Capital (the " _Preliminary Working Capital_ "), which statement shall be prepared in a manner consistent with the calculation of the Trial Working Capital Calculation and the practices and methodologies set out on _Schedule 3.2_ (the " _Net Working Capital Practices and Methodologies_ "). The Initial Purchase Price to be paid at the Closing shall be (i) increased dollar for dollar by the amount the Preliminary Working Capital exceeds the Target Amount or (ii) decreased dollar for dollar by the amount the Preliminary Working Capital is less than the Target Amount (the Initial Purchase Price as so adjusted at the Closing, the " _Closing Date Purchase Price_ "). 

  

 (b) Within fifteen (15) days following the Closing Date, Seller shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, and deliver to Buyer, a statement, together with the detailed work papers which support such statement (collectively, the " _Preliminary Working Capital Statement_ "), setting forth in reasonable detail the Closing Date Net Working Capital, which statement shall be prepared in accordance with the Net Working Capital Practices and Methodologies. The Preliminary Working Capital Statement shall also set out in reasonable detail any prepaid expenses attributable to Non-Assignable Contracts and Shared Business Contracts that were not included in the Closing Date Net Working Capital because the applicable Assignment Consent was not obtained or such Shared Business Contract was not split as of the Closing Date. 

   ##### 

  

    

 (c) To the extent necessary to verify and confirm the accuracy of the Preliminary Working Capital Statement, Buyer shall have the right to review the books and records of Seller for a period of ninety (90) days following the Closing Date. The Preliminary Working Capital Statement shall be binding and conclusive upon, and deemed accepted by, Buyer unless Buyer shall have notified Seller in writing within ninety (90) days following the Closing Date of any good faith objection thereto, which objection can only be that the Closing Date Net Working Capital, as reflected on the Preliminary Working Capital Statement, has not been prepared in accordance with the Net Working Capital Practices and Methodologies or contains mathematical errors on its face (the " _Objection_ "), indicating in reasonable detail the basis for its objections and the specific adjustments to the Closing Date Net Working Capital reflected on the Preliminary Working Capital Statement which Buyer believes should be made, and the Parties shall meet and confer in an effort to resolve such disagreement in good faith. Any items not disputed in a valid Objection shall be deemed to have been accepted by Buyer. 

  

 (d) If the Parties are unable to resolve all of their disputes with respect to the calculation of the Closing Date Net Working Capital within fifteen (15) days following SellerÂ’s receipt of Objection to the Preliminary Working Capital Statement pursuant to Section 3.2(c), then the Parties shall refer their remaining differences to an independent public accounting firm mutually agreed to by the Parties (the " _Independent Accounting Firm_ ") for decision, which decision shall be final and binding on the Parties upon delivery of the Independent Accounting FirmÂ’s written opinion. Within fifteen (15) days following the reference of such dispute to the Independent Accounting Firm, each Party shall submit its position with respect to any unresolved elements of the Objection to the Independent Accounting Firm in writing (with a copy to the other Party), supported by any documents and/or affidavits upon which it relies. Failure to do so without reasonable cause shall constitute a withdrawal by the applicable Party of its position with respect to any unresolved elements of the Objection to which such failure relates. The Independent Accounting Firm shall make its determination based solely on the provisions of this Section 3.2 and the submissions of the Parties, and not by independent review, and shall review only those issues still in dispute and only as to whether such amounts were arrived at in conformity with the Net Working Capital Practices and Methodologies and Section 3.2(b) hereof or contain mathematical errors on their face. The Independent Accounting Firm shall review the written submissions from the Parties and shall deliver their written opinion setting forth the proper amount of any disputed item within the scope of their review within a reasonable time following its receipt of such written submissions of the Parties. The scope of the disputes to be resolved by the Independent Accounting Firm is limited to the unresolved portion of the Objection submitted by Buyer and the Independent Accounting Firm may not assign a value to any disputed item greater than the greatest value for such item claimed by any Party or less than the lowest value for such item claimed by any Party. The Parties shall make readily available to the Independent Accounting Firm all relevant books and records and any work papers (including those of the PartiesÂ’ respective accountants) relating to Objection and the Preliminary Working Capital Statement, respectively, and all other items reasonably requested by the Independent Accounting Firm. The fees and expenses of the Independent Accounting Firm shall be paid one-half by Seller and one-half by Buyer. 

  

 (e) The calculation of the Closing Date Net Working Capital shall become final and binding on the Parties upon the earliest of (i) if no Objection has been timely filed, the expiration of the period within which Buyer must make its objection pursuant to 

   ##### 

  

    

Section 3.2(c) hereof, (ii) the date of an agreement in writing by the Parties
that the Preliminary Working Capital Statement, together with any
modifications thereto agreed by the Parties, shall be final and binding and
(iii) the date on which the Independent Accounting Firm shall issue its
written determination with respect to any dispute relating to such
Preliminary Working Capital Statement. The Preliminary Working Capital
Statement, (A) as submitted by Seller if no timely Objection has been given,
(B) as adjusted pursuant to any such agreement between the Parties or (C) as
adjusted pursuant to such determination of the Independent Accounting
Firm pursuant to Section 3.2(d) hereof, is herein referred to as the " _Final
Closing Date Net Working Capital Statement_." 

  

 (f) The Closing Date Purchase Price shall be (i) increased dollar for dollar by the amount the Closing Date Net Working Capital as reflected on the Final Closing Date Net Working Capital Statement exceeds the Preliminary Working Capital or (ii) decreased dollar for dollar by the amount the Closing Date Net Working Capital as reflected on the Final Closing Date Net Working Capital Statement is less than the Preliminary Working Capital. Any adjustments to the Closing Date Purchase Price made pursuant to this Section 3.2(f) shall be paid by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account or accounts specified by Seller, if Seller is owed payment, or to the account or accounts specified by Buyer, if Buyer is owed payment, within five (5) Business Days after the date the calculation of the Closing Date Net Working Capital becomes final and binding. 

  

 Section 3.3 _Allocation of Purchase Price_. The Parties agree that the Purchase Price and Assumed Liabilities shall be allocated among the Assets (tangible and intangible) on the basis of an allocation prepared in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code (the " _Allocation_ "). The Allocation shall be prepared by Buyer for the review and approval by Seller within twenty (20) days after the date on which the calculation of the Closing Date Net Working Capital shall become final and binding on the Parties. If the Parties have not adopted the Allocation within the timeframe described above, any disputed aspects of the Allocation shall be resolved by Independent Accounting Firm before the first filing date for filing IRS Form 8594\. Such resolution by the Independent Accounting Firm shall be final on both parties. The fees and expenses of the Independent Accounting Firm shall be paid one-half by Seller and one-half by Buyer. Such final version of the Allocation shall become part of this Agreement for all purposes. The Parties agree to report, pursuant to Section 1060 of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder or any other similar provision under state, local or foreign law, as and when required, the Allocation of the Purchase Price, as adjusted, among the Assets in a manner entirely consistent with such Allocation in the preparation and filing of all Tax Returns (including IRS Form 8594). Neither Party will take any action that would call into question such Allocation, except to the extent required by a taxing authority.

From and after the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the Closing Date or the date, if any, on which this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 10.1, Seller agrees that neither it nor any of its Affiliates shall, and that it shall cause its Representatives not to, directly or indirectly: (a) solicit, initiate or knowingly facilitate or encourage any Competing Proposal, (b) participate in any negotiations regarding, or furnish to any Person any material nonpublic information with respect to, any Competing Proposal, (c) engage in discussions with any Person with respect to any Competing Proposal, (d) approve any Competing Proposal, or (e) enter into any letter of intent or similar document or any agreement or commitment providing for any Competing Proposal. 

  

 Section 7.12 _Advise of Changes_.

ARTICLE VIII 

   

 _TRANSFERRED EMPLOYEES_  

  

 Section 8.1 _Hiring of Employees_. 

  

 (a) The Parties currently intend that there will be a continuity of employment for substantially all Business Employees following the Closing Date. As used herein, " _Business Employees_ " means all of those employees of the Business listed on _Schedule 8.1(a)_ who remain employed by Seller as of the Closing Date, and any other employees of Seller as of the Closing Date who are employed exclusively in the Business (including as of the Closing Date (x) those employees receiving salary continuation benefits under SellerÂ’s short-term disability and active employees on military leave or other approved absences, and (y) those employees absent from work pursuant to vacation, sick leave or other leave, including leave granted or required to be granted under the terms of the Family and Medical Leave Act; provided, that in the case of an employee described in clause (x) or (y), such employee is not receiving long-term disability benefits and is reasonably expected by Seller to return to active service within six months). As soon as practicable and at least ten (10) days prior to the Closing Date, and effective as of the Closing Date, Buyer shall make offers of employment (the " _Offers_ ") to substantially all of the Business Employees, which offers may be subject to routine background checks, on the terms set forth in Section 8.1(c). Except as set forth on _Schedule 8.1(a)_, during the past six months none of the Business Employees were transferred to the Business other than in the ordinary course of business. All Business Employees who accept BuyerÂ’s offer of employment shall cease to be employees of Seller and shall become BuyerÂ’s employees as of the date immediately following the Closing Date (the " _Transferred Employees_ "). Buyer shall not have any obligation to hire any Business Employee or any other employee of Seller that does not accept an Offer. 

   

 (b) Seller acknowledges and agrees that Buyer does not assume or agree to discharge any liability of Seller under COBRA with respect to any current or former employees of Seller. 

   

 (c) Buyer agrees that each Offer will be for compensation (including incentive opportunity but excluding equity based compensation) for the benefit of each Business Employee that, when taken as a whole, is at least as favorable as such compensation provided to such employee as set forth in the updated compensation information provided to Buyer in 

      ##### 

  

    

accordance with this Section 8.1(c). Seller has provided Buyer with such
compensation information as of the date hereof and will provide Buyer with
updated information at least fifteen (15) days prior to the Closing. In
addition, each Offer will provide that the applicable Business Employee shall
be eligible to participate in all of BuyerÂ’s welfare benefit plans
generally available to its employees and BuyerÂ’s 401(k) plan. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, Buyer agrees that each Offer will
be (i) for a comparable work location (which must be within fifty (50) miles
of such employeeÂ’s current work location), and (ii) for comparable
job functions. Buyer shall be deemed to have satisfied its obligations under
this Section 8.1(c) as to any Business Employee who actually accepts his or
her Offer. 

   

 (d) To the extent that a Transferred Employee commences participation in any employee benefit plan, program or arrangement maintained by Buyer or any of its Affiliates (each such plan, program or arrangement, a " _Buyer Plan_ ") following the Closing Date, Buyer shall, and shall cause its Affiliates and the applicable Buyer Plan to use commercially reasonable efforts to, (i) credit each Transferred EmployeeÂ’s service with Seller or any Subsidiary or any predecessor employers thereto, to the extent credited under the analogous Benefit Plan, as service with Buyer for benefit eligibility only under such Buyer Plan; provided, however, that, to the extent the Transferred Employees participate in BuyerÂ’s severance and vacation plans, such Transferred Employees shall also receive such service credit for benefit accrual purposes under such analogous Buyer Plan (if any); provided, further, that in no event shall the Transferred Employees be entitled to any credit to the extent that it would result in duplication of benefits with respect to the same period of service, (ii) cause any and all pre-existing condition limitations, eligibility waiting periods, active employment requirements and requirements to show evidence of good health under such Buyer Plan, to the extent that such conditions, exclusions and waiting periods would have been waived or satisfied under the analogous Benefit Plan in which such Transferred Employee participated immediately prior to the Closing Date, to be waived with respect to such Transferred Employee and such individualÂ’s spouse and eligible dependents who become participants in such Buyer Plan and (iii) give credit for or otherwise take into account under such Buyer Plan the out-of-pocket expenses and annual expense limitation amounts paid by each Transferred Employee under the analogous Benefit Plan for the year in which the Closing Date occurs. 

   

 (e) Seller will pay each Transferred Employee for their earned but unused vacation days accrued in accordance with SellerÂ’s applicable policies as of the Closing Date. 

   

 (f) Prior to the Closing, at its sole cost and expense, Seller shall take all actions necessary to comply with the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, with respect to the Business Employees. If Buyer takes any action after the Closing Date which independently, or in connection with any reduction in the size of the BusinessÂ’s work force occurring within the ninety (90) day period on or prior to the Closing Date, could be construed as a "plant closing" or "mass layoff," as those terms are defined in the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, Buyer shall be responsible for providing any notice required by the such act and Buyer shall be solely responsible for any and all penalties and costs (of Buyer or Seller or any of their respective Affiliates), if any, which may result from any failure to provide any notice required by such act, regardless of whether the applicable termination of employment occurred prior to, on, or following the Closing Date. 

       ##### 

  

     

 (g) From the Closing Date until six (6) months following the Closing Date, Buyer will provide all Transferred Employees with a severance plan or policy that provides cash severance benefits no less favorable to such employees than the Unisys Supplemental Unemployment Benefits Plan effective January 1, 2009, and, for all purposes with respect to such severance plan or policy, will provide the Transferred Employees with credit for past service in accordance with Section 8.1(d). 

   

 (h) This Article VIII is not intended to, and does not, create any rights or obligations to or for the benefit of anyone other than the Parties.

 Section 11.4 _Indemnification Procedure_. 

  

 (a) All claims for indemnification by a Buyer Indemnitee or a Seller Indemnitee (an " _Indemnified Party_ ") shall be asserted and resolved as set forth in this Section 11.4. As soon as is reasonably practicable after an Indemnified Party or any of its respective Affiliates, Representatives, successors and permitted assigns, as the case may be, becomes aware of any claim for which it is entitled to recover Losses under this Article XI, such Indemnified Party shall notify the other party (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") in writing (the " _Claim Notice_ "), which shall describe the claim in reasonable detail and shall specify, in reasonable detail, to the extent known, the facts underlying the nature of the claim and the basis for indemnification, and in furtherance of the foregoing, in the event of any claim for indemnification hereunder resulting from or in connection with any claim or Legal Proceeding by a third party, the Indemnified Party shall give such notice thereof to the Indemnifying Party not later than ten (10) Business Days prior to the time any response to the asserted claim is required, and in any event, within five (5) Business Days following receipt of notice thereof (or as soon as practicable prior to the expiration of the response period if less than ten (10) Business Days); provided, however, that no delay on the part of the Indemnified Party in so notifying the Indemnifying Party shall relieve the Indemnifying Party from any obligation hereunder unless the Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced thereby. 

   

 (b) The Indemnifying Party shall have 30 days from the personal delivery or receipt of the Claim Notice (the " _Notice Period_ ") to notify the Indemnified Party: (i) whether or not the Indemnifying Party disputes its liability to the Indemnified Party with respect to such claim or demand; and (ii) in the case of a third party claim, whether or not it will defend the Indemnified Party against such claim or demand. If the Indemnifying Party declines to defend the claim or demand, then the reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the Indemnified Party in defending such claim or demand shall be a liability of, and shall be paid by, the Indemnifying Party if the Indemnifying Party does not dispute its liability or if the Indemnifying Party does dispute its liability and the resolution of such dispute is against the Indemnifying Party. In the event that the Indemnifying Party elects to defend the Indemnified Party, it shall so notify the Indemnified Party within the Notice Period, and the Indemnifying Party shall defend the Indemnified Party by appropriate proceedings and shall have the sole power to direct and control such defense including the settlement of any case that involves solely monetary damages without the consent of the Indemnified Party. If any Indemnified Party desires to participate in any such defense, it may do so at its sole cost and expense, provided, however, that if the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall, based on advice of counsel to the Indemnifying Party, have conflicting or different claims or defenses, then the Indemnifying Party shall not have control of such conflicting or differing claims or defenses and the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to appoint a separate counsel for such claims and defenses, at the cost and expense (not to be unreasonable) of the Indemnifying Party. If the 

    ##### 

  

    

Indemnifying Party assumes the defense, so long as the Indemnifying Party is
in good faith defending such claim or proceeding, the Indemnified Party shall
not settle a claim or demand for which it is indemnified by the Indemnifying
Party without the written consent of the Indemnifying Party. The Indemnifying
Party shall not, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party,
settle, compromise or offer to settle or compromise any such claim or demand,
except such consent of the Indemnified Party shall not be required with
respect to monetary damage awards (for which the Indemnifying Party has
received, as an unconditional term of such settlement, an unconditional
release by claimant or plaintiff from all Losses in connection with such claim
or demand). The Indemnified Party will diligently and fully cooperate with
the Indemnifying Party, its counsel, experts and other relevant persons in
the defense of any claim or demand including providing access, during normal
business hours, to relevant facilities and to business records and other
documents, and shall permit them to consult with the employees and counsel and
other relevant persons of the Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Party shall
use its reasonable efforts to defend all such claims for which it has assumed
the defense. 

   

 (c) Notwithstanding any other provision, Seller shall be entitled to control in all respects any claims or Legal Proceedings relating to Taxes based on or related to income of Seller or any of its Affiliates and any other claims or Legal Proceedings relating to Taxes of Seller or any of its Affiliates; provided, however, that Buyer shall have the right to participate in any such Legal Proceeding if the outcome of such proceeding could have an adverse effect on Buyer or the Business, and Seller shall not settle such proceeding without BuyerÂ’s consent, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld. 

   

 Section 11.5 _Treatment of Indemnity Payments_. The Parties agree to treat any amounts payable after the Closing by Seller to Buyer (or by Buyer to Seller) pursuant to this Agreement as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for income Tax purposes, unless otherwise required by a Tax authority. 

  

 Section 11.6 _Certain Limitations_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary: 

  

 (a) No Buyer Indemnitee shall be entitled to indemnification hereunder from Seller with respect to any inaccuracy, misrepresentation or breach of a representation, warranty or covenant in this Agreement (a " _Breach_ ") if, on the date hereof, Seller establishes that (i) any of the persons listed on _Schedule 1.1(e)_ hereof had actual knowledge of the existence of such Breach and (ii) none of the persons listed on _Schedule 1.1(f)_ had actual knowledge of such Breach; provided, that the foregoing shall not limit SellerÂ’s obligations under Section 11.2(a)(iii). 

   

 (b) No Seller Indemnitee shall be entitled to indemnification hereunder from Buyer with respect to a Breach if, on the date hereof, Buyer establishes that (i) any of the persons listed on  _Schedule 1.1(f)_ hereof had actual knowledge of the existence of such Breach and (ii) none of the persons listed on _Schedule 1.1(e)_ had actual knowledge of such Breach; provided that the foregoing shall not limit BuyerÂ’s obligations under Section 11.3(a)(iii). 

   

 (c) Seller shall not be obligated to indemnify Buyer against any Current Liabilities included in the Closing Date Net Working Capital. 

       ##### 

  

     

 (d) If an Indemnified Party receives insurance proceeds for a claim as a result of Losses relating to a matter for which the Indemnified Party has also been indemnified hereunder, such Indemnified Party shall promptly pay the amount of such insurance proceeds to the Indemnifying Party, up to the amount previously paid by such Indemnifying Party to such Indemnified Party as indemnification hereunder in relation to such matter, or if such Indemnifying Party has not yet satisfied the indemnification claim of the Indemnified Party, the amount such Indemnifying Party is obligated to pay the Indemnified Party with respect to such matter shall be reduced by the amount of such insurance proceeds that such Indemnified Party has received. 

   

 Section 11.7 _Remedies Exclusive; Mitigation_. The remedies provided in this Article XI are the exclusive remedies of the Parties hereto for money damages after the Closing in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, including any breach or non-performance of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained herein and therein. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parties hereto shall each have and retain all rights and remedies existing in their favor under this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, at law or in equity, to bring actions for specific performance or injunctive relief (including the remedy of rescission) to enforce or prevent a breach or violation of any provision of this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements. Each Person seeking indemnification hereunder shall use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate Losses (including without limitation using commercially reasonable efforts to exercise cure rights under contracts) for which it seeks indemnification hereunder; provided, however, that any reasonable costs incurred by such Person in connection with such mitigation shall constitute Losses hereunder. 

  

 Section 11.8 _WAIVER OF CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES_. EXCEPT IN RESPECT OF THIRD PARTY CLAIMS, IN NO EVENT WILL EITHER PARTY HERETO BE LIABLE WHETHER IN CONTRACT OR TORT FOR ANY SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING LOSS OF REPUTATION OR GOODWILL, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT THESE DAMAGES MAY BE DISCLAIMED BY LAW, _PROVIDED_ ,  _HOWEVER_ , THE PARTIES HEREBY AGREE THAT LOST PROFITS RESULTING FROM A BREACH OF THE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OR OTHER TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT (" _EXCLUDED CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES_ ") ARE NOT CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES FOR PURPOSES OF ANY DAMAGE COMPUTATION AND ARE RECOVERABLE HEREUNDER. 

  

ARTICLE XII 

   

 _MISCELLANEOUS_  

  

 Section 12.1 _Fees and Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, the Parties shall each pay their respective expenses (including legal, investment banking, finderÂ’s, brokerÂ’s and accounting fees) incurred in connection with the origination, negotiation and execution of this Agreement, except that each Party shall pay, whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated, 50% of all filing fees incurred in connection with any filing with antitrust authorities pursuant to the HSR Act.

 Section 12.4 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts (including by facsimile and .pdf file), each of which shall be deemed to be an original and all of which together shall be deemed to be one and the same instrument. The Parties need not execute the same counterpart. 

  

 Section 12.5 _Entire Agreement; No Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement, the Schedules and Exhibits, the Confidentiality Agreement and the other Transaction Documents set forth the entire understanding of the Parties, and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, with respect to the subject matter hereof (other than the Confidentiality Agreement). Nothing herein, expressed or implied, shall create or establish any third party beneficiary hereto nor confer upon any person not a Party any rights or remedies under or by reason of this Agreement, except for those third party beneficiaries set forth in Section 11.2(a) and Section 11.3(a). 

  

 Section 12.6 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions hereof or the validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in any other situation or in any other jurisdiction. If the final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction or other authority declares that any term or provision hereof is invalid, void or unenforceable, the Parties agree that the court making such determination shall have the power to reduce the scope, duration, area or applicability of the term or provision, to delete specific words or phrases, or to replace any invalid, void or unenforceable term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision. 

  

 Section 12.7 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to conflict of law principles. 

  

 Section 12.8 _Enforcement; Venue_. Each of the Parties irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the District of Delaware located in Wilmington, Delaware, or if such court does not have jurisdiction, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, County of New Castle, for the purposes of any suit, action or other proceeding arising out of this Agreement, the other Transaction Documents or any transaction contemplated hereby or thereby. Each of the Parties further agrees that service of any process, summons, notice or document by U.S. registered mail to such PartyÂ’s respective address set forth in Section 12.3 shall be effective service of process for any action, suit or proceeding with respect to any matters to which it has submitted to jurisdiction as set forth above in the immediately preceding sentence. Each of the Parties irrevocably and unconditionally waives any

objection to the laying of venue of any action, suit or proceeding arising out
of this Agreement, the other Transaction Documents or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby in (a) the United States District Court for
the District of Delaware or (b) the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware, County of New Castle, and hereby further irrevocably and
unconditionally waives and agrees not to plead or claim in any such court
that any such action, suit or proceeding brought in any such court has been
brought in an inconvenient forum. 

   

 Section 12.9 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Closing Date, each Party may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other Party, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other Party contained in this Agreement or in any document delivered pursuant to this Agreement or (c) waive compliance by the other Party with any of the agreements or conditions contained in this Agreement. Any agreement on the part of a Party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such Party. The failure of any Party to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of those rights. 

  

 Section 12.10 _Schedules and Exhibits_. All Exhibits and Schedules hereto are hereby incorporated by reference and made a part of this Agreement. Any information disclosed in any schedule shall be deemed to be disclosed and incorporated into any other schedule if the applicability of such disclosure to such other schedule is reasonably apparent from the actual text of such disclosure without reference to further documentation. Any fact or item disclosed on any Schedule or Exhibit hereto shall not by reason only of such inclusion be deemed to be material and shall not be employed as a point of reference in determining any standard of materiality under this Agreement. 

  

 Section 12.11 _Delivery_. For purposes of this Agreement, references to the term "delivered by Seller," "delivered to Buyer" or "furnished or made available to Buyer" or similar expressions shall mean that Seller has: (a) posted such materials to the Data Room and has given Buyer and its Representatives access to the materials so posted, (b) set forth such materials in the Schedules; or (c) has otherwise made such materials available in writing (whether tangible or electronic) to Buyer. 

  

 Section 12.12 _Assignment_. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding on the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns. This Agreement shall not be assigned by either Party without the express prior written consent of the other Party, and any attempted assignment, without such consents, shall be null and void. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer may assign this Agreement without such consent to a wholly-owned subsidiary of Buyer; provided, however, that Buyer shall be and remain jointly and severally liable for all obligations of Buyer and any such assignee under this Agreement. 

  

 Section 12.13 _Specific Performance_. The Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event any provision of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with the terms hereof and that the Parties shall be entitled to specific performance of the terms hereof in addition to any other remedy at law or in equity, including monetary damages, that may be available to it. 

   ##### 

  

  

 Section 12.14 _No Strict Construction_. The Parties have participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. In the event any ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly by all Parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any Party by virtue of the authorship of any provision of this Agreement. 

  

 Section 12.15 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. THE PARTIES HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVE ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ACTIONS OF EITHER PARTY IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT THEREOF OR ANY DEALINGS BETWEEN THEM RELATING TO THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS AGREEMENT. THE SCOPE OF THIS WAIVER IS INTENDED TO BE ALL-ENCOMPASSING OF ANY AND ALL DISPUTES THAT MAY BE FILED IN ANY COURT AND THAT RELATE TO THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING CONTRACT CLAIMS, TORT CLAIMS, BREACH OF DUTY CLAIMS, AND ALL OTHER COMMON LAW AND STATUTORY CLAIMS. THE PARTIES EACH ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THIS WAIVER IS A MATERIAL INDUCEMENT TO ENTER INTO A BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP, THAT EACH PARTY WILL RELY ON THIS WAIVER, AND THAT EACH WILL CONTINUE TO RELY ON THIS WAIVER IN THEIR RELATED FUTURE DEALINGS. EACH PARTY FURTHER WARRANTS AND REPRESENTS THAT EACH HAS REVIEWED THIS WAIVER WITH ITS LEGAL COUNSEL, AND THAT EACH KNOWINGLY AND VOLUNTARILY WAIVES ITS JURY TRIAL RIGHTS FOLLOWING CONSULTATION WITH LEGAL COUNSEL. THIS WAIVER IS IRREVOCABLE, MEANING THAT IT MAY NOT BE MODIFIED EITHER ORALLY OR IN WRITING, AND THIS WAIVER SHALL APPLY TO ANY SUBSEQUENT AMENDMENTS, RENEWALS, SUPPLEMENTS OR MODIFICATIONS TO THIS AGREEMENT. IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, THIS AGREEMENT MAY BE FILED AS A WRITTEN CONSENT TO A TRIAL BY THE COURT. 

  

 Section 12.16 _Further Assurances_. 

  

 (a) Seller shall, at the Closing and from time to time thereafter, upon the request of Buyer, do, execute, acknowledge and deliver, or cause to be done, executed, acknowledged and delivered, all such further acts, assignments, transfers, powers of attorney, assurances and instruments as Buyer may reasonably request to assign and transfer the Assets to Buyer and to assure to Buyer the continued possession, control and enjoyment of the Assets. 

   

 (b) Prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall update _Schedule 1.1(i)_ to add any Unisys proprietary software (other than Excluded Assets) and any know-how of Transferred Employees related to use of such software in the Business that is primarily used, or otherwise necessary, in connection with the operation of the Business as of the Closing Date. Should Seller have failed to include such Unisys proprietary software on _Schedule 1.1(i)_, upon written notice from Buyer to Seller within twenty one (21) months after the Closing Date, such item shall be added to  _Schedule 1.1(i)_ retroactively to the Closing Date. The second sentence of this clause (b) shall be BuyerÂ’s sole recourse for an unintentional breach by Seller of the first sentence of this clause (b). 

       ##### 

  

     

 (c) If within twenty-one (21) months after the Closing Date, Seller notifies Buyer in writing that it has identified any item of Assigned Other Intellectual Property that, as of the Closing Date, was used in the operation of any business of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries (other than those assets, rights and services that are to be provided to Seller pursuant to the terms of the Subcontract (and the assets and other resources used to provide such services)), Buyer shall, or shall cause the applicable Affiliate of Buyer, to grant Seller and its Subsidiaries a royalty-free, world-wide, sub-licensable and transferable license to such intangible asset, limited in scope to use in SellerÂ’s and its SubsidiariesÂ’ businesses that are not Competitive Businesses (which license would be deemed effective as of the Closing Date). 

   

 Section 12.17 _Headings_. The heading references herein and the table of contents hereto are for convenience purposes only, do not constitute a part of this Agreement and shall not be deemed to limit or affect any of the provisions hereof.
