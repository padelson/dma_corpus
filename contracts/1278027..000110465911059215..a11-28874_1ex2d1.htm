Section 1.03. _Consents to Certain Assignments_.

 



 

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary (subject to
the provisions of Section 1.03(b)), this Agreement shall not constitute an
agreement to transfer or assign any asset or any claim or right or any benefit
arising under or resulting from such asset if an attempted direct or indirect
assignment thereof, without the consent of a third party, would constitute a
breach, default, violation or other contravention of the rights of such third
party, would be ineffective with respect to any party to an agreement
concerning such asset, claim or right, or would in any way adversely affect
the rights of Seller or any of the Seller Affiliates or, upon transfer,
Purchaser under such asset, claim or right. If any transfer or assignment by
Seller or any of the Seller Affiliates to Purchaser, or any direct or indirect
assumption by Purchaser of, any interest in, or liability, obligation or
commitment under, any asset, claim or right requires the consent of a third
party, then such transfer or assignment or assumption shall be made subject to
such consent being obtained. Purchaser agrees that neither Seller nor any of
the Seller Affiliates shall have any liability whatsoever to Purchaser arising
out of or relating to the failure to obtain any such consent that may be
required in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
because of any circumstances resulting therefrom. Purchaser further agrees
that no representation, warranty or covenant of Seller herein shall be
breached or deemed breached, and no condition shall be deemed not satisfied,
as a result of (i) the failure to obtain any such consent, (ii) any
circumstances resulting therefrom or (iii) any suit, action or proceeding (a "
_Proceeding_ ") or investigation commenced or threatened by or on behalf of
any person arising out of or relating to the failure to obtain any such
consent or any circumstances resulting therefrom.

 



 

(b) If any such consent is not obtained prior to the Closing, the Closing
shall nonetheless take place on the terms set forth in this Agreement and,
thereafter, Purchaser and Seller shall use their reasonable best efforts (not
including the payment of any consideration by Seller) to secure such consent
as promptly as practicable after the Closing and shall cooperate in any lawful
and commercially reasonable arrangement reasonably proposed by Purchaser under
which (i) Purchaser shall obtain (without infringing upon the legal rights of
such third party or violating any Applicable Law) the economic claims, rights
and benefits (net of the amount of any related Tax costs imposed on Seller,
any of the Seller Affiliates or any of their respective affiliates on post-
Closing income so transferable to Purchaser) under the asset, claim or right
with respect to which the consent has not been obtained in accordance with
this Agreement and (ii) Seller shall bear any related economic burden
resulting from implementation of any such alternative

 



      
 

 



 

arrangement pursuant to this Section 1.03 (other than the amount of any such
related Tax costs borne by Purchaser pursuant to clause (i) above) because a
third party consent has not been obtained in accordance with this Agreement.

 



 

Section 1.04. _Assumption of Liabilities_.

 



 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, Purchaser
shall assume, effective as of the Closing, and shall pay, perform and
discharge when due the following obligations, liabilities and commitments,
whether known or unknown, express or implied, primary or secondary, direct or
indirect, liquidated, absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise and whether
due or to become due, arising out of, relating to or otherwise in respect of

(ii) all obligations, liabilities and commitments for refunds, adjustments,

(iii) Property Taxes that are the responsibility of Purchaser pursuant to
Section 9.01(a);

liability claims);

 



 

(vi) all obligations, liabilities and commitments (A) arising under or in
respect of (x) the advertising commitments set forth in Schedule 1.04(a)(vi)

the Closing Date; and

 



 

(vii) all obligations, liabilities and commitments of Purchaser pursuant to
Section 5.05.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Purchaser shall
not assume any Retained Liability, each of which shall be retained and paid,

term " _Retained Liabilities_ " means:

Seller Affiliates arising out of or related to the Excluded Assets;

 



 

(ii) all obligations, liabilities and commitments of Seller or any of the
Seller Affiliates not listed in Section 1.04(a);

 



 

(iii) all accounts payable of Seller or any of the Seller Affiliates existing
as of the Closing and arising out of the operation or conduct of the Business
on or before the Closing;

 



 

(iv) Excluded Taxes;

 



 

(v) Property Taxes that are the responsibility of Seller pursuant to Section
9.01(a);

 



 

(vi) Transfer Taxes that are the responsibility of Seller pursuant to Section
9.01(c);

 



 

(vii) all obligations, liabilities and commitments of Seller or any of the

or Proceeding, in each case pending on or before the Closing Date;

manufactured on or prior to the Closing Date, including obligations,
liabilities and commitments for any personal injury claims, warranty
obligations, product recall or withdrawal, regardless of legal theory
asserted, but excluding, in all cases under this Section 1.04(b)(viii), any
obligations, liabilities or commitments that are Assumed Liabilities under
Section 1.04(a)(ii);

 



 

(ix) all obligations, liabilities and commitments under Environmental Laws to
the extent arising out of the operation or conduct of the Business or the use
or operation of the Transferred Assets, in each case on or prior to the

Products returned by such customer which are the responsibility of Purchaser
pursuant to Section 1.04(a)(ii), in each case against accounts payable by such
customer to Seller or such Seller Affiliate. Seller agrees to, and to cause
the Seller Affiliates to, provide notice to Purchaser of any such offset for
which Seller or such Seller Affiliate is entitled to be reimbursed by
Purchaser pursuant to this Section 1.04(c). Purchaser shall pay Seller
promptly following receipt of notice of any such offset by a customer
(together with supporting documentation).

 



 

(d) Seller agrees to reimburse Purchaser, dollar for dollar, in the event
that any of PurchaserÂ’s or its affiliatesÂ’ customers offset any Retained
Liability against accounts payable by such customer to Purchaser or its
affiliates. Purchaser agrees to provide notice to Seller of any such offset
for which Purchaser is entitled to be reimbursed by Seller pursuant to this
Section 1.04(d). Seller shall pay Purchaser promptly following receipt of
notice of any such offset by a customer (together with supporting

shall take place at the offices of Cravath, Swaine and Moore LLP, 825 Eighth

following the satisfaction (or, to the extent permitted, the waiver) of the

be agreed by Seller and Purchaser. The date on which the Closing occurs is
referred to in this Agreement as the " _Closing Date_ ". The Closing shall be
deemed to be effective as of 11:59 p.m. ET on the Closing Date.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 2.02. _Transactions to be Effected at the Closing_.

 



 

(a) Seller shall deliver or cause to be delivered to Purchaser (i) such duly
executed deeds, bills of sale, assignments and other instruments of transfer
relating to the Transferred Assets (other than the Transferred Intellectual
Property) in forms reasonably acceptable to Purchaser, (ii) duly executed
assignments of the Transferred Trademarks, in forms suitable for recording in
the applicable jurisdictions (it being understood that any notarization and/or
legalization required for the recording of any such assignment outside of the
United States may be effectuated after the Closing and shall be the sole
responsibility of Purchaser) in forms reasonably acceptable to Purchaser,
(iii) general assignments of all Other Transferred Intellectual Property in
forms reasonably acceptable to Purchaser, (iv) a duly executed counterpart of
the Transitional Services Agreement, (v) a duly executed counterpart of the
Excluded Technology License (it being understood that such deeds, bills of
sale, assignments and other instruments of transfer shall not require Seller
to make any additional representations, warranties or covenants, expressed or
implied, not contained in this Agreement) and (vi) the officerÂ’s certificates
referred to in Section 6.02; and

 



 

(b) Purchaser shall deliver to Seller and the Seller Affiliates (i) payment,
by wire transfer of immediately available funds to one or more accounts
designated in writing by Seller (such designation to be made at least two
business day prior to the Closing Date), in an amount equal to (A) the
Purchase Price plus or minus (B) an estimate, prepared by Seller and delivered
to Purchaser at least two business day prior to the Closing Date, of any
adjustment to the Purchase Price under Section 2.03 (the Purchase Price plus
or minus such estimate of any adjustment under Section 2.03 being hereinafter
called the " _Closing Date Payment_ "), (ii) duly executed counterparts to
such deeds, bills of sale, assignments and other instruments of transfer, and
appropriately executed assumption agreements and other instruments of
assumption providing for the assumption of the Assumed Liabilities, (iii) an
duly executed counterpart to the Transitional Services Agreement, (iv) a duly
executed counterpart of the Excluded Technology License and (v) the officerÂ’s

Section 2.03. _Post-Closing Purchase Price Adjustment_.

 



 

(a) _The Statement_. Within 60 days after the Closing Date, Seller shall
prepare and deliver to Purchaser a statement (the " _Statement_ "), setting
forth the book value of the Transferred Inventory as of 11:59 p.m. ET on the
Closing Date (" _Closing Inventory_ ") calculated in accordance with the
principles set forth on Schedule 2.03 (the " _Inventory Principles_ "),
whether or not doing so is in accordance with United States generally accepted
accounting principles (" _GAAP_ "). After the Closing Date, at SellerÂ’s
request, Purchaser shall assist Seller and its representatives in the
preparation of the Statement and shall provide Seller and its representatives
any information reasonably requested and shall provide them access at all
reasonable times during normal business hours and upon advance written notice
to the personnel, properties, books and records relating exclusively to the
Business for such purpose. Purchaser and its agents shall be permitted to
observe any physical inventory taken to determine the Closing Inventory.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) _Objections; Resolution of Disputes_.

 



 

(i) Unless Purchaser notifies Seller in writing within 45 days after SellerÂ’s
delivery of the Statement of any objection to the computation of Closing
Inventory set forth therein (the " _Notice of Objection_ "), the Statement
shall become final and binding at the end of such 45-day period. During such
45-day period Purchaser and its representatives shall be permitted to review
the working papers of Seller relating to the Statement and shall be granted
reasonable access to appropriate personnel of Seller responsible for preparing
such Statement. Any Notice of Objection shall specify in reasonable detail the
basis for the objections set forth therein. Any Notice of Objection shall
include only objections based on (A) mathematical errors in the computation of
Closing Inventory or (B) Closing Inventory not having been calculated in
accordance with the Inventory Principles. Seller and Purchaser acknowledge
that (x) the sole purpose of the determination of Closing Inventory is to
adjust the Closing Date Payment so as to reflect, based solely on the
operation of the Business, the amount, if any, by which the book value of the
Closing Inventory as of the close of business on the Closing Date deviates
from the Target Inventory and (y) such amount, if any, can be determined only
if the calculation is done using the same Inventory Principles.

 



 

(ii) If Purchaser provides the Notice of Objection to Seller within such
45-day period, Purchaser and Seller shall, during the 45-day period following
SellerÂ’s receipt of the Notice of Objection, attempt in good faith to resolve
PurchaserÂ’s objections. During such 45-day period, Seller and its
representatives shall be permitted to review the working papers of Purchaser
relating to the Notice of Objection and the basis therefor and shall be
granted reasonable access to appropriate personnel of Purchaser responsible
for preparing such Notice of Objection. If Purchaser and Seller are unable to
resolve all such objections within such 45-day period, the matters remaining
in dispute shall be submitted to Ernst and Young (or, if such firm declines to
act, to another nationally recognized public accounting firm mutually agreed
upon by Purchaser and Seller and, if Purchaser and Seller are unable to so
agree within 10 days after the end of such 45-day period, then Purchaser and
Seller shall each select such a firm and such firms shall jointly select a
third nationally recognized firm to resolve the disputed matters (such
selected firm being the " _Independent Expert_ ")). The parties shall instruct
the Independent Expert to render its reasoned written decision as promptly as
practicable but in no event later than 60 days after its engagement. The
resolution of disputed items by the Independent Expert shall be final and
binding, and the determination of the Independent Expert shall constitute an
arbitral award that is final, binding and non-appealable and upon which a
judgment may be entered by a court having jurisdiction thereover. The fees and
expenses of the Independent Expert shall be borne equally by Purchaser and
Seller. After the Statement shall have become final and binding, neither
Purchaser nor Seller shall have any further right to make any claims against
the other party in respect of (i) any element of Closing Inventory that
Purchaser raised, or could have raised, in the Notice of Objection or (ii) any
payment made pursuant to Section 2.03(c).

 



      
 

 



 

(c) _Adjustment Payment_. The Purchase Price shall be increased by the amount
by which Closing Inventory exceeds $6,500,000 (the " _Target Inventory_ ") by
more than $100,000, and the Purchase Price shall be decreased by the amount by
which Closing Inventory is less than the Target Inventory by more than
$100,000 (the Purchase Price as so increased or decreased being hereinafter
called the " _Adjusted Purchase Price_ "). Within 10 days after the Statement
has become final and binding in accordance with Section 2.03(b), (i) if the
Closing Date Payment is less than the Adjusted Purchase Price, Purchaser shall
pay to Seller an amount equal to such difference, plus simple interest thereon
at a rate of 3% per annum from the Closing Date to the date payment is made in
full, and (ii) if the Closing Date Payment is greater than the Adjusted
Purchase Price, Seller shall pay to Purchaser an amount equal to such
difference, plus simple interest thereon at a rate of 3% per annum from the
Closing Date to the date payment is made in full (the Closing Date Payment as
so increased or decreased being hereinafter called the " _Final Purchase
Price_ "). Any such payment hereunder shall be made by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by Purchaser
or Seller, as the case may be.

 



 

(d) _Post-Closing Books and Records_. Except for the consummation of the
Closing and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Purchaser
and Seller agree that on the Closing Date itself the Business shall be
conducted in the ordinary course in a manner substantially consistent with
past practice. Following the Closing, Purchaser shall not take any action with
respect to the accounting books and records of the Business on which the
Statement is to be based that would affect the Statement. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, no changes shall be made in any reserve or other
account existing as of the date of the Statement that would affect the
Statement except as a result of events occurring after the date of the
Statement and, in such event, only in a manner consistent with the past
practices of the Business.

obligation, enforceable against it in accordance with its terms subject, as to
enforcement, to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, reorganization
or similar laws affecting creditorsÂ’ rights generally and to general equitable
principles.

execution and delivery by Purchaser of each Ancillary Agreement to which it
is, or is specified to be, a party will not, and the consummation of the

the knowledge of Purchaser, threatened against Purchaser or any of its

Guarantor and is a legal valid and binding obligation of Guarantor and the
other parties thereto in full force and effect, and Guarantor has paid all
fees and expenses required thereby or in connection therewith to the extent
required to be paid on or prior to the date hereof and in the future shall pay
any such fees as they become due. The Commitment Letter has not been amended,
supplemented or otherwise modified in any respect, except, in each case, with
the prior written consent of Seller as permitted by Section 5.04, and the

constitute a default or breach on the part of Purchaser or Guarantor or, to
the knowledge of Purchaser or Guarantor, any other parties thereto, under the
Commitment Letter. Purchaser does not have any reason to believe that any of
the conditions to Financing will not be satisfied or that the Financing will

Agreements.

 



 

(b) As of the Closing and immediately after consummating the Acquisition and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary

condition is such that the sum of its debts is greater than the fair value of

to pay its probable liability on its debts as they become absolute and
matured), (ii) have unreasonably small capital with which to engage in its
business, including the Business or (iii) have incurred or plan to incur debts
beyond its ability to repay such debts as they become absolute and matured.

manner consistent with past practice and, to the extent consistent therewith,
use commercially reasonable efforts to preserve the business relationships

the ordinary course of business. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Purchaser
acknowledges and agrees that relationships with Seller and certain of its
affiliates providing services to the Business will terminate as of the Closing

constitute a breach of this Agreement. In addition, except as set forth in
Schedule 5.01 or otherwise contemplated by the terms of this Agreement, Seller
shall not, and shall cause the Seller Affiliates not to, do any of the
following in connection with the Business without the prior written consent of
Purchaser (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed):

Liens;

 



 

(ii) waive any claims or rights of material value that relate primarily to

properties, books, Contracts, commitments and records relating exclusively to
the Business (other than the Excluded Assets) including Product cost sheets,
price lists and Product lists by SKU and location; provided, however, that in
each case such access does not unreasonably disrupt the normal operations of
Seller or any of the Seller Affiliates relating to the Business. Nothing
contained in this Section 5.02 shall obligate Seller or any of its affiliates
to breach any duty of confidentiality owed to any person whether such duty
arises contractually, statutorily or otherwise.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 5.03. _Confidentiality_.

relating solely to the Business (other than information relating to the
Excluded Assets and the personnel engaged in the conduct of the Business);
_provided_ , _however_ , that Purchaser acknowledges that any and all other
information provided to it by Seller or SellerÂ’s representatives concerning
Seller and its affiliates shall remain subject to the terms and conditions of
the Confidentiality Agreement after the Closing Date.

 



 

(b) From and after the Closing Date until the six-year anniversary of the

Section 5.04. _Reasonable Best Efforts; Financing_.

 



 

(a) On the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, each of
Seller and Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the
Closing to occur, including taking all reasonable actions necessary to comply
promptly with all legal requirements that may be imposed on it or any of its
affiliates with respect to the Closing. Seller shall also provide such
reasonable cooperation in connection with the arrangement of the Financing as
may be reasonably requested by Purchaser, including providing information and
documents, and other actions that are or may be customary in connection with
comparable financing transactions or necessary to permit Purchaser to fulfill
conditions or obligations under the Commitment Letter. Each of Seller and
Purchaser shall not, and shall not permit any of their respective affiliates
to, take any actions that would, or that could reasonably be expected to,
result in any of the conditions set forth in Article VI not being satisfied
(including obtaining any consent, authorization, order or approval of, or any
exemption by, any Governmental Entity required to be obtained or made by
Seller or Purchaser in connection with the acquisition of the Transferred
Assets or the taking of any action contemplated by this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements in accordance with their respective terms).

 



 

(b) Each of Seller and Purchaser shall as promptly as practicable, but in no
event later than five business days following the execution and delivery of
this Agreement, (i) file or cause to be filed with the United States Federal
Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ ") and the United States Department of Justice
(the " _DOJ_ ") the notification and report form required for the transactions
contemplated hereby and any supplemental information requested in connection
therewith pursuant to the HSR Act and (ii) make

 



      
 

 



 

such other filings as are necessary in other jurisdictions in order to comply
with all Applicable Laws relating to competition and shall promptly provide
any supplemental information requested by applicable Governmental Entities
relating thereto. Any such filing, notification and report form and
supplemental information shall be in substantial compliance with the
requirements of the HSR Act or such other Applicable Law. Each of Seller and
Purchaser shall furnish on a confidential basis to the other such necessary
information and reasonable assistance as the other may request in connection
with its preparation of any filing or submission that is necessary under the
HSR Act or such other Applicable Law. Each of Seller and Purchaser shall keep
each other apprised of the status of any communications with, and any
inquiries or requests for additional information from, the FTC, the DOJ and
any other applicable Governmental Entity and shall comply promptly with any
such inquiry or request and shall promptly provide any supplemental
information requested in connection with the filings made hereunder pursuant
to the HSR Act or such other Applicable Law. Any such supplemental information
shall be in substantial compliance with the requirements of the HSR Act or
such other Applicable Law. Each party shall use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain any clearance required under the HSR Act or such other Applicable Law
for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
the Ancillary Agreements.

 



 

(c) Purchaser shall, and shall cause its affiliates to, use reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate action, do, or cause to
be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under Applicable Law, and
to execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, such
instruments and documents as may be required, to arrange the Financing as
promptly as reasonably practicable on the terms (including the "market flex"
provisions) and subject only to the conditions contained in the Commitment
Letter, including to (A) negotiate and enter into definitive agreements with
respect to the Financing (x) on the terms (including the "market flex"
provisions) and subject only to the conditions contained in the Commitment
Letter or (y) on other terms that (1) do not contain any additional or
modified conditions or other contingencies to the funding of the Financing
than those contained in the Commitment Letter as of the date of this
Agreement, (2) are in a form that is otherwise not reasonably likely to impair
or delay the funding of the Financing or the Closing and (3) do not reduce the
aggregate amount of the Financing set forth in the Commitment Letter as of the
date of this Agreement, unless in the case of this clause (3), replaced with
an amount of new financing on conditions no less favorable to Seller or
Purchaser than the terms set forth in the Commitment Letter for the Financing
as of the date of this Agreement, (B) satisfy, and cause its affiliates to
satisfy, on a timely basis all conditions applicable to Purchaser or its
affiliates contained in the Commitment Letter and (C) consummate the Financing
contemplated by the Commitment Letter at or prior to the Closing, which
efforts to consummate the Financing may include the taking of enforcement
action to cause the Financing Sources to fund the Financing if the conditions
to such Financing are satisfied. Purchaser shall, and shall cause its
affiliates to, refrain from taking, directly or indirectly, any action that is
reasonably likely to result in the failure of any of the conditions contained
in the Commitment Letter or in any definitive agreement related to the
Financing. For the avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Section 5.04, Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that its
obligation to consummate

 



      
 

 



 

the transactions contemplated by this Agreement on the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth herein are not conditioned upon the availability or
consummation of the Financing, the availability of any replacement commitments
or receipt of the proceeds therefrom.

 



 

(d) Purchaser shall not agree to or permit any amendment, supplement or other
modification of, or waive any of its rights under, the Commitment Letter
without SellerÂ’s prior written consent, except that Purchaser may amend,
supplement or otherwise modify the Commitment Letter if such amendment,
supplement or other modification (1) does not contain additional or modified
conditions or other contingencies to the funding of the Financing relative to
those contained in the Commitment Letter as in effect on the date of this
Agreement and (2) is otherwise not reasonably likely to impair or delay the
funding of the Financing or the Closing (it being understood that, subject to
the requirements of this clause (d), such amendment, supplement or other
modification of the Commitment Letter may provide for the assignment of a
portion of the financing commitment to additional agents or arrangers and
grant such persons approval rights with respect to certain matters as are
customarily granted to additional agents or arrangers).

 



 

(e) If any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable on the terms
(including the "market flex" provisions) and conditions contained in the
Commitment Letter, Purchaser shall promptly notify Seller, and Purchaser shall
use its reasonable best efforts to obtain, as promptly as practicable
following the occurrence of such event, replacement commitments on terms that
will enable Purchaser to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and that are not less favorable in the aggregate to Seller than
those contained in the Commitment Letter; provided that such replacement
commitments shall not (A) be subject to any additional or modified conditions
or other contingencies to the funding of the Financing than those contained in
the Commitment Letter as in effect on the date of this Agreement or (B)
otherwise be reasonably likely to impair or delay the funding of the Financing
or the Closing. Purchaser shall deliver to Seller complete and correct copies
of all amendments, supplements, other modifications or agreements pursuant to
which any amended, supplemented, modified or replacement commitments shall
provide Purchaser with any portion of the Financing; provided that Purchaser
may redact from any such copies the fee amounts payable to the Financing
Sources.

 



 

(f) Purchaser shall keep Seller informed on a timely basis of the status of
the Financing and any material developments relating to the Financing.

 



 

Section 5.05. _Employees_.

 



 

(a) _Offers of Employment_. Purchaser shall not be required to offer
employment to any Business Employee. In the event Purchaser elects, in its
sole discretion, to offer employment to any Business Employee, the terms and
conditions of any such offer of employment shall be in PurchaserÂ’s sole
discretion, subject to Applicable Law. No later than 10 days prior to Closing,
Purchaser shall deliver to Seller a list of each Business Employee to whom
Purchaser has made an offer of employment.

_Transferred Employee_ ".

 



 

(b) _Communications_. Seller shall provide Purchaser with reasonable access
to the Business Employees for purposes of identifying the Business Employees
to whom Purchaser will make an offer of employment. Purchaser shall be
responsible for advising Business Employees of the details of any offers and
terms of employment, and all communications in connection therewith, but
Seller shall be allowed to review and approve, prior to distribution, (i) any
written communication with Business Employees on or prior to the Closing Date
and (ii) any written communication with such Business Employees after the
Closing Date which describes or refers to any of SellerÂ’s benefits or
policies. Such approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

 



 

(c) _Allocation of Liabilities_. Purchaser shall, or shall cause its
Subsidiaries and affiliates to, assume and be solely responsible for all
employment, termination, compensation and benefits-related matters of any
nature that relates to the employment relationship between Purchaser and such
Transferred Employees and all obligations, liabilities and commitments in
respect thereof that arise from the commencement of the Transferred EmployeesÂ’
employment with Purchaser and subsequent services provided to Purchaser after
the Closing. Seller shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries and affiliates to,
remain solely responsible for all employment, termination, compensation and
benefits-related matters of any nature that relates to the employment
relationship between Seller and such Transferred Employees and all
obligations, liabilities and commitments in respect thereof that arise on or
prior to the Closing with respect to all Transferred Employees, as well as all
obligations, liabilities and commitments in respect of (i) awards of equity or
equity-based compensation granted to the Transferred Employees prior to the
Closing and (ii) severance benefits payable to Transferred Employees in
connection with their transfer to Purchaser.

 



 

(d) _Administration_. Following the date of this Agreement, Seller and
Purchaser shall reasonably cooperate in all matters reasonably necessary to

exchanging information and data relating to workers compensation, employee
benefits and employee benefit plan coverages (except to the extent prohibited
by Applicable Law), and in obtaining any governmental approvals required
hereunder.

 



 

(e) _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Nothing contained herein shall be
construed as requiring, and neither Seller nor any of the Seller Affiliates
shall take any action that would have the effect of requiring, Purchaser or
any of its affiliates to continue any specific employee benefit plans. The
provisions of this Section 5.05 are for the sole benefit of the parties to
this Agreement and nothing herein, expressed or implied, is intended or shall
be construed to (i) constitute an amendment to any of the compensation and
benefits plans maintained for or provided to Business Employees prior to or
following the Closing or (ii) confer upon or give to any person, other than
the parties hereto and their respective permitted successors and assigns, any
legal or equitable or other rights or remedies under or by reason of any
provision of this Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

(f) _Employment Tax Reporting Responsibility._ Purchaser and Seller hereby
agree to follow the alternate procedure for employment tax withholding as
provided in Section 5 of Rev. Proc. 2004-53, 2004-34 I.R.B. 320. Accordingly,
Seller shall have no employment tax reporting responsibilities, and Purchaser
shall have full employment tax reporting responsibilities, for Transferred
Employees following the close of business on the Closing Date.

 



 

Section 5.06. _Exclusivity_. Seller has been in negotiations with other
parties concerning a possible sale of the Business and such other parties have
obtained certain information relating thereto. Seller agrees to immediately
terminate, and to cause its affiliates, representatives, agents, officers,
employees, attorneys and accountants to terminate, all existing negotiations
or activities with any such party other than Purchaser, its affiliates and
their representatives. Seller agrees that it will not and will not permit its
affiliates or its affiliatesÂ’ officers, directors, employees, advisors or
other agents or representatives to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit,
entertain, initiate or encourage any inquiries, proposals or offers from any
person relating to any acquisition of the Business or the Transferred Assets

any other person to do or seek any of the foregoing, (A) participate in any
discussions or negotiations, (B) furnish to any other person any confidential
information with respect to the Business in connection with any such effort or
(C) otherwise cooperate in any way with, or assist or participate in, or
facilitate or encourage any such effort, in any such case described in (i) or
(ii), other than with the Purchaser, its affiliates and representatives.

 



 

Section 5.07. _Noncompetition Agreement of Seller_.

 



 

(a) From the Closing Date until the 18 month anniversary of the Closing Date,
Seller agrees not to, and shall cause its affiliates not to, directly or
indirectly, manufacture, market, distribute or sell branded salt-free spice
blend products of the type that the Business sells as of the Closing Date
through retail channels to end-users located in North America (" _Competing
Activity_ "); provided, that Seller and its affiliates may collectively own or
acquire, directly or indirectly: (i) securities of an entity which engages in
a Competing Activity if Seller and its affiliates do not, directly or
indirectly, own more than 20% of any class of securities of such firm or
entity, (ii) any instrument of indebtedness (that is not convertible or
exchangeable for voting securities, except as may be permitted by clause (i)
above) of any entity engaged in a Competing Activity or (iii) securities of
any entity engaged in a Competing Activity within North America if such
Competing Activity accounts for less than 20% of such entityÂ’s consolidated
annual revenues or assets.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything in Section 5.07(a) above to the contrary, Seller
and its affiliates shall not be prevented from (i) continuing to engage in any

affiliates including, without limitation, manufacturing, marketing,
distributing and selling spice blends (including salt-free spice blends not
primarily marketed as salt-free) and seasoning blends and any reasonable
extension or development thereof, (ii) manufacturing, marketing, distributing
and selling any product (other than the Products) through foodservice

compliance with this covenant as soon as practicable after the date of this
Agreement) until the date that is 75 days after the Closing Date, Seller shall

statements and other financial information regarding the Business that is
required to be included in the financial reports and other public disclosures
of Guarantor pursuant to Regulations S-X and S-K promulgated under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the Exchange Act in connection with
the transaction contemplated hereby. Such cooperation shall include assistance
with the preparation of financial statements and all other financial
information necessary for the accounting firm responsible for reviewing and
auditing such financial statements to perform its review and audit, including
the execution and delivery of a reasonable and customary representation letter
to such accounting firm (if and to the extent reasonably required by such
accounting firm). The accounting firm responsible for the review and audit of
such financial statements shall be KPMG LLP unless otherwise determined by
Purchaser. All costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Section
5.08 shall be paid by Purchaser.

 



 

Section 5.09. _Further Assurances_. After the Closing, each party shall take
such further actions and execute such further documents as may be reasonably
necessary or reasonably requested by the other party (including with respect
to information held by Seller or the Seller Affiliates and their agents in
respect of regulatory filings for Transferred Trademarks) in order to
effectuate the intent of this Agreement and to provide such other party in all
material respects with the intended benefits of this Agreement and the

ARTICLE VIII

 



 

 _Indemnification_

 



 

Section 8.01. _Indemnification by Seller_. Subject to the limitations set
forth in Section 8.04, from and after the Closing, Seller shall indemnify,
defend and hold harmless Purchaser and its affiliates and each of their

claims, losses, damages, liabilities, obligations or expenses, including
reasonable third-party legal fees and expenses (collectively, " _Losses_ "),
to the extent arising or resulting from any of the following:

 



 

(a) any breach of any representation or warranty of Seller contained in this
Agreement;

 



 

(b) any breach of any covenant or agreement of Seller contained in this
Agreement;

 



 

(c) any Retained Liability; and

 



      
 

 



 

(d) any fees, expenses or other payments incurred or owed by Seller to any
agent, broker, investment banker or other firm or person retained or employed
by it in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

Section 8.02. _Indemnification by Purchaser_. Subject to the limitations set
forth in Section 8.04, from and after the Closing, Purchaser shall indemnify,
defend and hold harmless Seller and each of its affiliates and each of their
respective officers, directors, employees, stockholders, agents and
representatives (the " _Seller Indemnitees_ ") from and against any and all
Losses, to the extent arising or resulting from any of the following:

 



 

(a) any breach of any representation or warranty of Purchaser contained in
this Agreement;

 



 

(b) any breach of any covenant or agreement of Purchaser contained in this
Agreement;

 



 

(c) any Assumed Liability; and

 



 

(d) any fees, expenses or other payments incurred or owed by Purchaser or its
affiliates to any agent, broker, investment banker or other firm or person
retained or employed by it in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

 



 

Section 8.03. _Indemnification Procedures_.

 



 

(a) _Procedures Relating to Indemnification of Third Party Claims_. If any
party (the " _Indemnified Party_ ") receives written notice of the
commencement of any action or proceeding or the assertion of any claim by a
third party or the imposition of any penalty or assessment for which indemnity
may be sought under Section 8.01 or 8.02 (a " _Third Party Claim_ "), and such
Indemnified Party intends to seek indemnity pursuant to this Article VIII, the
Indemnified Party shall promptly provide the other party (the " _Indemnifying
Party_ ") with written notice of such Third Party Claim, stating the nature,
basis and the amount thereof, to the extent known, along with copies of the
relevant documents evidencing such Third Party Claim and the basis for
indemnification sought. Failure of the Indemnified Party to give such notice
will not relieve the Indemnifying Party from liability on account of this
indemnification, except if and to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is
actually prejudiced thereby. The Indemnifying Party will have 60 days from
receipt of any such notice of a Third Party Claim to give notice to assume the
defense thereof. If notice to the effect set forth in the immediately
preceding sentence is given by the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnifying Party
will have the right to assume the defense of the Indemnified Party against the
Third Party Claim with counsel of its choice, which counsel must be reasonably
acceptable to the Indemnified Party. So long as the Indemnifying Party has
assumed the defense of the Third Party Claim in accordance herewith, (i) the
Indemnified Party may retain separate co-counsel at its sole cost and expense
and participate in the defense of the Third Party Claim, (ii) the Indemnified
Party will not file any papers or consent to the entry of any judgment or
enter into any settlement with respect to the Third Party Claim without the
prior written

 



      
 

 



 

consent of the Indemnifying Party and (iii) the Indemnifying Party will not
(A) admit to any wrongdoing or (B) consent to the entry of any judgment or
enter into any settlement with respect to the Third Party Claim to the extent
such judgment or settlement provides for equitable relief, in each case,
without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (such written
consent will not be withheld or delayed unreasonably). The parties will use
reasonable best efforts to minimize Losses from Third Party Claims and will
act in good faith in responding to, defending against, settling or otherwise
dealing with such claims. The parties will also cooperate in any such defense
and give each other reasonable access to all information relevant thereto.
Whether or not the Indemnifying Party has assumed the defense, such
Indemnifying Party will not be obligated to indemnify the Indemnified Party
hereunder for any settlement entered into or any judgment that was consented
to without the Indemnifying PartyÂ’s prior written consent.

 



 

(b) _Procedures for Non-Third Party Claims_. The Indemnified Party will
notify the Indemnifying Party in writing promptly of its discovery of any
matter that does not involve a Third Party Claim being asserted against or
sought to be collected from the Indemnified Party, giving rise to the claim of
indemnity pursuant hereto. The failure so to notify the Indemnifying Party
shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party from liability on account of this
indemnification, except only to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is
actually prejudiced thereby. The Indemnifying Party will have 45 days from
receipt of any such notice to give written notice of dispute of the claim to
the Indemnified Party, which notice shall state in reasonable detail the
reason for such dispute. The Indemnified Party will reasonably cooperate and
assist the Indemnifying Party in determining the validity of any claim for
indemnity by the Indemnified Party and in otherwise resolving such matters.
Such assistance and cooperation will include providing reasonable access, in a
manner that does not unreasonably disrupt the normal operation of the business
of the Indemnified Party, to and copies of information, records and documents
relating to such matters, furnishing employees to assist in the investigation,
defense and resolution of such matters and providing legal and business
assistance with respect to such matters.

 



 

Section 8.04. _Limits on Indemnification_.

 



 

(a) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Article VIII:

 



 

(i) Seller shall not be responsible, pursuant to Section 8.01(a) or (b), for
any indemnifiable Losses suffered by any Purchaser Indemnitee arising out of a
breach of any representation, warranty or covenant or agreement of Seller
herein unless a claim therefor is asserted in writing within the applicable
time period specified in Section 8.04(b), failing which such claim shall be
waived and extinguished;

 



 

(ii) Seller shall not be liable, pursuant to Section 8.01(a), for (x) any
Losses suffered by any Purchaser Indemnitee unless the aggregate of all Losses
suffered by the Purchaser Indemnitees exceeds, on a cumulative basis, an
amount equal to $5,687,500, and then only to the extent of any such excess or
(y) any individual items or series of related items where the Loss relating
thereto is less than $25,000 and such items shall not be aggregated for

 



       
 

 



 

purposes of the immediately preceding clause (x); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the foregoing limitations shall not apply to Losses arising or resulting
from (i) any breach of the representations or warranties made in Sections
3.01, 3.02, 3.05, 3.06(a) or 3.20 or (ii) fraud on the part of Seller;

(iv) neither party hereto shall be liable to the other for indirect, special,
consequential or punitive damages claimed by such other party (other than

breach of its representations, warranties or covenants hereunder;

 



 

(v) in no event shall Seller be obligated to indemnify the Purchaser
Indemnitees or any other person with respect to any matter to the extent that
such matter was taken into account in the calculation of the adjustment to the
Closing Date Payment, if any, pursuant to Section 2.03(c); and

 



 

(vi) the aggregate liability of Seller pursuant to Sections 8.01(a) and (b)
shall in no event exceed $325,000,000.

 



 

(b) No action or claim for Losses under Section 8.01(a) or 8.02(a) arising
out of or resulting from a breach of representations and warranties described

3.02, 3.05, 3.06(a) or 3.20, 4.01, 4.02, 4.05 or 4.06, and claims of, or

Section 8.01(b) arising out of or resulting from a breach of covenants or
agreements shall terminate when the applicable covenant or agreement

(c) Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that, (i) other than the
representations and warranties of Seller specifically contained in this
Agreement and in the Ancillary Agreements, none of Seller, any of its
affiliates or any other person has made any representation or warranty either
expressed or implied (A) with respect to the Business, the Transferred Assets,
the Assumed Liabilities or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
the Ancillary Agreements or (B) as to the accuracy or

 



      
 

 



 

completeness of any information regarding the Business, the Transferred
Assets, the Assumed Liabilities or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or by the Ancillary Agreements furnished or made available to
Purchaser and its representatives and (ii) Purchaser shall have no claim or
right to indemnification pursuant to this Article VIII and none of Seller, any
of the Seller Affiliates or any other person shall have or be subject to any
liability to Purchaser or any other person with respect to any information,
documents or materials furnished by Seller, any of its affiliates or any of
their respective officers, directors, employees, agents or advisors to
Purchaser, including the Confidential Information Memorandum dated August 2011
prepared by Deloitte Corporate Finance LLC and any information, documents or
material made available to Purchaser and its representatives in certain "data
rooms" (whether electronic or otherwise), management presentations or any
other form in expectation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
or the Ancillary Agreements (it being understood that this clause (ii) does
not supersede or otherwise affect the representations and warranties of Seller
specifically contained in this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements).
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Purchaser acknowledges and
agrees that, except as expressly set forth in this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements, Seller does not make any representations or warranties relating to
the maintenance, repair, condition, design, performance or marketability of
any Transferred Asset, including merchantability or fitness for a particular
purpose. Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that it shall obtain rights in the
Transferred Assets in their present condition and state of repair, "as is" and
"where is".

 



 

(d) Each of Purchaser and Seller acknowledges and agrees that, should the
Closing occur, its sole and exclusive remedy with respect to any and all
claims relating to this Agreement, the Business, the Transferred Assets, the
Excluded Assets, the Assumed Liabilities, the Retained Liabilities or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (other than (i) a claim for
payment due pursuant to Section 2.03(c), (ii) claims of, or causes of action
arising from, fraud, or (iii) causes of action arising from the Ancillary
Agreements or Article XI hereof) shall be pursuant to the indemnification
provisions set forth in this Article VIII. In furtherance of the foregoing,
(i) Purchaser hereby waives, from and after the Closing, any and all rights,
claims and causes of action (other than (A) a claim for payment due pursuant
to Section 2.03(c), (B) claims of, or causes of action arising from, fraud, or
(C) causes of action arising from the Ancillary Agreements) Purchaser or any
other Purchaser Indemnitee may have against Seller or any of the Seller
Affiliates or any of their respective directors, officers and employees
arising under or based upon any Federal, state, provincial, local or foreign
statute, law, ordinance, rule or regulation or otherwise (except pursuant to
the indemnification provisions set forth in this Article VIII) and (ii) Seller
hereby waives, from and after the Closing, any and all rights, claims and
causes of action (other than (A) a claim for payment due pursuant to Section
2.03(c), (B) claims of, or causes of action arising from, fraud, and (C)
causes of action arising from the Ancillary Agreements or Article XI hereof)
Seller or any other Seller Indemnitee may have against Purchaser or any of its
affiliates or any of their respective directors, officers and employees
arising under or based upon any Federal, state, provincial, local or foreign
statute, law, ordinance, rule or regulation or otherwise (except pursuant to
the indemnification provisions set forth in this Article VIII).

 



      
 

 



 

Section 8.05. _Calculation of Indemnity Payments_. The amount of any Loss for
which indemnification is provided under this Article VIII shall be net of any
amounts actually received by the Indemnified Party under third party insurance
policies with respect to such Loss and shall be (a) increased to take account
of any net Tax cost actually incurred by the Indemnified Party arising from
the receipt of indemnity payments hereunder (grossed up for such increase) and
(b) reduced to take account of any net Tax benefit actually realized by the
Indemnified Party arising from the incurrence or payment of any such
indemnified amount. In computing the amount of any such Tax cost or Tax
benefit, the Indemnified Party shall be deemed to recognize all other items of
income, gain, loss, deduction or credit before recognizing any item arising
from the receipt of any indemnity payment hereunder or the incurrence or
payment of any indemnified amount. Solely for purposes of calculating the
amount of Losses incurred out of or relating to any breach of a representation
or warranty (and not for purposes of determining whether or not a breach has
occurred), the references to "Business Material Adverse Effect," "Purchaser
Material Adverse Effect" or other materiality qualifications (or correlative
terms), shall be disregarded.

 



 

Section 8.06. _Tax Treatment of Indemnification_. For all Tax purposes,
Purchaser and Seller agree to treat (and shall cause each of their respective
affiliates to treat) any indemnity payment under this Agreement as an
adjustment to the Final Purchase Price unless a final determination by the IRS
or other applicable Taxing Authority provides otherwise.

 



 

ARTICLE IX

 



 

 _Tax Matters_

 



 

Section 9.01. _Tax Matters_.

 



 

(a) _Allocation of Certain Taxes_. In the case of any Straddle Period, (i)
Property Taxes for the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be equal to the amount of
such Property Taxes for the entire Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction,
the numerator of which is the number of days during the Straddle Period that
is in the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the denominator of which is the number of
days in the entire Straddle Period, and shall be an Excluded Liability and
(ii) Property Taxes for the Post-Closing Tax Period shall be equal to the
amount of such Property Taxes for the entire Straddle Period multiplied by a
fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days during the Straddle
Period that is in the Post-Closing Tax Period and the denominator of which is
the number of days in the entire Straddle Period, and shall be an Assumed
Liability. The party that has the primary obligation to do so under Applicable
Law shall file any Tax Return that is required to be filed in respect of Taxes
described in this Section 9.01(a), and that party shall pay the Taxes shown on
such Tax Return. To the extent any such Taxes paid by Purchaser (or any refund
of Taxes received by Purchaser) is allocable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period, or
any such Taxes paid by Seller (or any refund of Taxes received by Seller) is
allocable to the Post-Closing Tax Period, Purchaser or Seller (as applicable)
shall pay to the other party such proportionate amount promptly after the
payment of such Taxes (or the receipt of any such refund).

 



      
 

 



 

(b) _Purchase Price Allocations_.

 



 

(i) At least seven calendar days prior to the Closing Date, Purchaser shall
provide Seller with an estimate of the allocation of the total consideration
(including liabilities assumed) among the Transferred Assets, with a single
number for all of the Transferred Assets of each of Seller and each of the
Seller Affiliates. This estimate will be used at the Closing. If Seller does
not agree with such estimate, Seller and Purchaser shall use good faith
efforts to agree on an estimate prior to the Closing Date. If the parties
cannot agree on such estimate prior to the Closing Date, PurchaserÂ’s estimate
shall be used for allocating the total consideration pursuant to this
Agreement at the Closing.

 



 

(ii) Without regard to the estimate determined pursuant to Section 9.01(b)(i),
within 90 calendar days of the determination of the Final Purchase Price,
Purchaser shall provide Seller a proposed allocation (the " _Allocation_ ") of
the total consideration (including liabilities assumed) among the Transferred
Assets, as well as with a single amount for all of the Transferred Assets of
each of Seller and each of the Seller Affiliates. The Allocation shall be
consistent with Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations
thereunder. However, any amount allocated to the inventory of Unilever Canada
Inc. will not exceed 100% of the book value of such inventory (as determined
using principles consistent with determining book value for Closing Inventory
pursuant to Section 2.03(a)). The Allocation Statement shall become final and
binding 20 calendar days after Purchaser provides the Allocation to Seller,
unless Seller reasonably objects (in which case, Seller shall propose an
allocation). If the parties cannot agree on the Allocation, each party shall
be entitled to use its own valuation.

 



 

(iii) Seller (and its affiliates) and Purchaser (and its affiliates) agree to
file all Tax Returns consistent with the final versions of the allocations and
forms described in this Section 9.01.

 



 

(c) _Transfer Taxes_.

 



 

(i) Seller and Purchaser shall cooperate in timely making all filings,
returns, reports and forms as may be required in connection with PurchaserÂ’s
and SellerÂ’s payment of Transfer Taxes. Each party shall execute and deliver
all instruments and certificates reasonably necessary to enable the other to
comply with any filing requirements relating to any such Transfer Taxes.

 



 

(ii) The Purchaser, on the one hand, and Seller and Seller Affiliates, on the
other hand, shall equally pay all Transfer Taxes; provided, however, that each
of Seller and each of the Seller Affiliates shall use reasonable efforts to
avail itself of any available exemptions from any such Transfer Taxes, and to
cooperate with the other parties in providing any information and
documentation that may be necessary to obtain such exemption.

 



      
 

 



 

(iii) Notwithstanding Section 9.01(c)(ii), Purchaser shall pay or pay over to
Seller any Canadian Federal Goods and Services Tax imposed pursuant to Part IX
of the Excise Tax Act (Canada) ("GST"), Harmonized Sales Tax imposed pursuant
to Part IX of the Excise Tax Act (Canada) ("HST") and Quebec Sales Tax imposed
pursuant to the Act respecting the Quebec sales tax(Quebec) ("QST") imposed on
the transfer of the Transferred Assets (GST, HST and QST together, the
"Canadian Taxes"). In the event that Purchaser reasonably determines after
registering and timely filing appropriate Tax Returns that it cannot recover,
as refunds or as a direct offset to a Tax liability, all or a portion of the
Canadian Taxes from the appropriate Tax authority, Seller shall pay to
Purchaser 50% of the Canadian Taxes that Purchaser cannot recover. If,
subsequent to Seller paying to Purchaser an amount pursuant to this Section
9.01(c)(iii), Purchaser obtains a recovery of the Canadian Taxes from the
appropriate Tax authority, Purchaser shall repay 50% of the recovered amounts
to Seller.

 



 

(d) Purchaser, Seller and each of the Seller Affiliates agree to provide each
other with such information and assistance as is reasonably necessary,
including access to records and personnel, for the preparation of any Tax
Returns or for the defense of any Tax claim or assessment, whether in
connection with an audit or otherwise.

 



 

(e) Seller shall furnish to Purchaser on or prior to the Closing Date, a
certificate of its non-foreign status complying with the provisions of United
States Treasury Regulation Section 1.1445-2(b).

delayed), except as such release or announcement may be required by law or the
rules or regulations of any United States or foreign securities exchange, in
which case the party required to make the release or announcement shall, to
the extent practicable, use commercially reasonable efforts to allow the other
party reasonable time to comment on such release or announcement in advance of

that for a period of 270 days after the Closing Date, Purchaser may continue
to distribute product literature relating to the Business that uses any Names
and distribute Products with labeling that uses any Names to the extent that
such product literature and labeling exists on the Closing Date. In no event
shall Purchaser or the Business use any Names after the Closing in any manner
or for any purpose different from the use of such Names by Seller and the
Seller Affiliates during the 90-day period preceding the Closing. With respect
to the Transferred Inventory, Purchaser may continue to sell such Transferred
Inventory, notwithstanding that it bears one or more of the Names, for a
reasonable time after the Closing (not to exceed 270 days). " _Names_ " means
"Unilever", "Alberto", "Alberto-Culver" and "Culver Specialty Brands" and any

Affiliates not to (i), directly or indirectly, use any trademark set forth on

trademarks or (iii) renew the registrations for any such trademarks upon the
natural expiration of such registrations.

 



 

Section 10.03. _Support Services_. Purchaser acknowledges that as of the
Closing Date, neither Seller nor any of its affiliates shall have any
obligation to provide any support or other services to Purchaser relating to
the Business other than those services expressly required to be provided
pursuant to (i) the transitional services agreement in the form attached
hereto as Exhibit B (the " _Transitional Services Agreement_ ") and (ii) the
Excluded Technology License, each of which agreements shall be entered into by
Seller and Purchaser as of the Closing Date.

Purchaser shall afford or cause to be afforded to Seller and its affiliates
reasonable access to the personnel, properties, books, Contracts, commitments
and records relating to the Business for any reasonable business purpose,
including in respect of litigation, insurance matters and financial reporting
of Seller and its affiliates; _provided_ , _however_ , that such access does
not unreasonably disrupt the normal operations of Purchaser or any of its
affiliates. Nothing contained in this Section 10.04(a) shall oblige Purchaser
or any of its affiliates to breach any duty of confidentiality owed to any
person whether such duty arises contractually, statutorily or otherwise.

 



 

(b) Following the Closing, upon reasonable written notice to Seller, Seller
shall, or shall cause the Seller Affiliates to, afford to Purchaser and its
affiliates

 



      
 

 



 

reasonable access to SellerÂ’s or the Seller AffiliatesÂ’ personnel, properties,

any other documents or records necessary to allow Purchaser or its affiliates
to prepare any Tax Returns, for any reasonable business purpose, including in
respect of litigation, insurance matters, financial reporting and Preparation
of any Tax Returns of Purchaser and its affiliates; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that such access does not unreasonably disrupt the normal operations of Seller
or any of its affiliates and shall be subject to the withholding or redaction
by Seller of any such materials to the extent they do not relate to the
Business. Nothing contained in this Section 10.04(b) shall oblige Seller or
any of its affiliates to breach any duty of confidentiality owed to any person
whether such duty arises contractually, statutorily or otherwise.

 



 

Section 10.05. _Records_. Purchaser recognizes that certain records may
contain information relating to subsidiaries, divisions or businesses of
Seller and its affiliates other than the Business and that Seller and its
affiliates may, subject to SellerÂ’s obligations under Section 5.03 hereof,
retain copies thereof.

 



 

Section 10.06. _Refunds and Remittances_. After the Closing, if Seller or any
of its affiliates receive any refund or other amount which is a Transferred
Asset or is otherwise properly due and owing to Purchaser in accordance with

remitted, such amount to Purchaser at the address set forth in Section 12.04.
After the Closing, if Purchaser or any of its affiliates receive any refund or
other amount which is an Excluded Asset or is otherwise properly due and owing

Agreement, Purchaser promptly shall remit, or shall cause to be remitted, such

remit, or cause to be remitted, such amount to Seller at the address set forth

Seller the due and punctual payment and performance of, and compliance by

(b) Guarantor guarantees that the Guaranteed Obligations will be satisfied
strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. The liabilities and
obligations of the Guarantor under or in respect of this Section 11.01 are

(c) GuarantorÂ’s obligations under this Section 11.01 shall not be released or
discharged by any or all of the following: (i) any change in the time, manner

this Agreement; (v) any bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, arrangement,
readjustment, composition, liquidation or similar proceeding with respect to
Guarantor or Purchaser or their respective properties, or any action taken by
any trustee or receiver or by any court in any such proceeding, subject to
bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and
similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditorsÂ’
rights and to general equity principles; or (vi) any change in the name or
ownership of Purchaser or any other person referred to herein.

 



 

(d) Guarantor hereby waives (i) notice of acceptance of this guarantee, (ii)
presentment and demand concerning the liabilities of Guarantor and (iii) any
right to require that any action be brought against Purchaser or any other
person, or to require that Seller seek enforcement of any performance against
Purchaser or any other person prior to any action against Guarantor under the
terms hereof.

 



 

(e) Except as to applicable statutes of limitation, no delay of Seller in the
exercise of, or failure to exercise, any rights under this Section 11.01 shall
operate as a waiver of such rights, a waiver of any other rights, or a release
of Guarantor from any obligations hereunder.

 



 

(f) Guarantor hereby represents and warrants to Seller as follows:

 



 

(i) Guarantor is validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
jurisdiction in which it is organized and has full corporate power and
authority and possesses all governmental franchises, licenses, permits,
authorizations and approvals necessary to enable it to own, lease or otherwise
hold its properties and assets and to carry on its business as presently
conducted, other than such franchises, licenses, permits, authorizations and
approvals the lack of which would not reasonably be expected to have a
material adverse effect on its ability to perform its obligations hereunder.

 



      
 

 



 

(ii) Guarantor has full power and authority to execute this Agreement.
Guarantor has taken all action required by its organizational documents to
authorize the execution and delivery of this Agreement. This Agreement
constitutes its legal, valid and binding obligation, enforceable against it in
accordance with its terms subject, as to enforcement, to applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, reorganization or similar laws affecting
creditorsÂ’ rights generally and to general equitable principles.

 



 

(iii) The execution and delivery by Guarantor of this Agreement do not
conflict with, or result in any breach of or constitute a default under, or
result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the properties or assets of
Guarantor under, any provision of (i) the organizational documents of
Guarantor, (ii) any Contract to which Guarantor is a party or by which any of
its properties or assets is bound or (iii) any Judgment or Applicable Law
applicable to Guarantor or its properties or assets, other than, in the case
of clauses (ii) and (iii) above, any such items that would not reasonably be
