iv AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 

THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER ("Agreement") is made and entered into as
of November 30, 2011, by and among: SYNOPSYS, INC., a Delaware corporation
("Parent"); LOTUS ACQUISITION CORP., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-
owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"); and MAGMA DESIGN AUTOMATION, INC.,
a Delaware corporation (the "Company"). Certain capitalized terms used in this
Agreement are defined in Exhibit A.

RECITALS

A. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company intend to effect a merger of Merger Sub
into the Company (the "Merger") in accordance with this Agreement and the
DGCL. Upon the consummation of the Merger, Merger Sub will cease to exist, and
the Company will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent.

B. The respective boards of directors of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company
have approved this Agreement and the Merger.

C. In order to induce Parent to enter into this Agreement and cause the Merger
to be consummated, certain stockholders of the Company are executing voting
and support agreements in favor of Parent concurrently with the execution and
delivery of this Agreement (the "Support Agreements").

 

AGREEMENT

The parties to this Agreement, intending to be legally bound, agree as
follows:

 

Section 1\. DESCRIPTION OF TRANSACTION

 

1.1 Merger of Merger Sub into the Company. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub
shall be merged with and into the Company, and the separate existence of
Merger Sub shall cease. The Company will continue as the surviving corporation
in the Merger (the "Surviving Corporation"). 

1.2 Effects of the Merger. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in this
Agreement and in the applicable provisions of the DGCL.

1.3 Closing; Effective Time. The consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement (the "Closing") shall take place at the offices of Dewey and
LeBoeuf LLP, 1950 University Avenue, Suite 500, East Palo Alto, California, at
8:00 a.m. (California time) on the fifth business day after the satisfaction
or waiver of the last to be satisfied or waived of the conditions set forth in
_Section 6_ and _Section 7_ (other than the conditions set forth in _Section
6.4_ and _Section 7.4 _which by their nature are to be satisfied at the
Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of each of such conditions
and all other conditions to the Closing) unless Parent designates an earlier
date for the Closing, which earlier date shall not be earlier than the second
business day after the satisfaction or waiver of the last to be satisfied or
waived of the conditions set forth in _Section 6_ and _Section 7_ (other
than the conditions set forth in  _Section 6.4_ and _Section 7.4_). The
date on which the Closing actually takes place is referred to as the "Closing
Date." Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, a certificate of merger
satisfying the applicable requirements of the DGCL shall be duly executed by
the Company in connection with the Closing and, concurrently with or as soon
as practicable following the Closing, filed with the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware. The Merger shall become effective at the time of the
filing of such certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of the State
of Delaware or at such later time as may be specified in such certificate of
merger with the consent of the parties (the time as of which the Merger
becomes effective being referred to as the "Effective Time").

 



1 1.4 Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws; Directors and Officers. At the
Effective Time:

(a) the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be
amended in its entirety pursuant to the Merger to read as set forth on
Exhibit B;

(b) the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated to
read as set forth on Exhibit C; and

(c) the directors and officers of the Surviving Corporation shall be the
respective individuals who are directors and officers of Merger Sub
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 

1.5 Conversion of Shares.

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further
action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any stockholder of
the Company:

 

(i) any shares of Company Common Stock held by the Company or any wholly-owned
Subsidiary of the Company (or held in the Companys treasury) immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall continue to be so held and no consideration
shall be paid or payable in respect thereof;

 

(ii) any shares of Company Common Stock held by Parent, Merger Sub or any
other wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall remain issued and outstanding;

(iii) except as provided in _clause (i)_ and _clause (ii)_ of this _Section
1.5(a)_ and subject to _Section 1.5(b)_, _Section 1.7_ and _Section 1.8_,
each share of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into the right to receive $7.35 in cash,
without interest; and

 

(iv) each share of the common stock, $0.001 par value per share, of Merger Sub
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
one share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

(b) If, during the period commencing on the date of this Agreement and ending
at the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock are
changed into a different number or class of shares by reason of any stock
split, division or subdivision of shares, stock dividend, reverse stock
split, consolidation of shares, reclassification, recapitalization or other
similar transaction, or if a stock dividend is declared by the Company during
such period, or a record date with respect to any such event shall occur
during such period, then the consideration to be delivered in respect of
shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to _Section 1.5(a)(iii)_ shall be
adjusted, to the extent appropriate, to reflect such event.

 

1.6 Closing of the Companys Transfer Books. At the Effective Time: (a)
subject to _Section 1.5(a)(i)_ and  _Section 1.5(a)(ii)_, all shares of
Company Common Stock outstanding immediately

 



2  prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease
to exist, and all holders of certificates representing shares of Company
Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall cease to have any rights as stockholders of the Company; and (b) the
stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed with respect to all shares
of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.
No further transfer of any such shares of Company Common Stock shall be made
on such stock transfer books after the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, a valid certificate previously representing any shares of Company
Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (a "Company
Stock Certificate") is presented to the Paying Agent (as defined in _Section
1.7_) or to the Surviving Corporation or Parent, such Company Stock
Certificate shall be cancelled and shall be exchanged as provided in _Section
1.7_.

1.7 Exchange of Certificates.

(a) On or prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall select a reputable bank or
trust company to act as paying agent in the Merger (the "Paying Agent"). At
or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to be deposited with the
Paying Agent cash sufficient to make payments of the cash consideration
payable pursuant to  _Section 1.5_ (the "Payment Fund"). The Payment Fund
shall be invested by the Payment Agent as directed by Parent.

(b) Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to
mail to the Persons who were record holders of Company Stock Certificates or
uncertificated shares of Company Common Stock represented by a book entry
("Book Entry Shares") immediately prior to the Effective Time: (i) a letter of
transmittal in customary form and containing such provisions as Parent may
reasonably specify (including a provision confirming that delivery of Company
Stock Certificates or transfer of Book Entry Shares shall be effected, and
risk of loss and title to Company Stock Certificates or Book Entry Shares
shall pass, only upon delivery of such Company Stock Certificates or transfer
of Book Entry Shares to the Paying Agent); and (ii) instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of Company Stock Certificates or Book Entry Shares in
exchange for Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Company Stock
Certificate to the Paying Agent for exchange, together with a duly executed
letter of transmittal and such other documents as may be reasonably required
by the Paying Agent or Parent, or compliance with the reasonable procedures
established by the Paying Agent for delivery of Book Entry Shares: (A) the
holder of such Company Stock Certificate or Book Entry Shares shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor the cash consideration that such
holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of _Section 1.5_,
in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common
Stock formerly represented by such Company Stock Certificate or Book Entry
Shares; and (B) the Company Stock Certificate or Book Entry Shares so
surrendered shall be cancelled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of any
shares of Company Common Stock that are not registered in the transfer records
of the Company, payment of Merger Consideration may be made to a Person other
than the holder in whose name the Company Stock Certificate formerly
representing such shares or Book Entry Shares is registered if: (1) any such
Company Stock Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be
in proper form for transfer; and (2) such holder shall have paid any
fiduciary or surety bonds (on such terms as Parent may reasonably direct) and
any transfer or other similar Taxes required by reason of the payment of such
Merger Consideration to a Person other than such holder (or shall have
established to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent that such bonds and Taxes
have been paid or are not applicable). Until surrendered as contemplated by
this _Section 1.7(b)_, each Company Stock Certificate and each Book Entry
Share shall be deemed, from and after the Effective Time, to represent only
the right to receive Merger Consideration as contemplated by _Section 1.5_.
If any Company Stock Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
Parent may, in its reasonable discretion and as a condition precedent to the
delivery of any Merger Consideration with respect to the shares of Company
Common Stock previously represented by such Company Stock Certificate,
require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed

 



3  Company Stock Certificate to provide an appropriate affidavit and to deliver
a bond (in such sum and on such other terms as Parent may reasonably direct)
as indemnity against any claim that may be made against the Paying Agent,
Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Company
Stock Certificate. No interest shall be paid or will accrue on any cash
payable to holders of Company Stock Certificates or Book Entry Shares
pursuant to the provisions of this _Section 1.7_.

(c) Any portion of the Payment Fund that remains undistributed to holders of
Company Stock Certificates as of the date that is 180 days after the Effective
Time shall be delivered to Parent upon demand, and any holders of Company
Common Stock who have not theretofore surrendered their Company Stock
Certificates or Book Entry Shares in accordance with this _Section 1.7_ shall
thereafter look only to Parent for satisfaction of their claims for Merger
Consideration.

 

(d) Each of the Paying Agent, Parent, Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration payable or
otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder or former
holder of Company Common Stock or Company Equity Award such amounts as may be
required to be deducted or withheld from such consideration under the Code or
any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law or under any other applicable
Legal Requirement. To the extent such amounts are so deducted or withheld,
such amounts shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having
been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid.

(e) If any Company Stock Certificate or Book Entry Share has not been
surrendered by the earlier of: (i) the fifth anniversary of the date on which
the Merger becomes effective; or (ii) the date immediately prior to the date
on which the cash amount that such Company Stock Certificate or Book Entry
Share represents the right to receive would otherwise escheat to or become the
property of any Governmental Body, then such cash amount shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, become the property of the
Surviving Corporation, free and clear of any claim or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto.

(f) None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent
shall be liable to any holder or former holder of Company Common Stock or to
any other Person with respect to any Merger Consideration delivered to any
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property law, escheat
law or similar Legal Requirement.

1.8 Dissenting Shares

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
shares of Company Common Stock held by a holder who has made a proper demand
for appraisal of such shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with
Section 262 of the DGCL and who has otherwise complied with all applicable
provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL (any such shares being referred to as
"Dissenting Shares" until such time as such holder fails to perfect or
otherwise loses such holders appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL
with respect to such shares) shall not be converted into or represent the
right to receive Merger Consideration in accordance with _Section 1.5_, but
shall be entitled only to such rights as are granted by the DGCL to a holder
of Dissenting Shares.

 

(b) If any holders of Dissenting Shares shall lose their right to appraisal of
such shares of Company Common Stock under Section 262 of the DGCL (through
failure to perfect or otherwise), then such shares shall be deemed
automatically to have been converted into, as of the Effective Time, and to
represent only, the right to receive Merger Consideration in accordance with
_Section 1.5_, without interest thereon, upon surrender of the Company Stock
Certificate or Book Entry Shares representing such shares in accordance with
_Section 1.7_.

 



4 (c) The Company shall give Parent: (i) prompt notice of any demand for
appraisal received by the Company prior to the Effective Time pursuant to the
DGCL, any withdrawal of any such demand and any other demand, notice or
instrument delivered to the Company prior to the Effective Time pursuant to
the DGCL; and (ii) the opportunity to participate in and direct all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such demand, notice or
instrument. The Company shall not make any payment or settlement offer prior
to the Effective Time with respect to any such demand, notice or instrument
unless Parent shall have given its prior written consent to such payment or
settlement offer.

1.9 Further Action. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further
action is determined by Parent or the Surviving Corporation to be necessary or
desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving
Corporation with full right, title and possession of and to all rights and
property of Merger Sub and the Company, the officers and directors of the
Surviving Corporation and Parent shall be fully authorized (in the name of
Merger Sub, in the name of the Company and otherwise) to take such action.

Section 2\. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

The Company represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as follows (it
being understood that each representation and warranty contained in this
_Section 2_ is subject to and qualified by: (a) subject to _Section 9.6_,
the exceptions and disclosures set forth in the Disclosure Schedule; and (b)
disclosure in the Annual Report on Form 10-K of the Company for the year ended
May 1, 2011 (the "Company Form 10-K"), the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for
the fiscal quarter ended July 31, 2011, and the Current Reports on Form 8-K
filed from the date of the filing of the Company Form 10-K to the date of this
Agreement (excluding any risk factor disclosures contained in such document
under the heading "Risk Factors" and any disclosure of risks included in any
"forward-looking statements" disclaimer or other statements that are similarly
predictive or forward-looking in nature)):

 

2.1 Organization; Good Standing. The Company is a corporation duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of
Delaware, and has the requisite corporate power and authority: (a) to conduct
its business as it is presently being conducted; (b) to own, lease or operate
its properties and assets in a manner in which its properties and assets are
currently owned, leased or operated; and (c) to perform its obligations under
all Contracts by which it is bound. The Company is qualified to do business
and is in good standing (or equivalent status) in each jurisdiction where
the character of its properties owned or leased or the nature of its
activities make such qualification necessary, except where the failure to be
so qualified or in good standing (or equivalent status) would not have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. The Company has
made available accurate and complete copies of the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws of the Company, including all amendments thereto. The
Company is not in violation of its certificate of incorporation or bylaws.

2.2 Corporate Power; Enforceability. The Company has all requisite corporate
power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement, to perform its
covenants and obligations hereunder and, subject to obtaining the Requisite
Stockholder Approval, to consummate the Contemplated Transactions. The
execution and delivery by the Company of this Agreement, the performance by
the Company of its covenants and obligations hereunder and the consummation by
the Company of the Contemplated Transactions have been duly authorized by all
necessary corporate action on the part of the Company, and no
additional corporate proceedings on the part of the Company are necessary to
authorize the execution and delivery by the Company of this Agreement, the
performance by

 



5  the Company of its covenants and obligations hereunder or the consummation
by the Company of the Contemplated Transactions, other than obtaining the
Requisite Stockholder Approval. The board of directors of the Company (at a
meeting duly called and held) has: (a) unanimously determined that the Merger
is fair to and in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders; (b)
unanimously approved this Agreement and unanimously approved the Support
Agreements, the Merger and the other Contemplated Transactions, in accordance
with the requirements of the DGCL; (c) declared that this Agreement is
advisable; (d) unanimously recommended the adoption of this Agreement by the
Companys stockholders and directed that this Agreement be submitted for

and (e) subject to the accuracy of the representations set forth in  _Section
3.7_, to the extent necessary, adopted and approved a resolution having the
effect of causing the Company not to be subject to any corporate takeover
statute or other similar Legal Requirement (including any "moratorium,"
"control share acquisition," "business combination" or "fair price" statute)
of the State of Delaware or any other state, that might otherwise apply to

and (ii) confidentiality provisions protecting the Company Trade Secrets. To
the Knowledge of the Company, no current or former stockholder of any Acquired

policy requiring Company Associates who are or were involved in, or who have

all Company Trade Secrets. To the Knowledge of the Company, the Acquired
Corporations have enforced such policy without exception. To the Knowledge

covenant of any Contract with any other Person relating to confidentiality,
disclosure, or assignment of Intellectual Property or Intellectual Property
Rights (including any such Contract with an Acquired Corporation); or (B) has

to vest or perfect the rights of the Acquired Corporations in all material
Company Intellectual Property Rights have been validly executed, delivered,
and filed in a timely manner with the appropriate Governmental Body;

Person that is not (as of the date of this Agreement) an
Acquired Corporation;

(iii) to the Knowledge of the Company, no funding, facilities, or personnel of
any Governmental Body or of any college, university, or other educational

(vi) to the Knowledge of the Company, the Acquired Corporations collectively
own or otherwise have sufficient rights to use the Company Intellectual
Property in the manner that the Acquired Corporations currently use such
Company Intellectual Property.

(directly, contributorily, by inducement, or otherwise), misappropriating, or
otherwise violating, and since and including May 2, 2008, no Person has
materially infringed (directly, contributorily, by inducement, or otherwise),
misappropriated or otherwise violated, any Company Intellectual Property
Rights. The Company has provided to Parent an accurate and complete copy of
each letter or other written communication that has been sent or otherwise
delivered since and including November 1, 2008 by or on behalf of any
Acquired Corporation regarding any actual, alleged, or suspected
misappropriations, violations or infringements of any Company Intellectual
Property Rights. Part 2.16(h) of the Disclosure Schedule provides a brief
description of the current status of the matter referred to in each such
letter, communication, or correspondence.

 



18 (i) To the Knowledge of the Company: (i) no Acquired Corporation or

Intellectual Property Rights, except for contractual obligations to defend,
indemnify or hold harmless customers, distributors and resellers of any

(k) There is no pending suit, claim, action, investigation, or proceeding
made, conducted or brought by any Person that has been served upon or, to the
Knowledge of the Company, filed or threatened with respect to (and no Acquired
Corporation has been notified in writing of) any alleged infringement,
misappropriation or other violation by any Acquired Corporation, or by any
Company Product, of the Intellectual Property or Intellectual Property Rights
of another Person.

 

(l) To the Knowledge of the Company, all material Company Intellectual
Property Rights are valid, subsisting and enforceable (except that no
representation or warranty is made regarding the validity or enforceability of
any pending application for Company Registered Intellectual Property Rights).
Without limiting the foregoing: (i) to the Knowledge of the Company, each
item of material Company Registered Intellectual Property is and at all times
has been in compliance with all applicable Legal Requirements and all filings,
payments, and other actions required to be made or taken to maintain such item
of material Company Registered Intellectual Property Rights in full force and
effect have been made or take by the applicable deadline; and (ii) no

material Intellectual Property Rights that were previously owned, or purported
to be owned by, or filed in the name of, any Acquired Corporation (at a time
when it was an Acquired Corporation) have entered the public domain (other

Acquired Corporation is subject to any Order that restricts or impairs the
right or ability of any Acquired Corporation to use or otherwise exploit any
Company Intellectual Property.

(m) To the Knowledge of the Company, the execution and delivery of this
Agreement and the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions will not
result in, and would not reasonably be expected to result in: (i) any
Acquired Corporation granting, assigning or transferring to any third party
any rights to any Intellectual Property or Intellectual Property Rights; (ii)
any right of 

 



19  termination or cancellation under, or a breach of, any material Company
Intellectual Property Agreement; or (iii) the imposition of any Encumbrance on

necessary to conduct the business of the Acquired Corporations. The Acquired
Corporations maintain and are in material compliance with policies and
procedures regarding data security, back-up, disaster recovery and privacy
that are commercially reasonable and, in any event, are in material compliance
with all applicable Legal Requirements. Neither any Acquired Corporation, nor

concerning any Company Associate or current or former customer; or (ii)
notified any Company Associate or current or former customer or any law
enforcement authority of any information security breach.

on the right to use, modify or distribute such Company Product Software or
otherwise, that any Company Product Software be (A) disclosed or distributed
in source code form, (B) licensed for the purpose of making derivative works,
or (C) redistributable at no charge or that any Acquired Corporation grant to
any other Person any rights or immunities under any Company Intellectual
Property Right; or (ii) otherwise imposes any material limitation,

in any material refund, credit or similar compensation being provided by any
Acquired Corporation to any other Person.

 



20 (s) No source code of any Company Product Software has been licensed or
disclosed to any Person (including any escrow agent) who is not a Company

industry), or other software routines or hardware components intentionally
designed to permit: (i) unauthorized access to a computer or network, (ii)
unauthorized disablement or erasure of software, hardware or data; or (iii)
any other similar type of unauthorized activities.

Plan, or the plan sponsor, plan administrator or any fiduciary of any Company
Employee Plan (in each case, in their capacity as such), other than routine
claims for benefits that have been or are being handled through an
administrative claims procedure.

 



24 (g) Neither any Acquired Corporation nor, to the Knowledge of the Company, any
of their respective Representatives has, with respect to any Company Employee
Plan, engaged in or been a party to any non-exempt "prohibited transaction,"
as such term is defined in Section 4975 of the Code or Section 406 of
ERISA, which would reasonably be expected to result in the imposition of a
material penalty assessed pursuant to Section 502(i) of ERISA or a material
Tax imposed by Section 4975 of the Code, in each case applicable to any
Acquired Corporation or any Company Employee Plan or for which any Acquired
Corporation has any indemnification obligation.

(h) No Company Employee Plan that is a "welfare benefit plan" within the

exists since the date of such determination letter that would reasonably be
expected to adversely affect the qualified status of any such Company Employee
Plan.

 

(j) Except as would not be material, with respect to each International
Employee Plan that is a defined benefit pension plan or that provides
benefits pursuant to a formula, and that requires benefits to be funded
(before benefit obligations are actually due to participants) based on
actuarial principles, either: (i) the fair market value of the assets held for
the purpose of such International Employee Plan equals or exceeds the
projected benefit obligations under such plan; or (ii) any funding shortfall
is recognized as a book reserve (or has otherwise been properly reflected on
the Companys consolidated financial statements), based on reasonable GAAP or
generally accepted country-specific actuarial assumptions and methodologies.

(k) Except as otherwise contemplated by this Agreement, and except (in each
case) for any payment, benefit, increase or acceleration of less than
$100,000, neither the execution or delivery of this Agreement nor the
consummation of the Contemplated Transactions (alone or in combination with
any other event that would not, in and of itself, trigger such consequence(s))
will: (i) result in any payment or benefit becoming due or payable,
or required to be provided by any Acquired Corporation, to any Company

amount or value of any benefit or compensation otherwise payable or required
to be provided by any Acquired Corporation to any such Company Associate or

Taxes required by section 409A of the Code.

respect to any Company Employee Plan have been timely made, accrued or
reserved for in all material respects.

 



25 (m) Except as required by applicable Legal Requirements or the terms of any
Company Employee Plans as in effect on the date hereof, no Acquired
Corporation has any binding plan or commitment to amend or establish any new
Company Employee Plan or to increase any benefits under any Company Employee
Plan.

 

(n) No material deduction for federal income Tax purposes is expected by the
Company to be disallowed for remuneration paid by any Acquired Corporation by
reason of Section 162(m) of the Code with respect to 2011 or any of the four
preceding taxable years.

(o) No Company Employee Plan subject to ERISA is funded with or allows for
payments, investments or distributions in any employer security of the
Company, including employer securities as defined in Section 407(d)(1) of
ERISA, or employer real property as defined in Section 407(d)(2) or ERISA.

ERISA or the Code.

2010, there has not been any strike, lockout, slowdown, work stoppage,

materially interfere with the respective business activities of any Acquired
Corporation.

(b) To the Knowledge of the Company, each Acquired Corporation has complied
with applicable Legal Requirements with respect to employment (including
applicable laws, rules and regulations regarding wage and hour requirements,

(c) To the Knowledge of the Company, each Acquired Corporation has withheld
all amounts required by applicable Legal Requirements to be withheld from the
wages, salaries, and other payments to Company Associates or former
employees, and are not, to the Knowledge of the Company, liable for any

Non-U.S. Employees (other than routine payments to be made in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practice).

 



26 2.21 Governmental Authorizations. Each Acquired Corporation is and, since
and including May 2, 2006, has been, in compliance in all material respects
with the terms of each Governmental Authorization held by such Acquired
Corporation or otherwise affecting, or relating to, any asset owned or used by

material default under, and no condition exists that with notice or lapse of
time or both would constitute a material default under, any such Governmental
Authorization; or (b) any suspension, revocation, withdrawal or cancellation
of any such Governmental Authorization, in whole or in part. No Governmental
Authorization will be terminated or impaired or become terminable as a result
of the Contemplated Transactions except for such Governmental Authorizations
the loss of which would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material
Adverse Effect. Part 2.21 of the Disclosure Schedule describes the terms of
each material grant, incentive or subsidy provided or made available to or for
the benefit of any of the Acquired Corporations by any U.S. or foreign
Governmental Body or otherwise. Each of the Acquired Corporations is in
compliance with all of the terms and requirements of each grant, incentive
and subsidy identified or required to be identified in Part 2.21 of the
Disclosure Schedule in all material respects. Neither the execution, delivery
or performance of this Agreement, nor the consummation of the Merger or any
of the other Contemplated Transactions, will (with or without notice or lapse
of time) give any Person the right to revoke, withdraw, suspend, cancel,
terminate or modify any grant, incentive or subsidy identified or required to
be identified in Part 2.21 of the Disclosure Schedule.

export transactions that would reasonably be expected to give rise to any
future material claims against any of the Acquired Corporations (including
investigations of or voluntary disclosures by any Acquired Corporation).

 

2.25 Litigation. There is no Legal Proceeding pending and, to the Knowledge of
the Company, no Legal Proceeding has been threatened against any Acquired
Corporation or that affects any of the assets of any Acquired Corporation
that: (a) if adversely determined, would, individually or in the aggregate,
have a Material Adverse Effect; or (b) challenges or may have the effect of
preventing, delaying, making illegal or otherwise interfering with the Merger

28 2.26 Insurance. The Company has made available complete copies of, all
material policies of insurance and self-insurance relating to any Acquired

policies are in full force and effect, no notice of cancellation has been

any director or officer thereof, on the other hand, there are (and since and
including May 2, 2011 there have been) no transactions, agreements,
arrangements or understandings between any Acquired Corporation, on the one
hand, and any Affiliate (including any director or officer) thereof, but not
including any wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company, on the other hand, that
would be required to be disclosed pursuant to Item 404 of Regulation S-K
under the Securities Act in any report of the Company on Form 10-K or in any
proxy statement pertaining to an annual meeting of stockholders.

combinations set forth in Section 203 of the DGCL and any other similar
applicable Legal Requirements are not applicable to Parent or Merger Sub, are

the other Contemplated Transactions or to any of the Support Agreements or the
performance thereof.

proxy for the same meeting or subject matter which has become false or
misleading; _provided, however_ , that no representation or warranty is made

2.32 Receivables. All existing accounts receivable of the Acquired

obligations of customers of the Acquired Corporations arising from bona
fide transactions entered into in the ordinary course of business.

caused or constitutes a material inaccuracy in any representation or warranty
made by the Company in this Agreement; (ii) any event, condition, fact or
circumstance that occurs, arises or exists after the date of this Agreement
and that would cause or constitute a material inaccuracy in any representation
or warranty made by the Company in this Agreement if (A) such representation

discovery of such event, condition, fact or circumstance or (B) such event,
condition, fact or circumstance had occurred, arisen or existed on or prior
to the date of this Agreement; (iii) any material breach of any covenant or

for purposes of this _Section 4.2(c)_, the Company shall only have
the obligation to notify Parent in writing of such event, condition, fact or
circumstance once it has Knowledge thereof. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, the Company shall promptly advise Parent in writing of any
Legal Proceeding or material claim threatened, commenced or asserted against
or with respect to any of the Acquired Corporations. No notification given to
Parent pursuant to this _Section 4.2(c)_ or any information or knowledge
obtained pursuant to  _Section 4.1_ shall limit or otherwise affect any of
the representations, warranties, covenants or obligations of the Company
contained in this Agreement or any of the remedies available to Parent under
this Agreement.

 

(d) During the Pre-Closing Period, Parent shall promptly notify the Company in
writing of: (i) the discovery of any event, condition, fact or circumstance

caused or constitutes a material inaccuracy in any representation or warranty

occurrence, existence or discovery of such event, condition, fact or
circumstance or (B) such event, condition, fact or circumstance had occurred,
arisen or existed on or prior to the date of this Agreement; (iii) any
material breach of any covenant or obligation of Parent or Merger Sub; and

36  obligation to notify the Company in writing of such event, condition, fact
or circumstance once it has Knowledge thereof. No notification given to the
Company pursuant to this  _Section 4.2(d)_ or any information or knowledge
obtained pursuant to _Section 4.1_ shall limit or otherwise affect any of the
representations, warranties, covenants or obligations of Parent contained in
this Agreement or any of the remedies available to the Company under this
Agreement.

4.3 No Solicitation.

 

(a) The Company shall not (and shall not resolve or publicly propose to)
directly or indirectly, and the Company shall ensure that the other Acquired
Corporations and each Person who is an officer or director of any of the
Acquired Corporations do not (and do not resolve or publicly propose to) (and
the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to ensure that each other
Representative of any Acquired Corporation does not, and does not resolve
publicly or propose to) directly or indirectly: (i) solicit, initiate,
knowingly encourage, knowingly assist, or knowingly facilitate the making,
submission or announcement of any Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry
(including by approving any transaction, or approving any Person becoming an
"interested stockholder," for purposes of Section 203 of the DGCL) or take any
action that would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal
or Acquisition Inquiry; (ii) furnish or otherwise provide access to any non-
public information regarding any of the Acquired Corporations to any Person in
connection with or in response to an Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition
Inquiry; or (iii) engage in discussions or negotiations with any Person with
respect to any Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section 4.3(a)_,
prior to the adoption of this Agreement by the Requisite Stockholder
Approval, the Company may furnish non-public information regarding the
Acquired Corporations to, and may enter into discussions or negotiations with,
any Person in response to an unsolicited, bona fide, written
Acquisition Proposal that is submitted to the Company by such Person (and not
withdrawn) if: (i) none of the Acquired Corporations shall have breached (and
no Representative shall have taken action that would have been a breach had
such action been taken by the Company) any of the provisions set forth in
this _Section 4.3_ or _Section 5.2_ in a manner that resulted in the
submission of such Acquisition Proposal; (ii) the board of directors of the
Company determines in good faith, after consulting with, receiving advice
from and considering the advice of an independent financial advisor of
nationally recognized reputation and the Companys outside legal counsel, that
such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be likely to result
in a Superior Offer; (iii) the board of directors of the Company determines in
good faith, after consulting with, receiving advice from and considering the
advice of the Companys outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such
action would result in a breach of its fiduciary obligations to the Companys
stockholders under applicable Delaware law; (iv) at least 24 hours prior to
furnishing any such non-public information to, or entering into discussions
or negotiations with, such Person, the Company (A) gives Parent written notice
of the identity of such Person and of the Companys intention to furnish non-
public information to, or enter into discussions or negotiations with, such
Person, and (B) receives from such Person, and delivers to Parent a copy of,
an executed confidentiality agreement containing customary limitations on the
use and disclosure of all non-public written and oral information furnished
to such Person by or on behalf of the Acquired Corporations and other
provisions no less favorable to the Company than the provisions of the
Confidentiality Agreement as in effect immediately prior to the execution of
this Agreement (except that such confidentiality agreement need not contain
the "standstill" provision set forth in paragraph 9 of the Confidentiality
Agreement); and (v) contemporaneously with furnishing any non-public
information to such Person, the Company furnishes such non-public information
to Parent (to the extent such non-public information has not been previously
furnished or made available by the Company to Parent).

 



37 (c) If the Company, any other Acquired Corporation or any Representative of
any Acquired Corporation receives an Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition
Inquiry during the Pre-Closing Period, then the Company shall promptly (and in
no event later than 24 hours after receipt of such Acquisition Proposal or
Acquisition Inquiry): (i) advise Parent in writing of such Acquisition
Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry (including the identity of the Person making
or submitting such Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry and the
material terms and conditions thereof); and (ii) provide Parent with copies
of all documents and written communications, and, with respect to material
oral communications, a written summary of such communications, received by any
Acquired Corporation or any Representative of any Acquired Corporation
setting forth the terms and conditions of, or otherwise relating to, such
Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry. The Company shall keep Parent
reasonably informed with respect to the status and material terms and
conditions of any such Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry and any
material modification or proposed modification thereto, and shall promptly
(and in no event later than 24 hours after transmittal or receipt) provide
Parent with copies of any material correspondence and material written
communications, and, with respect to material oral correspondence or
communications, a written summary of such correspondence or communications,
between: (A) on the one hand, any Acquired Corporation or any Representative
of any Acquired Corporation; and (B) on the other hand, the Person that made
or submitted such Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry or any
Representative of such Person.

 

(d) The Company shall, and shall ensure that the other Acquired Corporations
and each Person that is a Representative of any of the Acquired Corporations,
immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing solicitation of, or
discussions or negotiations with, any Person relating to any Acquisition
Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry.

 

(e) The Company: (i) agrees that it will not, and shall ensure that each other
Acquired Corporation will not release or permit the release of any Person
from, or amend, waive or permit the amendment or waiver of any provision of,
any "standstill" or similar agreement or provision to which any of the
Acquired Corporations is or becomes a party or under which any of the
Acquired Corporations has or acquires any rights; and (ii) will use its best
efforts to enforce or cause to be enforced each such agreement or provision at
the request of Parent.

 

(f) Promptly, but in any event no later than 24 hours after the date of this
Agreement, the Company shall request each Person that has executed a
confidentiality or similar agreement in connection with such Persons
consideration of a possible Acquisition Proposal or investment in any Acquired
Corporation to return or destroy all confidential information
previously furnished to such Person by or on behalf of any of the Acquired
Corporations.

(g) The Company acknowledges and agrees that any action inconsistent with any
provision set forth in this _Section 4.3_ or _Section 5.2_ that is taken by
any Representative of any of the Acquired Corporations that, if taken by the
Company would have been a breach of this _Section 4.3_ or _Section 5.2_,
shall be deemed to constitute a breach of such provision by the Company.

4.4 Source Code Audit.

(a) During the Pre-Closing Period, the Company shall permit Parent to have
Black Duck, Palamida or another third party mutually agreed by the Company and
Parent, as selected by Parent (the "Auditor"), conduct a scan, audit and
analysis of the source code for the Company Product Software (to be
designated by Parent) (the "Designated Software"), at Parents expense, for
the purpose of identifying Open Source Materials and Proprietary Third-Party
Code (as defined below) included in the source code for such Designated
Software (the "Source Code Audit"). "Proprietary Third-Party Code" means any
proprietary third-party source code other than that of Parent or any of its
controlled Affiliates.

 



38 (b) The Company shall execute any estimator software provided by the Auditor
and provide the results thereof, and any other information requested by the
Auditor as part of its customary practices (but excluding, for avoidance of
doubt, any Company Product Software source code), to the Auditor in order for
the Auditor to provide an estimate of the charges and schedule for the Source
Code Audit to Parent, and (after the Auditor has been selected and retained by
Parent) shall make the source code for the Designated Software available to
the Auditor in order for the Auditor to perform the Source Code Audit, under
a Nondisclosure Agreement between the Company and the Auditor that is
reasonably acceptable in form and substance to the Company, Parent and the
Auditor (the "Auditor NDA"). If requested to do so by Parent, the Company
shall execute an Auditor NDA with, and provide the results and information
described above for a cost and schedule estimate to, two potential Auditors so
that Parent may obtain two estimates before selecting the Auditor. 

(c) The "Audit Period Start Date" means the last date upon which the Company
has: (i) executed any estimator software provided by the Auditor; (ii)
uploaded (or otherwise provided to the Auditor, in the manner instructed by
the Auditor) all associated source code for the Designated Software for
scanning and analysis by the Auditor; and (iii) executed the Auditor NDA.

(d) The "Source Code Audit Period" means the period commencing on the Audit
Period Start Date and ending 30 days thereafter, unless the Auditor estimates
that it will take more than 30 days after the Audit Period Start Date to
deliver all of the Reports (as defined below) to Company at its standard
or discounted rates (i.e., without charging higher rates or additional fees
in order to complete the project on an expedited basis), in which case the
Source Code Audit Period shall end the number of days after the Audit Period
Start Date equal to the period of time estimated by the Auditor, but in no
event more than 45 days after the Audit Period Start Date.

(e) Parent shall instruct the Auditor to complete the Source Code Audit as
expeditiously as possible, and in any event within the Source Code Audit
Period.

(f) If, before the end of the Source Code Audit Period, the Auditor notifies
Parent or Company that the Auditor cannot deliver all of the Reports to
Company within the Source Code Audit Period (or would need to charge
additional fees in order to deliver all of the Reports to Company within the
Source Code Audit Period), then the Source Code Audit Period will be extended
by up to 15 days in order to allow the Auditor to deliver all of the Reports
to Company. The Source Code Audit Period may be extended only once pursuant to
this _Section 4.4(f)_, but in no event will the Source Code Audit Period
exceed 45 days.

 

(g) The Auditor NDA shall provide that:

(i) None of the Company Product Software source code will be provided to
Parent;

(ii) The Source Code Audit will not include any identification or analysis of
any source code of Parent or any of its controlled Affiliates ("Parent Code");

 

(iii) The Auditor will be allowed and required to provide the results of its
scan, and its analysis of those results (collectively, the "Reports"), to
Parent, but only after the Company has first been provided with an opportunity
to review such Reports and has confirmed to the Auditor in writing that such
Reports include no source code of any Company Product Software and no
identification, results or analysis with respect to any Parent Code, which
confirmation the Company will perform promptly and reasonably;

 



39 (iv) Upon the completion of the Source Code Audit (including the delivery of
all Reports to Parent), all of the Company Product Software source code
provided to the Auditor will be returned to the Company; and

(v) If the Auditor has not delivered all of the Reports to Company by the end
of the Source Code Audit Period (as it may extended pursuant to _Section
4.4(f)_), the Source Code Audit shall end, all of the Company Product
Software source code provided to the Auditor will be returned to the Company,
any Reports previously delivered to the Company will be provided to Parent
(after review and confirmation by the Company as set forth above), and no
further information or Reports will be provided by the Auditor with respect to
the Source Code Audit to any party.

(h) The Company shall reasonably and promptly cooperate with Parent in
identifying the applicable licenses for any Open Source Materials and
Proprietary Third-Party Code found in the Company Product Software as a
result of the Source Code Audit, and in otherwise responding to questions
regarding the Source Code Audit or the Reports.

(i) If the results of the Source Code Audit indicate that any of the
representations and warranties made by the Company in _Section 2.16_ is
inaccurate in any material respect, then (without limiting any other rights
or remedies Parent may have as a result of such inaccuracy) upon the written
request of Parent to eliminate any such specified inaccuracy, and solely to
the extent that any such request is made within 40 days after Parents
receipt of the Reports from the Auditor, the Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to eliminate such inaccuracy prior to Closing (which may
include removing, replacing, or modifying the Open Source Materials or
Proprietary Third-Party Code in question or obtaining sufficient license
rights).

(j) The parties acknowledge and agree that the period of time upon which the
initial Source Code Audit Period is based and the 40 day request deadline in
_Section 4.4(i)_ each are based on an assumption that the Designated Software
will contain no more than 15 million lines of code, and that the 40 day
request deadline in _Section 4.4(i)_ is also based on the assumption that the
Company will reasonably and promptly cooperate with Parent in identifying the
applicable licenses for any Open Source Materials and Proprietary Third-Party
Code found in the Company Product Software as a result of the Source Code
Audit and in otherwise responding to questions regarding the Source Code Audit
or the Reports. If the Designated Software contains more than 15 million
lines of code, Parent and Company will negotiate in good faith reasonable
extensions of such time periods commensurate with the larger code base. If the
Company does not reasonably and promptly cooperate with Parent as
described above, then the 40 day request deadline will be extended, on a day-
by-day basis, for each day of delay caused by Companys failure to provide
such cooperation.

SECTION 5\. ADDITIONAL COVENANTS OF THE PARTIES

 

5.1 Proxy Statement. As promptly as practicable (but no later than 15 business
days after the date of this Agreement, unless otherwise mutually agreed by
the parties), the Company shall prepare and cause to be filed with the SEC a
preliminary Proxy Statement. The Company shall consult with Parent and provide
Parent and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the
Proxy Statement and any amendments or supplements thereto (and to review and
comment on any comments of the SEC or its staff on the Proxy Statement or any
amendments or supplements thereto), and 

 



40  shall reasonably consider all comments made by Parent, prior to the filing

counsel with a copy or a description of any comments received by the Company
or its legal counsel from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Proxy

to any such comments. The Company shall cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed
to the Companys stockholders as promptly as practicable after the earlier
of: (i) receiving notification that the SEC or its staff is not reviewing the
Proxy Statement; or (ii) the conclusion of any SEC or staff review of the
Proxy Statement. If any event relating to any of the Acquired Corporations
occurs, or if the Company becomes aware of any information, that should be
disclosed in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, then the
Company shall promptly inform Parent thereof and shall promptly file such
amendment or supplement with the SEC and, if appropriate, mail such amendment
or supplement to the stockholders of the Company. Parent shall furnish the
Company with the information concerning it and its Affiliates as may be
required to be disclosed in the Proxy Statement under the Exchange Act, and
any amendment or supplement thereto.

manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, or permit the withdrawal or
modification in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub of, the Company Board
Recommendation; (ii) recommend the approval, acceptance or adoption of, or
approve, endorse, accept or adopt, any Acquisition Proposal; (iii) approve or
recommend, or cause or permit any Acquired Corporation to execute or enter

to in this _Section 5.2(c)_.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _clause (i)_ of
_Section 5.2(c)_, at any time prior to the adoption of this Agreement by the
Requisite Stockholder Approval, the board of directors of the Company may
withdraw or modify the Company Board Recommendation:

(i) if: (A) an unsolicited, bona fide, written Acquisition Proposal is made to

any Acquired Corporation or any Representative of any Acquired Corporation;
and (ii) on the other hand, the Person that made or submitted such Acquisition
Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry or any Representative of such Person) not
previously provided to Parent; (G) throughout the period between the delivery
of such Recommendation Change Notice and any withdrawal or modification of the
Company Board Recommendation, the Company engages (to the extent requested by
Parent) in good faith negotiations with Parent to amend this Agreement in
such a manner that such Acquisition Proposal would no longer constitute a
Superior Offer; and (H) at the time of withdrawing or modifying the Company
Board Recommendation, the board of directors of the Company determines in
good faith, after consulting with, receiving advice from and considering the
advice of an independent financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation
and of the Companys outside legal counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal 

 



42  continues to constitute a Superior Offer and that the failure to withdraw or
modify the Company Board Recommendation would result in a breach of the
fiduciary obligations of the board of directors of the Company to the
Companys stockholders under applicable Delaware law in light of such Superior
Offer (after taking into account any changes to the terms of this Agreement
proposed by Parent as a result of the negotiations required by _clause (G)_
above or otherwise); or

(ii) if: (A) there shall arise after the date of this Agreement any change in
circumstances affecting the Acquired Corporations that does not relate to any
Acquisition Proposal and that leads the board of directors of the Company to
consider withdrawing or modifying the Company Board Recommendation (any such
change in circumstances unrelated to an Acquisition Proposal being referred to
as a "Change in Circumstances"); (B) the Company provides Parent written
notice of any meeting of the board of directors of the Company at which such
board of directors will consider and determine whether such Change in
Circumstances require the board of directors of the Company to withdraw or
modify the Company Board Recommendation, with such written notice provided to
Parent contemporaneously with the notice provided to the board of directors
of the Company, and with such notice to Parent specifying the date and time of
such meeting, the reasons for holding such meeting and a reasonably detailed
description of such Change in Circumstances; (C) the board of directors of
the Company determines in good faith, after consulting with, receiving advice
from and considering the advice of the Companys outside legal counsel, that,
in light of such Change in Circumstances, the failure to withdraw or modify
the Company Board Recommendation would result in a breach of its fiduciary
obligations to the Companys stockholders under applicable Delaware law; (D)
no less than four business days prior to withdrawing or modifying the Company
Board Recommendation, the board of directors of the Company delivers to Parent
a written notice (1) stating that a Change in Circumstances has arisen, (2)
stating that it intends to withdraw or modify the Company Board
Recommendation in light of such Change in Circumstances and describing any
intended modification of the Company Board Recommendation, and (3) containing
a reasonably detailed description of such Change in Circumstances; (E)
throughout the period between the delivery of such notice and any withdrawal
or modification of the Company Board Recommendation, the Company engages (to
the extent requested by Parent) in good faith negotiations with Parent to
amend this Agreement in such a manner that no withdrawal or modification of
the Company Board Recommendation would be legally required as a result of such
Change in Circumstances; and (F) at the time of withdrawing or modifying the
Company Board Recommendation, the board of directors of the Company
determines in good faith, after consulting with, receiving advice from and
considering the advice of the Companys outside legal counsel, that, in light
of such Change in Circumstances, the failure to withdraw or modify the
Company Board Recommendation would result in a breach of the fiduciary
obligations of the board of directors of the Company to the Companys
stockholders under applicable Delaware law (after taking into account any
changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent as a result of the
negotiations required by _clause (E)_ above or otherwise).

For purposes of _clause (i)_ of this _Section 5.2(d)_, any change in the
form or amount of the consideration payable in connection with a Superior
Offer, and any other material change to any of the terms of a Superior Offer,
will be deemed to be a new Superior Offer, requiring a new Recommendation
Change Notice and a new advance notice period; _provided, however,_ that the
advance notice period applicable to any such change to a Superior Offer
pursuant to _clause (i)(F)_ of the first sentence of this _Section 5.2(d)_
shall be three business days rather than four business days. Except as may be
required by applicable Legal Requirements, the Company agrees to keep
confidential, and not to disclose to the public or to any Person (other than
its Representatives who agree to keep such information confidential), any and
all information regarding any negotiations that take place pursuant to
_clause (i)(G)_ or _clause (ii)(E)_ of this _Section 5.2(d)_ (including the
existence and terms of any proposal made on behalf of Parent or the Company
during such negotiations). The Company shall ensure that any withdrawal
or modification of

 



43  the Company Board Recommendation: (x) does not change or otherwise affect
the approval of this Agreement by the board of directors of the Company; and
(y) does not have the effect of causing any corporate takeover statute or
other similar statute (including any "moratorium," "control share
acquisition," "business combination" or "fair price" statute) of the State of
Delaware or any other state to be applicable to this Agreement, any of the
Support Agreements, the Merger or any of the other Contemplated Transactions.

(e) The Companys obligation to call, give notice of and hold the Company
Stockholders Meeting in accordance with _Section 5.2(a)_ shall not be
limited or otherwise affected by the making, commencement, disclosure,
announcement or submission of any Superior Offer or other Acquisition
Proposal, by any Change in Circumstances or by any withdrawal or modification
of the Company Board Recommendation. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the Company agrees that: (i) unless this Agreement is terminated in
accordance with _Section 8.1_, the Company shall not submit any Acquisition
Proposal to a vote of its stockholders; and (ii) the Company shall not
(without Parents prior written consent) adjourn, postpone or cancel (or
propose to adjourn, postpone or cancel) the Company Stockholders Meeting,
except to the extent required to obtain the Requisite Stockholder Approval;
_provided, however,_ that with respect to _clause (ii)_ , the Company, after
consultation with Parent, may adjourn the Company Stockholders Meeting on no
more than one occasion to the extent necessary under applicable
Legal Requirements to ensure that any supplement or amendment to the Proxy
Statement required under applicable Legal Requirements is provided to the
Companys stockholders; _provided, further,_ that in no event shall the
Company Stockholders Meeting be adjourned pursuant to the foregoing proviso
(A) beyond five business days following the Meeting Date, or (B) to a date
that would require the establishment of a new record date for the
Company Stockholders Meeting.

(f) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.2_ shall prohibit the Company or
the board of directors of the Company from taking and disclosing to the
holders of Company Common Stock a position with respect to a tender offer or
exchange offer contemplated by Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under
the Exchange Act;  _provided,_ that, unless the Company shall have complied
with the provisions set forth in _Section 5.2(d)(i)_, the board of directors
of the Company expressly publicly reaffirms the Company Board Recommendation
in such disclosure. 

5.3 Company Equity Awards and ESPP.

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall cause each Company Option
that is vested, outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective
Time (including all Options that vest contingent on the Merger) (each, an
"Outstanding Vested Company Option") to be cancelled, terminated and
extinguished as of the Effective Time, and upon the cancellation thereof the
holder of each such Outstanding Vested Company Option shall be granted the
right to receive, in respect of each share of Company Common Stock subject to
such Outstanding Vested Company Option immediately prior to such cancellation,
an amount (subject to any applicable withholding Tax) in cash equal to: (i)
$7.35; _minus_ (ii) the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock
subject to such Company Option (it being understood that, if the exercise
price payable in respect of a share of Company Common Stock subject to any
such Company Option exceeds $7.35, then the amount payable under this _Section
5.3(a)_ with respect to such Company Option shall be zero). Each holder of an
Outstanding Vested Company Option cancelled as provided in this  _Section
5.3(a)_ shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right
to receive the cash consideration (if any) specified in this _Section
5.3(a)_, without interest. Parent shall cause the cash payments described in
this _Section 5.3(a)_ to be paid promptly following the Effective Time.

 



44 (b) At the Effective Time, each Company Option that is outstanding and
unvested immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, an "Outstanding
Unvested Company Option"), shall be converted into and become an option to
purchase Parent Common Stock, with such conversion effected through Parent:
(i) assuming such Outstanding Unvested Company Option; or (ii) replacing such
Outstanding Unvested Company Option by issuing a reasonably equivalent
replacement stock option to purchase Parent Common Stock in substitution
therefor, in either case in accordance with the terms (as in effect as of the
date of this Agreement) of the applicable Company Equity Plan and the terms of
the stock option agreement by which such Outstanding Unvested Company Option
is evidenced. All rights with respect to Company Common Stock under
Outstanding Unvested Company Options assumed or replaced by Parent shall
thereupon be converted into options with respect to Parent Common Stock.
Accordingly, from and after the Effective Time: (A) each Outstanding Unvested
Company Option assumed or replaced by Parent may be exercised solely for
shares of Parent Common Stock; (B) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock
subject to each Outstanding Unvested Company Option assumed or replaced by
Parent shall be determined by multiplying the number of shares of Company
Common Stock that were subject to such Outstanding Unvested Company Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Conversion Ratio (as defined
below), and rounding the resulting number down to the nearest whole number of
shares of Parent Common Stock; (C) the per share exercise price for the Parent
Common Stock issuable upon exercise of each Outstanding Unvested Company
Option assumed or replaced by Parent shall be determined by dividing the per
share exercise price of Company Common Stock subject to such Outstanding
Unvested Company Option, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time,
by the Conversion Ratio, and rounding the resulting exercise price up to the
nearest whole cent; and (D) subject to the terms of the stock option agreement
by which such Outstanding Unvested Company Option is evidenced, any
restriction on the exercise of any Outstanding Unvested Company
Option assumed or replaced by Parent shall continue in full force and effect
and the term, exercisability, vesting schedule and other provisions of such
Outstanding Unvested Company Option shall otherwise remain unchanged as a
result of the assumption or replacement of such Outstanding Unvested Company
Option; _provided, however_ , that the board of directors of Parent or a
committee thereof shall succeed to the authority and responsibility of the
board of directors of the Company or any committee thereof with respect to
each Outstanding Unvested Company Option assumed or replaced by Parent. The
"Conversion Ratio" shall be equal to the fraction having a numerator equal to
$7.35 and having a denominator equal to the average of the closing sale
prices of a share of Parent Common Stock as reported on the NASDAQ Global
Select Market for each of the five consecutive trading days immediately
preceding the Closing Date (the "Average Parent Stock Price"); _provided,
however_ , that if, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time,
the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock or Parent Common Stock are
changed into a different number or class of shares by reason of any stock
split, division or subdivision of shares, stock dividend, reverse stock split,
consolidation of shares, reclassification, recapitalization or other similar
transaction, then the Conversion Ratio shall be adjusted equitably
and proportionately to the extent appropriate to preserve the intended
consequences of the adjustment.

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall cause each Company Stock-
Based Award that is a restricted stock unit that is outstanding and vested
immediately prior to the Effective Time (including all such Company Stock-
Based Awards that vest contingent on the Merger) (each, an "Outstanding
Vested RSU") to be cancelled, terminated and extinguished as of the Effective
Time, and upon the cancellation thereof the holder of each such Outstanding
Vested RSU shall be granted the right to receive, in respect of each share of
Company Common Stock subject to such Outstanding Vested RSU immediately prior
to such cancellation, an amount (subject to any applicable withholding Tax) in
cash equal to $7.35. Each holder of an Outstanding Vested RSU cancelled as
provided in this _Section 5.3(c)_ shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive the cash consideration (if any) specified
in this _Section 5.3(c)_ without interest. Parent shall cause the cash
payments described in this _Section 5.3(c)_ to be paid promptly following the
Effective Time.

 



45 (d) At the Effective Time, each Company Stock-Based Award that is a restricted
stock unit that is outstanding and unvested immediately prior to the
Effective Time (each, an "Outstanding Unvested RSU"), shall be converted into
and become a restricted stock unit to acquire Parent Common Stock, with such
conversion effected through Parent: (i) assuming such Outstanding Unvested
RSU; or (ii) replacing such Outstanding Unvested RSU by issuing a reasonably
equivalent replacement restricted stock unit to acquire Parent Common Stock in
substitution therefor, in either case in accordance with the terms (as in
effect as of the date of this Agreement) of the applicable Company Equity Plan
and the terms of the restricted stock unit agreement by which such Outstanding
Unvested RSU is evidenced. All rights with respect to Company Common Stock
under Outstanding Unvested RSUs assumed or replaced by Parent shall thereupon
be converted into restricted stock units with respect to Parent Common Stock.
Accordingly, from and after the Effective Time: (A) each Outstanding Unvested
RSU assumed or replaced by Parent shall be settled solely for shares of Parent
Common Stock; (B) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to each
Outstanding Unvested RSU assumed or replaced by Parent shall be the number of
whole shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product (rounded down to the
next whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock, with no cash being payable
for any fractional share eliminated by such rounding) of the number of shares
of Company Common Stock that represented such Outstanding Unvested RSU
immediately prior to the Effective Time and the Conversion Ratio; and (C)
subject to the terms of the restricted stock unit agreement by which
such Outstanding Unvested RSU is evidenced, any restrictions shall continue
in full force and effect and the term, vesting schedule and other provisions
of such Outstanding Unvested RSU shall otherwise remain unchanged as a result
of the assumption or replacement of such Outstanding Unvested RSU; _provided_
, _however_ , that (1) subject to the terms of the applicable Company Equity
Plan and applicable Legal Requirements, Parent may modify the vesting schedule
of any or all of the Outstanding Unvested RSUs provided such modified vesting
schedule is, as to each holder of an Outstanding Unvested RSU, not less
favorable than the vesting schedule applicable to such holders Outstanding
Unvested RSU as of the Closing Date, and (2) the board of directors of Parent
or a committee thereof shall succeed to the authority and responsibility of
the board of directors of the Company or any committee thereof with respect to
each Outstanding Unvested RSU.

 

(e) At the Effective Time, if Parent determines that it desires to do so,
Parent may assume any or all of the Company Equity Plans or merge any such
Company Equity Plan into any equity incentive plan of Parent. If Parent elects
to so assume or merge any Company Equity Plan, then, under such Company Equity
Plan, Parent shall be entitled to grant stock awards, to the
extent permissible under applicable Legal Requirements, using the share
reserves of such Company Equity Plan as of the Effective Time (including any
shares returned to such share reserves as a result of the termination of
Outstanding Unvested Company Options that are assumed or replaced by Parent
pursuant to _Section 5.3(a)_), except that: (i) stock covered by such awards
shall be shares of Parent Common Stock; (ii) all references in such Company
Equity Plan to a number of shares of Company Common Stock shall be deemed
amended to refer instead to a number of shares of Parent Common Stock
determined by multiplying the number of referenced shares of Company Common
Stock by the Conversion Ratio, and rounding the resulting number down to the
nearest whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock; and (iii) the board of
directors of Parent or a committee thereof shall succeed to the authority and
responsibility of the board of directors of the Company or any committee
thereof with respect to the administration of such Company Equity Plan.

 



46 (f) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all action that may
be necessary (under the Company Equity Plans and otherwise) to effectuate the
provisions of this _Section 5.3_.

 

(g) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all action that may be
necessary to: (i) cause any outstanding offering period under the ESPP to be
terminated as of the last business day prior to the date on which the Merger
becomes effective; (ii) make any pro rata adjustments that may be necessary to
reflect the shortened offering period, but otherwise treat such shortened
offering period as a fully effective and completed offering period for all
purposes under the ESPP; (iii) cause the exercise (as of the last business day
prior to the date on which the Merger becomes effective) of each outstanding
purchase right under the ESPP; and (iv) provide that no further offering
period or purchase period shall commence under the ESPP after the Effective
Time; _provided, however_ , that the actions described in _clauses (i)_
through _(iv)_ of this sentence shall be conditioned upon the consummation of
the Merger. On such new exercise date, the Company shall apply the funds
credited as of such date under the ESPP within each participants payroll
withholding account to the purchase of whole shares of Company Common Stock in
accordance with the terms of the ESPP. The Company shall terminate the ESPP
immediately prior to and effective as of the Effective Time (and subject to
the consummation of the Merger).

(h) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to prepare and file with the
SEC as soon as reasonably practicable following the Effective Time, a
registration statement on Form S-8 with respect to the Parent Common Stock
subject to any Company Equity Awards that are assumed or substituted for by
Parent pursuant to this  _Section 5.3_.

5.4 Employee Benefits.

 

(a) If Parent elects not to maintain the Surviving Corporations health,
vacation or 401(k) plans after the Effective Time, then, subject to any
necessary transition period and subject to any applicable Parent plan
provisions, contractual requirements or Legal Requirements: (i) all employees
of the Acquired Corporations who continue employment with Parent,
the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary of the Surviving Corporation
after the Effective Time ("Continuing Employees") shall be eligible to
participate in Parents health, vacation and 401(k) plans, to substantially
the same extent as similarly situated employees of Parent; (ii) for purposes
of determining a Continuing Employees eligibility to participate in such
plans, such Continuing Employee shall receive credit under such plan for his
or her years of continuous service with the Acquired Corporations prior to
the Effective Time; and (iii) for purposes of determining a Continuing
Employees eligibility to participate in each compensation, vacation,
severance (or other termination benefits), fringe or other welfare benefit
plan, program or arrangement of Parent in which any such Continuing Employee
is or becomes eligible to participate, such Continuing Employee shall receive
credit under such plans for his or her years of continuous service with the
Acquired Corporations prior to the Effective Time.

(b) Nothing in this  _Section 5.4_ or elsewhere in this Agreement shall be
construed to create a right in any Company Associate to employment with
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any other Subsidiary of Parent. Except
for Indemnified Persons to the extent of their rights pursuant to _Section
5.5_, no Company Associate, former employee or Continuing Employee shall be
deemed to be a third party beneficiary of this Agreement. Nothing in this
_Section 5.4(b)_ shall limit the effect of  _Section 9.8_.

(c) Unless otherwise requested by Parent in writing at least 10 business days
prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall take (or cause to be taken) all
actions necessary or

 



47  appropriate to terminate, effective no later than the day prior to the date
on which the Merger becomes effective, any Company Employee Plan that contains
a cash or deferred arrangement intended to qualify under Section 401(k) of
the Code (a "Company 401(k) Plan"). If the Company is required to terminate
any Company 401(k) Plan, then the Company shall provide to Parent prior to the
Closing Date written evidence of the adoption by the board of directors of
the Company of resolutions authorizing the termination of such Company 401(k)
Plan (the form and substance of which shall be subject to the prior review and
approval of Parent, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld). The
Company also shall take such other actions in furtherance of terminating such
Company 401(k) Plan as Parent may reasonably request.

(d) To the extent any employee notification or consultation requirements are
imposed by applicable Legal Requirements with respect to the Contemplated
Transactions, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to comply
with such notification or consultation requirements and shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable law, use its reasonable best efforts to consult with
Parent to the extent Parents cooperation or involvement is necessary. To the
extent any material oral or written communications are to be made prior to the
Closing Date to any Continuing Employees regarding post-Closing employment
matters, including post-Closing employee benefits and compensation,
the Company shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, use its
reasonable best efforts to consult with Parent regarding such communications
and Parent shall have a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such
communications.

 

5.5 Indemnification of Officers and Directors

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation: (i) to assume and perform all rights to indemnification existing
in favor of, and all rights to advancement of expenses to, the current or
former directors and officers of the Company (the "Indemnified Persons") as
provided in the Companys certificate of incorporation or the Companys bylaws
as in effect on the date of this Agreement, and as provided to such directors
and officers in the indemnification agreements that are identified in Part
5.5(a) of the Disclosure Schedule and forms of which have been made available
to Parent, as in effect on the date of this Agreement, for acts or omissions
occurring prior to the Effective Time (including acts or omissions occurring
in connection with this Agreement and the consummation of the Contemplated
Transactions), and such rights shall continue in full force and effect until
the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations with respect to any
claims against such officers and directors arising out of such acts or
omissions, except as otherwise required by applicable Legal Requirements;
and (ii) to include and cause to be maintained in effect in the Surviving
Corporations (or any successors) certificate of incorporation, for a period
of six years after the Effective Time, the current provisions regarding
elimination of liability of directors.

(b) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to maintain in effect the Companys current directors
and officers liability insurance covering each Person currently covered by
the Companys directors and officers liability insurance policy
(an accurate and complete copy of which has been heretofore made available to
Parent) for acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time;
_provided, however,_ that: (i) Parent or the Surviving Corporation may
substitute therefor one or more "tail" policies, the material terms of which,
including coverage and amount, are no less favorable in any material respect
to such directors and officers than the material terms of the Companys
existing policies as of the date hereof; or (ii) Parent may request that the
Company obtain such extended reporting period coverage under the Companys
existing insurance programs (to be effective as of the Effective Time); and
_provided, further,_ that in no event shall Parent or the Surviving
Corporation be required to pay aggregate annual premiums for insurance under
this _Section 5.5(b)_ in excess of 250% of the amount of the aggregate
premiums paid by the Company for 

 



48  2011 for such purpose (which 2011 premiums are hereby represented and
warranted by the Company to be as set forth in Part 2.26 of the Disclosure
Schedule), it being understood that Parent shall nevertheless be obligated to
provide such coverage as may be obtained for such 250% amount.

(c) In the event that Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
successors or assigns shall: (i) consolidate with or merge into any other
Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger; or (ii) transfer all or substantially all its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, Parent
shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, cause proper provision to
be made so that the successor and assign of Parent or the Surviving
Corporation assumes the obligations set forth in this _Section 5.5(c)_.

(d) The provisions of this _Section 5.5_ shall survive consummation of the
Merger and are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by,
each Indemnified Person, his or her heirs and his or her legal
representatives.

 

5.6 Regulatory Approvals and Related Matters.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement (including _Section
5.6(b)_, _Section 5.6(c)_, _Section 5.6(d)_ and _Section 5.6(e)_), prior to
the Effective Time, each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall use its
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and do, or
cause to be done, all things necessary or advisable under applicable Legal
Requirements to consummate the Merger as soon as practicable after the date
of this Agreement, including: (i) each party making an appropriate filing of a
Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the
Merger and the other Contemplated Transactions as promptly as practicable
after the date of this Agreement (and in any event within 10 business days
after the date of this Agreement unless otherwise mutually agreed by the
parties), and supplying, as promptly as reasonably practicable, any
additional information and documentary material that may be requested by a
Governmental Body pursuant to the HSR Act; (ii) each party making all
appropriate filings and submissions (and filings and submissions considered
by Parent to be advisable) with any Governmental Body pursuant to applicable
Legal Requirements (including under any applicable foreign Legal Requirement
relating to antitrust, competition or merger control matters), as promptly
as practicable; (iii) the parties using reasonable best efforts to obtain,
subject to _Section 5.6(b)_, _Section 5.6(c)_, _Section 5.6(d)_ and
_Section 5.6(e)_, as promptly as practicable, the termination of any waiting
period under the HSR Act and any applicable foreign Legal Requirement relating
to antitrust, competition or merger control matters; (iv) the parties
cooperating and consulting with each other in (A) determining which
filings are required to be made prior to the Effective Time with, and which
material Consents are required to be obtained prior to the Effective Time
from, Governmental Bodies in connection with the Merger and the other
Contemplated Transactions and (B) timely making all such filings and timely
seeking all such Consents; (v) the parties using reasonable best efforts to
obtain all Consents from any third party necessary, proper or advisable (as
determined by Parent) to consummate the Contemplated Transactions (provided,
that the Company shall not be obligated to pay any consent fees or modify the
terms of any Contract in connection with obtaining such Consents except as are
contingent on the Closing); and (vi) the parties using reasonable best
efforts to execute and deliver any additional instruments necessary to
consummate the Merger and the other Contemplated Transactions.

(b) In connection with the efforts referenced in _Section 5.6(a)_, and
subject to any applicable Legal Requirement, each of the Company, on the one
hand, and Parent and Merger Sub on the other hand, will: (i) cooperate with
each other in connection with any investigation or other inquiry, including
any proceeding initiated by a third party; (ii) keep the other party
reasonably informed of any communication received by such party from, or
given by such party to, the Federal Trade Commission

 



49  ("FTC"), the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (the "DOJ") or
any other U.S. or foreign Governmental Body and of any communication received
or given in connection with any proceeding by a private party, in each case
regarding the Merger or the other Contemplated Transactions; and (iii) permit
the other party, to the extent practicable and at its own expense, to review
any communication given by it to, and consult with each other in advance of
any meeting or conference with, the FTC, the DOJ or such other applicable
Governmental Body or other Person, and, to the extent permitted by the FTC,
the DOJ or such other applicable Governmental Body or other Person, give the
other party the opportunity to attend and participate in such meetings and
conferences. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall be entitled to have
the lead role in devising the strategy of the parties with respect to seeking
any actions or Consents of any Governmental Body with respect to the Merger
and coordinating other contacts, where permitted, with Governmental Bodies.
Neither Parent and Merger Sub nor the Company shall commit to or agree with
any Governmental Body to stay, toll or extend any applicable waiting period
under the HSR Act or applicable antitrust, competition or merger control Legal
Requirements, without the written consent of the other, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

(c) In the event that any Legal Proceeding is initiated (or threatened to be
initiated) by a Governmental Body challenging the Merger or any of the other
Contemplated Transactions, each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall
use its reasonable best efforts to cooperate with each other and to contest
and resist any such action or proceeding until the entering into by a court
of competent jurisdiction of any preliminary or permanent injunction or other
Order that preliminarily or permanently prohibits, prevents or restricts the
consummation of the Merger or any of the other Contemplated Transactions.
Parent shall be entitled to control and to direct the defense of any antitrust
or competition law litigation related to the Merger and the other Contemplated
Transactions; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the Company shall be entitled to
participate fully and actively, at the Companys sole expense, in the conduct
thereof. No party shall make any offer, acceptance or counter-offer to any
Governmental Body with respect to any proposed settlement, consent decree,
commitment or remedy, or, in the event of litigation, discovery, admissibility
of evidence, timing or scheduling unless such party shall have first consulted
with the other party or, if by the Company, as specifically requested by or
agreed with Parent.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this  _Section
5.6_ or elsewhere in this Agreement, neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall have
any obligation under this Agreement to: (i) dispose of, transfer or
exclusively license or cause any of its Subsidiaries to dispose of, transfer
or exclusively license any assets (including any technology, Software or
other Intellectual Property or Intellectual Property Right) to any Person, or
to commit to cause any of the Acquired Corporations to dispose of, transfer or
exclusively license any assets (including any technology, Software or other
Intellectual Property or Intellectual Property Right) to any Person; (ii)
discontinue or cause any of its Subsidiaries to discontinue, or commit to
cause any of the Acquired Corporations to discontinue, offering any product
or service; (iii) non-exclusively license or otherwise make available, or
cause any of its Subsidiaries to non-exclusively license or otherwise make
available, to any Person any technology, Software or other Intellectual
Property or Intellectual Property Right, or to commit to cause any of the
Acquired Corporations to non-exclusively license or otherwise make available
to any Person any technology, Software or other Intellectual Property or
Intellectual Property Right; (iv) hold separate or cause any of its
Subsidiaries to hold separate any assets or operations (either before or after
the Closing Date), or to commit to cause any of the Acquired Corporations to
hold separate any assets or operations; or (v) make or cause any of its
Subsidiaries to make any commitment, or to commit to cause any of the Acquired
Corporations to make any commitment (to any Governmental Body or otherwise),
regarding its future operations or the future operations of any of the
Acquired Corporations; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent shall be required
to take the actions set forth in _clauses (i)_ through _(v)_ of this
_Section 5.6(d)_ if, but only if: (A) the parties are informed by the
management of the Bureau of Competition of the FTC

 



50  ("Bureau Management") that such actions are demanded and required as a
condition to providing the Required Regulatory Approval; and (B) such actions,
considered collectively, would not result in a Detriment. For purposes of
this _Section 5.6(d)_, an action so demanded and required by Bureau
Management would be deemed to result in a "Detriment" if such action,
considered together with all other actions so demanded and required by Bureau
Management: (1) would have resulted in a reduction of the combined annual
consolidated revenues of Parent, the Company and their respective Subsidiaries
of at least $5,000,000 for the twelve-month period ended October 31, 2011
(any such reduction of at least $5,000,000, a "Specified Revenue Reduction")
if such action had been taken immediately before such twelve-month period; or
(2) would otherwise have an adverse impact that is material to the business
of Parent or the business of the Acquired Corporations, taken as a whole. It
is understood that, if the only actions so demanded and required by Bureau
Management are actions of the type set forth in _clause (i)_ or _clause
(ii)_ of the first sentence of this _Section 5.6(d)_ ("Demanded Divestiture
Actions"), then for purposes of _clause (2)_ of the proviso to the preceding
sentence, such Demanded Divestiture Actions will not be deemed to have an
adverse impact that is material to the business of Parent or the business of
the Acquired Corporations, unless such Demanded Divestiture Actions,
considered collectively, would have resulted in a Specified Revenue Reduction
had such Demanded Divestiture Actions been taken immediately before such
12-month period; _provided_ , _however,_ that it is also understood that (A)
for purposes of determining whether a Detriment would occur, Demanded
Divestiture Actions must be considered together with actions of the type set
forth in _clause (iii)_ , _clause (iv)_ and _clause (v)_ of the first
sentence of this _Section 5.6(d)_, and (B) even if the Demanded Divestiture
Actions would not themselves have resulted in a Specified Revenue Reduction,
such Demanded Divestiture Actions may nonetheless be deemed to result in a
Detriment when considered together with any actions of the type set forth in
_clause (iii)_ , _clause (iv)_ or _clause (v)_ of the first sentence of this
_Section 5.6(d)_ that are demanded and required by Bureau Management.

 

(e) At the request of Parent, the Company shall agree to divest, sell, dispose
of, hold separate or otherwise take or commit to take any other action with
respect to any of the businesses, product lines or assets of the Acquired
Corporations; _provided_ that any such action is conditioned upon the
consummation of the Merger.

 

5.7 Disclosure. Parent and the Company shall consult with each other before
issuing any press release or otherwise making any public statement or
disclosure with respect to the Merger or any of the Contemplated Transactions
and neither shall issue any such press release or make any such public
statement or disclosure without the prior approval of the other (which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), except
as may be required by applicable Legal Requirements, court process or by
obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national securities
exchange or national securities quotation system, in which case the party
proposing to issue such press release or make such public statement or
disclosure shall first, to the extent practicable, consult with the other
party about, and allow the other party reasonable time to comment in advance
on, such press release, public announcement or disclosure. The parties agree
that the initial press release to be issued with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall be in the form heretofore agreed to
by the parties.

5.8 Resignation of Officers and Directors. The Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain and deliver to Parent at or prior to the
Effective Time (or, at the option of Parent, at a later date) the resignation
of each officer and director of each of the Acquired Corporations to be
effective as of the Effective Time.

 

5.9 Section 16 Matters. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take
such reasonable steps as are required to cause the disposition of Company
Common Stock and Company

 



51  Options in connection with the Merger by each officer or director of the
Company who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the
Exchange Act with respect to the Company to be exempt from Section 16(b) of
the Exchange Act pursuant to Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act.

5.10 Stockholder Litigation. The Company shall promptly (and in any event
within 24 hours after obtaining knowledge of any such claim or litigation)
notify Parent in writing, and shall give Parent the opportunity to participate
fully and actively, at Parents sole expense, in the defense and settlement,
of any stockholder claim or litigation (including any class action or
derivative litigation) against or otherwise involving the Company and/or any
of its directors or officers relating to this Agreement, the Merger or any of
the other Contemplated Transactions. No compromise or full or partial
settlement of, or material concession in, any such claim or litigation shall
be agreed to or made by the Company without Parents prior written consent.

5.11 Convertible Notes. The Company shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts, in consultation with Parent and at Parents sole expense, to retire
or cause to be converted all of the Companys outstanding 6% Convertible
Senior Notes due 2014 (the "Notes") concurrently with, or prior to, the
Closing.

 

5.12 Tax Matters. On or prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall terminate
(or cause to be terminated): (a) all Tax sharing and Tax allocation
agreements (whether oral or written) between any Acquired Corporation and any
Person other than any other Acquired Corporation; and (b) all powers of
attorney with respect to Tax matters, in each case, other than any such
agreement or power of attorney that Parent requests in writing remain in
effect after the Closing Date.

and warranty shall be disregarded if all such inaccuracies, considered
collectively, would not result in an increase in the amounts payable pursuant
to _Section 1.5_ and _Section 5.3_ in excess of $5,500,000.

not have been threatened in writing, any Legal Proceeding in which a
Governmental Body is or is threatened to become a party: (a) challenging or

shall not be permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section
8.1(b)_ if the failure to consummate the Merger by 5:00 p.m. Eastern time on

obligations set forth in _Section 4.3_ and _Section 5.2_; (ii) the Companys
board of directors, acting in accordance with _Section 5.2(d)(i)_, modifies

and delivers all of the information, including the final version of the
Alternative Acquisition Agreement, required to be included and delivered to
Parent by the Company by _clause (iii)_ of this  _Section 8.1(f))_; (v)
throughout the Notice Period, the Company engages, and causes its financial
and legal advisors to engage, in good faith negotiations with Parent to amend

subsequent date) such that the conditions set forth in _Section 6.1_ would
not be satisfied as of that subsequent date (it being understood that, for
purposes of determining the accuracy of such representations or warranties as
of the date of this Agreement or as of any subsequent date (A) all materiality
and similar qualifications limiting the scope of such representations or
warranties shall be disregarded (other than the reference to "Material Adverse
Effect" in _Section 2.12(a)_, which shall not be disregarded) and (B) any

subsequent to the date of this Agreement or a breach of a covenant or
obligation by the Company is curable by the Company prior to the End Date and
the Company is continuing to exercise commercially reasonable efforts to cure
such inaccuracy or breach, then Parent may not terminate this Agreement under
this _Section 8.1(g)_ on account of such inaccuracy or breach unless such
inaccuracy or breach shall remain uncured for a period of 45 days commencing
on the date that Parent gives the Company notice of such inaccuracy or breach;
or

 



56 (h) by the Company at any time prior to the Effective Time if: (i) any of
Parents representations or warranties contained in this Agreement shall be
inaccurate as of the date of this Agreement such that the condition set forth
in _Section 7.1_ would not be satisfied (it being understood that, for
purposes of determining the accuracy of such representations or warranties as
of the date of this Agreement or as of any subsequent date, all materiality
qualifications limiting the scope of such representations or warranties shall
be disregarded); or (ii) if any of Parents covenants or obligations
contained in this Agreement shall have been breached such that the condition
set forth in _Section 7.2_ would not be satisfied; _provided, however,_ that
if an inaccuracy in any of Parents representations or warranties as of a
date subsequent to the date of this Agreement or a breach of a covenant or
obligation by Parent is curable by Parent by the End Date and Parent is
continuing to exercise commercially reasonable efforts to cure such
inaccuracy or breach, then the Company may not terminate this Agreement under
this _Section 8.1(h)_ on account of such inaccuracy or breach unless such
inaccuracy or breach shall remain uncured for a period of 45 days commencing
on the date that the Company gives Parent notice of such inaccuracy or breach.

The party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section
8.1_ (other than pursuant to _Section 8.1(a)_) shall give written notice of

with  _Section 9.9_, including a description in reasonable detail of the
reasons for such termination and specifying the provision or provisions of
this Agreement pursuant to which such termination is being effected.

this Agreement may not be terminated by the Company unless any fee required to
be paid by the Company at or prior to the time of such termination pursuant to
_Section 8.3_ shall have been paid in full.

8.2 Effect of Termination. In the event of the termination of this Agreement
as provided in  _Section 8.1_, this Agreement shall be of no further force

and _Section 9_ shall survive the termination of this Agreement and shall
remain in full force and effect; (ii) the termination of this Agreement shall
not relieve any party from any liability for any Willful and Material Breach
of any representation, warranty, covenant, obligation or other

action required by any party) such that effective upon the termination of this

term "current management personnel with the title of Director, Sr. Staff, Sr.
Principal, Architect or above", and (B) as used in paragraph 8(b) in the
Confidentiality Agreement shall be replaced with the term "current management
personnel with the title of Director or above."

Agreement and at or prior to the time of termination of this Agreement an
Acquisition Proposal shall have been made or publicly announced or 

 



57  communicated; and (iii) within 12 months after the date of such termination,
an Acquisition Transaction (whether or not relating to such Acquisition
Proposal) is consummated or a definitive agreement providing for an
Acquisition Transaction (whether or not relating to such Acquisition Proposal)
is executed ( _provided_ that for purposes of this _clause (iii)_ the
references to "15%" in the definition of Acquisition Transaction shall be
deemed to be references to "50%"), then, the Company shall pay to Parent a
non-refundable fee in the amount of $18,000,000 in cash (the "Company
Termination Fee").

 

(c) If this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section 8.1(e)_,
or if this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the Company pursuant to any
other provision of _Section 8.1_ (other than _Section 8.1(h)_) at any time
after the occurrence of a Triggering Event and prior to obtaining the
Requisite Stockholder Approval, then (unless the Company is required to pay
to Parent the fee referred to in _Section 8.3(d)_) the Company shall pay to
Parent the Company Termination Fee.

(d) If this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the Company at any time after
the Company Board Recommendation has been withdrawn or modified in accordance
with _clause (ii)_ of  _Section 5.2(d)_ (other than pursuant to _Section
8.1(h)_) and prior to obtaining the Requisite Stockholder Approval, then the
Company shall pay to Parent a non-refundable fee in the amount of $27,500,000
in cash. 

(e) If this Agreement is terminated by: (i) Parent or the Company pursuant to
_Section 8.1(b)_; (ii) at the time of the termination of this Agreement, any
Antitrust Condition was not satisfied, or waived by Parent; (iii) the failure
of such Antitrust Condition to be satisfied did not result from any breach by
the Company of any covenant or obligation set forth in this Agreement; (iv)
at the time of the termination of this Agreement, each of the conditions in
_Section 6_, other than the Antitrust Conditions in _Section 6_ and the
condition set forth in _Section 6.4_, was satisfied; and (v) the condition
in _Section 6.4_ would be satisfied if the Closing were to occur on the End
Date, then Parent shall pay to the Company a non-refundable fee in the amount
of $30,000,000 (the "Parent Termination Fee").

(f) Any Company Termination Fee required to be paid to Parent pursuant to
_Section 8.3(b)_ shall be paid by the Company contemporaneously with the
earlier to occur of the consummation of, or entry into of a definitive
agreement relating to, the Acquisition Transaction contemplated by  _Section
8.3(b)_. Any Company Termination Fee required to be paid to Parent pursuant to
_Section 8.3(c)_ or _Section 8.3(d)_ shall be paid by the Company: (i) in
the case of a termination of this Agreement by the Company, at or prior to
the time of such termination; or (ii) in the case of a termination of this
Agreement by Parent, within two business days after such termination. Any
Parent Termination Fee required to be paid to the Company pursuant to 
_Section 8.3(e)_ shall be paid by Parent: (A) in the case of a termination of
this Agreement by Parent, at or prior to the time of such termination; or (B)
in the case of a termination of this Agreement by the Company, within
two business days after such termination. In no event shall the Company
Termination Fee or the Parent Termination Fee be paid on more than one
occasion.

(g) The parties acknowledge and agree that the covenants and obligations
contained in this _Section 8.3_ are an integral part of the Contemplated
Transactions, and that, without these covenants and obligations, the parties
would not have entered into this Agreement. The Company further acknowledges
that the Parent Termination Fee is not a penalty, but rather is a reasonable
amount that will compensate the Company in the circumstances in which the
Parent Termination Fee is payable for the efforts and resources expended and
opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on
this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the Merger,
which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, except in the case
of a Willful and Material Breach by Parent, the Companys right to 

 



58  receive the payment of the Parent Termination Fee from Parent shall be the
sole and exclusively remedy of the Company against Parent or Merger Sub for
the loss suffered as a result of the failure of the Merger to be consummated
or any loss suffered as a result of any breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or obligation in this Agreement, and none of Parent, Merger
Sub, any of their respective Subsidiaries or any of their respective former,
current or future officers, directors, partners, stockholders, managers,
members, Affiliates or agents shall have any further liability or obligations
relating to or arising out of this Agreement. Likewise Parent acknowledges
that the Company Termination Fee is not a penalty, but rather is a reasonable
amount that will compensate Parent in the circumstances in which the Company
Termination Fee is payable for the efforts and resources expended and
opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on
this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the Merger, which
amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this  _Section 8.3(g)_ shall limit
the rights of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company under _Section 9.12_ (or
otherwise with respect to injunctive or similar relief), in each case prior to
the termination of this Agreement.

 

(h) If (i) the Company fails to pay when due any amount payable under this
_Section 8.3_, then (A) the Company shall reimburse Parent for all costs and
expenses (including fees and disbursements of counsel) incurred in connection
with the collection of such overdue amount and the enforcement by Parent of
its rights under this _Section 8.3_ and (B) the Company shall pay to Parent
interest on such overdue amount (for the period commencing as of the date such
overdue amount was originally required to be paid and ending on the date such
overdue amount is actually paid to Parent in full) at a rate per annum 500
basis points over the "prime rate" (as announced by Bank of America, N.A. or
any successor thereto) in effect on the date such overdue amount was
originally required to be paid; and (ii) Parent fails to pay when due any
amount payable under this _Section 8.3_, then (1) Parent shall reimburse the
Company for all costs and expenses (including fees and disbursements of
counsel) incurred in connection with the collection of such overdue amount
and the enforcement by the Company of its rights under this _Section 8.3_ and
(2) Parent shall pay to the Company interest on such overdue amount (for the
period commencing as of the date such overdue amount was originally required
to be paid and ending on the date such overdue amount is actually paid to
Parent in full) at a rate per annum 500 basis points over the "prime rate" (as
announced by Bank of America, N.A. or any successor thereto) in effect on
the date such overdue amount was originally required to be paid.

(i) Any fee or other amount payable pursuant to this  _Section 8.3_ shall be
paid by the paying party free and clear of all deductions and withholdings. In
the event that any deduction or withholding is required by applicable Legal

for the District of Delaware); (b) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or
defeat such jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from such court;
and (c) agrees that it will not bring any such action in any court other than

PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES, AGREES AND CERTIFIES THAT: (i) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR
ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE,
THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO PREVENT OR
DELAY ENFORCEMENT OF SUCH WAIVER; (ii) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE
IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVER; (iii) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVER VOLUNTARILY; AND (iv)

or warranty set forth in the corresponding numbered or lettered section in
_Section 2_, and shall not be deemed to relate to or to qualify any other
representation or warranty, except where it is reasonably apparent on its face
from the substance of the matter disclosed that such information is intended
to qualify another representation or warranty. The fact that any item of
information is disclosed in the Disclosure Schedule shall not be construed to
represent a determination that: (a) such item is material or establishes a
standard of materiality; or (b) such item did not arise in the ordinary
course of business or consistent with past practice. Such information and the

interpreting the terms "material," "Material Adverse Effect" or other similar
terms in this Agreement.

Agreement or the rights of any of the parties hereunder, the prevailing party

without the prior written consent of Parent; or (b) Parent, in whole or in

therefor. Accordingly, in the event of any breach or threatened breach by any
party of any covenant or obligation contained in this Agreement, the Company
or Parent shall be entitled to obtain, without proof of actual damages (and in
addition to any other remedy to which such party may be entitled at law or in
equity): (a) a decree or order of specific performance to enforce the
observance and performance of such covenant or obligation; and (b) an
injunction restraining such breach or threatened breach. The Company and
Parent each hereby waives any requirement for the securing or posting of any

any Legal Requirement in this Agreement shall be construed as referring to
