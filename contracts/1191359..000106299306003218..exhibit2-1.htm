The Merger

 2.1  At Closing, Arkanova shall be merged with and into the
Acquirer pursuant to this Agreement and Plan of Merger and the separate
corporate existence of Arkanova shall cease and the Acquirer, as it exists
from and after the Closing, shall be the Surviving Company.

 

Effect of the Merger

 2.2 The Merger shall have the effect provided therefor by the
State Corporation Law. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and
subject thereto, at Closing (i) all the rights, privileges, immunities,
powers and franchises, of a public as well as of a private nature, and all
property, real, personal and mixed, and all debts due on whatever account,
including without limitation subscriptions to shares, and all other choses in
action, and all and every other interest of or belonging to or due to
Arkanova or the Acquirer, as a group, subject to the terms hereof, shall be
taken and deemed to be transferred to, and vested in, the Surviving Company
without further act or deed; and all property, rights and privileges,
immunities, powers and franchises and all and every other interest shall be
thereafter as effectually the property of the Surviving Company, as they were
of Arkanova and the Acquirer, as a group, and (ii) all debts, liabilities,
duties and obligations of Arkanova and the Acquirer, as a group, subject to
the terms hereof, shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the
Surviving Company and the Surviving Company shall thenceforth be responsible
and liable for all debts, liabilities, duties and obligations of Arkanova and
the Acquirer, as a group, and neither the rights of creditors nor any liens
upon the property of Arkanova or the Acquirer, as a group, shall be impaired
by the Merger, and may be enforced against the Surviving Company.

 

Certificate of Incorporation; Bylaws; Directors and Officers 

 2.3 The Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Company
from and after the Closing shall be the Certificate of Incorporation of the
Acquirer until thereafter amended in accordance with the provisions therein
and as provided by the applicable provisions of the State Corporation Law.
The Bylaws of the Surviving Company from and after the Closing shall be the
Bylaws of the Acquirer as in effect immediately prior to the Closing,
continuing until thereafter amended in accordance with their terms, the
Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Company and as provided by the
State Corporation Law. \- 7 -

 

The Directors of Arkanova at the Effective Time shall be the Directors of the
Surviving Company after the Closing.

 

Conversion of Securities

 2.4  At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without
any action on the part of the Acquirer, Arkanova or the Arkanova
Shareholders, the shares of capital stock of each of Arkanova and the
Acquirer shall be converted as follows:

        | (a)   |  

_Capital Stock of the Acquirer_. Each issued and  outstanding share of the
Acquirer\'s capital stock shall continue to be  issued and outstanding and
shall be converted into one share of validly  issued, fully paid, and non-
assessable common stock of the Surviving  Company. Each stock certificate of
the Acquirer evidencing ownership of  any such shares shall continue to
evidence ownership of such shares of  capital stock of the Surviving Company. 

      |   | 
      | (b)   |  

_Conversion of Arkanova Shares_. Each Arkanova Share  that is issued and
outstanding at the Effective Time shall automatically  be cancelled and
extinguished and converted, without any action on the  part of the holder
thereof, into the right to receive at the time and in  the amounts described
in this Agreement an amount of Acquisition Shares  equal to the number of
Acquisition Shares divided by the number of  Arkanova Shares outstanding
immediately prior to Closing. All such  Arkanova Shares, when so converted,
shall no longer be outstanding and  shall automatically be cancelled and
retired and shall cease to exist, and  each holder of a certificate
representing any such shares shall cease to  have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive the  Acquisition Shares paid in
consideration therefor upon the surrender of  such certificate in accordance
with this Agreement. 

 

Issuance of Additional Alton Shares

 2.5 In the event that Alton, during the twenty-four (24) month
period following the Effective Date, issues or agrees to issue shares of its
then authorized common stock, or issues or agrees to issue options, warrants
or other rights to acquire shares of its then authorized common stock, at an
effective price per share which is less than $0.80 per Alton Common Share (as
adjusted for any stock dividends, share splits, consolidations or
recapitalizations, other than the Stock Split), then the Arkanova
Shareholders, on a pro rata basis, shall be entitled to receive that number
of additional Alton Common Shares equal to the difference between $0.80 and
the price at which the new shares are issued (or the exercise price of the
options, warrants or other rights to acquire shares, as the case may be)
multiplied by 13,000,000. All shares to be issued pursuant to this Section
2.5 shall be validly issued and outstanding as fully paid and non-assessable
shares and shall be transferable upon the books of Alton, in all cases
subject to the provisions and restrictions of all applicable securities laws.

 

Adherence with Applicable Securities Laws

 2.6  The Arkanova Shareholders are acquiring the Acquisition
Shares for investment purposes and may not offer, sell or otherwise transfer,
pledge or hypothecate any of the Acquisition Shares issued to them (other
