NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements set forth in this Agreement, the Parties
agree as follows:

ARTICLE I.

 

 _THE MERGER_

 1.1 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in this Agreement, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub will be merged with and
into the Company and the separate existence of Merger Sub shall thereupon
cease. The Company will be the surviving corporation in the Merger under the
MGCL (sometimes hereinafter referred to as the "Surviving Corporation") and,
following the Merger, will be a wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent. The Merger
will have the effects set forth in this Agreement and specified in the MGCL
and the MLLCA.

 

1.2 _Closing_.

 

(a) The closing of the Merger (the "Closing") will take place at the
offices of Greenberg Traurig, LLP, 3161 Michelson Drive, Suite 1000, Irvine,
CA 92612, at 10:00 a.m. (New York City time), as soon as practicable (and, in
any event, within three (3) Business Days) following the satisfaction or, to
the extent permitted by applicable Law, waiver of the conditions set forth in
_Article VI_ (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied only at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, waiver of those conditions), unless
another place, date or time is mutually agreed to in writing by the Company
and Parent (the day on which the Closing takes place, the "Closing Date").

 

(b) In addition, upon the terms set forth in this Agreement, the closing of
the Preferred Stock Offering contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 5.19_ of this
Agreement will take place at the offices of Greenberg Traurig, LLP, 3161
Michelson Drive, Suite 1000, Irvine, CA 92612, at 10:00 a.m. (New York City
time), on the Closing Date immediately following, and subject to the
consummation of, the Closing, unless another place, date or time is mutually
agreed to in writing by the Company and Parent.

 

1.3 _Effective Time_. As soon as practicable on the Closing Date, the
Company and Merger Sub will cause the Merger to be consummated by (a)
executing, acknowledging and filing with the State Department of Assessments
and Taxation of the State of Maryland (the "SDAT") articles of merger with
respect to the Merger (the "Articles of Merger"), in such form as required
by, and executed in accordance with, the relevant provisions of the MGCL and
the MLLCA, and (b) making any other filings, recordings or publications
required to be made by the Company or Merger Sub under the MGCL and the
MLLCA. The Merger will become effective on the date and time at which the
Articles of Merger have been filed with, and accepted for record by, the SDAT
or on such later date and time (not to exceed thirty (30) days from the date
the Articles of Merger are accepted for record by the SDAT) as may be mutually
agreed to by the Company and Parent in writing and specified in the Articles
of Merger (the "Effective Time"). 

 



2

    

1.4 _Charter and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation_. At the Effective
Time, the charter of the Company, as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, shall be amended as part of the Merger as set forth in
_Exhibit A_ attached hereto, which shall be attached to the Articles of
Merger, and as so amended as part of the Merger will be the charter of the
Surviving Corporation (the "Charter") until thereafter amended, supplemented,
corrected or restated. The Parties shall take all necessary action such that
the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation in effect from and after the
Effective Time shall be amended and restated as of the Effective Time to be in
the form of the bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time (except that references to the name of Merger Sub shall be
replaced by references to the name of the Surviving Corporation) (the
"Bylaws"), until thereafter amended, supplemented or restated.

 

1.5 _Directors and Officers of Surviving Corporation_. The Parties will
take all actions necessary (including by so designating in the Articles of
Merger) so that the directors of the Surviving Corporation are the Persons
designated by Parent in its sole discretion, until their respective successors
have been duly elected and qualify or until their earlier death, resignation
or removal in accordance with the MGCL, the Charter and the Bylaws. The
Parties will take all actions necessary so that the officers of the Surviving
Corporation are the Persons designated by Parent in its sole discretion,
until their respective successors have been duly elected or appointed and
qualify or until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance
with the MGCL, the Charter and the Bylaws.

 

1.6 _Tax Consequences_. The Parties intend that, for U.S. federal and
applicable state income tax purposes, the Merger shall be treated as a
taxable sale by the Stockholders of the Shares in exchange for the per Share
Merger Consideration. The Parties hereto agree not to take any position on any
tax return that is inconsistent with the foregoing for all U.S. federal, and,
if applicable, state and local tax purposes.

ARTICLE II.

 

 _MERGER CONSIDERATION_

 

2.1 _Delivery of Company Estimate of Available Cash_.

 

(a) No later than fifteen (15) days prior to the anticipated Closing Date,
the Company will deliver to Parent a closing statement (the "Estimated
Closing Statement") setting forth the Companys (i) estimate of Available Cash
(the "Available Cash Estimate") and (ii) calculation of the Aggregate Merger
Consideration based on the Available Cash Estimate (the "Estimated Aggregate
Merger Consideration"). The Available Cash Estimate will be prepared in
accordance with the definition of "Available Cash" set forth in this
Agreement, applied consistently with the Sample Calculation.

(b) Parent shall have five (5) Business Day following the Companys
delivery of the Estimated Closing Statement (the "Objection Period") to object
to the Available Cash Estimate and the Companys calculation of the Aggregate
Merger Consideration set forth therein, by delivering to the Company a
written notice setting forth the disputed items, including Parents
calculation of the amounts in dispute and the reasons for Parents objection
thereto in reasonable detail (an "Objection Notice"). If Parent

 



3

    

 delivers to the Company an Objection Notice within the Objection Period
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.1(b)_, then the Company and Parent will
cooperate in good faith to resolve the disputed items set forth in such
Objection Notice as promptly as practicable following Parents delivery of
such Objection Notice (and in any event no later than three (3) Business Days
prior to the anticipated Closing Date) (such period, the "Resolution Period")
and agree on the amounts of Available Cash and the Estimated Aggregate Merger
Consideration.

 

(c) If (x) Parent does not deliver to the Company an Objection Notice
pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 2.1(b)_ or (y) Parent delivers to the Company an
Objection Notice pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.1(b)_ and all disputed items
set forth in such Objection Notice are resolved by the Company and Parent
within the Resolution Period, then, in each case, no later than three (3)
Business Days prior to the anticipated Closing Date, the Company shall deliver
to Parent an updated closing statement (the "Closing Statement") setting
forth an updated (i) estimate of Available Cash (taking into account the
agreed upon resolution of any disputed items, if applicable) and (ii)
calculation of the Aggregate Merger Consideration based on the updated
estimate of Available Cash. Unless Parent objects to the updated calculations
of Available Cash and the Aggregate Merger Consideration set forth in the
Closing Statement in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.1(d)_, such
calculations shall be final, conclusive and binding on the Parties.

(d) Parent may object to the Companys calculations of Available Cash and
the Aggregate Merger Consideration set forth in the Closing Statement only if
(x) the amount of Available Cash set forth in the Closing Statement exceeds
the Available Cash Estimate by more than $100,000 or (y) the reason for
Parents objection is that the calculation of Available Cash set forth in the
Closing Statement was not either (i) consistent in all material respects with
the estimated calculations of Available Cash and Aggregate Merger
Consideration, each as agreed upon pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.1(b)_ or
_Section_ __ _ 2.1(e)_, as applicable, or (ii) performed in accordance with
the definition of "Available Cash" set forth in this Agreement, applied
consistently with the Sample Calculation. Parent may object to the Companys
calculations of Available Cash and the Aggregate Merger Consideration set
forth in the Closing Statement by delivering to the Company, prior to the
Closing Date, an Objection Notice setting forth the disputed items, including
Parents calculation of the amounts in dispute and the reasons for Parents
objection thereto in reasonable detail. If Parent does not deliver to the
Company an Objection Notice pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.1(d)_, then the
updated calculation of Available Cash and the Aggregate Merger Consideration
set forth in the Closing Statement shall be final, conclusive and binding on
the Parties. If Parent delivers to the Company an Objection Notice pursuant to
this _Section_ __ _ 2.1(d)_, then the Company and Parent will cooperate in
good faith to resolve the disputed items set forth in such Objection Notice
as promptly as practicable following Parents delivery of such Objection
Notice (and in any event prior to the anticipated Closing Date) and agree on
the amounts of Available Cash and the Estimated Aggregate
Merger Consideration. If all disputed items set forth in such Objection
Notice are resolved by the Company and Parent prior to the Closing Date, then,
on or prior to Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to Parent a further
updated Closing Statement setting forth an updated calculation of (i)
Available Cash (taking into account the agreed upon resolution of any such
disputed items) and (ii) the Aggregate Merger Consideration, and such updated
calculations shall be final, conclusive and binding on the Parties.

 



4

    

(e) If Parent delivers to the Company an Objection Notice (x) pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 2.1(b)_ and the Company and Parent are unable to resolve any
disputed items set forth therein within the Resolution Period or (y) pursuant
to _Section_ __ _ 2.1(d)_ and the Company and Parent are unable to resolve
any disputed items set forth therein prior to the Closing Date, then, in each
case, the Parties shall promptly (and in any event within two (2) Business
Days) after the end of the Resolution Period or the delivery of an Objection
Notice pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.1(d)_, as applicable, submit such
unresolved disputed items (each, a "Disputed Item") to Squar Milner LLP or, if
such firm is not available, a mutually acceptable nationally recognized
accounting firm that has not provided material services to either the Company
or Parent or any of their respective Affiliates in the preceding three (3)
years (the "Independent Accountant"). The Parties shall instruct the
Independent Accountant to render a decision with respect to the Disputed Items
as soon as practicable (and in any event within ten (10) days) after the
submission to it of the Disputed Items. Each of the Company and Parent shall
make available to the Independent Accountant all information, records, data
and working papers as may be reasonably requested by the Independent
Accountant in connection with the resolution of the Disputed Items. The
Independent Accountant shall act as an expert and not as an arbitrator to
calculate, based solely on the written submissions of the Parties and not by
independent investigation, regarding each of the Disputed Items and shall be
instructed that its calculation (i) must be made in accordance with the
definition of "Available Cash" set forth in this Agreement, applied
consistently with the Sample Calculation, and (ii) with respect to each
Disputed Item, must be within the range of values established for such amount
as determined by reference to the values assigned to such amount by each of
the Parties. Except to the extent a Disputed Item relates to any
interpretation of Law or of the terms of this Agreement, the determination of
the Independent Accountant concerning any Disputed Item shall be final,
conclusive and binding on the Parties without further right of appeal. The
cost of the Independent Accountant in connection with its services pursuant
to this _Section_ __ _ 2.1(e)_ shall be shared equally by the Company and
Parent. For the avoidance of doubt, if any Disputed Item regarding the
Available Cash is submitted to the Independent Accountant pursuant to this 
_Section_ __ _ 2.1(e)_, the Parties will not proceed to consummate the
Closing until such Disputed Items are resolved in accordance with this
_Section_ __ _ 2.1(e)_.

 

2.2 _Effect of the Merger on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any
capital stock of the Company or Merger Sub:

(a) _Merger Consideration_. Each share of common stock, par value $0.001
per share, of the Company (each, a "Share" and, collectively, the "Shares")
(excluding any Shares granted in the form of Unvested Company
Restricted Stock Awards, which will be treated in accordance with _Section_
__ _ 2.4_) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(other than any Shares owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any other wholly-owned
Subsidiary of Parent (each, an "Excluded Share" and, collectively, "Excluded
Shares")) will be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal

 



5

    

 to the Merger Consideration, without interest, payable in accordance with
and in the manner set forth in _Section_ __ _ 2.3_, will cease to be
outstanding, will be cancelled and will cease to exist as of the Effective
Time, and each certificate formerly representing any Shares (other than
Excluded Shares) (each, a "Stock Certificate") and each book-entry account
formerly representing any non-certificated Shares (other than Excluded Shares)
(each, a "Book-Entry Share") will thereafter represent only the right to
receive the Merger Consideration, without interest.

 

(b) _Cancellation of Excluded Shares_. Each Excluded Share will cease to
be outstanding, will be cancelled without payment of any consideration
therefor, and will cease to exist.

(c) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. All of the limited liability company
interests of Merger Sub outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
will be converted into and become one share of common stock, par value $0.001
per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

For clarity, the obligations of the Company to issue and sell shares of Series
A Preferred Stock at the closing of the Preferred Stock Offering immediately
following the Effective Time shall survive the Closing and be an obligation of
the Surviving Corporation.

 

2.3 _Surrender of Shares_.

 

(a) _Appointment of Paying Agent_. Prior to the Closing, Parent and Merger
Sub will appoint Broadridge Corporate Issuer Solutions, Inc. or, if such
financial service company is not available, a nationally recognized financial
service company or trust company that has not provided material services to
either the Company or Parent or any of their respective Affiliates in the
preceding three (3) years and is reasonably acceptable to the Company and
Parent to serve as the paying agent (together with its successors and
permitted assigns, the "Paying Agent") in connection with the Merger and the
other Transactions and will enter into an agreement with the Paying Agent, in
form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Company and Parent, relating
to the Paying Agents responsibilities with respect to this Agreement,
including the payment of the Merger Consideration in accordance herewith (as
it may be amended, modified, or supplemented from time to time in accordance
with the terms thereof, the "Paying Agent Agreement").

 

(b) _Deposit of Merger Consideration_. Pursuant to the Paying Agent
Agreement, at or prior to the Closing, Parent will deposit, or will cause to
be deposited, with the Paying Agent, in trust for the benefit of the holders
of Shares immediately prior to the Effective Time, cash in U.S. dollars in an
amount equal to the Aggregate Merger Consideration, as finally determined
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.1(c)_ or _Section_ __ _ 2.1(d)_, as the case
may be (all cash deposited with the Paying Agent pursuant to this  _Section_
__ _ 2.3(b)_ being hereinafter referred to as the "Payment Fund"). The

expressly provided for in this Agreement. Any such investment, if made, must

_Section_ __ _ 2.3(e)_ ( _Termination of Payment Fund_ ), Parent will, or
will cause the Surviving Corporation to, promptly replace or restore the cash
in the Payment Fund so as to ensure that the Payment Fund is at all times
maintained at a level sufficient for the Paying Agent to make all payments of
the Merger Consideration as provided under _Section_ __ _ 2.2(a)_. No
investment losses resulting from investment of the Payment Fund will diminish
the rights of any holder of Shares immediately prior to the Effective Time to
receive the Merger Consideration as provided herein.

 

(c) _Procedures for Surrender_.

 

(i) Promptly after the Effective Time, and in any event within two (2)
Business Days thereafter, Parent will cause the Paying Agent to mail to each
holder of record of Shares or, in the case of "street-holders," deliver to The
Depository Trust Company ("DTC") (in each case, other than holders of Excluded
Shares) immediately prior to the Effective Time: (A) a letter of transmittal
(the "Letter of Transmittal"), in customary form, specifying that delivery
will be effected, and risk of loss and title will pass, only upon delivery of
the Stock Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the Stock
Certificates as provided in _Section_ __ _ 2.3(f)_) or transfer of the Book-
Entry Shares to the Paying Agent (including customary provisions with respect
to delivery of an "agents message" with respect to Book-Entry Shares), and
(B) instructions for effecting the surrender of the Stock Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu of the Stock Certificates as provided in 
_Section_ __ _ 2.3(f)_) or the Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent in
exchange for payment of the aggregate amount of Merger Consideration that such
holder is entitled to pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, such materials
to be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent and the Company
may reasonably agree.

 

(ii) Upon surrender to the Paying Agent of a Stock Certificate (or
affidavits of loss in lieu of the Stock Certificates, as provided in
_Section_ __ _ 2.3(f)_) or Book-Entry Shares, together with, in the case of
Stock Certificates, the Letter of Transmittal, duly executed, or, in the case
of Book-Entry Shares held through DTC, receipt of an "agents message" by the
Paying Agent and required presentation by DTC, and such other documents as may
be reasonably required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Stock
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares will be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor, and Parent will cause the Paying Agent to pay and deliver to each
such holder, as promptly as practicable, a check or wire transfer of
immediately available funds in the amount of cash that such holder has the
right to receive pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.2(a)_. Notwithstanding the
forgoing, if a holder of not less than 24,000 Shares properly delivers to the
Paying Agent a Stock Certificate (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the
Stock Certificates, as provided in _Section_ __ _ 2.3(f)_) or Book-Entry
Shares, together with, in the case of Stock Certificates, the Letter of
Transmittal, duly executed, or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares held through
DTC, receipt of an "agents message" by the Paying Agent and required
presentation by

 



7

    

 DTC, in each case, at least five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing
Date, the Paying Agent will, and Parent will cause the Paying Agent to, pay
and deliver to each such holder the amounts due to such holders pursuant to
this _Section_ __ _ 2.3(c)_ not later than one (1) Business Day following the
Closing Date.

 

(iii) No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon
surrender of the Shares.

 

(iv) In the event of a transfer of ownership of certificated Shares (other
than Excluded Shares) that is not registered in the stock transfer books of
the Company, a check for any cash to be paid upon due surrender of the Stock
Certificate may be issued to such transferee if the Stock Certificate formerly
representing such Shares is presented to the Paying Agent, accompanied by all
documents reasonably required by the Paying Agent to evidence and effect such
transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer Taxes have been
paid or are not applicable. Payment of the Merger Consideration with respect
to Book-Entry Shares will only be made to the Person in whose name such Book-
Entry Shares are registered in the stock transfer books of the Company
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 

(v) Parent will pay all charges and expenses, including those of the Paying
Agent, in connection with the surrender of Stock Certificates and Book-Entry
Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration.

 

(d) _Transfers_. From and after the Effective Time, there will be no
transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of the Shares that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, any Stock Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the
Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent for transfer, such Stock
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares will be cancelled and exchanged for the
amount of cash that the holder thereof has the right to receive therefor
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.2(a)_, in accordance with the procedures set
forth in _Section_ __ _ 2.3(c)(ii)_.

(e) _Termination of Payment Fund_. Any portion of the Payment Fund
(including the proceeds of any investments of the Payment Fund) that remains
unclaimed by, or otherwise undistributed to, the holders of Stock Certificates
and Book-Entry Shares by the twelve (12)-month anniversary of the Effective
Time will be delivered to Parent or the Surviving Corporation upon demand by
Parent. Any holder of Shares (other than Excluded Shares) who has not
theretofore complied with this _Article II_ will thereafter look only to
Parent and the Surviving Corporation for payment of the Merger Consideration
upon delivery of the Stock Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the
Stock Certificates as provided in  _Section_ __ _ 2.3(f)_) or transfer of
the Book-Entry Shares, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, none of the Surviving Corporation, Parent, the Paying Agent or any
other Person will be liable to any former holder of Shares for any amount
properly delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned
property, escheat, or similar Laws. If any Stock Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares shall not have been surrendered immediately prior to the time that
such Stock Certificates or Book-Entry Shares would escheat to, or become the
property of, any Governmental Authority, any

 



8

    

 unclaimed funds payable with respect to such Stock Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the
property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or
interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

(f) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Stock Certificates_. In the event any
Stock Certificate will have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon (i) the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Stock
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent or the
Paying Agent, (ii) the delivery to the Paying Agent of a letter of
instruction, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Paying Agent,
directing Paying Agent to accept such Persons payment instructions based on
the facts stated in such affidavit, and (iii) the posting by such Person of a
bond in such reasonable amount and upon such reasonable terms as may be
reasonably required by Parent to indemnify Parent and the Surviving
Corporation against any claim that may be made against Parent or the
Surviving Corporation with respect to such Stock Certificate, then the Paying
Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Stock
Certificate a check in the amount equal to (x) the number of Shares
represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed Stock Certificate __multiplied
by__ (y) the Merger Consideration.

 

2.4 _Treatment and Payment of Company Equity Awards_.

 

(a) _Treatment of Unvested Company Restricted Stock Awards_. At the
Effective Time, each Unvested Company Restricted Stock Award that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will become immediately
and fully vested, all restrictions thereon will lapse and such Unvested
Company Restricted Stock Award will be automatically converted into the right
to receive an amount in cash (without interest thereon) equal to the product
of (x) the total number of Shares subject to such Unvested Company Restricted
Stock Award (for the avoidance of doubt, excluding any Shares
receiving payment pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.3_) and (y) the Merger
Consideration, subject to applicable withholding of Taxes in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 2.7_, which amount shall be payable in accordance with 
_Section_ __ _ 2.4(b)_.

(b) _Payment Procedures_. Payments to holders in respect of Unvested
Company Restricted Stock Awards will be paid through the Companys or the
Surviving Corporations payroll system, as soon as reasonably practicable (but
in any event no later than five (5) Business Days) after the Effective Time.
Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent and Merger Sub will cause the Paying
Agent to transfer to the Surviving Corporation an amount in cash sufficient to
pay all amounts required by the foregoing sentence.

 

(c) _Corporate Actions_. At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company
will take all such lawful actions as may be necessary to (i) give effect to
the treatment of the Unvested Company Restricted Stock Awards in accordance
with this _Section_ __ _ 2.4_ and (ii) cause the Company Stock Plan to be
terminated effective at or prior to the Effective Time.

2.5 _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, in the event that, from the date of this Agreement
to the earlier of the Effective Time and the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with _Article VII_ , the number of Shares or securities convertible
or exchangeable into or exercisable for Shares will have been changed into a
different number of Shares or securities, or a different class, by reason of
any reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split), stock
dividend or distribution, recapitalization, or other similar transaction, the
Merger Consideration will be ratably adjusted to reflect fully the effect of
any such change; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this  _Section_ __
_ 2.5_ will be construed to permit the Company to take any action with
respect to its securities that is prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

 

2.6 _No Dissenters_ __ _or Appraisal Rights_. No dissenters or appraisal
rights will be available with respect to the Merger or the other
Transactions, including any remedy under Section 3-201 _et seq._ of the MGCL.

 

2.7 _Withholding_. Each of Parent and, as applicable, the Company or the
Surviving Corporation shall deduct and withhold, or cause the Paying Agent to
deduct and withhold, from any amounts payable or otherwise deliverable
pursuant to this Agreement to any holder or former holder of Shares (including
any Unvested Company Restricted Stock Awards) such amounts as are required to
be deducted or withheld therefrom under the Code or any provision of any
applicable Law ("Applicable Withholding Taxes"); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that, prior to making any such deduction or withholding, the applicable
withholding agent shall provide advance notice to the affected recipient of
the amounts subject to withholding and a reasonable opportunity for such
recipient to provide forms or other evidence that would exempt such amounts
from withholding Tax. To the extent any amounts are deducted or withheld and
paid over to the relevant Governmental Authority, such amounts shall be
treated for all purposes under this Agreement, except for  _Section_ __ _
8.11_, as having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would otherwise
have been paid.

Disclosure Schedule, each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has prepared
and timely filed (taking in account extensions validly obtained) all federal
income Tax Returns and all other material Tax Returns that are required to be
filed, and all such filed Tax Returns are true, accurate and complete in all
material respects. The Company and its Subsidiaries have paid all material
Taxes required to be paid by them (whether or not shown on any Tax Return),
other than Taxes that are not yet due or that are being contested in good
faith in appropriate

 



26

    

 proceedings and, in each case, which have been adequately reserved for in
accordance with GAAP. The Company has delivered to Parent true, correct and
complete copies of all such Tax Returns, examination reports and statements
of deficiencies, adjustments and proposed deficiencies and adjustments in
respect of the Company and any of the Subsidiaries for each Taxable period for
which the statute of limitations has not expired. The Company has made
available to Parent copies of any private letter ruling requests, closing
agreements or gain recognition agreements with respect to Taxes requested or
executed in the last six (6) years.

 

(b) The Company (i) upon the filing of its U.S. federal income tax return
on 2018 Form 1120-REIT for its taxable year beginning January 1, 2018 and
ending December 31, 2018, will have been subject to taxation for such year as
a real estate investment trust within the meaning of Sections 856 and 857 of
the Code (a "REIT") and has satisfied all requirements for qualification and
taxation as a REIT for such year (other than such filing, which will occur on
or before October 15, 2019); (ii) has operated since January 1, 2019 and
will continue to operate until the Effective Time in a manner consistent with
the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT, including
distributing any net capital gain and REIT taxable income earned prior to the
Effective Time (based on reasonable estimates agreed to in writing by the
Company and Parent) and assuming that the Company makes distributions of net
capital gain and REIT taxable income earned after the Effective Time for its
calendar year ending December 31, 2019 sufficient to meet the requirements of
Section 857(a)(1) of the Code and otherwise satisfies the requirements for
qualification as a REIT during the remainder of the 2019 tax year occurring
after the Effective Time; and (iii) has not taken or omitted to take any
action that could reasonably be expected to result in a challenge by the IRS
to its status as a REIT, and to the Knowledge of the Company, no such
challenge is pending or threatened. No entity in which Company owns an
interest is a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, other than a
"qualified REIT subsidiary" within the meaning of Section 856(i)(2) of the
Code ("Qualified REIT Subsidiary"), a "taxable REIT subsidiary" within the
meaning of Section 856(l) of the Code ("Taxable REIT Subsidiary"), or a REIT.
_Section_ __ _ 3.16(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a list
of each Qualified REIT Subsidiary and Taxable REIT Subsidiary owned directly
or indirectly by the Company, and each Subsidiary not so set forth and
identified in _Section_ __ _ 3.16(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule is
and has been since its formation classified as a partnership or entity
disregarded as separate from Company or a Subsidiary for U.S. federal income
tax purposes and not as a corporation or an association taxable as a
corporation. Taking into account all distributions to be made by the
Company prior to the Effective Time, the Company will have distributed cash
to the Stockholders for the portion of its taxable year that includes the
Closing Date ending at the Effective Time that is no less than the Companys
REIT taxable income and net capital gain through the Effective Time (based on
reasonable estimates agreed to in writing by the Company and Parent); and the
Company will not be subject to Tax including under Section 857(b) or 4981 of
the Code in respect of such portion of the taxable year.

(c) Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has complied in all respects
with all applicable Laws relating to the payment and withholding of Taxes and
all Taxes that it is obligated to withhold from amounts owing to any employee,
contractor, creditor or third party have been fully and timely paid or
properly accrued.

 



27

    

(d) The Company Balance Sheet reflects all Liabilities for unpaid Taxes of
the Company and any of the Subsidiaries for periods (or portions of periods
through December 31, 2018. Neither the Company nor any of the Subsidiaries has
any liability for unpaid Taxes accruing after the Company Balance Sheet Date
except for Taxes arising in the Ordinary Course of Business consistent with
past practice following December 31, 2018.

with the intent to hold for a long-term period and derive profits from
capital appreciation and rental income, and not for sale to customers in the
ordinary course of business.

 

(f) Beginning with its taxable year ended December 31, 2018, (i) the
Company and the Subsidiaries have not incurred any liability for material
Taxes under Sections 856(g)(5)(C), 857(b)(1), 857(b)(4), 857(b)(5),
857(b)(6)(A), 857(b)(7), 860(c) or 4981 of the Code or Section 337(d) (and/or
Section 1374) of the Code (and the applicable Treasury Regulations
thereunder) which have not been previously paid and shall not incur any such
liability (based on reasonable estimated agreed to in writing by the Company
and Parent) for such Taxes for the portion of the taxable year that includes
the Closing Date ending at the Effective Time, and (ii) neither the Company
nor any Subsidiary has incurred any material liability for Taxes other than
(A) in the Ordinary Course of Business, or (B) transfer or similar
Taxes arising in connection with a sale, exchange, or other transfer of
property. No event has occurred, and no condition or circumstance exists,
which presents a material risk that any material Tax described in the
preceding sentence will be imposed upon Company or the Subsidiaries.

(g) Beginning with its taxable year ended December 31, 2018, neither the
Company nor any Subsidiaries has engaged at any time in any "prohibited
transactions" within the meaning of Section 857(b)(6) of the Code or engaged
in any transaction that would give rise to "redetermined rents, redetermined
deductions, excess interest, and redetermined TRS service income" described in
Section 857(b)(7) of the Code.

 

(h) Neither Company nor any of the Subsidiaries (other than Taxable REIT
Subsidiaries) has or has had any earnings and profits attributable to such
entity or any other corporation that arose in any non-REIT year within the
meaning of Section 857 of the Code, other than earnings and profits that
were distributed prior to the end of the Companys tax year in which they
were acquired by the Company or its Subsidiaries.

 

(i) There is currently no dispute or claim concerning any Tax liability of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries claimed or raised by any Governmental
Authority of which the Company has received notice. Neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries has waived any statute of limitations in respect of
material Taxes beyond the date hereof or agreed to any extension of time
beyond the date hereof with respect to a material Tax assessment or
deficiency, and there has not been a request by a Governmental Authority to
execute such a waiver or extension.

jurisdiction where neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries files Tax
Returns such that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is or may be subject
to taxation by, or required to file any Tax Return in, that jurisdiction. No
Liens for Taxes exist with respect to any assets or properties of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries, other than Permitted Liens.

(l) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries (i) is, or has been, a
party to any Tax sharing, allocation, indemnity or similar Contract (other

entered into in the Ordinary Course of Business, the primary purpose of which
do not relate to Taxes) pursuant to which it will have any obligation to make
any payments for Taxes after the Effective Time, (ii) has been a member of an
affiliated group filing a consolidated U.S. federal income Tax Return or other
similar combined, consolidated or unitary Tax group (other than a group the
common parent of which was the Company or its predecessor or any of its

on any person (other than the Company or its predecessor or any of its
Subsidiaries) under Treasury Regulations 1.1502-6 or any similar provision of
state, local or foreign Law, or as a transferee or successor, by contract or
otherwise.

participated in a "listed transaction" within the meaning of Treasury
Regulations Section 1.6011-4(b).

 

(n) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has been a "controlled
corporation" or a "distributing corporation" (or, in each case, a

(o) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has entered into any
"closing agreement" under Section 7121 of the Code, or other Contract with a
Governmental Authority in respect of Taxes that remains in effect, and no
request for a ruling, relief, advice, or any other item that relates to the
Taxes or Tax Returns of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is currently
pending with any Governmental Authority.

(p) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries will be required to

income for any taxable period (or portion thereof) ending after the Closing
Date as a result of any

consummate the Merger and the other Transactions. Parent has made available
the Company correct and complete copies of the Organizational Documents of
Parent and Merger Sub, each as amended through the date of this Agreement, and
each as so delivered is in full force and effect. Each of Parent and Merger

Sub to consummate the Merger and the other Transactions.

 

(b) The execution, delivery, and performance of this Agreement by Parent
and Merger Sub do not, and the consummation of the Merger and the other

any material Contract to which Parent or Merger Sub is a party, except in the
case of clauses (ii) and (iii) above, any such breach, violation, notice,
consent, approval, material increase in any cost or obligation, default,

supplied by or on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in the Information Statement will, at the time it
(or any amendment or supplement thereto) is first published, sent or given to
the Stockholders, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent and Merger Sub make no
representation or warranty with respect to statements included or incorporated
by reference in the Information Statement based on information supplied by
or on behalf of the Company for inclusion or incorporation by reference
therein.

4.5 _Litigation_. As of the date hereof, (a) there is not currently any
Action before any Governmental Authority pending or threatened in writing
against Parent or Merger Sub, or any of their respective material properties
or assets, that would or would reasonably be expected to,

 



34

    

 individually or in the aggregate, prevent, materially delay or materially
impair the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the Merger and the
other Transactions, and (b) neither Parent nor Merger Sub is subject to any
outstanding judgment, decision, ruling, order, writ, injunction, decree,
assessment or award of any Governmental Authority that would or would
reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, prevent,
materially delay or materially impair the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to
consummate the Merger and the other Transactions.

 

4.6 _Sufficiency of Funds_. As of the date hereof and as of the Effective
Time, and at such other time as payments may be required to be made by Parent
or Merger Sub under this Agreement (including, without limitation, the Closing
Date), Parent and Merger Sub, together, will have available to them cash and
other sources of immediately available funds sufficient to pay the Aggregate
Merger Consideration and all other cash amounts payable pursuant to this
Agreement, to pay all costs and expenses in connection with the Merger and the
other Transactions for which Parent or Merger Sub are responsible under
this Agreement, and to consummate the Merger and the other Transactions.
Parent and Merger Sub expressly acknowledge and agree that their obligations
under this Agreement, including their obligations to consummate the Merger and
the other Transactions, are not subject to, or conditioned on, the receipt or
availability of any funds or financing.

4.7 _Ownership of Merger Sub; No Prior Activities_. All of the issued and
outstanding limited liability company interests of Merger Sub are, and at the
Effective Time will be, owned by Parent or a direct or indirect wholly-owned
Subsidiary of Parent, free and clear of any Lien. Merger Sub has not
conducted any business and has no business activities, assets, liabilities,
claims by or against it or obligations of any nature, other than those
incident to its formation and pursuant to this Agreement and the Merger and
the other Transactions.

4.8 _Ownership of Shares; Interested Stockholder_. Neither Parent nor
any of its Subsidiaries beneficially owns, directly or indirectly, any
Shares, any rights or options to acquire any Shares, or any securities or
instruments convertible into, exchangeable for, or exercisable for Shares, and
neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has any rights to acquire any
Shares except pursuant to this Agreement. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub nor
any of their respective Affiliates is, nor at any time during the period
commencing three (3) years prior to the date of this Agreement has been, an
"interested stockholder" of the Company as defined in Section 3-601 of the
MGCL.

 

4.9 _Equity Commitment Letter_. Parent has received and accepted, and has
delivered to the Company, a true, correct and complete fully executed copy of
the Equity Commitment Letter from the Sponsor to invest, subject to the terms
and conditions therein, cash in the aggregate amount set forth therein (being
referred to as the "Equity Financing"). As of the date hereof, the Equity
Commitment Letter, in the form so delivered, is in full force and effect and
is a legal, valid and binding obligation of Parent and the other parties
thereto, except as such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar Laws affecting or
relating to creditors rights generally. The Equity Commitment Letter has not
been amended, supplemented or otherwise modified in any respect, no
amendment, supplement or modification is contemplated and the commitments
thereunder have not been withdrawn, terminated or rescinded in any respect. No
event has occurred that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both,
would or would reasonably be expected to constitute a default or breach on
the part of Parent, or any other

 



35

    

 parties thereto under any term or condition of the Equity Commitment Letter.
Parent has no reason to believe that Sponsor will be unable to satisfy any
term or condition set forth in the Equity Commitment Letter at or prior to
the Closing, or that any portion of the Equity Financing to be made thereunder
will otherwise not be available to consummate the Merger and the other
Transactions at the time required pursuant to this Agreement. The obligations
to make the Equity Financing available to Parent pursuant to the terms of the
Equity Commitment Letter are not subject to any conditions precedent or other
contingencies related to the funding of the full amount of the Equity
Financing, other than as expressly set forth in the Equity Commitment Letter.
As of the date of this Agreement, there are no agreements, arrangements or
understandings (whether oral or written) or commitments to enter into
agreements, arrangements or understandings (whether oral or written) to which
Parent is a party related to the Equity Financing other than as expressly
contained in the Equity Commitment Letter and delivered to the Company prior
to the date hereof. For the avoidance of doubt, it is not a condition to the
Closing under this Agreement for Parent to obtain the Equity Financing or any
other financing.

 

4.10 _Brokers and Finders_. No broker, investment banker, financial
advisor or other Person is entitled to any brokers, finders, financial
advisors or other similar fee or commission in connection with this
Agreement, the Merger or any other Transactions based upon arrangements made
by or on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub.

 

4.11 _Absence of Certain Arrangements_. None of Parent, Merger Sub nor any
of their respective Affiliates has entered into any Contract with any bank or
investment bank or other provider of debt or equity financing on an exclusive
basis in connection with any transaction involving the Company (or otherwise
on terms that would prohibit such provider from providing or seeking to
provide such financing to any third party in connection with a transaction
relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries), except for such actions
to which the Company has previously agreed in writing. Other than
this Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreement and the Support Agreement, as
of the date hereof, there are no Contracts or any commitments to enter into
any Contract between Parent, Merger Sub, or any of their respective
Affiliates, on the one hand, and any director, officer, employee or
stockholder of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on the other hand,
relating to the Transactions or the operations of the Surviving Corporation
after the Effective Time.

 

4.12 _No Other Representations or Warranties_. Each of Parent and Merger
Sub acknowledges and agrees that, except for the representations and
warranties expressly set forth in _Article III_, (a) the Company does not
make, and has not made, any representations or warranties relating to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or their respective properties, assets or
businesses, or otherwise in connection with this Agreement, the Merger or the

III_, (b) no Person has been authorized by the Company to make any
representations or warranty relating to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, or their respective properties, assets or businesses, or
otherwise in connection with this Agreement, the Merger or the other
Transactions and, if made, any such representation or warranty will not be

knowingly facilitate any effort or attempt to make an Acquisition Proposal,

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section_ __ _
5.4(a)_ or elsewhere in this Agreement, express or implied, if at any time on
or after the date hereof and prior to the Written Consent Effective Time, the
Company or any of its Representatives receives a written Acquisition Proposal
from any Person that did not result from a breach of _Section_ __ _ 5.4(a)_,
the Company and its Representatives may contact the Person who made such
Acquisition Proposal (and such Persons Representatives) solely to ascertain
facts or clarify terms so that the Company Board may become fully informed
with respect to the terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal and the
Person who submitted the same, and if the Company Board determines in good
faith, (A) After Consultation with the Companys financial advisor and outside
legal counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or would reasonably
be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal and (B) After Consultation with
the Companys outside legal counsel, that the failure to take the actions
described in clause (x) or (y) below would reasonably be expected to be
inconsistent with the duties of the Companys directors under applicable Law,
then the Company and its Representatives may (x) furnish, pursuant to an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, information (including non-public

_provided_ that the Company promptly (and in any event within 48 hours) shall
provide to Parent such material non-public information, if such information
was not previously provided to Parent or its Representatives, and (y) engage
and participate in discussions and negotiations with the Person making such
Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall promptly (and in any event within 48
hours) provide to Parent to the extent provided to and in the possession of
the Company, its Subsidiaries or their respective Representatives, a copy of
the proposed transaction documents in respect of such Acquisition Proposal

financing fee information). The terms and existence of any such Acquisition
Proposal, the identity of the Person making such Acquisition Proposal, and all
information provided to Parent pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 5.4(b)_

discussions or negotiations regarding the status of any Acquisition Proposal.

Proposal to the Stockholders, (ii) authorize, cause or permit the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries to enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding, agreement-in-principle, written commitment or definitive
agreement with respect to any Acquisition Proposal (other than an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 5.4(b)_) (the
actions described in clauses (i) and (ii) being referred to, collectively, as
an "Adverse Recommendation Change"), or (iii) terminate this Agreement

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this _Section_
__ _ 5.4_ or elsewhere in this Agreement, express or implied, prior to the

received by the Company that did not result from a material breach of
_Section_ __ _ 5.4(a)_, the Company Board may make an Adverse Recommendation
Change and terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.3(b)_ if it
has determined in good faith, After Consultation, that such Acquisition
Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Company shall not be entitled to exercise its right to make any such Adverse
Recommendation Change or terminate this Agreement pursuant to  _Section_ __ _
7.3(b)_ until after the fourth (4th) Business Day (the "Superior Proposal
Notice Period") following Parents receipt of written notice (a "Superior
Proposal Notice") from the Company advising Parent that the Company Board
intends to take such action, including the details of the terms and conditions
of any Superior Proposal that is the basis of the proposed action by the
Company Board and the identity of the party making such Superior Proposal,
and, if applicable, contemporaneously providing a copy of all of the relevant
proposed transaction agreements and any other material documents provided by,
or material correspondence with, the party making such Superior Proposal; and
_provided_ , _further_ , that prior to making such Adverse Recommendation
Change or terminating this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.3(b)_, (i)
the Company shall have negotiated, and have caused its Representatives to
negotiate, in good faith with Parent during the Superior Proposal Notice
Period, to the extent Parent theretofore shall have notified the Company that
it desires to so negotiate, to enable Parent to submit to the Company, prior
to the expiration of the Superior Proposal Notice Period, a proposed
definitive amendment to this Agreement in such form that, if approved by the
Company Board and entered into, would constitute a binding definitive
agreement among the Company, Parent and Merger Sub (and, if applicable, any
other material transaction documents), and (ii) if Parent shall have submitted
to the Company prior to the expiration

 



42

    

 of the Superior Proposal Notice Period the proposed definitive amendments
described in clause (i), the Company Board shall have determined in good
faith, After Consultation, that after giving effect to such proposed
amendments and entering into the aforementioned definitive amendment to this
Agreement (and, if applicable, or any other material transaction documents)
proposed by Parent, the applicable Acquisition Proposal would continue to
constitute a Superior Proposal; _provided_ , _further_ , _however_ , (1) that
any change to the price or other material change to the material terms of such
Acquisition Proposal will require a new Superior Proposal Notice, to
be delivered by the Company to Parent consistent with the content
requirements described in clause (i) above, and will trigger a new three (3)
Business Day period following Parents receipt of such new Superior Proposal
Notice (a "Subsequent Superior Proposal Notice Period") during which the
Company shall not be entitled to exercise its right to make any such Adverse
Recommendation Change or terminate this Agreement pursuant to  _Section_ __ _
7.3(b)_ and shall comply with its obligations set forth in clauses (i) and
(ii) above, and (2) any purported termination of this Agreement pursuant to
this sentence shall be void and of no force and effect unless the Company
terminates this Agreement in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 7.3(b)_, has
complied in all material respects with its obligations under this _Section_ __
_ 5.4_ and pays (or causes to be paid) to Parent the Company Termination
Payment in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 7.5(b)_ substantially concurrently

Recommendation Change in respect of a Superior Proposal if any such Superior
Proposal resulted from a breach by the Company of this _Section_ __ _ 5.4_.

 

(e) Nothing contained in this _Section_ __ _ 5.4_ shall prohibit the
Company from (i) (x) taking and disclosing to the Stockholders a position
contemplated by Rule 14d-9, Rule 14e-2(a) or Item 1012 of Regulation M-A
under the Exchange Act or (y) making any disclosure to the Stockholders if the
Company Board determines in good faith, After Consultation with the Companys
outside legal counsel, that the failure to make such disclosure would
reasonably be likely to be inconsistent with applicable Law (and, specifically
in the case of the duties of the Companys directors under applicable Law,
that the failure to make such disclosure would reasonably be expected to be
inconsistent with the duties of the Companys directors under the applicable
Law) or (ii) making any "stop-look-and-listen" communication to the
Stockholders pursuant to Section 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act (or any
similar communications to the Stockholders, whether or not in the context of a
tender offer or exchange offer, that discloses the occurrence of any state of
facts, events, conditions or developments but does not include an Adverse
Recommendation Change); _provided_ that, it is hereby acknowledged and agreed
that a factually accurate public or other statement made by the Company
(including in response to any unsolicited inquiry, proposal or expression of
interest made by any Person to the Company not in breach of _Section_ __ _
5.4(a)_ that describes the operations of the provisions of this _Section_ __ _
5.4_ and/or _Section_ __ _ 7.3(b)_ will not, in and of itself, constitute an
Adverse Recommendation Change, so long as any such factually accurate public
or other statement includes an express reaffirmation of the Company
Recommendation).

 



43

    

5.5 _Stockholders_ __ _Written Consent; Information Statement_.

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the execution of this
Agreement (but in any event within three (3) Business Days after the date
hereof) and in lieu of calling a meeting of the Stockholders, the Company
shall submit the form of irrevocable written consent attached hereto as
_Exhibit B_ to certain of the Stockholders holding, in the aggregate, a
number of Shares sufficient to approve the Merger by the Requisite Stockholder
Vote (such written consent, as duly executed and delivered by such
Stockholders, the "Stockholders Written Consent"). As soon as practicable
upon receipt of the Stockholders Written Consent by the corporate secretary
of the Company, the Company will provide Parent with a facsimile copy of such
Stockholders Written Consent, certified as true and complete by the
corporate secretary of the Company. In connection with the Stockholders
Written Consent, the Company shall take all actions necessary to comply, and
shall comply in all respects, with the requirements of Section 2-505 of the
MGCL and the applicable provisions of the Organizational Documents of the
Company.

 

(b) As promptly as practicable (but in any event within ten (10) days)
following the Written Consent Effective Time, the Company shall prepare and
file with the SEC a written information statement of the type contemplated by
Rule 14c-2 of the Exchange Act (such information statement, including

concerning the Stockholders Written Consent, the Merger and the
other Transactions and (ii) the notice of action by written consent required
by Section 2-505 of the MGCL and the Organizational Documents of the Company.
Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall promptly furnish to the Company all
information concerning such Person as may be reasonably requested in
connection with the preparation, filing and distribution of the Information
Statement. The Company shall promptly notify Parent upon the receipt of
any comments from the SEC or its staff or any request from the SEC or its
staff for amendments or supplements to the Information Statement and shall
provide Parent with copies of all correspondence between it and its
representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, on the other hand. Each of the
Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall use their respective commercially
reasonable efforts to respond as promptly as practicable to any comments of
the SEC with respect to the Information Statement. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, prior to filing or mailing the Information Statement (or any
amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC with
respect thereto, the Company (i) shall provide Parent a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such document or response and
(ii) shall include in such document or response all comments reasonably
proposed by Parent. If, at any time prior to the date that is twenty (20) days
after the Information Statement is first mailed to the Stockholders, any
information relating to the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
respective affiliates, officers or directors should be discovered by the
Company, Parent or Merger Sub which is required to be set forth in an
amendment or supplement to the Information Statement, so that the Information
Statement shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they are

 



44

    

 made, not misleading, the Party that discovers such information shall
promptly notify the other Parties hereto, and an appropriate amendment or
supplement describing such information shall be filed with the SEC and, to
the extent required by applicable Law, disseminated to the Stockholders.

 

(c) Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall use their reasonable
best efforts to cause the Information Statement to be (i) filed with the SEC
in definitive form as contemplated by Rule 14c-2 under the Exchange Act and
(ii) mailed to the Stockholders, in each case as promptly as practicable, and
in any event within two (2) Business Days, after the latest of (A)
confirmation from the SEC that it has no further comments on the Information
Statement, (B) confirmation from the SEC that the Information Statement is
otherwise not to be reviewed or (C) expiration of the ten (10)-day period
after filing in the event the SEC does not review the Information Statement.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company agrees that
unless the Company Board has made an Adverse Recommendation Change and the
Company has terminated this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.3(b)_ and
has paid (or caused to be paid) to Parent the Company Termination Payment in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 7.5(b)_, its obligations pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 5.5(c)_ shall not be affected by the commencement, public
proposal, public disclosure or communication to the Company or any other
Person of any Acquisition Proposal.

5.6 _Cooperation; Efforts_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement and except to the extent a
different standard of efforts is expressly set forth in any of the provisions
of this Agreement, each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company will use their
respective reasonable best efforts to promptly take, or cause to be taken, all
action and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or
advisable under this Agreement and applicable Laws to consummate and make
effective the Merger and the other Transactions as promptly as reasonably
practicable (and in any event no later than the Outside Date), including (i)
preparing as reasonably promptly as practicable all necessary applications,
notices, petitions, filings, ruling requests, and other documents and
obtaining as reasonably promptly as practicable all consents and approvals
necessary or advisable to be obtained from any Governmental Authority in
order to consummate the Merger and the other Transactions (collectively, the
"Governmental Approvals") and (ii) as reasonably promptly as practicable
taking all steps as may be necessary to obtain all such Governmental
Approvals.

(b) The Company and its Affiliates will give prompt written notice to
Parent, and Parent and its Affiliates will give prompt written notice to the
Company, of (i) the occurrence, or failure to occur, of any event which
occurrence or failure to occur has resulted in or would reasonably be
expected to result in the failure to satisfy or be able to satisfy any of the
conditions specified in _Article VI_ , and such written notice shall specify
the condition which has failed or will fail to be satisfied; (ii) any written
notice from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be
required in connection with the Transactions to the extent such consent is
material to the Company and its Subsidiaries,

 



45

    

 taken as a whole; and (iii) any material written notice from any
Governmental Authority in connection with the Transactions; _provided_ that
the delivery of any notice pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 5.6(b)_ shall
not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to Parent and
its Affiliates or the Company and its Affiliates; _provided_ , _further_ that
the failure to deliver any such notice shall not affect the determination of
the satisfaction of any of the conditions specified in _Article VI_.

 

(c) Each of the Company and Parent and their respective Affiliates shall
use their respective reasonable best efforts to give any notices to third
parties other than Governmental Authorities, and use their respective
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any consents from third parties
other than Governmental Authorities required in connection with the Merger,
to the extent that such consents are (i) necessary to consummate the
Transactions or (ii) required to prevent the occurrence of a Company Material
Adverse Effect, whether prior to or after the Effective Time; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that except as provided in the last sentence of _Section_ __ _
5.16_, Parent and its Affiliates shall not be required to make any payments or
concessions in connection with the fulfillment of its obligations under this
_Section_ __ _ 5.6(c)_.

5.7 _Information; Access and Reports_. Subject to applicable Law, the
Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, afford to Parent
and its Representatives reasonable access, upon reasonable advance notice,
during ordinary business hours, during the period prior to the Effective Time,
to all of their respective properties, books, records, Contracts, commitments
and personnel (including, without limitation, independent contractors) and,
during such period, the Company shall, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to, furnish reasonably promptly to Parent (a) to the extent not
publicly available, a copy of each report, schedule, registration statement
and other document filed by it during such period pursuant to the requirements
of federal or state securities Laws or commission actions and (b) all other
information concerning its business, properties and personnel as Parent may
reasonably request (in each case, in a manner so as to not interfere in any
material respect with the normal business operations of the Company or its
Subsidiaries); _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not be required
to permit such access or make such disclosure, to the extent it determines
that such disclosure or access would reasonably be likely to (i) violate the
terms of any confidentiality agreement or other Contract with a third party
entered into prior to the date of this Agreement ( _provided_ that the Company
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the required consent
of such third party to such access or disclosure); (ii) result in the loss of
any attorney-client privilege ( _provided_ , that the Company shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to allow for such access or disclosure in a

obtaining Knowledge of the Company

Notice, in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit D_ and satisfactory to

the charter of the Company), provided that, in the case of any taxable year
that includes but does not end on the Closing Date, any action by the Company

Effective Time shall not be considered to result in a breach of this
covenant or any representation or covenant of the Company in this Agreement
with respect to such tax year, and (ii) will not become liable, for any such
taxable year, for U.S. federal income or excise Tax, including under Section
857(b) or 4981 of the Code. After the date of this Agreement and prior to the

50

    

(b) Parent and the Company shall, upon written request, use their

(c) The Company shall prepare or cause to be prepared and timely file or
cause to be timely filed (taking into account any applicable extensions of

including timely filing of Tax Returns (including for the Company on IRS Form
1120-REIT) for the taxable year ended December 31, 2018 (taking into account
any applicable extensions of time). Subject to the preceding sentence insofar
as it relates to Tax Returns for the 2018 tax year, Parent shall cause to be
timely filed all Tax Returns for the Company and each Subsidiary of the
Company that are required to be filed for the taxable period that includes
the Closing Date and any other Tax Returns for the Company and its
Subsidiaries for which the due date for the filing of such returns (determined
taking into account any applicable extensions of time) has not occurred prior
to the Closing Date. Any such Company Returns shall be prepared in a manner
consistent with the historic Tax accounting practices of the Company (except
as may be required under applicable Tax Law). The Company shall pay all Taxes
shown as due on the Company Returns. The Company shall provide to Parent
copies of the Company Returns at least fifteen (15) calendar days prior to the
due date of such Tax Returns (including applicable extensions) and the
Company shall consider in good faith any and all reasonable comments of Parent
with respect to such Tax Returns; provided that the incorporation of comments
of Parent with respect to such Company Returns shall not be considered to

its Subsidiaries shall cooperate with Parent and Merger Sub to allow for the
determination, assessment, planning, and implementation of a go-forward
insurance plan by Parent for the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries as

modification, cancellation, extension, renewal, or replacement of insurance
effective at the Effective Time or thereafter; provided, for clarity, no
changes shall become effective prior to the Effective Time.

5.19 _Series A Preferred Stock Offering_. (a) As promptly as practicable
after the date hereof (but in no event more than three (3) Business Days
after the date hereof), the Company Board shall authorize the classification
and designation of the Series A Preferred Stock and an offering of up to
$20,000,000 of shares of Series A Preferred Stock that is exempt from the
registration requirements of Section 5 of the Securities Act pursuant to Rule
506(c) of Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act (the "Preferred
Stock Offering"); and (b) as promptly as

 



51

    

 practicable following the filing with the SEC of the Information Statement
in definitive form, the Company shall commence the Preferred Stock Offering,
which shall be limited solely to the Stockholders as of the date of this
Agreement that are "accredited investors" (as defined in Rule 501 of
Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act). The Preferred Stock
Offering shall be made by means of a subscription or purchase agreement or
other offering documents (collectively, the "Preferred Stock Offering
Documents") approved by the Company Board and Parent that are disseminated or
made available to the investors in the Series A Preferred Stock as required
by the applicable provisions of Rule 506 of Regulation D promulgated under the
Securities Act. None of the information supplied or to be supplied by or on
behalf of the Company for inclusion in the Preferred Stock Offering Documents
will, at the time it (or any amendment or supplement thereto) is first sent
or given to investors in the Series A Preferred Stock contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. None of the
information supplied or to be supplied by or on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub
for inclusion in the Preferred Stock Offering Documents will, at the time it
(or any amendment or supplement thereto) is first sent or given to investors
in the Series A Preferred Stock contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they are made, not misleading. The Parties and their respective
Representatives shall reasonably cooperate in preparing and disseminating the
Preferred Stock Offering Documents and in effecting the Preferred Stock
Offering; provided, however, that Parent shall be solely responsible for the
payment of any fees, costs or expenses incurred or required to be paid in
connection with, arising out of or relating to the Preferred Stock Offering
and the preparation of the Preferred Stock Offering Documents. The closing of
the Preferred Stock Offering will take place immediately following the
Effective Time of the Merger. For the avoidance of doubt, (i) compliance by
the Parties with their respective obligations under this Section 5.19 or the
consummation of the Preferred Stock Offering is not a condition to the Closing
under this Agreement, and (ii) the beneficial and/or record owners of the
Preferred Stock shall be responsible for any and all costs relating to their
ownership of such stock, including any withholding Tax due on dividends or
proceeds from the disposition of such stock.

 

5.20 _Termination of Employees and Officers_. Unless otherwise agreed
among Parent and any of the employees set forth herein, prior to the Closing,
the Company shall have (i) terminated or caused the termination of employment
of each individual listed on Section 5.20 of the Company Disclosure Schedule

obligations of the Company arising out of or resulting from such terminations;
and (ii) delivered to Parent copies of the Termination and Release Agreement,
in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit E-1_, _Exhibit E-2_ or _Exhibit E-3_,
as applicable (the "Termination and Release Agreement"), duly executed by
each of the individuals listed on Section 5.20 of the Company Disclosure
Schedule.

 

5.21 _Company Name_. At or prior to the Closing, the Company will cause
Chad M. Carpenter to execute and deliver to Parent a non-exclusive, royalty-
free license for a ten (10)-year term, in the form acceptable to Chad M.

or inaccuracy is not curable or, if curable, is not cured within the earlier

is then in breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement in
this Agreement or any representation and warranty of the Company in this
Agreement fails to be true and correct, in each case, such that it would give
rise to the failure of a condition in _Section_ __ _ 6.2(a)_ or _Section_ __
_ 6.2(b)_;

 



56

    

(b) prior to the Written Consent Effective Time, but not after, in order
to accept a Superior Proposal in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 5.4(d)_, if

of such Superior Proposal, but only if the Company is not then in material
breach of _Section_ __ _ 5.4_, _provided_ that prior to or concurrently with
such termination, the Company pays Parent the Company Termination Payment
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.5(b)_; or

(c) (i) the conditions set forth in _Section_ __ _ 6.1_ and _Section_ __
_ 6.2_ (other than any condition that by its nature is to be satisfied at the

consummate the Closing, and (iii) Parent and Merger Sub fail to consummate the
Closing within the earlier of one (1) Business Day before the Outside Date and

7.4 _Termination by Parent_. This Agreement may be terminated and the
Merger may be abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time by Parent
upon written notice to the Company if:

(a) there has been a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement made by the Company in this Agreement, or any such representation
and warranty shall have become inaccurate after the date of this Agreement, in
each case, such that a condition set forth in _Section_ __ _ 6.2(a)_ or
_Section_ __ _ 6.2(b)_ would not be satisfied and such breach or inaccuracy
is not curable or, if curable, is not cured within the earlier of (x) thirty
(30) days after written notice thereof is given by Parent to the Company and
(y) the Outside Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent shall not have the
right to terminate this Agreement and abandon the Merger and the other
Transactions under this  _Section_ __ _ 7.4(a)_ if Parent or Merger Sub is
then in breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement in this
Agreement or any representation and warranty of Parent in this Agreement fails
to be true and correct, in each case, such that it would give rise to the
failure of a condition in _Section_ __ _ 6.3(a)_ or _Section_ __ _ 6.3(b)_;

 

(b) the Stockholders Written Consent evidencing the Company Stockholder
Approval shall not have been delivered to the corporate secretary of the
Company, and a facsimile copy of such Stockholders Written Consent shall not
have been provided to Parent, in each case, prior to 5:00 p.m. (New York City

Agreement; or

 



57

    

(c) prior to the time, but not after, the Company Stockholder Approval is
obtained, if any Adverse Recommendation Change shall have been made by the
Company Board.

 

7.5 _Effect of Termination and Abandonment_.

 

(a) This Agreement may be terminated only pursuant to _Section_ __ _
7.1_,  _Section_ __ _ 7.2_, _Section_ __ _ 7.3_ or _Section_ __ _ 7.4_.
Termination of this Agreement by the Company shall not require the approval of
the Stockholders. In order to terminate this Agreement, the Party desiring to
terminate this Agreement shall give written notice of such termination to the
other Parties in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 8.6_. Except as provided in
this _Section_ __ _ 7.5_, in the event of termination of this Agreement and
the abandonment of the Merger pursuant to and in accordance with this _Article
VII_, this Agreement shall become void and of no effect with no liability or
obligation to any Person on the part of any Party hereto or any of their
respective Representatives or Affiliates, _provided_ that (i) the provisions
set forth in the last sentence of _Section_ __ _ 5.7_ ( _Access; Information_
),  _Section_ __ _ 5.9_ ( _Publicity_ ), _Section_ __ _ 5.11_ ( _Expenses_
), this _Section_ __ _ 7.5_ and _Article VIII_ will survive the termination
of this Agreement, and (ii) subject to _Section_ __ _ 7.5(d)_ and _Section_
__ _ 7.5(e)_, a termination of this Agreement shall not relieve any Party to
this Agreement from any liability or damages for any willful breach or
fraud by such Party that occurs prior to such termination. For purposes of
this Agreement, "willful breach" means, with respect to any representation,
warranty, agreement or covenant set forth in this Agreement, a breach that is
a consequence of a conscious act or omission undertaken by the breaching
Party with the intention or knowledge that the taking of, or failure to take,
such act would, or would reasonably be expected to, cause or constitute a
material breach of this Agreement.

(b) In the event that (i) (A) this Agreement is terminated (1) by either
the Company or Parent pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.2(a)_ or (2) by Parent
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.4(a)_ (other than in respect of the Companys
failure to comply in all material respects with its obligations under
_Section_ __ _ 5.4_) or _Section_ __ _ 7.4(b)_ and, in either case, prior to
the date of such termination, the Company has received an Acquisition Proposal
that has been publicly disclosed or any Person shall have publicly proposed
or publicly announced an intention (whether or not conditional) to make an
Acquisition Proposal, in each case, that has not been withdrawn and (B) within
twelve (12) months of the date of the termination referred to in clause (A)
above, the Company enters into a definitive agreement with respect to, or
consummates, such Acquisition Proposal ( _provided_ , that for purposes of
this _Section_ __ _ 7.5(b)(i)_, the references to "20%" in the definition of
"Acquisition Proposal" will be deemed to be references to "50%"), (ii) this
Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.4(a)_ in
respect of the Companys failure to comply in all material respects with its
obligations under _Section_ __ _ 5.4_, or _Section_ __ _ 7.4(c)_ or (iii)
this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to  _Section_ __ _
7.3(b)_, then, in each case, the Company will pay Parent an aggregate amount
equal to $2,000,000 (the "Company Termination Payment"), by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by Parent,
which amount shall be payable (1) in the case of a payment required by clause
(i) above, within two (2) Business Days after the earlier of entry into a
definitive agreement in respect of the Acquisition Proposal or the
consummation of such Acquisition Proposal, (2) in the

 



58

    

 case of a payment required by clause (ii) above, within two (2) Business
Days after termination of this Agreement, or (3) in the case of a payment
required by clause (iii) above, concurrently with or prior to termination of
this Agreement. The Parties acknowledge and agree that in no event will the
Company be required to pay the Company Termination Payment on more than one
occasion.

 

(c) The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this
_Section_ __ _ 7.5_ are an integral part of the Merger and the other
Transactions, and that, without these agreements, Parent would not have
entered into this Agreement; accordingly, in the event the Company Termination
Payment is required to be paid by the Company pursuant to _Section_ __ _
7.5(b)_ and the Company fails to timely pay to Parent the Company Termination
Payment and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent commences a suit that
results in a judgment against the Company for the Company Termination
Payment, the Company will pay to Parent its costs and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees and disbursements of counsel or other professionals
and experts and court costs) in connection with such suit, together with
interest thereon at the prime rate as published in _The Wall Street Journal_
(or if not reported therein, as reported in another authoritative source
reasonably selected by the other party) in effect on the date the Company
Termination Payment was required to be paid from such date through the date
of full payment thereof.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if the
Company Termination Payment is required to be paid by the Company pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 7.5(b)_, Parents right to receive the Company Termination
Payment and any additional amounts pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.5(c)_ will be
the sole and exclusive remedies of Parent, its respective Subsidiaries, any
of Parents or its Subsidiaries respective former, current or future general
or limited partners, stockholders, directors, officers, managers, members,
Affiliates, agents and other Representatives and any other Person against the
Company, the Companys Subsidiaries, any of the Companys or its Subsidiaries
respective former, current or future general or limited partners,
stockholders, directors, officers, managers, members, Affiliates, agents or
other Representatives for any loss suffered as a result of any breach of any
covenant or agreement in this Agreement or the failure of the Merger and the
other Transactions to be consummated.

 

(e) Each of the Parties acknowledges and agrees that: (i) the Company
Termination Payment is not intended to be a penalty, but rather is liquidated
damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent in the
circumstances in which the Company Termination Payment is due and payable, for
the efforts and resources expended and opportunities forgone while
negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the
expectation of the consummation of the Merger and the other Transactions,
which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision, (ii)
the Company Termination Payment and any additional amounts pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 7.5(c)_, when paid in full accordance with this Agreement,
will be in full and complete satisfaction of any and all monetary damages of
Parent and each of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective former,
current or future general or limited partners, stockholders, directors,
officers, managers, members, Affiliates, agents or other Representatives
arising out of or related to this Agreement, the Merger or the other
Transactions (including any breach of this

 



59

    

 Agreement by the Company), the termination of this Agreement, the failure to
consummate the Merger or the other Transactions, and any claims or actions
under applicable Laws arising out of any such breach, termination or failure,
(iii) in the event this Agreement is terminated under circumstances where the
Company Termination Payment is payable, in no event will Parent be entitled to
seek or obtain any recovery or judgment in excess of the Company Termination
Payment and any additional amounts pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.5(c)_ against
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or any of their respective former,
current or future general or limited partners, stockholders, directors,
officers, employees, managers, members, Affiliates, agents or other
Representatives or any of their respective assets, and in no event will Parent
be entitled to seek or obtain any other damages of any kind,
including consequential, special, indirect or punitive damages for, or with
respect to, this Agreement or the Merger or the other Transactions (including
any breach by the Company), the termination of this Agreement, the failure to
consummate the Merger or the other Transactions or any claims or actions
under applicable Laws arising out of any such breach, termination or failure),
and (iv) the Parties will take such actions as are necessary and sufficient so
that the agreements contained in this  _Section_ __ _ 7.5_ may be
enforceable against such Party, including executing and delivering any
waivers, releases and similar instruments consistent therewith upon any other
Partys request; _provided_ , _however_ , that this _Section_ __ _ 7.5_ will
not limit Parents right to specific performance pursuant to _Section_ __ _
8.5(d)_ (subject to the limitations set forth therein); _provided_ , _further_
,  _however_ , that under no circumstances shall Parent be permitted or
entitled to receive both a grant of specific performance requiring
consummation of the Merger and the other Transactions and the Company
Termination Payment pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 7.5_.

ARTICLE VIII.

 

 _MISCELLANEOUS AND GENERAL_

 

8.1 _Non-Survival_. The representations and warranties in this
Agreement and in any certificate delivered pursuant hereto will terminate at
the Effective Time. This _Section_ __ _ 8.1_ will not limit any covenant or
agreement of the parties that by its terms contemplates performance in whole
or in part after the Effective Time.

8.2 _Modification or Amendment_. Subject to applicable Laws and 
_Section_ __ _ 8.3_, at any time prior to the Effective Time, this Agreement
may be amended (except to the extent that any such amendment would violate the
MGCL or the MLLCA), modified or waived if, and only if, such
amendment, modification or waiver is in writing and signed, in the case of an
amendment or modification by Parent, Merger Sub, and the Company, or in the
case of a waiver, by the Party against whom the waiver is to be effective.

 

8.3 _Waiver of Conditions_. The conditions to each of the respective
Parties obligations to consummate the Merger and the other Transactions are
for the sole benefit of such Party and may be waived by such Party in whole or
in part to the extent permitted by applicable Laws. No failure or delay by any
Party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder will operate as a
waiver thereof nor will any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any
other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or
privilege. The rights and remedies herein provided will be cumulative and not
exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by Law (except to the extent
specifically provided otherwise in _Section_ __ _ 7.5(d)_ and _Section_ __ _
7.5(e)_).

 



60

    

8.4 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts, each such counterpart being deemed to be an original instrument,
and all such counterparts will together constitute the same agreement.
Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by
facsimile transmission or by email of a .pdf attachment will be effective as
delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement.

 

8.5 _GOVERNING LAW; VENUE; WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL; SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE_.

 

(a) THIS AGREEMENT AND ALL DISPUTES, CLAIMS OR CONTROVERSIES ARISING OUT OF
OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, OR THE NEGOTIATION, VALIDITY OR PERFORMANCE OF
THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY SHALL BE GOVERNED BY
AND INTERPRETED AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE INTERNAL LAW OF THE STATE
OF MARYLAND, WITHOUT REGARD TO ANY LAW THAT MIGHT OTHERWISE GOVERN UNDER
APPLICABLE PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAW.

(b) Each of the Parties irrevocably (i) consents to submit itself to the
personal jurisdiction of the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, Maryland, or,
if that court does not have jurisdiction, the U.S. District Court for the
District of Maryland, Baltimore Division (the "Maryland Courts") in
connection with any matter based upon or arising out of or relating to this
Agreement, the Merger or the other Transactions, or the actions of the Parties
in the negotiation, administration, performance, and enforcement of this
Agreement, (ii) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such
personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any court,
(iii) agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this Agreement or
the Merger or the other Transactions in any court other than the Maryland
Courts, (iv) agrees to request and/or consent to the assignment of any such
proceeding to the Maryland Courts Business and Technology Case Management
Program and (v) consents to service being made through the notice procedures
set forth in _Section_ __ _ 8.6_. Each of the Parties agrees that service of
any process, summons, notice, or document by U.S. registered mail to the
respective addresses set forth in _Section_ __ _ 8.6_ will be effective
service of process for any suit, action, or proceeding based upon, arising out
of or relating to this Agreement, the Merger and the other Transactions. Each
Party irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of motion, as a
defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any suit, action or proceeding based
upon, relating to or arising out of this Agreement, any claim that it is
not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the above-named courts for any
reason other than the failure to serve process in accordance with this
_Section_ __ _ 8.5_, that it or its property is exempt or immune from
jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process commenced in such
courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior to judgment,
attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment, or
otherwise), and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Laws, that the
suit, action, or proceeding in any such court is brought in an inconvenient
forum, that the venue of such

 



61

    

 suit, action, or proceeding is improper, or that this Agreement, or the
subject matter hereof or thereof, may not be enforced in or by such courts and
further irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable
Laws, the benefit of any defense that would hinder, fetter, or delay the levy,
execution, or collection of any amount to which the Party is entitled pursuant
to the final judgment of any court having jurisdiction. Each Party expressly
acknowledges that the foregoing waiver is intended to be irrevocable under the
Law of the State of Maryland and of the U.S.

 

(c) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY THAT MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES
AND, THEREFORE, EACH SUCH PARTY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY
RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY SUIT, ACTION,
PROCEEDING, OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED IN CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE)
DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY BASED UPON, ARISING OUT OF, OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT OR THE MERGER OR THE OTHER TRANSACTIONS OR THE ACTIONS OF THE
PARTIES IN NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE, AND ENFORCEMENT OF
THIS AGREEMENT, OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED THEREBY. EACH PARTY
CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (i) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT, OR ATTORNEY OF
ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY
WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER,
(ii) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (iii)
IT GIVES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (iv) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO
THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS
IN THIS _SECTION 8.5_.

(d) The Parties acknowledge and agree that irreparable harm would occur,
and the Parties would not have any adequate remedy at Law (i) for any actual
or threatened breach of the provisions of this Agreement or (ii) in the event
that any of the provisions of this Agreement (including failure to take such
actions as are required hereunder in order to consummate this Agreement) were
not performed in accordance with their specific terms. It is accordingly
agreed that each Party shall be entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions
to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement and to
specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement and any other
agreement or instrument executed in connection herewith; and the Parties
further agree to waive any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond
or proving actual damages in connection with such remedy. Each Party hereby
consents to the right of the other Parties to seek the issuance of
such injunction or injunctions, and to the grant of such injunction or
injunctions. The Parties further agree not to assert that a remedy of
injunction or specific performance is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to Law
or inequitable for any reason, nor to assert that a remedy of monetary
damages would provide for an adequate remedy. Without limiting the foregoing,
the Company shall be entitled to injunctive relief and specific performance to
enforce the obligation of Parent to consummate the Merger and the other
Transactions and to enforce the obligations of Parent and the Sponsor under
the Equity Commitment Letter.

8.7 _Entire Agreement; Assignment; Binding Effect_. This Agreement
(including any exhibits, annexes and schedules hereto), the Company
Disclosure Schedule, the Support Agreement, the Equity Commitment Letter and
the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement among the
Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all other
prior agreements, understandings, representations, and warranties, both
written and oral, among the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof.
Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests, or obligations
hereunder will be assigned, in whole or in part, by operation of Law or
otherwise, by any of the Parties without the prior written consent of the
other Parties. Any purported assignment in contravention of this Agreement is
void. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon,
inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by the Parties and their
respective permitted successors and permitted assigns.

 

8.8 _Parties in Interest_. This Agreement will be binding upon, and inure
solely to the benefit of, the Parties and nothing in this Agreement, express
or implied, is intended to or will confer upon any other Person any rights,
benefits, or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this
Agreement, other than (a) after the Effective Time, with respect to the
provisions of _Section_ __ _ 5.12_ ( _Indemnification; Directors_ __ _and
Officers_ __ _Insurance_ ), which will inure to the benefit of the Persons or
entities benefiting therefrom who are intended to be third-party
beneficiaries thereof, (b) after the Effective Time, the rights of the holders
of Stock Certificates and Book-Entry Shares to receive the Merger
Consideration in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement
and (c) after the Effective Time, the rights of the holders of Company Equity
Awards to receive the payments contemplated by the applicable provisions of
_Section_ __ _ 2.4_ ( _Treatment and Payment of Company Equity Awards_ ).
The representations and warranties in this Agreement are the product of
negotiations among the Parties and are for the sole benefit of the Parties.
Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are subject to waiver
by the Parties in accordance with the terms of this Agreement without notice
or liability to any other person. In some instances, the representations and
warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation among the Parties
of risks associated with particular matters regardless of the knowledge of
any of the Parties. Consequently, persons other than the Parties may not rely
upon the representations and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations
of actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of
any other date.

 



64

    

8.9 _No Recourse_. All Actions (whether in contract or in tort, in law or
in equity, or granted by statute) that may be based upon, in respect of, arise
under, out or by reason of, be connected with, or relate in any manner to this
Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or performance of this
Agreement (including any representation or warranty made in, in connection
with, or as an inducement to, this Agreement) may be made only against (and
are those solely of) the entities that are expressly identified as Parties to
this Agreement in the Preamble to this Agreement. No other Person, including
any director, officer, employee, incorporator, member, partner, manager,
stockholder, affiliate, agent, attorney or representative of, or any financial
advisor or lender to, any Party to this Agreement or any director, officer,
employee, incorporator, member, partner, manager, stockholder, affiliate,
agent, attorney or representative of, or any financial advisor or lender to
any of the foregoing (each such other Person, a "Non-Recourse Party") shall
have any liabilities (whether in contract or in tort, in law or in equity, or
granted by statute) for any claims, causes of action, obligations or
liabilities arising under, out of, in connection with or related in any
manner to this Agreement or based on, in respect of or by reason of this
Agreement or its negotiation, execution, performance or breach.

 

8.10 _Obligations of Parent and of the Company_. Whenever this Agreement
requires Merger Sub to take an action, such requirement will be deemed to
include an undertaking on the part of Parent to cause Merger Sub to take such
action. Whenever this Agreement requires a Subsidiary of the Company to take
any action, such requirement will be deemed to include an undertaking on the
part of the Company to cause such Subsidiary to take such action and, after
the Effective Time, on the part of the Surviving Corporation to cause such
Subsidiary to take such action.

 

8.11 _Transfer Taxes_. All federal, state, local or foreign or other
excise, sales, use, value added, transfer (including real property transfer
or gains), stamp, documentary, filing, recordation and other similar taxes and
fees that may be imposed or assessed at or following the Closing as a result
of the Merger or the other Transactions, together with any interest,
additions or penalties with respect thereto and any interest in respect of
such additions or penalties, will be paid by Parent, without reduction
(including by reason of _Section_ __ _ 2.7_) of any amounts payable
or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder or former
holder of Shares.

 

8.12 _Severability_. The provisions of this Agreement will be deemed
severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision will not
affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions of this
Agreement. If any provision of this Agreement, or the application of such
provision to any Person or circumstance, is invalid or unenforceable, (a) a
suitable and equitable provision will be substituted therefor in order to
carry out, so far as may be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of
such invalid or unenforceable provision and (b) the remainder of this
Agreement, and the application of such provision to other Persons or
circumstances, will not be affected by such invalidity or unenforceability,
nor will such invalidity or unenforceability affect the validity or
enforceability of such provision, or the application of such provision, in
any other jurisdiction.

STOCK

Pacific Oak Residential Trust, Inc., a Maryland corporation (the
"Corporation"), hereby certifies to the State Department of Assessments and
Taxation of Maryland (the "Department") that:

 

FIRST: Pursuant to the authority expressly vested in the Board of Directors
of the Corporation (the "Board of Directors") by Article VI of the Articles
of Incorporation filed of record with the Maryland State Department of
Assessments and Taxation (the "SDAT") on April 1, 2014, and the Articles of
Conversion filed of record with the SDAT on April 1, 2014, as amended by the
Articles of Amendment filed of record with the SDAT on November 5, 2014 and
the Articles of Amendment filed of record with the SDAT on November 5, 2014
(as so amended and as may be amended or restated or supplemented from time to

(the "MGCL"), the Board of Directors has, by resolution adopted at a duly
called and held meeting of the Board of Directors, classified and designated
15,000 shares of authorized but unissued preferred stock, $0.001 par value per
share, of the Corporation as shares of 6.0% Series A Convertible Redeemable
Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share, and has provided for the
issuance of such series.

SECOND: The terms of the 6.0% Series A Cumulative Convertible Redeemable
Preferred Stock as set by the Board of Directors, including the preferences,
conversion or other rights, voting powers, restrictions, limitations as to
dividends, qualifications, or terms or conditions of redemption, which, upon

Charter, with any necessary or appropriate renumbering or re-lettering of the
sections or subsections hereof, are as follows:

Section 1. _Number of Shares and Designation_. A series of Preferred
Stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Corporation (the "Preferred Stock")

other agreements, _plus_ all cash on hand on the date of determination of

immediately preceding, but not including, the Conversion Date, as reported on

January, April, July and October of each year following the Issue Date until
such time as the Series A Preferred Shares are converted or redeemed in
accordance herewith, commencing on [January] 15, 20[20]; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if any Dividend Payment Date falls on any day other than a
Business Day, the dividend payment due on such Dividend Payment Date shall be
paid on the Business Day immediately following such Dividend Payment Date and
no interest or other sum shall accumulate or be paid on the amount so payable
for the period after such Dividend Payment Date to such next Business Day.

"Dividend Periods" shall mean, until the Series A Preferred Shares are
redeemed, quarterly dividend periods commencing on the first calendar day of
the quarter and ending on the last calendar day of the quarter, starting in
the first month of the first calendar quarter following the Issue Date of the
Series A Preferred Shares.

"Indebtedness" shall mean (a) any indebtedness of the Corporation, whether or
not contingent, for borrowed money (whether by loan or the issuance and sale
of debt securities evidenced by notes, debentures or similar instruments and

bonds, letters of credit and bankers acceptances, whether or not matured),
(b) any obligations of the Corporation evidenced by notes, bonds, debentures

subsidiaries on such date _to_ (b) the net asset value of the Corporation and
its subsidiaries as reasonably determined by, and calculated through
procedures approved by, the Board of Directors.

"Junior Shares" shall mean the Common Shares and any other class or series of
shares of capital stock of the Corporation now or hereafter issued and
outstanding over which the Series A Preferred Shares have preference or
priority in the payment of dividends or in the distribution of assets on any
liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation and, unless the
context clearly indicates otherwise.

"Parity Shares" shall have the meaning set forth in Section 9(b) hereof.

"Senior Shares" shall have the meaning set forth in Section 9(a) hereof.

 

"Set Apart for Payment" shall be deemed to include, without any action other
than the following: the recording by the Corporation in its accounting
ledgers of any accounting or bookkeeping entry which indicates, pursuant to a
declaration of dividends or other distribution by the Board of Directors, the
allocation of funds to be so paid on any series or class of shares of
capital stock of the Corporation; _provided_ , _however_ , that if any funds
for any class or series of Junior Shares or any class or series of shares of
capital stock ranking on a parity with the Series A Preferred Shares as to the
payment of dividends are placed in a separate account of the Corporation or
delivered to a disbursing, paying or other similar agent, then "Set Apart for
Payment" with respect to the Series A Preferred Shares shall mean placing such
funds in a separate account or delivering such funds to a disbursing, paying
or other similar agent.

"Transfer Agent" means V Stock Transfer, or such other agent or agents of the
Corporation as may be designated by the Board of Directors or its designee as
the transfer agent, registrar and dividend disbursing agent for the Series A

Section 3. _Dividends_.

 

(a) Subject to the preferential rights of the holders of any Senior Shares,
the holders of any Series A Preferred Share shall be entitled to receive,
when, as, and if authorized by the Board of Directors and declared by the
Corporation, out of funds legally available for that purpose, dividends
payable in cash in an amount per Share equal to 6.0% of the
liquidation preference per annum (equivalent to $60.00 per Share per annum),
except as provided in Sections 3(b), 3(c) and 3(d) hereof. Such dividends
shall begin to accrue and shall be fully cumulative from the Issue Date of
such Series A Preferred Share, whether or not in any Dividend Period or
Periods there shall be funds of the Corporation legally available for the
payment of such dividends, and shall be payable quarterly, when, as and if
authorized by the Board of Directors and declared by the Corporation, in
arrears on Dividend Payment Dates, commencing on the first Dividend Payment
Date after the first Issue Date. Each such dividend shall be payable in
arrears to the holders of record of Series A Preferred Shares, as they appear
on the stock records of the Corporation on the last day of the

 



3

    

 calendar quarter, whether or not a Business Day, immediately preceding the
quarter in which the applicable Dividend Payment Date falls. Accrued and
unpaid dividends on the Series A Preferred Shares for any past Dividend
Periods may be declared and paid at any time and for such interim periods,
without reference to any regular Dividend Payment Date, to holders of record
on such date, not less than ten (10) nor more than fifty (50) days preceding
the payment date thereof, as may be fixed by the Board of Directors.
Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, dividends on the
Series A Preferred Shares shall accrue whether or not the Corporation
has Available Cash, whether or not there are funds legally available for the
payment of such dividends, and whether or not such dividends are authorized or
declared.

 

(b) If all of the Series A Preferred Shares selected for redemption
pursuant to Section 6 are not redeemed by the Corporation in accordance with
the terms of Section 6, then the annual dividend rate for the Series A
Preferred Shares will increase to 12.0% of the liquidation preference per
annum (equivalent to $120 per Share per annum) beginning on the calendar day
immediately following the redemption date (as determined in accordance with
Section 6(c)); _provided_ , _however_ , that such 12.0% dividend rate shall
not apply unless and until the aggregate number of Series A Preferred Shares
selected for redemption pursuant to Section 6 that are not redeemed by the
Corporation in accordance with the terms of Section 6 constitute 10.0% or more
of all outstanding Series A Preferred Shares.

 

(c) If, at any time following [●], 2020, dividends on any Series A
Preferred Shares shall be in arrears for more than two (2) Dividend Periods,
whether or not consecutive, the then-applicable annual dividend rate for the
Series A Preferred Shares will increase beginning on such date by 3.0% of the
liquidation preference per annum (equivalent to an additional $30 per share
per annum).

(d) The amount of dividends payable for each full Dividend Period for
the Series A Preferred Shares shall be computed by dividing the then-
applicable annual dividend rate by four. The amount of dividends payable for
the Series A Preferred Shares for any partial Dividend Period shall be
prorated and computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve
(12) thirty (30)-day months. Holders of Series A Preferred Shares shall not be
entitled to any dividends, whether payable in cash, property or stock, in
excess of cumulative dividends, as herein provided, on the Series A Preferred
Shares. Except as set forth in Section 3(c), no interest, or sum of money in
lieu of interest, shall be payable in respect of any dividend payment or
payments on the Series A Preferred Shares that may be in arrears.

(e) So long as any Series A Preferred Shares are outstanding, no full
dividends, except as described in the immediately following sentence, shall be
declared or paid or Set Apart for Payment on any class or series of Parity
Shares for any period unless full cumulative dividends have been or
contemporaneously are declared and paid or declared and a sum sufficient for
the payment thereof Set Apart for Payment on the Series A Preferred Shares for
all past Dividend Periods terminating on or prior to the dividend payment
date on such class or series of Parity Shares. When dividends are not paid in
full (or a sum sufficient for such full payment is not Set Apart for Payment),
as aforesaid, all dividends declared upon the Series A Preferred Shares and
all dividends declared upon any other class or series of Parity Shares shall
be declared ratably in proportion to the respective amounts of dividends
accumulated and unpaid on the Series A Preferred Shares and accumulated and
unpaid on such Parity Shares.

 



4

    

(f) So long as any Series A Preferred Shares are outstanding, no dividends
(other than dividends or distributions paid solely in shares of, or options,
warrants or rights to subscribe for or purchase shares of, Junior Shares)
shall be declared or paid or Set Apart for Payment or other distribution
declared or made upon Junior Shares, nor shall any Junior Shares be redeemed,
purchased or otherwise acquired (other than a redemption, purchase or other
acquisition of Common Shares made for purposes of an employee incentive or
benefit plan of the Corporation or any subsidiary) for any consideration (or
any moneys be paid to or made available for a sinking fund for the redemption
of any Junior Shares) by the Corporation, directly or indirectly (except by
conversion into or exchange for Junior Shares), unless in each case (i) the
full cumulative dividends on all outstanding Series A Preferred Shares and any
other Parity Shares of the Corporation shall have been paid or declared and
Set Apart for Payment for all past Dividend Periods with respect to the
Series A Preferred Shares and all past dividend periods with respect to such
Parity Shares and (ii) sufficient funds shall have been paid or declared and
Set Apart for Payment of the dividend for the current Dividend Period
with respect to the Series A Preferred Shares and the current dividend period
with respect to such Parity Shares. Any dividend payment on the Series A
Preferred Shares shall first be credited against the earliest accrued but
unpaid dividend due which remains payable.

(g) No distributions on Series A Preferred Shares shall be authorized by
the Board of Directors of the Corporation or paid or Set Apart for Payment by
the Corporation at such time as the terms and provisions of any material
agreement of the Corporation for Indebtedness, prohibits such declaration,
payment or Set Apart for Payment or provides that such declaration, payment
or Set Apart for Payment would constitute a breach thereof or a default
thereunder, or if such declaration or payment shall be restricted or
prohibited by law. In determining whether a distribution (other than
upon voluntary or involuntary liquidation), by dividend, redemption or other
acquisition of shares of capital stock of the Corporation or otherwise, is
permitted under the MGCL, amounts that would be needed, if the Corporation
were to be dissolved at the time of the distribution, to satisfy the
preferential rights upon dissolution of holders of shares of Series A
Preferred Shares shall not be added to the Corporations total liabilities.

 

(h) Anything in these terms of the Series A Preferred Shares to the
contrary notwithstanding, nothing in this Section 3 shall prevent the
creation, authorization or issuance of up to $200,000 in the aggregate (as
determined based upon the aggregate offering price), or purchase or
acquisition by the Corporation, of Series A Preferred Shares (or
Senior Shares or Parity Shares) in order to preserve the qualification of the
Corporation as a real estate investment trust for federal and/or state income
tax purposes or to comply with any applicable listing or continued listing
requirements of any national securities exchange or automated quotation
system.

Section 4. _Liquidation Preference_.

 

(a) In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the
Corporation, whether voluntary or involuntary, before any payment or
distribution of the assets of the Corporation (whether capital or surplus)
shall be made to or Set Apart for Payment for the holders of Junior Shares,
the holders of the Series A Preferred Shares shall be entitled to
receive $1,000.00 per Series A Preferred Share (as may be adjusted for stock
splits, recapitalizations, combinations, reclassifications and similar events
which affect the Series A Preferred Shares) plus an amount equal to all
dividends (whether or not declared), including any amount due under Section
5(b),

 



5

    

 accrued and unpaid thereon to the date of final distribution to such
holders; but such holders shall not be entitled to any further payment. After
payment to the holders of the Series A Preferred Shares of the full
preferential amount to which they are entitled, as described above, the
holders of the Series A Preferred Shares, as such, shall have no right or
claim to any of the remaining assets of the Corporation. If, upon any
liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, the assets of the
Corporation, or proceeds thereof, distributable among the holders of the
Series A Preferred Shares shall be insufficient to pay in full the
preferential amount aforesaid and liquidating payments on any other shares of
any class or series of Parity Shares, then such assets, or the proceeds
thereof, shall be distributed among the holders of Series A Preferred Shares
and any such other Parity Shares ratably in accordance with the respective
amounts that would be payable on such Series A Preferred Shares and any such
other Parity Shares if all amounts payable thereon were paid in full. For the
purposes of this Section 4, (i) a consolidation or merger of the
Corporation with one or more corporations, real estate investment trusts or
other entities, (ii) a sale, lease or transfer of all or substantially all of
the Corporations assets or (iii) a statutory share exchange shall not be
deemed to be a liquidation, dissolution or winding up, voluntary or
involuntary, of the Corporation.

(b) Subject to the rights of the holders of any Parity Shares, after
payment shall have been made in full to the holders of the Series A Preferred
Shares, as provided in this Section 4, any other series or class or classes of
Junior Shares shall, subject to the respective terms and provisions (if any)
applying thereto, be entitled to receive any and all assets remaining to be
paid or distributed, and the holders of the Series A Preferred Shares shall
not be entitled to share therein.

 

Section 5. _Redemption at the Option of the Corporation_.

 

(a) The Series A Preferred Shares shall not be redeemable prior to [●],
2022, except as set forth in Section 6\. At any time on or after [●], 2022,
the Corporation, at its option, may redeem, in whole or in part, the Series A
Preferred Shares, at any time and from time to time, at a redemption price of
(i) $1,120.00 per Series A Preferred Share (as may be adjusted for stock
splits, recapitalizations, combinations, reclassifications and similar events
which affect the Series A Preferred Shares), plus (ii) the amounts indicated
in Section 5(b). If less than all of the outstanding Series A Preferred
Shares are to be redeemed, the Series A Preferred Shares to be redeemed may be
selected by any equitable method determined by the Board of Directors provided
that such method does not result in the creation of fractional shares.

(b) Upon any redemption of Series A Preferred Shares pursuant to
this Section 5, the Corporation shall pay in full all accrued and unpaid
dividends in arrears for each Dividend Period ending on or prior to the Call
Date. If the Call Date falls after a dividend payment record date and prior to
the corresponding Dividend Payment Date, then each holder of Series A
Preferred Shares at the close of business on such dividend payment record date
shall be entitled to the dividend payable on such Shares on the corresponding
Dividend Payment Date notwithstanding the redemption of such Shares before
such Dividend Payment Date. Except as provided above, the Corporation shall
make no payment or allowance for unpaid dividends, whether or not in arrears,
on Series A Preferred Shares called for redemption.

 

(c) If full cumulative dividends on the Series A Preferred Shares and any
other class or series of Parity Shares of the Corporation shall not have been
or contemporaneously are (i)

 



6

    

 authorized, declared and paid or (ii) declared and a sum sufficient for the
payment thereof Set Apart for Payment for all past Dividend Periods that have
ended and the then current Dividend Period, the Series A Preferred Shares may
not be redeemed under this Section 5 and the Corporation may not purchase or
acquire Series A Preferred Shares, otherwise than pursuant to a purchase or
exchange offer made on the same terms to all holders of Series A Preferred
Shares or pursuant to Article VII of the Charter.

(d) Notice of the redemption of Series A Preferred Shares under this
Section 5 shall be mailed by first-class mail to each holder of record of
Series A Preferred Shares to be redeemed at the address of each such holder as
shown on the Corporations records, not less than thirty (30) nor more than
ninety (90) days prior to the Call Date. Neither the failure to mail any
notice required by this paragraph (e), nor any defect therein or in the
mailing thereof, to any particular holder, shall affect the sufficiency of
the notice or the validity of the proceedings for redemption with respect to
the other holders. Any notice which was mailed in the manner herein provided
shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given on the date
mailed whether or not the holder receives the notice. Each such mailed notice
shall state, as appropriate: (i) the Call Date; (ii) if less than all of the
Series A Preferred Shares are to be redeemed, the number of Series A Preferred
Shares to be redeemed; (iii) the redemption price set forth in Section 5(a)
or Section 5(b), as applicable, plus accrued and unpaid dividends through the
Call Date, including dividends required by Section 5(c) above; (iv) the place
or places at which certificates, if any, for such Series A Preferred Shares
are to be surrendered (or, in the case of shares of Series A Preferred Share
held in book-entry form, the Depositary the facilities of which such Series A
Preferred Shares shall be redeemed); and (v) that dividends on the Series A
Preferred Shares to be redeemed shall cease to accrue on such Call Date except
as otherwise provided herein. Notice having been mailed as aforesaid, from and
after the Call Date (unless the Corporation shall fail to make available an
amount of cash necessary to effect such redemption), (x) except as otherwise
provided herein, dividends on the Series A Preferred Shares so called for
redemption shall cease to accrue, (y) said Series A Preferred Shares shall no
longer be deemed to be outstanding, and (z) all rights of the holders thereof
as holders of Series A Preferred Shares of the Corporation shall cease (except
the right to receive cash payable upon such redemption, without interest
thereon, upon surrender and endorsement of their certificates if so required
or, in the case of Series A Preferred Shares held in book-entry form through a
Depositary, upon delivery of such shares in accordance with such notice and
the procedures of such Depositary, and to receive any dividends payable
thereon). The Corporations obligation to provide cash in accordance with the
preceding sentence shall be deemed fulfilled if, on or before the Call Date,
the Corporation shall deposit with a bank or trust company (which may be an
affiliate of the Corporation) that has an office in the Borough of Manhattan,
City of New York, and that has, or is an affiliate of a bank or trust company
that has, capital and surplus of at least $500,000,000, funds necessary for
such redemption, in trust, with irrevocable instructions that such cash be
applied to the redemption of the Series A Preferred Shares so called for
redemption. No interest shall accrue for the benefit of the holders of Series
A Preferred Shares to be redeemed on any cash so set aside by the Corporation.
Subject to applicable escheat laws, any such cash unclaimed at the end of two
(2) years from the Call Date shall revert to the general funds of the
Corporation, after which reversion the holders of such Shares so called for
redemption shall look only to the general funds of the Corporation for the
payment of such cash.

As promptly as practicable after the surrender or delivery in accordance with
said notice of any such Series A Preferred Shares so redeemed (properly
endorsed or assigned for transfer, if the Corporation shall so require and if
the notice shall so state, or, in the case of shares of Series A Preferred
Stock held in book-entry form through a Depositary, upon delivery of such
shares in accordance with such notice and the procedures of such Depositary),
such Shares shall be exchanged for any cash (without interest thereon) for
which such Shares have been redeemed.

 

(e) The deposit of funds with a bank or trust company for the purpose of
redeeming Series A Preferred Shares shall be irrevocable except that:

i. the Corporation shall be entitled to receive from such bank or
trust company the interest or other earnings, if any, earned on any money so
deposited in trust, and the holders of any shares redeemed shall have no claim
to such interest or other earnings; and

 

ii. any balance of monies so deposited by the Corporation and unclaimed by
the holders of the Series A Preferred Shares entitled thereto at the
expiration of two (2) years from the applicable redemption date shall be
repaid, together with any interest or other earnings thereon, to the
Corporation, and after any such repayment, the holders of the shares entitled
to the funds so repaid to the Corporation shall look only to the Corporation
for payment of the redemption price without interest or other earnings.

of dividends and as to the distribution of assets upon liquidation,

Preferred Shares; and _provided_ , _further_ , that if any such
amendment, alteration or repeal would also materially and adversely affect
any powers, rights or preferences of any Parity Shares, the affirmative vote
of a majority of the votes entitled to be cast by the holders of the Series A

amount of, any Series A Preferred Shares or Senior Shares of any class, or any
security convertible into any Series A Preferred Shares or Senior Shares of
any class;

 

 _provided_ , _however_ , that no such vote of the holders of Series A
Preferred Shares shall be required if, at or prior to the time when such
action exceeding the Loan to Value Ratio, amendment, alteration or repeal is
to take effect, such share exchange, consolidation or merger is to take
effect, or when the issuance of any such Series A Preferred Shares, Senior
Shares or convertible securities is to be made, as the case may be, provision

stock split in the form of a stock dividend or similar events which affect the
outstanding Series A Preferred Shares, into a greater number of shares or
other securities of the Corporation convertible into or exchangeable for
