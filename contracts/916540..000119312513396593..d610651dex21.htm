   6.9.1 | The Seller shall procure in accordance with the Debt Settlement
Plan that at Completion: 
---|--- 



     | (a) | all Intercompany Loans provided by a Group Company to a
member of the Sellers Group (excluding the Group Companies) as existing
immediately prior to the Completion Date (the "Intercompany Group Loans") are
assigned by the relevant Group Company to VION Ingredients International
(Holding) B.V.; and 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | VION Ingredients International (Holding) B.V. declares as
dividend and distributes to its shareholder VION International B.V. the
Intercompany Group Loans; or 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (c) | through any other steps agreed upon between the Seller and
the Purchaser, the Intercompany Group Loans are transferred, cancelled,
distributed, contributed or otherwise treated in such manner that they shall
no longer exist between a Group Company as a creditor and a member of the
Sellers Group (excluding the Group Companies) as a debtor. 
---|---|--- 



   6.9.2 | The Seller shall procure in accordance with the Debt Settlement
Plan that at Completion all Intercompany Loans provided by a member of the
Sellers Group (excluding the Group Companies)(each a "Seller Assignor") to a
Group Company as existing immediately prior to the Completion Date and for
which the Debt Settlement Plan provides that these will be assigned (the
"Intercompany Seller Loans") are assigned by the relevant Seller Assignor to
the Purchaser or any other member of the Purchasers Group (each a "Purchaser
Assignee") against payment of the Assignment Consideration, in accordance with
Clause 7.2 ( _Completion actions_ ). To the extent that Intercompany Loans
provided by a member of the Sellers Group (excluding the Group Companies) to
a Group Company existing immediately prior to the Completion Date are not
assigned to a Purchaser Assignee, such Intercompany Loans will be treated as
set out in the Debt Settlement Plan. 
---|--- 
 



24 outstanding under the Intercompany Loans is subject to change solely in the
Ordinary Course of Business (with the exception of Clause 6.7.2) between the
Effective Date and Completion. Therefore, at Signing as well as once a month
between Signing and Completion the Seller shall inform the Purchaser about the
outstanding amount under the Intercompany Loans, including such detail as the
Purchaser may reasonably require to verify the same. 
---|--- 



   6.9.4 | Notwithstanding Clause 6.9.3, the Seller has the right, after
written notification to the Purchaser no later than five (5) Business Days
before the date on which Completion is envisaged to take place, to
transfer an amount of EUR 60,000,000 to VION Financial Services B.V. in the 5
Business Day period prior to the Completion Date in order to satisfy certain
cash requirements of the Sellers Group and as a result thereof increase the
amount outstanding under the VFS Intercompany Loan. For the avoidance of
doubt, after such increase, at Completion the VFS Intercompany Loan shall be
treated as set out in Clause 6.9.1(b) or (c) (as the case may be) and Clause
6.9.6(a). 
---|--- 
 



   6.9.5 | The Seller shall deliver a notice (the "Assignment Notice") to
the Purchaser no later than five (5) Business Days before the date on which
Completion is envisaged to take place, setting forth the Intercompany Seller
Loans. The Assignment Notice shall be drawn up in good faith, on the basis of
the Sellers Groups internal reporting systems and the Accounting Principles
consistently applied and in close consultation with the Management Team. The
Assignment Notice shall be binding for the purposes of determining the
Intercompany Seller Loans and aggregate amount thereof to be assigned at
Completion. 
---|--- 
 



   6.9.6 | If, in the Interim Period, any payment is made under any
Intercompany Loan existing at the Effective Date or thereafter, and if the
aggregate balance of the amounts of such payments between the Group and
the Sellers Group (excluding the Group) is not zero, then such balance (the
"Incremental ICL Balance"): 
---|--- 



     | (a) | shall be a positive figure if the amount of such payments
made by the Group to the Sellers Group (excluding the Group) exceeds the
amount of such payments made by the Sellers Group (excluding the Group)
to the Group; or 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | shall be a negative figure if the amount of such payments
made by the Sellers Group (excluding the Group) to the Group exceeds the
amount of such payments made by the Group to the Sellers Group
(excluding the Group), provided that, to the extent, such negative figure
exceeds EUR 10,000,000 (10 million euro), any excess shall be disregarded for
purposes of calculating the Completion Payment Amount in accordance with
Clause 6.11 ( _Funds flow at Completion_ ). 
---|---|--- 
 



25 Seller shall at Completion pay to the Purchaser by way of reduction of the
Purchase Price an amount equal to the Incremental ICL Balance in the manner
set forth in Clause 6.11 ( _Funds flow at Completion_ ). If the Incremental
ICL Balance is a negative figure, the Purchaser shall at Completion pay to the
Seller an amount equal to the positive Incremental ICL Balance up to the
maximum amount of EUR 10,000,000 (ten million euro) in the manner set forth
in Clause 6.11 ( _Funds flow at Completion_ ). 
---|--- 



   6.9.8 | The Seller shall deliver a notice (the "ICL Notice") to the
Purchaser no later than five (5) Business Days before the date on which
Completion is envisaged to take place, setting forth the Incremental ICL
Balance, the payments on which the Incremental ICL Balance is based and
provide sufficient detail as to enable the Purchaser to assess the basis for
the Incremental ICL Balance. The ICL Notice shall be drawn up in good faith,
on the basis of the Groups internal reporting systems and the Accounting
Principles consistently applied. The ICL Notice shall be binding for the
purposes of determining the Incremental ICL Balance payable at Completion and
shall only be subject to challenge in accordance with _Schedule 8_ ( _
_Additional ICL Payment__ ). 
---|--- 



   6.9.9 | As the Intercompany Loans outstanding at the Effective Date
have been disregarded in deriving the Equity Value, and as any payment under
an Intercompany Loan in the Interim Period shall be taken into account in
the Incremental ICL Balance and settled between the Seller and the Purchaser
at Completion in accordance with Clause 6.9.7 the Parties acknowledge and
agree that such payments shall not affect the Equity Value and shall neither
constitute Leakage nor otherwise lead to any adjustment of the Purchase Price
except pursuant to Clause 6.9.7 or, following Completion, pursuant to
_Schedule 8_ ( _ _Additional ICL Payment__ ). 
---|--- 
 



   6.10 | Intra-Group Services between Signing and Completion

   6.10.1 | The Seller shall procure that all Intra-Group Services will

accordance with the Ordinary Course of Business and at prices consistent with
past practice, and (ii) be terminated at Completion except for the
transitional services to be provided under the Transitional Services
Agreement. 
---|--- 



   6.10.2 | As, subject to Completion occurring and the other terms of
this Agreement, the benefit and risk to Group passes as of the Effective Date,
the Parties acknowledge and agree that any payment by or on behalf of a
Group Company to the Sellers Group for the provision of Intra-Group Services
in accordance with Clause 6.10.1, shall not affect the Equity Value and shall
hence neither constitute Leakage nor otherwise lead to any adjustment of the
Purchase Price.  
---|--- 
 



26 ---|--- 

At Completion the sum (the "Completion Payment Amount") of the following
amount shall be payable by the Purchaser to the Seller in accordance with
Clause 7.2 ( _Completion actions_ ) and the Notary Letter, subject to
adjustment as expressly provided for in this Agreement:

 



     | (a) | the Total Consideration; _minus_ 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | the Incremental ICL Balance; _minus_ 
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | the SNP Purchase Price. 
---|---|--- 



   6.12 | Funding of Completion amounts 
---|--- 

The Purchaser shall not, without the Sellers prior written consent, such
consent to be withheld at Sellers sole discretion, take any action with
respect to the Debt Financing which, in any way, may make the timely
availability of an amount equal to the Completion Payment Amount
unavailable, including agreeing to a reduction in the amount of the financial
commitments thereunder below the level necessary to permit the Purchaser to
pay the Completion Payment Amount or any changes to, or the inclusion of any
additional conditions precedent or draw stops to, the utilisation of such
financing at Completion.



   6.13 | Delivery of the Leakage Notice 
---|--- 

The Seller shall deliver the Leakage Notice to the Purchaser no later than
five (5) Business Days before the date on which Completion is envisaged to
take place. The Leakage Notice shall set out the Leakage Amount and specify
for each item of Leakage the relevant amount (also if it is nil) and provide
sufficient detail as to enable the Purchaser to assess the amount and basis
for the amount. The Leakage Notice shall be binding for the purposes of
determining the Purchase Price payable at Completion in accordance with Clause
6.11 ( _Funds flow at Completion_ ) and shall only be subject to challenges
in accordance with Paragraph 2.1 ( _Additional Leakage_ ) of _Schedule 4_ (
_Leakage_ ).



   6.14 | Execution of the Notary Letter

shall have the following meaning:

 

Loss Transfer Amount has the meaning set out in Paragraph 1.7 in this
_Schedule 10_ ( _Terminated Profit Pooling Agreements_ );

 

Profit Pooling Termination Date means the date on which the Terminated Profit

   1 | Terminated Profit Pooling Agreements 
---|--- 



   1.1 | The Seller shall use its reasonable best efforts that the
Terminated Profit Pooling Agreements are terminated ( _beendet_ ) with civil
law effect ( _zivilrechtlicher Wirkung_ ) as at the end of December 31, 2013,
24:00 hrs CET (the "Profit Pooling Termination Date"). 
---|--- 



   1.2 | The agreements and the respective shareholder resolutions
regarding the termination of the Terminated Profit Pooling Agreements must be
approved by the Purchaser beforehand (such approval not to be
unreasonably withheld) and must in particular provide for the following: 
---|--- 



     | (a) | before and after the end of the Terminated Profit Pooling
Agreements, all rights and obligations of the respective parties resulting
from the time periods prior to termination of the Terminated Profit Pooling
Agreements shall be fulfilled by the respective party and shall remain
unaffected; 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | should any action or omission be or become required,
including, without limitation, during any subsequent Tax audit, by any party
to such Terminated Profit Pooling Agreements in order to ensure the validity,
proper execution and implementation of the fiscal unity between the parties
up to and including the termination, such party shall use its reasonable best
efforts that such action or omission is taken; 
---|---|--- 
 



99 Nothing in the Agreement shall take priority over what is established in the
respective termination agreement in accordance with the above. However, for
the avoidance of doubt, the preceding sentence shall not exclude any indemnity
claim of the Seller or the Profit Receiving Company against the Purchaser (or
vice versa) under this  _Schedule 10_ ( _Terminated Profit Pooling
Agreements_ ).



   1.3 | Should any amount of Tax become payable by a Profit Receiving
Company with respect to any period prior to and including the Profit Pooling
Termination Date and with respect to a Tax for which the fiscal unity shall
be in place between the Profit Receiving Company and a Profit Transferring
Company or a Profit Transferring Company and a German Operating Company, the
relevant Profit Receiving Company shall promptly pay such Taxes ensuring that
none of the Profit Transferring Companies or German Operating Companies is
held liable for any such Tax amounts under applicable Law. Should a Profit

Purchaser as adjustment of the Purchase Price such amount as is necessary to
indemnify and hold harmless the Profit Transferring Companies or German
Operating Companies, as the case may be, from any such secondary liability. 
---|---

performance of the obligations under Paragraph 1.3 by the Profit Receiving

assessment notices regarding periods and Taxes for which the fiscal unities
based on the Terminated Profit Pooling Agreements, shall be effective are
final and binding and can neither be challenged nor changed. Seller further

Pooling Agreements will be effective for civil law and Tax purposes upon the
Profit Pooling Termination Date. 
---|---

the Seller shall, until Completion, and the Purchaser shall, after Completion,
procure that the Profit Transferring Companies prepare pursuant to German
GAAP financial statements of the respective Profit Transferring Company for
the fiscal year until and including the Profit Pooling Termination Date (such
financial statements in accordance with German GAAP and established at the
expense of the Profit Transferring Companies the "HGB Financial Statements"
of a Profit Transferring Company). 
---|--- 
 



100 Financial Statements for each Profit Transferring Company to the other Party
for review and will reasonably consider any comments the other Party may have
before finalization of and redelivery of the final HGB Financial Statements
to the other Party. In case any comments or objections by the other Party are
not accepted in such final HGB Financial Statements, the assessment of any
such comments or objections shall be finally decided upon in accordance with
Paragraph 4.3 of _Schedule 4_ ( _Leakage_ ). 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | In connection with and during the preparation of the HGB
Financial Statements, the preparing Party shall (i) keep the other Party
informed about the status of the preparation of the HGB Financial
Statements, (ii) upon the other Partys reasonable request provide or make
available to the other Party all relevant books, accounts, records, electronic
data, correspondence and other documentation related to the HGB Financial
Statements and (iii) answer any reasonable questions of the other Party
related to the preparation of the HGB Financial Statement. 
---|---|--- 



   1.6 | The Purchaser or the Seller, as the case may be, shall procure
that each Profit Transferring Company shall actually pay in cash all profit
transfer liabilities by irrevocable wire transfers to the relevant
Profit Receiving Company under the Terminated Profit Pooling Agreements for
the fiscal year 2013 (the aggregate amount of all such cash payments actually
made being the "Profit Transfer Amount") and the Seller shall simultaneously
pay to the Purchaser by irrevocable wire transfer an amount equal to the
Profit Transfer Amount and all such payments to the Purchaser shall be treated
as adjustments to the Purchase Price, unless otherwise required by Law. 
---|--- 
 



   1.7 | If the HGB Financial Statements of a Profit Transferring Company
show a loss of the respective Profit Transferring Company, the Seller shall
procure that the respective Profit Receiving Company pays an amount equal to
such loss to such Profit Transferring Company in accordance with the
respective Terminated Profit Pooling Agreement as soon as practical after
Completion (the aggregate amount of such cash payments actually made, being
the "Loss Transfer Amount"). The Purchaser shall pay to Seller an amount
equal to the Loss Transfer Amount within ten (10) Business Days from receipt
of the Loss Transfer Amount and all such payments to the Purchaser shall be
treated as adjustments to the Purchase Price, unless otherwise required by
Law.

Completion duly perform any obligation arising from or in connection with the
consummation and/or termination of the Terminated Profit Pooling Agreement

respective Profit Transferring Company, harmless from any reasonable out of
pocket costs and expenses (other than a payment of profits or (partial)
repayment of loss compensation under the Terminated Profit Pooling Agreement)
incurred by any member of the Purchasers Group. The Purchaser shall further
procure that - unless required by Law or required to uphold the fiscal unity -
the Profit Transferring Companies and their respective subsidiaries shall not
amend the accounts or tax declarations for business years ending at or prior
to Completion. 
---|--- 



   1.9 | The Purchaser shall indemnify the Seller or, at the Sellers
discretion, the respective Profit Receiving Company, from any obligation
arising from or on connection with the consummation and/or termination of the

financial obligations arising from or out of the termination agreement
pursuant to Paragraph 1.2), in particular, without limitation, (i) any
liabilities to compensate losses of the respective Profit Transferring
Company pursuant to section 302 German Stock Corporation Act (AktG) under the
Terminated Profit Pooling Agreements (other than the payment of the Loss
Transfer Amount which shall exclusively be dealt with under Paragraph 1.7),
(ii) any liabilities to reimburse profits paid under the Terminated Profit
Pooling Agreements, and, (iii) any obligation to provide security to creditors
of the Profit Transferring Companies pursuant to sec. 303 Stock Corporation
Act (AktG). The Purchaser shall settle upon request of the Seller, by way of
actual payment, any and all claims of the respective Profit Transferring
Company on behalf of the respective Profit Receiving Company under the
respective Terminated Profit Pooling Agreement in due course or - if the
payment in connection with the consummation and/or termination of the
Terminated Profit Pooling Agreements shall be made directly by the Profit
Receiving Company or the Seller  the Purchaser shall actually pay the amount
to be indemnified pursuant to sentence one of this Paragraph 1.9 to the Seller
or, at the Sellers discretion, to the respective Profit Receiving Company, by
way of irrevocable wire transfers and the Seller or the respective Profit

transfers to the Profit Receiving Company and the Profit Receiving Company
shall on behalf of the Seller simultaneously pay to the Purchaser by

behalf of the Seller shall be treated as adjustments to the Purchase Price,
