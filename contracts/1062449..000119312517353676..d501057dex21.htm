ARTICLE I

The Merger 

_Section 1.01_ _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set

1 _Section 1.02_ _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") will
take place at 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on the second business day after
satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by Law) waiver of the conditions set
forth in _Article VII_ (other than those conditions that by their terms are
to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or (to the
extent permitted by Law) waiver of those conditions), at the offices of White
and Case LLP, located at 1221 Avenue of the Americas, New York, New York 10020,
unless another time, date or place is agreed to in writing by Parent and the
Company; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall Parent and Merger Sub
be obligated to consummate the Closing if the Marketing Period has not ended

case the Closing shall not occur until the earlier to occur of (i) a date
before or during the Marketing Period specified by Parent on three
business days prior written notice to the Company and (ii) the third
business day immediately following the final day of the Marketing Period,
subject to, in each case, the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted

conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject
to the satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by Law) waiver of those
conditions). The date on which the Closing occurs is referred to in this
Agreement as the " _Closing Date_."

required by, and executed and acknowledged in accordance with, the relevant
provisions of the MBCA, and shall make all other filings and recordings
required under the MBCA (if any). The Merger shall become effective on such
date and time as the Articles of Merger are filed with the Secretary of State
of the State of Minnesota or at such later date and time as Parent and the
Company shall agree and specify in the Articles of Merger. The date and time
at which the Merger becomes effective is referred to in this Agreement as
the " _Effective Time_."

_Section 1.04_ _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set
forth in the applicable provisions of the MBCA. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, from and after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall possess all properties, rights, privileges, powers and

liabilities, debts and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the
claims, obligations, liabilities, debts and duties of the Surviving
Corporation.

be amended in their entirety to read the same as the articles
of incorporation of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time (which shall not be amended by Merger Sub from the date hereof
until such time except as otherwise contemplated hereby), and as so amended
shall be the articles of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until
thereafter changed or amended (subject to _Section 6.06(b)_) as provided
therein or by applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that the articles of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation, as so amended at the Effective
Time, shall provide that the name of the Surviving Corporation shall be the
name of the Company and the date of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation
shall be the date of incorporation of the Company. 

(b) The Company shall take all necessary action so that, as of the Effective
Time, the bylaws of the Company shall be amended in their entirety to read
the same as the bylaws of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, and as so amended shall be the bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation until thereafter changed or amended (subject to  _Section
6.06(b)_) as provided therein or by applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation, as so amended at the Effective
Time, shall provide that the name of the Surviving Corporation shall be the
name of the Company.

 



2 _Section 1.06_ _Directors_. The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall, from and after the Effective Time, be the directors
of the Surviving Corporation, until the earlier of their resignation or
removal or until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified,
as the case may be.

 

 _Section 1.07_ _Officers_. The officers of the Company immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall, from and after the Effective Time, be the officers
of the Surviving Corporation, until the earlier of their resignation or

as the case may be.

 

 _Section 1.08_ _Taking of Necessary Action_. If at any time after the
Effective Time any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the
purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full
right, title and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges,

Corporation, the board of directors of the Surviving Corporation and the
officers of the Surviving Corporation shall take all such lawful and necessary

ARTICLE II

Effect of the Merger on Capital Stock

_Section 2.01_ _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of
Company Common Stock or any shares of capital stock of Parent or Merger Sub:

 

(a) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each share of capital stock of Merger Sub
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable
share of common stock, no par value per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

 

(b) _Cancellation of Certain Company Common Stock_. Each share of Company
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
that is directly or indirectly owned by Parent, any Subsidiary of Parent or
any Subsidiary of the Company, shall automatically be canceled and shall cease
to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

 

(c) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Each share of Company Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (excluding (i)
each Company Restricted Stock Award which shall be treated solely in
accordance with _Section 2.04_, (ii) shares to be canceled in accordance with
_Section 2.01(b)_ and (iii) the Dissenting Shares) shall be converted into
the right to receive $157.00 in cash, without interest (the " _Merger
Consideration_ "). At the Effective Time, all such shares of Company Common
Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and
shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate (or evidence of shares
in book-entry form) that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
any such shares of Company Common Stock (each, a " _Certificate_ ") shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the
Merger Consideration.

 



3 (d) _Dissenters  Rights_. At the Effective Time, the Dissenting Shares shall
no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease
to exist, and each holder of Dissenting Shares shall cease to have any rights
with respect thereto, subject to any rights the holder thereof may have under
this  _Section 2.01(d)_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time that are held by any holder who has (i) not voted
in favor of approval of the Merger and adoption of the Plan of Merger, (ii)
demanded and perfected such holders right to dissent from the Merger and to
be paid the fair value of such shares of Company Common Stock in accordance
with Sections 302A.471 and 302A.473 of the MBCA and (iii) as of the Effective
Time, has not effectively withdrawn or lost such dissenters rights (the "
_Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into or represent the right to
receive the Merger Consideration as provided in _Section 2.01(c)_, but the
holder thereof, if such holder complies in all respects with Sections 302A.471
and 302A.473 of the MBCA (the " _Dissenters  Rights_"), shall be entitled to
payment of the fair value (including interest determined in accordance with
Section 302A.473 of the MBCA) of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the
Dissenters Rights; _provided_ , _however_ , that if any such holder shall
fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to
dissent under the Dissenters Rights, then the right of such holder to be paid
the fair value of such holders Dissenting Shares shall cease and such
Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective
Time into, and to have become exchangeable solely for the right to receive,
the Merger Consideration, without interest thereon and subject to any
applicable withholding Taxes specified in  _Section 2.03(h)_. The Company
shall provide prompt notice to Parent of any demands, attempted withdrawals of
such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to applicable Law that
are received by the Company for Dissenters Rights with respect to any shares
of Company Common Stock, and Parent shall have the right to participate in all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of
Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle or compromise or offer to
settle or compromise, any such demand, or agree to do any of the foregoing.

 

 _Section 2.02_ _Adjustment to Merger Consideration_. Without limiting the
other provisions of this Agreement, if the outstanding shares of Company
Common Stock are changed into a different number or class of shares due to any
stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or
distribution of securities convertible into Company Common Stock),
reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of
shares or other like change with respect to Company Common Stock occurring on
or after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time, the Merger
Consideration as provided in _Section 2.01(c)_ shall be equitably adjusted
by Parent to reflect the effect thereof.

_Section 2.03_  _Exchange Fund_.

(a) _Paying Agent_. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit
with a paying agent selected by Parent (which shall be the Companys transfer
agent or another reputable bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the
Company, and with whom the Parent shall enter into a paying agent agreement in
form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Company) (the " _Paying
Agent_ ") cash in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger
Consideration as required to be paid pursuant to this Agreement (such cash
being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The Exchange Fund
shall not be used for any other purpose.

(b) _Certificate Exchange Procedures_. As promptly as reasonably practicable
after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each
holder of record of a Certificate (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the
Paying Agent and which shall otherwise be in customary form (including
customary provisions with respect to delivery of an "agents message" with
respect to shares held in book-entry form)), and (ii) instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger
Consideration. Each holder of record of a Certificate shall, upon
surrender to the Paying Agent of such Certificate, together with such letter
of

 



4  transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be
required by the Paying Agent, be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the
amount of cash which the number of shares of Company Common Stock previously
represented by such Certificate shall have been converted into the right to
receive pursuant to _Section 2.01(c)_, and the Certificate so surrendered
shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of
Company Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of the
Company, payment of the Merger Consideration may be made to a person other
than the person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered if
such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for
transfer and the person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or
other similar Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger
Consideration to a person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate or establish to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent that such
Tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by
this _Section 2.03(b)_, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after
the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender
the Merger Consideration which the holder thereof has the right to receive in
respect of such Certificate pursuant to this _Article II_. No interest shall
be paid or will accrue on any cash payable to holders of Certificates pursuant
to the provisions of this _Article II_.

 

(c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. All cash paid upon
the surrender of Certificates in accordance with the terms of this _Article
II_ shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such
Certificates. At the close of business on the day on which the Effective Time
occurs, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and there
shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of
the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, any Certificate is presented to the Surviving Corporation for transfer,
it shall be canceled against delivery of cash to the holder thereof as
provided in this _Article II_. 

(d) _Termination of the Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates on the date that is
twelve months after the date on which the Effective Time occurs shall be
delivered to the Surviving Corporation (or its designee), upon demand, and any
holders of the Certificates who have not theretofore complied with this
_Article II_ shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for, and
the Surviving Corporation shall remain liable for, payment of their claims for
the Merger Consideration pursuant to the provisions of this _Article II_.

(e) _No Liability_. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of
any cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official in compliance
with any applicable state, federal or other abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law. If any Certificate shall not have been surrendered prior to the
date on which the related Merger Consideration would escheat to or become the
property of any Governmental Authority, any such Merger Consideration shall,
to the extent permitted by applicable Law, immediately prior to such time
become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all
claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto.

(f)  _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest the cash in
the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that such
investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of
America or any agency or instrumentality thereof and backed by the full faith
and credit of the United States of America, in commercial paper obligations of
a domestic issuer rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service,
Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of
deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial
banks with capital exceeding $10.0 billion (based on the most recent financial
statements of such bank that are then publicly available). Any interest and
other income resulting from such investments shall be paid solely to the

instances of noncompliance that, individually or in the aggregate, would not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

(b) The Company has made available to Parent true and complete copies of (to
the extent applicable) (i) each material Company Benefit Plan (or, with
respect to any unwritten material Company Benefit Plan, a written description
thereof), other than any Company Benefit Plan that the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is prohibited from making available to Parent as the result of
applicable Law relating to the safeguarding of data privacy, and (ii) the most
recent summary plan description, if any, required under ERISA with respect to
each material Company Benefit Plan.

(c) Each Company Benefit Plan intended to be "qualified" (or registered)
within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code (or any comparable provision
under applicable non-U.S. Laws) has received a favorable determination or
opinion letter as to such qualification or registration from the Internal
Revenue Service (or any comparable Governmental Authority), and no event has
occurred, either by reason of any action or failure to act, that could
reasonably be expected to cause the loss of any such
qualification, registration or Tax-exempt status or the imposition of any
material penalty or Tax liability, except where such loss of qualification,
registration or Tax-exempt status or the imposition of any material penalty or
Tax liability, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

(d) Section 3.12(d) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth, as of the
date of this Agreement, each material Company Benefit Plan that provides
health or welfare benefits (whether or not insured) with respect to employees

coverage or benefits (A) required to be provided under Part 6 of Title I of
ERISA, or any other applicable Law, or (B) the full cost of which is borne
by the employee or former employee (or any of their beneficiaries)). Each
such U.S. plan is amendable, terminable or otherwise may be discontinued
unilaterally by the Company at any time without material liability or expense
to Parent, the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as a result
thereof other than ordinary administration expenses typically incurred in a
termination event and/or claims incurred prior to the date of such amendment,
and no such plan, plan documentation or agreement, summary plan description
or other written communication distributed generally to employees by its terms
prohibits the Company from amending or terminating any such Company Benefit
Plan. Each Company Benefit Plan is in compliance with the Patient Protection
and Affordable Care Act and its companion bill, the Health Care and Education
Reconciliation Act of 2010 (the " _2010 Health Care Law_ "), to the extent
applicable, except for such noncompliance that, individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.
The operation of each Company Benefit Plan will not result in the incurrence
of any penalty to the Company, Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries
pursuant to the 2010 Health Care Law, to the extent applicable that,
individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect.

 

(e) No Company Benefit Plan is or has at any time been covered by Title IV of
ERISA or subject to Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA and none
of the Company or its Subsidiaries has any liability, contingent or otherwise,
with respect to any employee benefit plan that is covered by Title IV of ERISA
or subject to Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA.

liability with respect to any "multiemployer plan" (within the meaning of
Sections 3(37) or 4001(a)(3) of ERISA or Section 414(f) of the Code). The term
" _ERISA Affiliate_ " means any trade or business, whether or not
incorporated, that together with the Company would be deemed a "single

(g) Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, (i) no proceeding has been
threatened, asserted, instituted or, to the Knowledge of the Company, is

routine claims for benefits and appeals of such claims), any trustee or
fiduciary thereof, or any of the assets of any trust of any of the Company
Benefit Plans, (ii) no non-exempt "prohibited transaction" (within the meaning
of Section 4975 of the Code and Section 406 of ERISA) has occurred or is
reasonably expected to occur with respect to the Company Benefit Plans, and
(iii) no Company Benefit Plan is under, and neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has received any notice of, an audit or investigation by the
Internal Revenue Service, Department of Labor or, to the Knowledge of the
Company, any other Governmental Authority, and no such completed audit, if
any, has resulted in the imposition of any Tax or penalty.

 

(h) There are no loans by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any of
their current or former employees, other than loans under any Company Benefit
Plan intended to qualify under Section 401(k) of the Code and routine travel
advances made in the Ordinary Course of Business.

 

(i) Each Company Benefit Plan that is subject to Section 409A of the Code has
operated in compliance with its terms and the operational and documentary
requirements of Section 409A of the Code and the regulations thereunder,
except as would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

 

(j) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement, shareholder or other
approval of this Agreement nor the consummation of the Merger (either alone
or together with any other event) will, in respect of any employee, officer,
director or independent contractor of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
(whether current, former or retired), except as would not be material to
the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (i) cause any payment or
benefit to become due or payable, including severance pay, (ii) increase the
amount or value of any benefit, compensation or other material obligation
otherwise payable or required to be provided, (iii) accelerate the time of
payment or vesting of any such benefit or compensation, (iv) accelerate the
time or otherwise trigger, either directly or indirectly, any funding (through
a grantor trust or otherwise) of any such compensation or benefits or cause
the Company to transfer or set aside any assets to fund any material benefits
under any Company Benefit Plan, (v) otherwise give rise to any material
liability under any Company Benefit Plan, (vi) limit or restrict the right to
merge, materially amend, terminate or transfer the assets of any Company
Benefit Plan on or following the Effective Time or (vii) result in the payment
of any amount that could, individually or in combination with any other such
payment, constitute an "excess parachute payment" as defined in Section
280G(b)(1) of the Code. As of the date of this Agreement, the Company has made
available to Parent a working draft copy of preliminary Section 280G
calculations that were recently prepared with respect to disqualified
individuals in connection with the Merger (it being understood such
calculations are not final and were provided "as-is" for
informational purposes only). Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
has any gross-up or indemnity obligation on or after the Effective Time for
any Taxes imposed under Section 4999 or 409A of the Code or otherwise.

 



20 (k) Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries has any liability in respect of post-retirement health,
medical, disability, life insurance or other welfare benefits for retired,
former or current employees or directors of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries except as required to comply with Section 4980B of the Code or
any similar Law. To the extent that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
sponsors any such plan, the Company or the applicable Subsidiary has reserved
the right to amend, terminate or modify at any time all plans or arrangements
providing for retiree health, medical, disability or life insurance coverage.

 

(l) None of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has made any promises or
commitments to create any additional material Company Benefit Plan or to
modify or change in any material way any existing material Company Benefit
Plan other than those amendments or modifications required by Law.

expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, (i) each Company Benefit Plan
that is mandated by a Governmental Authority other than a Governmental
Authority of the United States or subject to the Laws of a jurisdiction

fair market value of the assets of each funded Foreign Company Plan, the
liability of each insurer for any Foreign Company Plan funded through
insurance or the book reserve established for any Foreign Company Plan,
together with any accrued contributions, is sufficient to procure or provide
for the accrued benefit obligations, as of the date of this Agreement, with
respect to all current and former participants in such Foreign Company Plan
according to the actuarial assumptions and valuations most recently used to
determine employer contributions to such Foreign Company Plan, and no
transaction contemplated by this Agreement shall cause such assets or
insurance obligations to be less than such benefit obligations, (ii) each
Foreign Company Plan has been maintained and operated in all material respects
in accordance with the applicable plan document and all applicable Laws and
other requirements, and if intended to qualify for special Tax
treatment, satisfies all requirements for such treatment, and (iii) except as
required by Law, no condition or term under any relevant material Foreign
Company Plan exists which would prevent Parent from terminating or amending
any material Foreign Company Plan at any time for any reason without material
liability to Parent.

(n) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary of the Company is a party to any
agreement, contract, arrangement or plan that has resulted, separately or in
the aggregate, in the payment of any amount that will not be fully deductible
as a result of Section 162(m) of the Code, except for any payment or lack of
deductibility that, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would

Representations and Warranties of Parent and Merger Sub

 

Except, subject to _Section 9.03(g)_, as set forth in the Parent Disclosure

the Company as follows:

 



30 _Section 4.01_ _Organization, Standing and Corporate Power_. Each of Parent
and Merger Sub is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under
the Laws of its jurisdiction of organization and has all requisite corporate
power and authority to carry on its business as presently conducted.

corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the

corporate action on the part of each of Parent and Merger Sub, and no other
corporate proceedings (including any shareholder action) on the part of Parent
or Merger Sub are necessary to authorize this Agreement or to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger. This
Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by each of Parent and Merger
Sub and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by the
Company, constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of Parent and
Merger Sub, enforceable against each of Parent and Merger Sub in accordance
with its terms, subject, as to enforceability, to bankruptcy, insolvency and
other Laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors
rights and to general equity principles.

_Section 4.03_ _Non-Contravention_. The execution and delivery of this
Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub do not, and the consummation of the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and compliance with
the provisions of this Agreement will not, conflict with, or result in any
violation or breach of, or default (with or without notice or lapse of time,
or both) under, or give rise to a right of termination, cancellation or
acceleration of any obligation or to the loss of a benefit under, or result in
the creation of any Lien upon any of the properties or assets of Parent or
Merger Sub under, any provision of (a) the articles of incorporation or bylaws
of Parent or the articles of incorporation or bylaws of Merger Sub or (b)
subject to the filings and other matters referred to in the immediately
following sentence, (i) any Contract to which Parent or Merger Sub or any of
their respective Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of their respective
properties or assets are bound, (ii) any Law or Judgment, in each case
applicable to Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective Subsidiaries or
any of their respective properties or assets or (iii) any Authorizations of
Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective Subsidiaries, other than, in
the case of _clause (b)_ above, any such conflicts, violations, breaches,
defaults, rights, losses or Liens that would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.
No consent, approval, order, waiver or authorization of, action or nonaction
by, registration, declaration or filing with, or notice to, any Governmental
Authority is required to be obtained or made by or with respect to Parent or
Merger Sub or any of their respective Subsidiaries in connection with the

contemplated by this Agreement, (C) the filing with the Secretary of State of
the State of Minnesota of the Articles of Merger as required by the MBCA, (D)
any filings as may be required under Chapter 80B of the Minnesota Statutes and
(E) such other consents, approvals, orders, waivers, authorizations, actions,
nonactions, registrations, declarations, filings and notices the failure
of which to be obtained or made would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 

 _Section 4.04_ _Financing_. Parent has delivered to the Company true,
correct and complete copies, as of the date of this Agreement, of (a) an
executed commitment letter dated as of the date of this Agreement from Roark
Capital Partners II Sidecar LP (the " _Equity Investor_ " and, such letter,
the " _Equity Commitment Letter_ ") to invest, subject to the terms and
conditions therein, cash in the aggregate amount

 



31  set forth therein to Parent (the " _Equity Financing_ ") and (b) an executed
commitment letter from Barclays Bank plc dated as of the date of this
Agreement (including the exhibits, annexes and schedules thereto, the " _Debt
Commitment Letter_ " and, together with the Equity Commitment Letter, the "
_Financing Letters_ ") to provide, subject to the terms and conditions
therein, debt financing in the aggregate principal amount set forth therein
as of the Closing Date (being collectively referred to as the " _Debt
Financing_ " and, together with the Equity Financing, collectively referred to
herein as the " _Financing_ "). As of the date of this Agreement, the
Financing Letters, in the form so delivered, are in full force and effect and
are legal, valid and binding obligations of Parent, enforceable against Parent
and the Equity Investor (in the case of the Equity Commitment Letter) in
accordance with their terms, and, to the Knowledge of Parent, the other
parties thereto, subject, as to enforceability, to bankruptcy, insolvency and
other Laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors
rights and to general equity principles. As of the date of this Agreement,
Parent is not in breach, violation or default under the Financing Letters and
has fully paid or caused to be paid any and all commitment fees or other fees
in connection with the Financing Letters that are payable on or prior to the
date of this Agreement. Assuming the accuracy of the Companys representations
and warranties set forth in _Article III_ and the funding of the Financing in
accordance with the terms of the Financing Letters, the net proceeds
contemplated by the Financing will, together with Parents existing
unrestricted cash and cash equivalents in the aggregate, be sufficient to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement upon the terms
contemplated by this Agreement and to pay all related fees and expenses
associated therewith, including payment of all amounts under _Article II_ and
any repayment or refinancing of any outstanding debt contemplated by this
Agreement (to the extent required by, and pursuant to the terms of, this
Agreement). As of the date of this Agreement, to the Knowledge of Parent, no
event has occurred (and no event is reasonably expected to occur), that
individually or in the aggregate, with or without notice, lapse of time or
both, in each case that would reasonably be expected to (i) constitute a
default or breach on the part of Parent under any term or condition of
either Financing Letter, (ii) permit any of the other parties thereto to
terminate, or to not make the initial funding of the facilities to be
established thereunder upon satisfaction of all conditions thereto, or (iii)
preclude the satisfaction of the funding conditions set forth in the
Financing Letters. Except as set forth in the Financing Letters, there are no
conditions precedent to the respective obligations of the Equity Investor and
the lenders party to the Debt Commitment Letter to fund the full amount of
the Financing. Except for any fee letters (redacted solely with respect to fee
amounts or other sensitive information that does not impact conditionality,
enforceability, availability or aggregate principal amount of the Financing)
that have been provided to the Company (the " _Fee Letters_ "), there are no
contractual contingencies under any agreements, side letters or arrangements
(other than) relating to the Financing to which either Parent, Merger Sub or
any of their respective Affiliates is a party that would permit the Equity
Investor or the lenders party to the Debt Commitment Letter to reduce the
total amount of the Financing, or that would materially and adversely affect
the availability of the Financing. Assuming the accuracy of the Companys
representations and warranties set forth in _Article III_ , after giving
effect to each of the transactions contemplated hereby, Parent and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, will be solvent (solvency to be defined in
the same manner as in the solvency certificate attached to the Debt Commitment
Letter as Annex I to Exhibit D). Regardless of whether the Financing is
consummated, Parent has on the date of this Agreement and will have when any
payment of the Parent Termination Fee is required, access to immediately
available funds sufficient to pay the Parent Termination Fee.

 

 _Section 4.05_ _Litigation_. There is no suit, action or proceeding pending
or, to the Knowledge of Parent or Merger Sub, threatened against Parent,
Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates that, individually or in the
aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse
Effect. There is no Judgment outstanding against Parent, Merger Sub or any of
their respective Affiliates that, individually or in the aggregate, would
reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 



32 _Section 4.06_ _Information Supplied_. None of the information supplied or to
be supplied by or on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub or any of its
Subsidiaries for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy
Statement will, at the date it is first mailed to the shareholders of the
Company and at the time of the Shareholders Meeting, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light
of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading.

_Section 4.07_ _Operation of Merger Sub_. Merger Sub has been formed solely
for the purpose of engaging in the transactions contemplated hereby and,
prior to the Effective Time, will not have engaged in any business activities,
other than activities pursuant to this Agreement.

 

 _Section 4.08_ _Ownership of Company Common Stock; Certain Arrangements_.
None of Parent, Merger Sub or their Affiliates (a) beneficially owns (within
the meaning of Section 13 of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder), or will prior to the Closing Date (other than
pursuant to the transactions contemplated hereby), beneficially own any
shares of Company Common Stock, (b) is an "interested shareholder" under
Section 302A.011, Subd. 49, of the MBCA or (c) is party to any agreement,
arrangement, or understanding that would be required to be disclosed under
Item 1005(e) of Regulation M-A under the Exchange Act. Other than this
Agreement, there are no contracts, undertakings, commitments, agreements or
obligations or understandings between Parent, Merger Sub or the
Equity Investor or any of their respective controlled Affiliates, on the one
hand, and any member of the Companys management or the Company Board, the
Company Financial Advisor or any of their respective Affiliates, on the other
hand, relating to the Transactions or the operations of the Company after the
Effective Time or that would be required to be disclosed under Item 1005(d) of
Regulation M-A under the Exchange Act.

 

 _Section 4.09_ _Brokers and Other Advisors_. Neither Parent nor any of its
Affiliates, nor any of their respective officers or directors has employed
any broker, finder or financial or similar advisor or incurred any liability
for any financial advisors or brokers fees, commissions or finders fees in
connection with the Merger or the related transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, in each case that would reasonably be expected to impose any
liability on the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

 

 _Section 4.10_ _Non-Reliance on Estimates, Projections, Forecasts, Forward-
Looking Statements and Business Plans_. Parent and Merger Sub hereby
acknowledge that, except for the representations and warranties set forth in
_Article III_ , none of the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor any of
their respective shareholders or Representatives, nor any other person, has
made or is making any representation or warranty in connection with this
Agreement, including with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
their respective businesses and operations. Without limiting the foregoing, in
connection with the due diligence investigation of the Company and its
Subsidiaries by Parent and Merger Sub, Parent and Merger Sub (and their
Representatives) have received and may continue to receive from the Company
and its Subsidiaries and their Representatives certain estimates,
projections, forecasts and other forward-looking information, as well as
certain business plan information, regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries
and their respective businesses and operations. Parent and Merger Sub hereby
acknowledge that there are uncertainties inherent in attempting to make such
estimates, projections, forecasts and other forward-looking statements, as
well as in such business plans, with which Parent and Merger Sub are
familiar, that Parent and Merger Sub are taking full responsibility for
making their own evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of all estimates,
projections, forecasts and other forward-looking information, as well as such
business plans, so furnished to them (including the reasonableness of the
assumptions underlying such estimates, projections, forecasts, forward-looking
information or business plans), and that Parent and Merger Sub will have no
claim against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or any of their
respective shareholders or Representatives, or any other person, with respect
thereto.

step transaction) or series of related transactions, in each case other than
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, with a person or group
relating to (x) the issuance to such person or group or acquisition by such
person or group of at least 15% of the equity interests in the Company or (y)
the acquisition by such person or group of at least 15% of the consolidated

whole, pursuant to a merger, consolidation, share exchange, reorganization,
recapitalization, consolidation or other business combination, sale of shares
of capital stock, sale of assets, tender offer, exchange offer or other

as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act.

(iii) The term " _Superior Proposal_ " means any _bona fide_ , written
Takeover Proposal that if consummated would result in a person or group (or
the shareholders of any person) owning, directly or indirectly, (a) more than
fifty percent (50%) of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock or (b)
more than fifty percent (50%) of the assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, in either case that the Company Board
determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and
outside legal counsel) (x) is reasonably likely to be consummated in
accordance with its terms, and (y) if consummated, would be more favorable to
the shareholders of the Company from a financial point of view than the
Merger, in each case taking into account all financial, legal,
financing, regulatory and other aspects of such Takeover Proposal (including
the person or group making the Takeover Proposal) and of this Agreement deemed
relevant by the Company Board (including any changes to the terms of this
Agreement proposed by Parent pursuant to _Section 5.02(h)_).

the Company Board as of the date of this Agreement (or if known, the magnitude
or material consequences of which were not known or reasonably foreseeable by
the Company Board as of the date of this Agreement), which change, effect,
event, occurrence or fact becomes known to the Company Board prior to

(c) _Response to Takeover Proposals_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in _Section 5.02(a)_, if at any time following the execution and
delivery of this Agreement and prior to obtaining the Shareholder Approval (i)
the Company has received a _bona fide_ , written Takeover Proposal from a
third party that did not result from a breach of this  _Section 5.02_, and
(ii) the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its
financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that such Takeover Proposal
constitutes or is reasonably likely to result in a Superior Proposal and the
failure to take the following actions is reasonably likely to be inconsistent
with the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law, then the Company
may (A) enter into an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement with the person
making such Takeover Proposal and, after entering into such Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement, furnish information with respect to the Company and
its Subsidiaries to such person pursuant to such Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement,  _provided_ , that the Company shall promptly (and in any event

request for discussions or negotiations related to, any Takeover Proposal
(including any material changes related to the foregoing), and in connection
with such notice, provide the identity of the person or group making such

Agreement), and a description of any material oral terms and conditions);
_provided_ , that the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective
Representatives shall not engage in any substantive discussions or
negotiations or provide any non-public information concerning the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries unless and until such persons identity has been
disclosed to Parent and such redactions have been unredacted. Thereafter the
Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed on a prompt (and, in any event,
within 24 hours) basis of the status, details and terms (other than immaterial
details and terms) of any such Takeover Proposal or request (including
copies of any written requests, proposals, offers or agreements).

5.02(c)_ (an " _Acquisition Agreement_ ") or (iv) publicly propose or announce
an intention to take any of the foregoing actions (any action described in
_clauses (i)_ , _(ii)_ or _(iv)_ being referred to as an " _Adverse
Recommendation Change_ ").

(f)  _Intervening Event_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, at any time prior to the receipt of the Shareholder
Approval, and subject to compliance with _Section 5.02(h)_, the Company Board
may make an Adverse Recommendation Change in response to an Intervening Event
if the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its
outside legal counsel, that the failure to do so would be reasonably likely to
be inconsistent with the Company Boards fiduciary duties under applicable
Law.

(g) _Superior Proposal_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, at any time prior to the receipt of the Shareholder
Approval, if, in response to a _bona fide_ written Takeover Proposal made
after the execution and delivery of this Agreement and not withdrawn that did
not result from a breach of this _Section 5.02_, the Company Board
determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside counsel and
financial advisors) that such Takeover Proposal constitutes a Superior
Proposal, (i) subject to compliance with _Section 5.02(h)_, the Company
Board may make an Adverse Recommendation Change and/or (ii) the Company may
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.01(f)_ in order to enter into
an Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Company shall not terminate this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 8.01(f)_ unless the Company (A) has complied with its obligations
under  _Section 5.02(h)_, (B) pays, or causes to be paid, to Parent the
Company Termination Fee payable pursuant to _Section 8.03(b)_ prior to or
concurrently with such termination and (C) immediately following or
concurrently with such termination, enters into a definitive Acquisition
Agreement that documents the terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal.

 



40 (h) _Certain Conditions_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, the Company shall not be entitled to make an Adverse
Recommendation Change pursuant to _Section 5.02(f)_ and _Section 5.02(g)_ or
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.01(f)_ unless:

 

(i) the Company shall have provided to Parent prior written notice at least
four business days in advance (the " _Match Right Period_ " and, such notice,
the " _Match Right Notice_ "), advising Parent that the Company intends to
take such action (and specifying, in reasonable detail, the reasons for such
action and the material terms and conditions of any such Superior Proposal or
details of such Intervening Event, as applicable); and

(ii) during such Match Right Period, if requested by Parent in good faith,
the Company and its Representatives shall have engaged in good faith
negotiations with Parent regarding changes to the terms of this Agreement
intended by Parent so that an Adverse Recommendation Change would no longer
be necessary or to cause such Takeover Proposal to no longer constitute a
Superior Proposal, as applicable; and

(iii) the Company Board shall have considered any adjustments to this
Agreement (including a change to the price terms hereof) and any other
agreements that may be proposed in writing by Parent (the " _Proposed Changed
Terms_ ") no later than 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on the last business
day of the Match Right Period and shall have determined in good faith (after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors) that,
after giving effect to such Proposed Changed Terms, the failure to make the
Adverse Recommendation Change or terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section
8.01(f)_, as applicable, would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with
its fiduciary obligations of the Company Board under applicable Law.

For the avoidance of doubt, any (1) material changes in the changes, effects,
events, occurrences or facts relating to an Intervening Event, (2) material
revisions to the terms of a Superior Proposal or (3) material revisions to a
Takeover Proposal that the Company Board had determined no longer constitutes
a Superior Proposal, shall constitute a new Intervening Event or Takeover
Proposal, as applicable, and shall in each case require the Company to deliver
to Parent a new Match Right Notice; _provided_ that, in such event, each
reference in this _Section 5.02(h)_ to the Match Right Period shall
be deemed to be a two business day period.

(i) _Standstills; Confidentiality Agreements_. Notwithstanding any provision
of  _Section 5.02(e)_ to the contrary, the Company shall not grant any
waiver or release under, or fail to enforce, any standstill or similar
agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , at any time prior to obtaining the
Shareholder Approval, the Company may grant a waiver or release under any
standstill agreement if the Company Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with its outside legal counsel) that the failure to take such
action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties under applicable Law. The Company shall provide written notice to
Parent of any waiver or release of any standstill by the Company, including
disclosure of the identities of the parties thereto and circumstances
relating thereto. Except for the waiver or release of standstill as
contemplated by this _Section 5.02(i)_, the Company shall enforce, and shall
not release or permit the release of any person from, or amend, waive,
terminate or modify, and shall not permit the amendment, waiver, termination
or modification of, any provision of, any confidentiality or similar agreement
or provision to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or
under which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has any rights. The
Company shall not, and shall not permit any of its Representatives to, enter
into any confidentiality or similar agreement subsequent to the date of this
Agreement that prohibits the Company from providing to Parent the information
specifically required to be provided to Parent pursuant to this _Section
5.02_.

 



41 (j) _Communications With Shareholders_. Nothing contained in this _Section
5.02_ shall prohibit the Company from (i) taking and disclosing to its
shareholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a)
promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii) making any disclosure to its
shareholders if, in the good faith determination of the Company Board after
consultation with its outside legal counsel, the failure to make such
disclosure would reasonably be expected to violate applicable Laws or (iii)
making any "stop-look-and-listen" communication to the shareholders of the
Company pursuant to Section 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act (or
any similar communications to the shareholders of the Company) in which the
Company indicates that it has not changed the Recommendation;  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that _clause (ii)_ shall not be deemed to permit the Company
Board to make an Adverse Recommendation Change or take any of the actions
referred to in _Section 5.02(e)_, _Section 5.02(f)_ or _Section 5.02(g)_
except, in each case, to the extent expressly permitted by _Section 5.02(e)_,
_Section 5.02(f)_ or _Section 5.02(g)_, respectively; _provided_ , _further_
, that nothing in this  _Section 5.02_ shall prohibit the Company from
contacting and engaging in any discussions with any person or group or their
respective Representatives who has made a Takeover Proposal solely for the
purpose of clarifying such Takeover Proposal and the terms thereof.

reasonable request of Parent, advise Parent at least on a daily basis on each
of the last seven business days prior to the date of the Shareholders
Meeting as to the aggregate tally of proxies received by the Company with
respect to the Shareholder Approval. Without the prior written consent of
Parent, the adoption of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby (including the Merger) and a non-binding vote on executive compensation
shall be the only matters (other than procedural matters) that the Company
shall propose to be acted on by the shareholders of the Company at the
Shareholders Meeting.

 



42 (b) _Preparation of Proxy Statement_. As promptly as reasonably practicable
after the date hereof (and in any event within fifteen business days), the
Company, with the assistance of Parent, shall prepare, and the Company shall
file with the SEC, the preliminary Proxy Statement in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to each of the Company and Parent relating to the
Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby. Subject to the terms of this
Agreement, the Proxy Statement shall reflect the Recommendation and shall

the Fairness Opinion, together with a summary thereof. Parent shall cooperate
with the Company in the preparation of the preliminary Proxy Statement and the
definitive Proxy Statement and shall furnish to the Company the information
relating to it and Merger Sub required by the Exchange Act or as reasonably
requested by the Company. The Company shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts, after consultation with Parent, to respond as promptly as practicable

6.01(a)_. Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall promptly correct
any information provided by it for use in the Proxy Statement if and to the
extent that it shall have become false or misleading in any material respect.
The Company agrees to take all steps reasonably necessary to cause the Proxy
Statement as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and to be disseminated to
holders of shares of Company Common Stock, in each case as, and to the extent,
required by applicable Law. The Company shall promptly provide Parent and its
counsel with copies of any written comments, and shall inform them of
any oral comments, that the Company or its counsel may receive from the SEC
or its staff (including any request by the SEC or its staff for any amendments
or supplements to the preliminary Proxy Statement or the definitive Proxy
Statement), and the Company and Parent shall cooperate in filing with the SEC
or its staff, and, if required, the Company shall mail to its shareholders, as
promptly as reasonably practicable, such amendment or supplement. Parent and
its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review any written
responses to such SEC comments and the Company shall give due consideration to
the reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by Parent and
its counsel. The Proxy Statement shall comply in all material respects with
all applicable requirements of Law.

properties, books and records and to those employees and Representatives of
the Company to whom Parent requests access, and, during such period, the
Company shall furnish to Parent, as promptly as reasonably practicable, all
financial, operating and other data and information concerning its and its
Subsidiaries business, properties and personnel that are in the possession,
custody or control of the Company as Parent through its officers, employees,
accountants, counsel, consultants, financial advisors and other
Representatives may reasonably request (it being agreed, however, that the
foregoing shall not permit Parent or any such Representatives to conduct any
Phase II environmental assessment). Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or
disclose information where the Company reasonably determines that such access
or disclosure would jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or conflict with or violate any Law (including
antitrust Laws) or any Contract to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party ( _provided_ that the Company shall in such event use
reasonable best efforts to avoid such constraints on disclosure, including
entering into a joint defense agreement in customary form). No investigation
or access permitted, or knowledge obtained, pursuant to this _Section 6.02_
shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement made by the Company hereunder or otherwise prejudice in any way the
rights and remedies of Parent or Merger Sub hereunder, nor shall any such
investigation, access or knowledge be deemed to affect or modify Parents or
Merger Subs reliance on the representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements made by the

 



43  Company in this Agreement. Except for disclosures expressly permitted by the
Confidentiality Agreement, Parent shall, in accordance with the
Confidentiality Agreement, keep confidential and not disclose, and shall

Parties shall request and shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain early
termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act.

Governmental Authority with respect to the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby. Subject to reasonable limitations limiting access to
outside counsel and subject to the Confidentiality Agreement, the Company and
Parent each shall, upon request by the other, consult with the other regarding
all information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers and
shareholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or
advisable in connection with any statement, filing, notice or application made
by or on behalf of Parent, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries
to any third party and/or any Governmental Authority in connection with the
Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein (including _Section 6.03(e)_), Parent shall,

its views and acting reasonably and in good faith, direct and control all
aspects of the Parties efforts to gain regulatory clearance either before any
Governmental Authority or in any action brought to enjoin the transactions
contemplated hereby pursuant to the HSR Act.

(e) Except as expressly set forth in _Section 6.03(d)_ and this  _Section

Litigation and the Company shall give reasonable and good faith consideration
to Parents advice with respect to such Transaction Litigation. The Company
shall not, and shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries nor any of its or
their Representatives to, compromise, settle or come to a settlement
arrangement regarding any Transaction Litigation unless Parent
shall otherwise consent in writing, which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. " _Transaction Litigation_ " means any Litigation
commenced or threatened against any Party or any of its Affiliates by any
Governmental Authority or any private party relating to, arising out of or
relating to this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other transactions
contemplated hereby.

 

(f) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall cooperate with Parent and use
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do or
cause to be done all things, reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its
part under applicable Laws and rules and policies of NASDAQ to cause the
delisting of the Company and of the Company Common Stock from NASDAQ
as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time and the deregistration of
the Company Common Stock under the Exchange Act as promptly as practicable
after such delisting.

 

(g) From and after the date hereof until the Effective Time, Parent and Merger
Sub shall take all actions necessary or desirable to cause the representation
and warranty set forth in _Section 4.04_ to be true, correct and complete as

 _Section 6.04_ _State Takeover Statutes_. Subject to the accuracy of
Parents representations in _Section 4.08_, if any Takeover Statute becomes
or is deemed to be applicable to the Company, Parent or Merger Sub, or the
Merger, or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement, then the
Company, the Company Board and an appropriate committee thereof,
as applicable, shall to the extent permitted by applicable Law, (a) grant all
approvals and take all action necessary to ensure that the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated herein and (b) otherwise act to
eliminate, or if not possible minimize to the maximum extent possible, the
effects of such Takeover Statute on this Agreement, the Merger and the other

 



45  transactions contemplated hereby. No Adverse Recommendation Change shall
change the approval of the Company Board or the appropriate committee thereof
for purposes of causing any Takeover Statute to be inapplicable to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

_Section 6.05_ _Benefit Plans_.

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause its Subsidiaries
(including the Surviving Corporation) to honor all Company Benefit Plans,
including all employment agreements with executives of the Company, in
accordance with their terms as in effect immediately before the Effective
Time, except as otherwise specifically provided herein. For the period
commencing at the Effective Time and ending on December 31, 2018 (or, if
shorter, during the period of continued employment of the relevant employee),
Parent shall cause its Subsidiaries to provide to each individual who is
employed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries immediately before the
Effective Time who continues employment with Subsidiaries of Parent
immediately following the Effective Time (each, a " _Company Employee_ ") (i)
base compensation and cash incentive opportunities that are substantially
comparable in the aggregate to what was provided to the Company Employee as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) all other compensation and
employee benefits that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to those
provided to the Company Employee as of immediately prior to the Effective Time
(excluding all equity-based compensation); _provided_ that Parent shall cause
its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation) to honor, without any
adverse modification, the benefits specifically listed on Section 6.05(a) of
the Company Disclosure Letter for the period commencing at the Effective Time
and ending on the date that is one year following the Effective Time (or, if
shorter, during the period of continued employment of the relevant employee).

(b) Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to give each Company
Employee credit for all service with the Company and its Subsidiaries and
their respective predecessors under any employee benefit plan of Parent, the
Surviving Corporation, or any of their Subsidiaries, including any such
plans providing vacation, sick pay, other paid time off, severance pay and
benefits, and retirement benefits maintained by Parent or its Subsidiaries in
which such Company Employees participate for purposes of eligibility, vesting
and entitlement to benefits, including for severance benefits and vacation or
sick leave or other paid time off entitlement (but not for benefit accruals or
participation eligibility under any defined benefit pension plan or plan
providing post-retirement medical or other similar benefits), to the extent
past service was recognized for such Company Employees under the comparable
Company Benefit Plans immediately prior to the Effective Time. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, nothing in this _Section 6.05_ shall be construed to require
crediting of service that would result in (i) duplication of benefits or (ii)
service credit for benefit accruals under a defined benefit pension plan or
any grandfather or frozen plan Parent benefit plan. 

(c) In the event of any change in the welfare benefits provided to Company
Employees following the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, use commercially reasonable efforts to cause (i) the
waiver of all limitations as to pre-existing conditions, exclusions and
waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements
applicable to the Company Employees (and their eligible dependents) under any
welfare benefit plans in which Company Employees participate following the
Effective Time, to the extent that such conditions, exclusions or waiting
periods would not apply in the absence of such change, and (ii) for the plan
year in which the Effective Time occurs, the crediting of each Company
Employee (or his or her eligible dependents) with any payments made that
accumulated towards all deductibles and out-of-pocket maximums paid prior to
any such change in satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket
requirements after such change.

(d) If requested by Parent in writing within thirty business days prior to
the Effective Time, effective as of, and contingent upon, the Closing Date,
the Company shall adopt such resolutions and/or amendments to terminate each
Company Benefit Plan listed in Section 6.05(d) of the Company

 



46  Disclosure Letter (each, a " _Terminated Plan_ "). The Company shall provide
Parent with a copy of the resolutions and/or plan amendments (the form and
substance of which shall be subject to review and approval by Parent)
evidencing that each Terminated Plan has been terminated.

(e) The Parties acknowledge and agree that all provisions contained in this
_Section 6.05_ are included for the sole benefit of the Parties, and that
nothing in this Agreement, whether express or implied, (i) shall create any
third party beneficiary or other rights (A) in any other person, including
any employees or former employees of the Company, any of the Companys
Subsidiaries or any Affiliate of the Company, any Company Employee, or any
dependent or beneficiary thereof, or (B) to continued employment with Parent
or any of its Affiliates or to employment or continued employment or to a
particular term or condition of employment with Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries, or any of their respective Affiliates, (ii) shall be treated
as an amendment or other modification of any employee benefit plan, or (iii)
shall limit the right of Parent or its Subsidiaries to (A) amend, terminate or
otherwise modify any employee benefit plan of Parent or its Subsidiaries
following the Effective Time or (B) terminate the employment or service of
any employee or other service-provider following the Effective Time at any
time and for any or no reason. For the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing
_clause (iii)(A)_ does not relieve Parent of any obligations it may have
under _Section 6.05(a)_ through _(c)_.

_Section 6.06_  _Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance_.

(a) Prior to the Closing, Parent and the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to purchase a "tail" or "runoff" officers and directors liability
insurance policy in respect of acts or omissions occurring prior to the
Effective Time covering each such person currently covered by the Companys
officers and directors liability insurance policy on terms with respect to
coverage, deductibles and amounts no less favorable than those of such policy
in effect on the date of this Agreement for the six year period following
Effective Time and at a price not to exceed 300% of the amount per annum the
Company paid in its last full fiscal year prior to the date of this Agreement,
which amount is set forth on Section 6.06(a) of the Company Disclosure
Letter (the " _Current Premium_ "). If the Company or Parent obtains prepaid
"tail" or "runoff" policies prior to the Effective Time in accordance with
this _Section 6.06(a)_, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain such policies in full force and
effect for their full term, and continue to honor the obligations thereunder.
If the Company fails to purchase such "tail" or "runoff" policy prior to the
Closing, then either (i) Parent may purchase such "tail" or "runoff" policy on
behalf of the Company or the Surviving Corporation or (ii) the Surviving
Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
maintain an officers and directors liability insurance policy in respect of
acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time covering each such
person currently covered by the Companys officers and directors liability
insurance policy on terms with respect to coverage and amount no less
favorable than those of such policy in effect as of the date of this Agreement
for a period of six years after the Effective Time;  _provided_ _further_ ,
that in satisfying its obligation under this _Section 6.06(a)(ii)_, neither
Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to pay annual premiums
in excess of 300% of the Current Premium and if such premiums for such
insurance would at any time exceed 300% of the Current Premium, then Parent or
the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be maintained policies of insurance
that, in Parent or the Surviving Corporations good faith judgment, provide
the maximum coverage available at an annual premium equal to 300% of the
Current Premium.

(b) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to fulfill and honor in all respects the obligations of the
Company and its Subsidiaries pursuant to (i) each indemnification agreement in
effect between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any individual who
at the Effective Time is, or at any time prior to the Effective Time was, a
director or officer of the Company or of a Subsidiary of the Company (each, an
" _Indemnified Party_ ") made available to Parent; and (ii) any
indemnification provision and any exculpation provision set forth in the
Company Articles of Incorporation or the Company Bylaws or similar governing
documents of any Subsidiary of the Company 

 



47  as in effect on the date of this Agreement, in each case, to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable Law. From the Effective Time through the
sixth anniversary of the date on which the Effective Time occurs, the
articles of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall
contain, and Parent shall cause the articles of incorporation and bylaws of
the Surviving Corporation to so contain, provisions no less favorable
with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of
each Indemnified Party than are set forth in the articles of incorporation and
bylaws of the Company as in effect on the date of this Agreement.

 

(c) Except as otherwise required by applicable Law, from and after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, indemnify and hold harmless, and provide advancement
of expenses to, each Indemnified Party in respect of acts or omissions in
their capacity as a director or officer of the Company or its Subsidiaries or
as an officer, director, employee, fiduciary or agent of another enterprise
if the Indemnified Party was serving in such capacity at the request of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, in any case occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law or provided
under the articles of incorporation, bylaws, any indemnification agreements
and any other governing documents of the Company and its Subsidiaries in
effect on the date hereof. In the event of any threatened or pending
Litigation to which an Indemnified Party is, has been or becomes a party or
with respect to which an Indemnified Party is, has been or becomes otherwise
involved (including as a witness), arising in whole or in part out of,
or pertaining in whole or in part to, the fact that the Indemnified Party is
or was an officer or director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or is
or was serving at the request of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as an
officer, director, employee, fiduciary or agent of another enterprise
(including any Litigation arising out of or pertaining to matters occurring or
existing or alleged to have occurred or existed, or acts or omissions
occurring or alleged to have occurred, at or prior to the Effective Time, or
arising out of or pertaining to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby), to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, the
Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to, advance fees, costs and expenses (including attorneys fees and
disbursements) incurred by each Indemnified Party in connection with and prior
to the final disposition of such Litigations, such fees, costs and
expenses (including attorneys fees and disbursements) to be advanced within
thirty calendar days of receipt by Parent from the Indemnified Party of a
request therefor, _provided_ that such Indemnified Party provides a written
affirmation of such Indemnified Partys good faith belief that he or she has
met all applicable standards of conduct applicable to indemnification and an
undertaking to repay such advance if it is ultimately determined by a final
non-appealable order of a court of competent jurisdiction that such
Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification under this _Section
6.06(c)_ or otherwise.

 

(d) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns
(i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any person, then, and in each such case proper provision shall be
made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation shall
assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 6.06_.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if an Indemnified Party
is or has been a party to or is or has been otherwise involved (including as
a witness) in any Litigation (whether arising before, at or after the
Effective Time) on or prior to the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective
Time, the provisions of this _Section 6.06_ shall continue in effect
until the final disposition of such Litigation.

(f) The provisions of this _Section 6.06_ are (i) intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, his or her
heirs and his or her representatives and (ii) in addition to, and not in
substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any
such individual may have under the articles of organization or bylaws, by
Contract or otherwise.

 



48 _Section 6.07_ _Public Announcements_. Parent and the Company shall consult
with each other before issuing, and give each other the opportunity to review
and comment upon, any press release or other public statements with respect to
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
shall not issue any such press release or make any such public statement
prior to such consultation, except as may be required by applicable Law, court
process or the rules and regulations of NASDAQ or any other national
securities exchange or national securities quotation system and except for
any matters referred to in, and made in compliance with, _Section 5.02_. The
Parties agree that the initial press release to be issued with respect to the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be in
the form mutually agreed to by the Parties. Prior to making any written
communications to the employees or independent contractors of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries pertaining to compensation or benefit matters that
are affected by the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Company
shall provide Parent with a copy of the intended communication, Parent shall
have a reasonable period of time to review and comment on the communication,
and Parent and the Company shall cooperate in providing any such mutually
agreeable communication. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this _Section 6.07_
shall not apply to any communication (a) that is consistent with the initial
press release and the terms of this Agreement and does not contain any
information relating to the Company, Parent or the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement that has not been previously announced or made public in
accordance with the terms of this  _Section 6.07_, (b) is made in the
Ordinary Course of Business and does not primarily relate to this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby or (c) with respect to any Adverse
Recommendation Change or announcement made with respect to any Takeover
Proposal, Superior Proposal or related matters in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement, or any dispute between the Parties regarding this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

 _Section 6.08_ _Financing_.

 

(a) Parent and Merger Sub shall use their reasonable best efforts to take, or
cause to be taken by their Representatives, all actions and to do, or cause
to be done by their Representatives, all things necessary to obtain the
Financing on the terms and subject to the conditions described in the
Financing Letters, and, without the consent of the Company, will not consent
to any amendment or modification to be made to, or any waiver of any
provision or remedy under, or any assignment of the obligations of the other
parties thereto under (i) the Equity Commitment Letter whatsoever (except to
increase the amount of the Equity Financing) or (ii) the Debt Commitment
Letter, in the case of this _clause (ii)_ , solely to the extent such
amendment, modification, waiver or assignment would (A) reduce the aggregate
principal amount of the Debt Financing (unless the Equity Financing is
increased by a corresponding amount or Parent otherwise has immediately
available cash and cash equivalents on hand in an amount at least equal to
such reduction), (B) expand or impose new or additional conditions,
or otherwise expand or adversely amend or modify any of the conditions, to
the receipt of the Financing, or (C) otherwise reasonably be expected to (1)
materially delay or prevent the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, including the Closing, (2) make the funding of the
Financing (or satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the Financing)
materially less likely to occur at the Effective Time or (3) adversely impact
the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to enforce its rights against the other
parties to the Financing Letters or the definitive agreements with respect
thereto (such definitive agreements, together with the Debt Commitment Letter,
the " _Debt Financing Agreements_ " and, together with the Equity Financing
Agreements (as defined below), the " _Financing Agreements_ ") (clauses (A)
through (C), collectively, the " _Consent Requirements_ "). Subject to
the foregoing, Parent and Merger Sub may (I) consent to the assignment of the
commitments of any lender under the Debt Commitment Letter, and to amend the
Debt Commitment Letter solely to add or replace any lender under the Debt
Commitment Letter with other lenders, arrangers, bookrunners, agents,
syndication agents, documentation

 



49  agents or similar entities and (II) amend or otherwise modify the Debt
Commitment Letter solely to implement any flex provisions set forth in the Fee
Letters. In the event of any such assignment, amendment or modification of
the Debt Commitment Letter as permitted by the immediately preceding sentence,
the financing under such assigned, amended or modified Debt Commitment Letter
will be deemed to be "Debt Financing" as such term is used in this Agreement.

(b) Parent and Merger Sub shall use their reasonable best efforts, and shall
use their reasonable best efforts to cause their Representatives, to (i)
maintain in effect the Financing Letters (including any definitive agreements
entered into in connection therewith) until the earliest of the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the termination of this
Agreement or the time at which any Alternative Financing is available, (ii)
satisfy on a timely basis all conditions in the Financing Agreements
applicable to Parent and Merger Sub (and that are within their control)
to obtaining the Financing, (iii) negotiate and enter into definitive
agreements with respect to the Equity Financing on terms and conditions
contained in the Equity Commitment Letter (such definitive agreements,
together with the Equity Commitment Letter, the " _Equity Financing
Agreements_ ") and definitive agreements with respect to the Debt Financing on
terms and conditions contained in the Debt Commitment Letter (as modified, to
the extent exercised, by the flex provisions set forth in the Fee Letters) or
on other terms acceptable to Parent that would not result in the Consent
Requirements being applicable, (iv) consummate the Financing at or prior to
the Closing (which efforts shall include, making demand upon the lenders and
the Equity Investor to consummate the Financing to the extent the conditions
thereto have been satisfied (other than those which are dependent upon, or are
to occur simultaneously with, the funding of the Financing), and (v) using
cash or cash equivalents on hand and/or amounts available under other existing
credit facilities to fund the portion of the Merger Consideration not funded
by the Financing (if necessary).

 

(c) At the Companys request, Parent shall keep the Company reasonably
informed on a current basis of the status of its efforts to consummate the
Financing (or any Alternative Financing in accordance with this _Section
6.08_), including providing prompt written notice of any actual or threatened
breach or default by any party to any Financing Agreement and the receipt of
any written notice or other written communication from any Financing Source
with respect to any actual or threatened breach, default, termination or
repudiation by any party to any Financing Agreement of any provision thereof.
If any portion of the Financing becomes reasonably likely to be unavailable
on the material terms and conditions contemplated by the applicable Financing
Agreements (in the case of the Debt Financing Agreements, giving effect to, to
the extent exercised, the flex provisions set forth in the Fee Letters), (1)
Parent will promptly (and in any event, within two business days) notify the
Company, _provided_ , that in no event will Parent or Merger Sub be under any
obligation to disclose any information that (x) is subject to attorney-client
or similar privilege if Parent or Merger Sub shall have used its reasonable
best efforts to disclose such information in a manner that would not waive
such privilege (including entering into a joint defense agreement in
customary form), or (y) would contravene any Law, and (2) Parent will use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain alternative financing from alternative
sources in an amount sufficient to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement (it being understood that Parent shall have no obligation to
accept any terms or conditions that are materially less favorable, taken as a
whole, to Parent, Merger Sub and the Company than the terms and conditions
set forth in the applicable Financing Agreements) (" _Alternative Financing_
") as promptly as reasonably practicable following the occurrence of such
event. For purposes of this Agreement, (x) the terms "Financing", "Debt
Financing" and/or "Equity Financing" (as the case may be) as used in this
Agreement will be deemed to include any such Alternative Financing, (y) the
term "Debt Commitment Letter" and/or "Equity Commitment Letter" (as the case
may be) will be deemed to include any commitment letters with respect to any
such Alternative Financing and (z) the term "Financing Agreements", "Debt
Financing Agreements" and/or "Equity Financing Agreements" (as the case may
be) will be deemed to include any definitive agreement with respect to the
Alternative Financing.

 



50 (d) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, compliance by
Parent and Merger Sub with this _Section 6.08_ shall not relieve Parent or
Merger Sub of their obligations to consummate the Transactions whether or not
the Financing or the Alternative Financing is available.

 

 _Section 6.09_ _Financing Cooperation_.

 

(a) The Company and its Subsidiaries shall use reasonable best efforts to
provide, and cause their respective Representatives to provide,
all cooperation that is reasonably necessary, customary or advisable and
reasonably requested by Parent to assist Parent in connection with the
consummation, arrangement, marketing and syndication of the Debt Financing or
any replacement, amended, modified or alternative financing permitted by this
Agreement (collectively with the Debt Financing, the " _Available Financing_
") (it being understood that the receipt of such financing is not a condition
to the Merger);  _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this _Section
6.09_ shall require such cooperation or other action on the part of the
Company, its Subsidiaries or their respective Representatives to the extent it
would (A) unreasonably disrupt the conduct of the business or operations of
the Company or its Subsidiaries or (B) require the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives to enter into any
agreement, take any corporate action or otherwise agree to pay any fees,
reimburse any expenses or otherwise incur any liability (other than out-of-
pocket expenses that shall be subject to reimbursement by Parent as set forth
below) or give any indemnities prior to the Effective Time. Subject to the
foregoing proviso, cooperation shall include using reasonable best efforts to
(i) prepare and furnish the Required Information, (ii) make available
financial information and data derived from the historical books and records
of the Company and its Subsidiaries that is (x) required to permit Parent to
prepare the pro forma financial statements contemplated by paragraph 8 of

hereof (provided that Parent shall be responsible for the preparation of any
pro forma financial statements and pro forma adjustments giving effect to the
transactions contemplated hereby for use in connection with the offering of
the Available Financing, it being understood that the Company shall cooperate
with Parent in the preparation of such pro forma information to the extent its
cooperation relates to financial information and data derived from the
Companys historical books and records) or (y) pertinent and customary
financial and other information (other than pro forma financial statements) as

sessions, drafting sessions and sessions with rating agencies, and to
reasonably cooperate with the marketing or solicitation efforts of Parent and
Merger Sub and their financing sources, in each case as reasonably requested
by Parent and Merger Sub and reasonably required in connection with the
Available Financing, (iv) as reasonably requested by Parent, assist Parent
with the preparation of customary materials for rating agency
presentations, marketing materials, offering memoranda and bank information
memoranda (including with respect to presence of or absence of material non-
public information relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries and the
accuracy of the information relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries
contained therein), lender presentations, offering documents, private
placement memoranda, prospectuses and similar documents required in connection
with the Available Financing, (v) reasonably facilitate the pledging of
collateral, provided that no such pledging or related documents or agreements
shall be effective prior to the Effective Time, (vi) taking all corporate
actions, subject to the occurrence of the Effective Time, reasonably
requested by Parent to permit the consummation of the Available Financing
(provided that no such action shall be required of the Company Board prior to
the Effective Time), (vii) furnish Parent and any lenders involved with the
Available Financing, with all documentation and other information required by
any Governmental Authority with respect to such financing under

 



51  applicable "know your customer" and anti-money laundering rules and

of comfort letters (by delivering drafts thereof) when customarily required to
be delivered during the Marketing Period.

 

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries shall be required to take or permit the taking of any
action pursuant to this _Section 6.09_ that would (i) contravene any
applicable Law or require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to disclose
information subject to any attorney-client, attorney work product or other
legal privilege ( _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to allow for such access or disclosure to the maximum
extent that does not result in a loss of any such attorney-client, attorney
work product or other legal privilege), (ii) cause any covenant,
representation or warranty in this Agreement to be breached by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, (iii) require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
to pay any commitment or other fee or incur any other expense (except to the

Subsidiaries that is not continuing in such capacity after the Closing to
execute any certificate, document, instrument or agreement), or (vii)
interfere in any material respect with the conduct of the business of the
Company and its Subsidiaries. Nothing in this _Section 6.09_ or otherwise
shall require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, prior to the Closing, to
be an issuer or other obligor with respect to any of the Available Financing.
The Company hereby consents to the reasonable use of its and its Subsidiaries
logos in connection with the Available Financing; _provided_ , that such logos
shall be used solely in a manner that is not intended or reasonably likely to
harm, disparage or otherwise adversely affect the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries.

(c) Parent shall, promptly upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company
for all reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees,
but excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, the costs of the Companys
preparation of its annual and quarterly financing statements in the Ordinary
Course of Business) incurred by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
their respective Representatives in connection with such financing or pursuant
to this _Section 6.09_. In addition, Parent shall indemnify and hold
harmless the Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives
from and against any and all losses, damages, claims, costs or expenses

Subsidiaries pursuant to this _Section 6.09_ containing any untrue statement
of a material fact or omitting to state a material fact necessary in order to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading or (y) any fraud or intentional misrepresentation or
willful misconduct by any such persons.

 



52 (d) All non-public or otherwise confidential information regarding the Company
or its Subsidiaries obtained by Parent, Merger Sub, or any of their
respective Representatives pursuant to this _Section 6.09_ shall be kept
confidential in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement. Notwithstanding
the foregoing or anything to the contrary contained herein or in the
Confidentiality Agreement, Parent and the Company, as the parties to the
Confidentiality Agreement, hereby agree that the sharing of such confidential
information with, and the use of such information by, the Debt Financing
Sources shall be permitted subject to the terms set forth in the Debt
Commitment Letter so long as such information is disclosed subject to
customary confidentiality arrangements.

 

(e) The Company and its Subsidiaries shall use reasonable best efforts to
deliver all notices and take all other actions to facilitate the termination
at the Effective Time of all commitments in respect of the Existing Credit
Agreement, the repayment in full (or, in the case of letters of credit, the
cash collateralization) on the Closing Date of all obligations in respect of

shall relieve any Party from liability for any intentional and material breach
by such party of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements set forth in this Agreement prior to such termination.

 

 _Section 8.03_ _Termination Fees_.

 

(a) If this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section 8.01(e)_
or is terminated by the Parent or the Company pursuant to  _Section
8.01(b)(iii)_ if, at the time of such termination, Parent would have been
entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.01(e)_, then the
Company shall pay to Parent (or its designee) the Company Termination Fee by
wire transfer of same-day funds within two business days following the date of
such termination of this Agreement, in consideration for the disposition of
Parents rights under this Agreement.

 

(b) If this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to _Section
8.01(f)_, then the Company shall pay to Parent (or its designee) the Company
Termination Fee by wire transfer of same-day funds, concurrently with, and as
a condition to the effectiveness of, such termination of this Agreement, in
consideration for the disposition of Parents rights under this Agreement.

(c) If (i) after the execution and delivery of this Agreement, a Takeover
Proposal shall have been made to the Company Board or become publicly known
prior to the termination of this Agreement and not withdrawn, (ii) this
Agreement is terminated (A) by Parent or the Company pursuant to _Section

into a definitive agreement providing for any transaction contemplated by any
Takeover Proposal (regardless of when made), or consummates any Takeover
Proposal (regardless of when made), then, in any such case, the Company shall
pay to Parent (or its designee) the Company Termination Fee by wire transfer
of same-day funds on the date such transaction is consummated, in
consideration for the disposition of Parents and Parents rights under this
Agreement. Solely for purposes of this _Section 8.03(c)(iii)_, the term "

(d) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by (i) the Company pursuant

Parent shall pay or cause to be paid to the Company the Parent Termination Fee
by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account or accounts
designated in writing by the Company within five business days of such
termination.

(e) Each of the Company and Parent acknowledges and agrees that the agreements
contained in this  _Section 8.03_ are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, neither
the Company nor Parent would have entered into this Agreement; accordingly, if
the Company or Parent fails promptly to pay any amount due pursuant to
_Section 8.03_, and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent or the Company,
as applicable, commences a suit that results in an award against the Company
or Parent for such amount, the Company shall pay to Parent (or its designee)
Parents and Merger Subs, or Parent shall pay to the Company the Companys,
reasonable and documented costs and expenses (including attorneys fees and
expenses) in connection with such suit, together with interest on the
applicable amount from the date such payment was required to be made until the
date of payment at the prime lending rate as published in _The Wall Street
Journal_ in effect on the date 

 



57  such payment was required to be made. In no event shall the Company or
Parent be required to pay any termination amount on more than one occasion.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, (x)(A) if Parent
(or its designee) receives the Company Termination Fee from the Company
pursuant to _Section 8.03_, then any such payment shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy of Parent, any of its Subsidiaries, and any of their
respective former, current or future officers, employees, directors, partners,

equityholders, managers, members, attorneys, agents, advisors or other
Representatives (the " _Company Related Parties_ "), and none of the Company
Related Parties shall have any further liability or obligation, whether in
law, equity, contract, tort or otherwise, relating to or arising out of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, (B) if the Company
receives the Parent Termination Fee from Parent pursuant to _Section 8.03_,
then, without limiting _Section 10.11(b)_, any such payment shall be the sole
and exclusive remedy of the Company Related Parties against the Parent
Related Parties and none of the Parent Related Parties shall have any further
liability or obligation, whether in law, equity, contract, tort or otherwise,
relating to or arising out of this Agreement, the Financing Letters or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby (including in connection with any
breach of, or default under, this Agreement or the Financing Letters), or
(y)(A) if Parent (or its designee) receives any payments from the Company in
respect of any breach of this Agreement, and thereafter Parent (or its
designee) is entitled to receive the Company Termination Fee under _Section
8.03_, the amount of such Company Termination Fee shall be reduced by the
aggregate amount of any payments made by the Company to Parent (or its
designee) in respect of any such breaches of this Agreement, and (B) if the
Company receives any payments from Parent in respect of any breach of
this Agreement, and thereafter the Company is entitled to receive the Parent
Termination Fee under _Section 8.03_, the amount of such Parent Termination
Fee shall be reduced by the aggregate amount of any payments made by Parent to
the Company in respect of any such breaches of this Agreement.

(f) The Parent Termination Fee and the Company Termination Fee shall be deemed
to be liquidated damages for any and all losses or damages suffered or
incurred by the Company Related Parties or the Parent Related Parties, as the
case may be, in connection with this Agreement and the Financing Letters (and
the termination of any of the foregoing), the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby (and the abandonment thereof) or any matter forming the
basis for such termination (or for any breach or failure to perform hereunder,
thereunder or otherwise (in each case, whether willfully, intentionally,
unintentionally or otherwise)) and the Company Related Parties and the Parent
Related Parties shall not have any further liability, whether pursuant to a
claim in contract or tort, at law or in equity or otherwise, to the Parent
Related Parties or the Company Related Parties, as the case may be, under this
Agreement or the Financing Letters (and the termination of any of the
foregoing), the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby (and the
abandonment thereof) or any matter forming the basis for such termination (or
for any breach or failure to perform hereunder, thereunder or otherwise (in
each case, whether willfully, intentionally, unintentionally or otherwise)).

 

 _Section 8.04_ _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the Parties at
any time before or after the Closing shall have occurred or receipt of the
Shareholder Approval; _provided_ , _however_ , that after the Shareholder
Approval has been obtained, there shall be made no amendment that by Law
requires further approval by the shareholders of the Company without such
approval having been obtained. This Agreement may not be amended except by an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the Parties. In the event
that any Party seeks an amendment to or waiver of clause (x)(B) of the

written consent of each such party shall be required before any such amendment
or waiver may become effective.

herein. Any agreement on the part of a Party to any such extension or waiver

or Exhibit, such reference shall be to an Article or a Section of, or an
Annex or Exhibit to, this Agreement unless otherwise indicated.

(b) The table of contents, headings and index of defined terms contained in
this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way
the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

 

(c) Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in this
Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without
limitation." The word "will" shall be construed to have the same meaning and
effect of the word "shall." The words "hereof," "herein" and 

 



67  "hereunder" and words of similar import when used in this Agreement shall
refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this
Agreement. The word "extent" in the phrase "to the extent" shall mean the
degree to which a subject or other thing extends, and such phrase shall not
mean simply "if." The word "or" when used in this Agreement is not
exclusive. 

(d) The phrase "made available," when used in reference to anything made
available to Parent, Merger Sub or their Representatives shall be deemed to
mean that such item has been provided in writing (including via email or
posting to an electronic data site) to Parent, Merger Sub or their
Representatives prior to the execution and delivery of this Agreement. 

(e) The Parties have participated jointly in negotiating and drafting this
Agreement. In the event that an ambiguity or a question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed without regard to any
presumption or rule requiring construction or interpretation against the Party
drafting or causing any instrument to be drafted.

 

(f) References to a person are also to its permitted successors and assigns.
All terms defined in this Agreement shall have the defined meanings when used
in any certificate or other document made or delivered pursuant hereto unless
otherwise defined therein.

(g) All capitalized terms not defined in the Company Disclosure Letter or the
Parent Disclosure Letter shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this
Agreement. Any information set forth in one section or subsection of the
Company Disclosure Letter or Parent Disclosure Letter, as applicable, shall
be deemed to apply to and qualify the Section or subsection of this Agreement
to which it corresponds in number and each other Section or subsection of this
Agreement to the extent that it is reasonably apparent on its face that such
information is relevant to such other Section or subsection. No disclosure in
the Company Disclosure Letter or Parent Disclosure Letter, as applicable,
relating to any possible breach or violation of any contract or Law shall be
construed as an admission or indication that any such breach or violation
exists or has actually occurred.

(h) The definitions contained in this Agreement are applicable to the
singular as well as the plural forms of such terms and to the masculine as
well as to the feminine and neuter genders of such term.

 

(i) Any agreement, instrument or statute defined or referred to herein or in
any agreement or instrument that is referred to herein means such agreement,
instrument or statute as from time to time amended, modified or supplemented,
including (in the case of agreements or instruments) by waiver or consent and
(in the case of statutes) by succession of comparable successor statutes
and references to all attachments thereto and instruments incorporated
therein.

(j) Whenever this Agreement requires a Subsidiary of the Company to take any
action, such requirement shall be deemed to include an undertaking on the part
of the Company to cause such Subsidiary to take such action and, after the
Effective Time, on the part of Parent and the Surviving Corporation to cause
such Subsidiary to take such action. Whenever this Agreement requires Merger
Sub to take any action, such requirement shall be deemed to include an
undertaking on the part of Parent to cause Merger Sub to take such action.

_Section 10.04_ _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, together with the
Confidentiality Agreement, constitute the entire agreement, and supersede all
prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the Parties
with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and the Confidentiality
Agreement.

 

 _Section 10.05_ _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Except for (a) the
provisions of _Section 6.06_ and  _Section 10.13_, (b) the rights, at and
after the Effective Time, of the former holders of shares of Company Common
Stock to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, (c) those third party beneficiary rights of the
Company specified in the Equity Commitment Letter and (d) the rights, at and
after the Effective Time, of the holders of the Company Equity Awards to
receive the payments contemplated by  _Section 2.04_, neither this Agreement
nor any other agreement contemplated hereby are intended to or shall confer
upon any person other than the Parties hereto and thereto any legal or
equitable rights or remedies. The representations and warranties in this
Agreement are the product of negotiations among the Parties and are for the
sole benefit of the Parties. Any inaccuracies in such representations and
warranties are subject to waiver by the Parties in accordance with  _Section
8.05_ without notice or liability to any other person. The representations and
warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation among the Parties of
risks associated with particular matters. Notwithstanding anything in
the foregoing to the contrary, each Financing Source is an express third-
party beneficiary of clause (x)(B) of the third sentence of _Section 8.03(e)_
(Termination Fees), _Section 8.04_ (Amendment), _Section 10.04_
(Entire Agreement), this _Section 10.05_ (No Third-Party Beneficiaries),
Section 10.06 (Assignment), _Section 10.07_ (GOVERNING LAW), _Section 10.08_
(Jurisdiction; Service of Process), _Section 10.09_ (WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL)
and _Section 10.11_ (Non-Recourse to Non-Parties) and may enforce such
sections directly.

_Section 10.06_  _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by
operation of law or otherwise by any of the Parties without the prior written
consent of the other Parties, and any assignment without such consent shall
be null and void; _provided_ , _however_ , that, prior to the Closing, Parent
and Merger Sub may assign this Agreement (in whole but not in part) to Parent
or any of its Affiliates and/or to the Debt Financing Sources (including for
purposes of creating a security interest herein or otherwise assign as
collateral in respect of such Debt Financing) so long as such assignment would
not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. No
assignment by any Party shall relieve such Party of any of its obligations
hereunder. Subject to the immediately preceding sentences, this Agreement will
be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the Parties
and their respective successors and assigns.

 



70 _Section 10.07_ _GOVERNING LAW_. SUBJECT TO THE TERMS OF THE DEBT
COMMITMENT LETTER AND THE EQUITY COMMITMENT LETTER RELATING TO THE
APPLICATION OF NEW YORK LAW (TO THE EXTENT SET FORTH THEREIN ON THE DATE
HEREOF), THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY LITIGATION (WHETHER AT LAW, IN CONTRACT OR IN
TORT) THAT MAY BE DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY BASED UPON, RELATING TO ARISING OUT
OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY TRANSACTION CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, OR THE NEGOTIATION,
EXECUTION OR PERFORMANCE HEREOF OR THEREOF, SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND
CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF MINNESOTA, REGARDLESS
OF THE LAWS THAT MIGHT OTHERWISE GOVERN UNDER APPLICABLE PRINCIPLES OF
CONFLICTS OF LAWS THEREOF. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY, ANY RIGHT
OR OBLIGATION WITH RESPECT TO ANY DEBT FINANCING SOURCE, THE AVAILABLE
FINANCING, THE DEBT COMMITMENT LETTER, EQUITY INVESTOR, EQUITY COMMITMENT
LETTER AND THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY AND THEREBY, AND ANY
LITIGATION RELATING THERETO OR ARISING THEREUNDER, SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND
CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK WITHOUT GIVING
EFFECT TO ANY CHOICE OF LAW OR CONFLICT OF LAW RULES AND PROVISIONS.

_Section 10.08_  _Jurisdiction; Service of Process_.

(a) Each of the Parties irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of
the state and federal courts located in Hennepin County, Minnesota for the
purpose of any Litigation directly or indirectly based upon, relating to
arising out of this Agreement or any transaction contemplated hereby or the
negotiation, execution or performance hereof or thereof, and each of the
Parties hereby irrevocably agrees that all claims in respect to such
Litigation shall be brought in, and may be heard and determined, exclusively
in such state or federal courts. Each of the Parties irrevocably
and unconditionally waives any objection to the laying of venue in, and any
defense of inconvenient forum to the maintenance of, any Litigation so
brought. Each of the Parties agrees that a final judgment in any Litigation
shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the
judgment or in any other manner provided by Law.

(b) Each of the Parties irrevocably consents to the service of the summons
and complaint and any other process in any other Litigation relating to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, on behalf of itself or its
property, by personal delivery of copies of such process to such Party at the
addresses set forth in _Section 10.03_. Nothing in this _Section 10.08_
shall affect the right of any Party to serve legal process in any other manner
permitted by Law.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, each Party acknowledges
and irrevocably agrees (i) that any Litigation, whether in contract or tort,
at law or in equity or otherwise, involving any Financing Source arising out
of, or relating to, the transactions contemplated hereby, the Financing
Letters, the Financing or the performance of services thereunder or
related thereto shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Supreme
Court of the State of New York sitting in the Borough of Manhattan in the City
of New York, or if under applicable Law exclusive jurisdiction is vested in
the federal courts, the United States District Court for the Southern
District of New York (and the appellate courts thereof) and each Party submits
for itself and its property with respect to any such Litigation to the
exclusive jurisdiction of such court and agrees not to bring (or permit any
of its Affiliates to bring or support anyone else in bringing) any such
Litigation in any other court, (ii) to waive and hereby waives, to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable Law, any objection which it may now
or hereafter have to the laying of venue of, and the defense of an
inconvenient forum to the maintenance of, any such Litigation in any such
court and (iii) that a final judgment in any such Litigation shall be
conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment
or in any other manner provided by applicable Law.

 



71 _Section 10.09_ _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES
THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO
INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A
TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY BASED UPON, RELATING
TO ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY TRANSACTION OR AGREEMENT CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY (INCLUDING THE FINANCING AND THE FINANCING LETTERS OR AGAINST ANY
FINANCING SOURCE) OR THE NEGOTIATION, EXECUTION OR PERFORMANCE HEREOF OR
THEREOF. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE,
AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE,
THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE
THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (II) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE
IMPLICATION OF THIS WAIVER, (III) EACH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND
(IV) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER
THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION.

_Section 10.10_ _Specific Performance_.

 

(a) The Parties acknowledge and agree that, subject to the provisions of this
_Section 10.10_, irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the
provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached, and that monetary damages, even if
available, would not be an adequate remedy therefor and therefore
fully intend for specific performance to be an available remedy for breaches
of this Agreement. It is accordingly agreed that, prior to the termination of
this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.01_, each Party shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically the performance of terms and provisions of this Agreement
in any court referred to in _Section 10.08_, without proof of actual damages,
this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at Law
or in equity; _provided_ , that the Company shall only be entitled to enforce
or seek to enforce specifically Parents obligation to cause all or any
portion of the Equity Financing to be funded (whether under this Agreement or
the Equity Commitment Letter) or otherwise cause Parent or Merger Sub to
consummate the Merger (including the obligation to pay the aggregate Merger
Consideration) if: (i) the conditions set forth in  _Section 7.01_ and
_Section 7.02_ have been satisfied and remain satisfied at the time when the
Closing would have occurred but for the failure of the Financing to be funded
(other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the
Closing but which are then capable of being satisfied at the Closing), (ii)
the Debt Financing is available to be funded at the Closing and has been
funded or will be funded if the Equity Financing is funded, (iii) the Company
has irrevocably confirmed to Parent in writing that if specific performance is
granted and the Financing is funded, then the Closing will occur and (iv)
Parent and Merger Sub have failed to consummate the Merger by the date the
Merger is required to have occurred pursuant to _Section 1.02_. For the
avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the Company be entitled to specific
performance to cause all or any portion of the Equity Financing to be
funded (whether under this Agreement or the Equity Commitment Letter) or
cause Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated hereby (including the obligation to pay the Merger Consideration)
if the Debt Financing has not been funded or will not be funded at the
Closing even if the Equity Financing is funded at the Closing.

(b) The Parties further agree not to assert that a remedy of specific
enforcement is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to Law or inequitable for any
reason, nor to object to a remedy of specific performance on the basis that a
remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy for any such
breach. Each Party further acknowledges and agrees that the agreements
contained in this _Section 10.10_ are an integral part of the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby and that, without these agreements,
neither the Company nor Parent would have entered into this Agreement. Each

 



72  Party further agrees that no other Party or any other person shall be
required to obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar instrument in
connection with or as a condition to obtaining any remedy referred to in this
_Section 10.10_, and each Party hereto irrevocably waives any right it may
have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or
similar instrument.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, while the
Company may seek (i) specific performance, subject in all respects to this
_Section 10.10_, and (ii) payment of the Parent Termination Fee, if, as and
when payable pursuant to _Section 8.03(d)_, under no circumstances shall the
Company, directly or indirectly, be permitted or entitled to receive (A) both
a grant of specific performance or other equitable relief pursuant to which
the Merger is actually consummated and the aggregate Merger Consideration is
actually received, on the one hand, and payment of any monetary damages
whatsoever or the payment of all or a portion of the Parent Termination Fee,
on the other hand, or (B) both payment of any monetary damages, on the one
hand, and payment of all or any portion of the Parent Termination Fee, on the
other hand (except to the extent the amounts of such payments actually
received by the Company from all such payments do not exceed the amount of the
Parent Termination Fee).

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the maximum
aggregate liability of Parent and Merger Sub for monetary damages or other
monetary remedies in connection with this Agreement (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, under _Section 8.02_, _Section 8.03_ or _Section
10.10(c)_), the Equity Commitment Letter and/or the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby shall be limited to an amount equal to the Parent
Termination Fee, and in no event shall any Company Related Party seek or
obtain, nor shall it permit any of its Representatives or any other person on
its or their behalf to seek or obtain, any monetary recovery or monetary
award or any monetary damages of any kind against Parent and Merger Sub in
excess of an amount equal to the Parent Termination Fee.

 

 _Section 10.11_ _Non-Recourse to Non-Parties_.

 

(a) Without limiting any of the express terms or conditions of this Agreement
or any of the Financing Agreements, each Party agrees, on behalf of itself
and its Affiliates and Representatives, that all proceedings, claims,
obligations, liabilities or causes of action (whether in Contract or in tort,
in Law or in equity or otherwise, or granted by statute or otherwise, whether
by or through attempted piercing of the corporate, limited partnership or
limited liability company veil or any other theory or doctrine, including
alter ego or otherwise) that may be based upon, in respect of, arise under,
out or by reason of, be connected with, or relate to: (A) this Agreement or
any other agreement referenced herein or the transactions contemplated
hereunder (including any financing obtained in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement), (B) the negotiation, execution
or performance of this Agreement or any other agreement referenced herein
(including any representation or warranty made in, in connection with, or as
an inducement to, this Agreement or such other agreement), (C) any breach or
violation of this Agreement or any other agreement referenced herein and (D)
any failure of the transactions contemplated hereunder or any other agreement
referenced herein (including any agreement in respect of financing obtained
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) to be
consummated, in each case, may be made only against (and are those solely of)
the persons that are expressly identified herein as a Party to this Agreement
(or a party to any such other agreement referenced herein or contemplated
hereunder) and, in accordance with, and subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement (or the terms of any such other agreement referenced herein or
contemplated hereunder).

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, but subject (as
it relates to any Equity Financing Source) to the express terms of the Equity
Commitment Letter, the Company (on behalf of itself and the Company Related
Parties) (i) hereby waives any claims or rights

 



73  against any Financing Source relating to or arising out of this Agreement,
the Available Financing, the Financing Letters and the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby, whether at law or in equity and whether in
tort, contract or otherwise, (ii) hereby agrees not to bring or support any
suit, action or proceeding against any Financing Source in connection with
this Agreement, the Available Financing, the Financing Letters and the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, whether at law or in equity and
whether in tort, contract or otherwise, and (iii) hereby agrees to cause any
suit, action or proceeding asserted against any Financing Source by or on
behalf of the Company Related Parties in connection with this Agreement, the
Available Financing, the Financing Letters and the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby to be dismissed or otherwise terminated. In furtherance and
not in limitation of the foregoing waivers and agreements, it is acknowledged
and agreed that no Financing Source shall have any liability for any claims or
damages to the Company in connection with this Agreement, the Available
Financing, the Financing Letters and the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no Financing
Source shall be responsible for any indirect, incidental, special, punitive,
exemplary or consequential damages in connection with this Agreement, the
Available Financing, the Financing Letters and the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby.

 

 _Section 10.12_ _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this
Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of
law or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement
shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or
legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in
any manner adverse to any Party. Upon such determination that any term or
other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect
the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable Law in a mutually acceptable manner.

 

 _Section 10.13_ _Legal Representation_. In any Litigation arising under or
in connection with this Agreement, each member of the Company Board shall
have the right, at his or her election, to retain the firm of Faegre Baker
Daniels LLP to represent the Company Board or any of its members in such
matter, and each party hereto, for itself, its Affiliates and its and
their respective successors and assigns, hereby irrevocably waives and
consents to any such representation in any such matter and the communication
by such counsel to the Company Board or any of its members in connection with
any such representation of any fact known to such counsel arising by reason
of such counsels prior representation of the Company or the Company Board.
Each party hereto, for itself, its Affiliates and its and their respective
successors and assigns, irrevocably acknowledges and agrees that all
communications between the Company Board and counsel, including Faegre Baker
Daniels LLP, made in connection with the negotiation, preparation, execution,
delivery and closing under, or any Litigation arising under or in connection
with, this Agreement which, immediately prior to the Closing, would be deemed
to be privileged communications of the Company Board and its counsel shall
continue after the Closing to be privileged communications between the
Company Board and such counsel. Each member of the Company Board and Faegre
Baker Daniels LLP are entitled to rely upon this _Section 10.13_.

 

 _Section 10.14_ _Counterparts; Facsimile and Electronic Signatures_. This
Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, all of which shall be
considered one and the same agreement and shall become effective when one or
more counterparts have been signed by each of the Parties and delivered to the
other Parties. This Agreement or any counterpart may be executed and
delivered by facsimile copies or delivered by electronic communications by
portable document format (.pdf), each of which shall be deemed an original.
