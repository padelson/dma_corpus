plus (ii) the Closing Cash, plus or minus, as applicable, (iii) the amount

applicable, (iii) the amount determined pursuant to Section 2.3(a) based on

Purchase Price"), by making the following disbursements in cash (items (D) and

Working Capital is greater than the top of the Target Working Capital Range,
the Purchase Price payable at the Closing will be increased by the amount of
such excess, subject to further adjustment after the Closing as provided in

accordance with the principles set forth on Schedule 2.3(a), and (ii) the
Closing Cash (the "Final Closing Cash"). If Purchaser does not deliver a
Closing Statement within such sixty (60)-day period, then the Estimated
Closing Working Capital and the Estimated Closing Cash delivered by Seller
prior to Closing will, at the option of Seller, be final, conclusive and
binding on the parties.

 

(c)Dispute. Within thirty (30) days following receipt by Seller of the
Closing Statement, Seller shall deliver written notice to Purchaser if Seller
disputes any of the Closing Statement. If Seller does not notify Purchaser of
a dispute with respect to the Closing Statement within such thirty (30)-day
period, such Closing Statement will be final, conclusive and binding on the
parties. In the event of a notification of such dispute, Purchaser and Seller
shall negotiate in good faith to resolve such dispute. If Purchaser and

within thirty (30) days after Seller advises Purchaser of its objections, then
Purchaser and Seller jointly shall engage Ernst and Young, provided that if
Ernst and Young is not willing or unable to accept such engagement, then
Purchaser and Seller shall jointly engage another nationally or regionally
recognized accounting firm that is not presently providing and has not
provided either party or their Affiliates with services in the last two (2)

to resolve such dispute. As promptly as practicable thereafter, Purchaser and
Seller shall each prepare and submit a presentation to the Accounting Firm.
As soon as practicable thereafter,

   

Purchaser and Seller shall cause the Accounting Firm to choose one of the
parties' positions based solely upon the presentations by Purchaser and
Seller. The party whose position is not accepted by the Accounting Firm shall
be responsible for all of the fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm. All
determinations made by the Accounting Firm will be final, conclusive and
binding on the parties.

 

(d)Access. For purposes of complying with the terms set forth in this Section

and their respective representatives all information, records, data and
working papers, and shall permit access to its facilities and personnel, as
may be reasonably required in connection with the preparation and analysis of
the Closing Statement and the resolution of any disputes thereunder.

 

(e)Adjustment. Within five (5) Business Days after the date on which the
Final Closing Working Capital and the Final Closing Cash are finally
determined pursuant to Section 2.3(c), Seller and Purchaser shall jointly
determine the amount by which the Purchase Price would have been adjusted
pursuant to Section 2.3(a) had the Final Closing Working Capital and the Final
Closing Cash (as finally determined pursuant to Section 2.3(c)) been
substituted for the Estimated Closing Working Capital and the Estimated
Closing Cash, respectively, as of the Closing.

 

(i)If such substitutions would have resulted in a Purchase Price (the
"Adjusted Purchase Price") that is less than the Purchase Price that was paid
on the Closing Date, then Seller and Purchaser shall deliver a joint written
authorization to the Escrow Agent within two (2) Business Days from the date
on which the Final Closing Working Capital and the Final Closing Cash are
finally determined, authorizing the Escrow Agent to release from the Working
Capital Escrow Account (i) to Purchaser an amount in cash equal to such
shortfall and (ii) to Seller the remainder, if any, of the funds in the
Working Capital Escrow Account; provided that if the Working Capital Escrow
Account is reduced to zero ($0) and an amount remains outstanding to Purchaser
under this Section 2.3(e), then the Seller and Purchaser shall deliver a joint
written authorization to the Escrow Agent to release from the Indemnity Escrow
Account the amount of such remaining obligation. The amount payable to
Purchaser after the Closing pursuant to this Section 2.3 shall be limited
solely to the available funds in the Working Capital Escrow Account and, if
applicable, the Indemnity Escrow Account.

 

(ii)If the Adjusted Purchase Price is greater than the Purchase Price that was
paid on the Closing Date, then, within two (2) Business Days from the date on
which the Final Closing Working Capital and the Final Closing Cash are finally
determined, (i) Purchaser shall pay, or cause to be paid, to Seller an amount
in cash equal to such excess by wire transfer of immediately available funds
to an account or accounts designated in writing by Seller to Purchaser prior
to the date such payment is due hereunder, and (ii) Seller and Purchaser shall
deliver a joint written authorization to the Escrow

   

Agent authorizing the Escrow Agent to release to Seller all of funds in the
Working Capital Escrow Account.

paid on the Closing Date, there will be no adjustment to the Purchase Price
pursuant to this Section 2.3(e).

improvements included as part of, or located on or at, the Real Property are

(including, zoning regulations or ordinances). To the Knowledge of the
Companies, the buildings, plants, facilities, installations, fixtures and
other structures or improvements themselves

Property, are not in material violation of, or in material conflict with, any
applicable Law (including, zoning regulations or ordinances without any

moratorium, reorganization or similar laws in effect which affect the
enforcement of creditors' rights generally and by limitations on the
availability of equitable remedies and by equitable principles. There exist
no material defaults on the part of any Latisys Company under any Real Estate
Lease nor any state of facts which, upon notice or lapse of time, or both,
would constitute a material default under any Real Property Lease or, in
either case, that would give the other party thereto the right to terminate
such Real Property Lease as a result of such default. Except for (i) customer
agreements entered into in the Ordinary Course of Business and (ii) the
agreements set forth on Schedule 4.18(c) hereto, no Latisys Company has

hereof and as of the Closing Date:

 

6.1Organization and Good Standing. Purchaser is a limited liability company
duly formed, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State
of Delaware and has all requisite limited liability company power and
authority to own, lease and operate its properties and carry on its business.

(a)The execution and delivery by Purchaser of this Agreement or the Purchaser
Documents does not, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated

   

hereby or thereby, or compliance by Purchaser with any of the provisions

provision of (i) the certificate of formation or operating agreement of
Purchaser; (ii) any Contract or Permit to which Purchaser is a party or by
which any of the properties or assets of Purchaser are bound; (iii) any Order

Documents or the compliance by Purchaser with any of the provisions hereof or

thereby, except for (i) compliance with the applicable requirements of the HSR
Act and (ii) such Consents, Orders or Permits that, if not obtained, would not
have a material and adverse effect on Purchaser's ability to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby.

 

6.4Investment Intention. Purchaser is acquiring the Companies pursuant to the
Share Sale for its own account, for investment purposes only and not with a
view to the distribution (as such term is used in Section 2(11) of the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act") of the Companies'
capital securities. Purchaser understands that the Common Stock has not been
registered under the Securities Act and cannot be sold under the Securities
Act unless subsequently registered under the Securities Act or an exemption
from such registration is available. Purchaser has such knowledge and
experience in financial and business matters and investments in general that
make it capable of evaluating the merits and risks of this Agreement.
Purchaser acknowledges that it has been afforded: (a) the opportunity to ask
such questions as it has deemed necessary of, and to receive answers from,
representatives of the Latisys Companies concerning the merits and risks of
investing in the Latisys Companies; (b) access to information about the
Latisys Companies, its results of operations, financial condition and cash
flow, and its businesses generally, in each case sufficient to Purchaser's
satisfaction to enable Purchaser to evaluate whether or not to proceed with
the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby; and (c) the opportunity to obtain such
additional information that Purchaser believes is necessary to make an
informed investment decision with respect to the execution and delivery of
this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.
Purchaser is an "accredited investor" within the meaning of Regulation D
promulgated under the Securities Act.

 

6.5Financial Advisors. Except as set forth on Schedule 6.5 hereto, no Person
has acted, directly or indirectly, as a broker, finder or financial advisor
for Purchaser in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and no Person is entitled to any fee or commission or like payment
in respect thereof.

 

6.6Financing. Attached hereto as Exhibit B is a true, correct and complete
copies, as of the date of this Agreement, of an executed commitment letter
(the "Debt Commitment Letter"), pursuant to which the lenders party thereto
(collectively, the

   

"Lenders") have committed, subject to the terms and conditions set forth
therein, debt financing in the amounts set forth therein for the purposes of
financing the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and related fees
(being collectively referred to as the "Debt Financing"). The Debt Commitment
Letter has not been amended or modified prior to the date of this Agreement
and as of the date of this Agreement, no such amendment or modification is
contemplated (other than amendments or modifications that are permitted by
Section 7.12), and as of the date of this Agreement, the respective
obligations and commitments contained in the Debt Commitment Letter have not
been withdrawn or rescinded in any respect. Except for fee letters and
engagement letters with respect to the Debt Financing, as of the date hereof,
there are no side letters or agreements (whether written or oral) to which
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates is a party related to the funding or
investing, as applicable, of the Debt Financing that could affect the
availability of the Debt Financing, or which include conditions precedent to
the obligations of the parties thereunder, other than as expressly set forth
in the Debt Commitment Letter. Purchaser has fully paid or caused to be fully
paid any and all commitment fees or other fees in connection with the Debt
Commitment Letter that are payable on or prior to the date hereof, and as of
the date hereof, the Debt Commitment Letter is in full force and effect and is
the legal, valid, binding and enforceable obligation of Purchaser, and, to the
Knowledge of Purchaser, each of the other parties thereto. There are no
conditions precedent or other contingencies related to the funding of the full
amount of the Debt Financing, other than as expressly set forth in the Debt
Commitment Letter. As of the date hereof, no event has occurred which, with
or without notice, lapse of time or both, would reasonably be expected to
constitute a default or breach on the part of Purchaser or, to the Knowledge
of Purchaser, any other party thereto under the Debt Commitment Letter. As of
the date hereof, Purchaser has no reason to believe that any of the conditions
to the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter applicable to
it will not be satisfied. Assuming the Debt Financing is funded in accordance
with the Debt Commitment Letter, Purchaser, in the aggregate and together with
the available cash and cash equivalents of Purchaser, has as of the date
hereof, and will have at and after the Closing funds sufficient to (i) pay the
Purchase Price, (ii) finance the repayment or refinancing of debt contemplated
by this Agreement or the Debt Commitment Letter, (iii) pay any and all fees
and expenses required to be paid by Purchaser in connection with the Share
Sale and the Debt Financing, and (iv) satisfy all of the other payment
obligations of Purchaser contemplated hereunder.

 

6.7Informed Decision. Purchaser (i) has conducted its own independent review
and analysis of, and, based thereon, has formed an independent judgment
concerning, the business, assets, condition, operations and prospects of the
Latisys Companies, and (ii) has been furnished with or given access to such
documents and information about the Latisys Companies and their respective
businesses and operations as it and its representatives and advisors have
deemed necessary to enable it to make an informed decision with respect to the
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby. Purchaser has received all materials relating to the
business of the Latisys Companies that it has requested and has been afforded
the opportunity to obtain any additional information necessary to verify the
accuracy of any such information or to otherwise evaluate the merits of the
transactions contemplated hereby. Seller and the Companies have answered to
Purchaser's

   

satisfaction all inquiries that Purchaser and its representatives and advisors
have made concerning the business of the Latisys Companies or otherwise
relating to the transactions contemplated hereby. Purchaser acknowledges that
any announcement by Seller of its intention to sell the Companies (as well as
the execution of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby) might affect one or more of the customer relationships of
the Latisys Companies, and that such effects do not and will not constitute a
breach of any of the Companies' representations and warranties in Article IV.

 

6.8Litigation. There is no legal, administrative arbitral or other proceeding
by or before any Governmental Body or, to the knowledge of Purchaser,
threatened against Purchaser, nor to the knowledge of Purchaser is there any
pending investigation by any Governmental Body, which would give any third
party the right to enjoin or rescind the transactions contemplated hereby or
otherwise prevent Purchaser from complying with the terms and provision of
this Agreement. Purchaser shall promptly notify Seller if any change, event
or condition arises or occurs after the date hereof that would have made the
foregoing representation untrue had such change, event or condition arisen or
occurred on or prior to the date hereof or that could possibly materially
delay the Closing.

Company (collectively, the "DandO Indemnitees") with respect to all acts or
omissions by them in their capacities as such, or taken at the request of a
Latisys Company, at any time prior to the Closing Date. Purchaser agrees that
all rights of the DandO Indemnitees to indemnification and exculpation from
liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Closing Date as
provided in the respective certificate of incorporation or by-laws or
comparable organizational documents of any Latisys Company as now in effect,
and any indemnification agreements or arrangements of each Latisys Company
shall survive the Closing Date and shall continue in full force and effect in
accordance with their terms. Such rights shall not be amended, or otherwise
modified in any manner that would adversely affect the rights of the DandO
Indemnitees, unless such modification is required by Law. 

 

(b)From and after the Closing Date, the Latisys Companies shall cause the
certificate of incorporation and by-laws or comparable organizational
documents of the Latisys Companies to not be amended, repealed or otherwise
modified in a manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of the

those persons who are currently covered by any Latisys Companies' directors'
and officers' liability insurance policy on terms with respect to such

officers currently covered by such insurance than those of such policy in
effect on the date hereof.

 

(d)The provisions of this Section 7.6: (i) are for the benefit of, and shall
be enforceable by, each DandO Indemnitee, his or her heirs and his or her
representatives; and (ii) are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any
other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such person may have
by Contract or otherwise. The DandO Indemnitees to whom this Section 7.6

consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not the continuing or
surviving Person of such consolidation or merger; or (ii) transfers or conveys
all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and
in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of Purchaser shall assume all of the obligations thereof set forth in
this Section 7.6.

   

(f)The obligations of Purchaser under this Section 7.6 shall not be terminated
or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any DandO Indemnitee to whom
this Section 7.6 applies without the consent of the affected DandO Indemnitee.

 

7.7Public Announcements. Between the date of this Agreement and the Closing
Date, except to the extent required by Law or the rules of the NYSE, none of
the Companies, Purchaser, or Seller shall issue, or cause to be issued, any
press release or public announcement of any kind concerning the transactions
contemplated hereby without the consent of the other parties hereto (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); and in
the event any such press release, public announcement or other disclosure is
required by Law or the rules of the NYSE, the parties will consult prior to
the making thereof and use their best efforts to agree upon a mutually
satisfactory text.

 

7.8Access and Information.

 

(a)From the date of this Agreement until the Closing, subject to Section 7.1
and to reasonable rules, regulations and policies of Seller and any applicable
Laws, Seller shall (i) afford Purchaser and its representatives reasonable
access, during regular business hours and upon reasonable advance notice to
Seller, to the Latisys Companies and to the employees reasonably requested by
Purchaser or as specified by Seller in connection with each such visit;
provided, however, access to such employees will only be available upon
reasonable notice to Seller to the attention of both Peter Stevenson and
Douglas Butler and at such times and places as they shall determine in their
reasonable discretion. Any access shall be conducted (i) under the
supervision of Seller's or its Affiliate's personnel, (ii) subject to all of
the standard protocols and procedures of the Latisys Companies, including the
requirement that visitors be escorted at all times, (iii) subject to any
additional procedures required by any landlord, and (iv) in such a manner as
does not unreasonably interfere with the normal operations of the Latisys
Companies. All such access shall be at the risk of Purchaser and its
representatives and agents, and in connection therewith, Purchaser hereby
agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Seller Indemnified Parties with respect
to any Losses resulting from or arising out of such access.

 

(b)Following the Closing and until any applicable statute of limitations
(including periods of waiver) has run, Purchaser agrees to retain all Books
and Records in existence on the Closing Date and to grant to Seller and its
representatives during regular business hours and upon reasonable advance
notice to Purchaser, the right, at the expense of Seller, (i) to inspect and
copy the Books and Records and (ii) to have personnel of Purchaser made
available to them or to otherwise cooperate to the extent reasonably requested
by Seller, including in connection with (A) preparing and filing Tax returns
and/or any Tax inquiry, audit, investigation or dispute, or (B) any
litigation, audit, dispute, claim or investigation. No Books and Records
shall be destroyed by Purchaser without first advising Seller in writing and
giving Seller a reasonable opportunity to obtain possession thereof at
Seller's expense.

   

7.9Tax Matters.

 

(a)Preparation and Filing of Tax Returns.

 

(i)Between the date hereof and the Closing Date, the Seller shall prepare or
cause to be prepared on a timely basis and in a manner consistent with past
practice and file or cause to be filed on a timely basis all Tax Returns for
the Companies for taxable periods that are required to be filed on or before
the Closing Date. With respect to consolidated, unitary, combined or similar
Tax Returns (the "Consolidated Tax Returns") that include the Latisys
Companies for the period through the Closing Date, and with respect to any
other Tax Returns for a Latisys Company for any period that ends prior to the
Closing Date and that is not described in the preceding sentence, the Seller
shall prepare on a timely basis and in a manner consistent with past practice
such Tax Returns and, to extent required by the Code and the Treasury
Regulations, include the income of the Latisys Companies that is allocable to
the taxable period that is deemed to end as of Closing, and such Tax Returns
shall be executed and filed by Seller if the filing date is on or before the
Closing Date and executed by Purchaser if the filing date is after the Closing
Date. 

 

(ii)Except as provided in Section 7.9(a)(i), Purchaser shall prepare or cause
to be prepared and file or cause to be filed on a timely basis all Tax Returns
with respect to the Latisys Companies that are not described in Section
7.9(a)(i) as being prepared and filed by the Latisys Companies or the Seller,
as applicable.

 

(iii)With respect to any Tax Return required to be prepared or caused to be
prepared by the Seller or Purchaser pursuant to Section 7.9(a)(i) and (ii)
with respect to the Latisys Companies (such party, the "Filing Party") and as
to which either Seller is the Filing Party or an amount of Tax is allocable to
Seller, the Filing Party shall provide the party that is not the Filing Party
(the "Non-Filing Party") with a draft of such completed Tax Return or in the
case of a Consolidated Tax Return, a pro forma Tax Return for the Latisys
Companies (prepared on a separate company basis) and a statement certifying
and setting forth the calculation of the amount of Tax shown on such Tax
Return or Consolidated Tax Return that is allocable to such Non-Filing Party,
together with appropriate supporting information and schedules at least thirty
(30) Business Days prior to the due date (including any extension thereof) for
the filing of such Tax Return or Consolidated Tax Return, as the case may be,
and such Non-Filing Party shall have the right to review and comment on such
Tax Return or Consolidated Tax Return and statement, as the case may be, prior
to the filing of such Tax Return or Consolidated Tax Return and shall provide
to the Filing Party written notice of any objections it has with respect to
such Tax Return or Consolidated Tax Return (a "Tax Dispute") no later than
fifteen (15) Business Days prior to the date when such Tax Return or
Consolidated Tax Return must be filed. In the event of any such objections
the parties shall in

   

good faith attempt to resolve such dispute for a period of five (5) Business
Days following the date on which the Filing Party was notified of the Tax
Dispute; provided, that if such dispute is not settled by such date (the "Tax
Dispute Date") the parties shall submit all such disputed matters to the
Accounting Firm, within one (1) Business Day after the Tax Dispute Date. The
decision by the Accounting Firm shall be final and binding on the parties with
respect to how any such Tax Return or Consolidated Tax Return should be filed.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the fees and
expenses relating to the Accounting Firm pursuant to this Section 7.9(a)(iii)
shall be paid one-half by Purchaser and one-half by the Seller.

 

(iv)The Purchaser shall not make any election under Code Section 338 (or any
similar provision under state, local, or foreign law) with respect to the
acquisition of the Companies and their Affiliates.

 

(b)Tax Refunds.

 

(i)Subject to paragraph (ii), below, rights and benefits relating to all
credits or refunds of Tax liabilities of the Latisys Companies no matter how
secured (including credits for overpayment of estimated Taxes) arising from or
relating to any taxable period (or portion thereof) ending on or prior to the
Closing Date shall remain with and be for the benefit of the Seller, and
Purchaser shall pay to the Seller within five (5) days of receipt by
Purchaser, any Latisys Company or any Affiliate of any of the foregoing the
amount of any such Tax refund or credit against Taxes plus any overpayment
interest accruing from the date the corresponding Tax liability was paid but
only to the extent that such refund or credit was not reflected on the Closing
Statement. Upon a reasonable request from the Seller, Purchaser shall
cooperate, and cause the Latisys Companies to cooperate, in filing amended Tax
Returns to obtain a refund or credit that the Seller is entitled to pursuant
to this Section 7.9(b), provided that Purchaser shall not be required to file
a request for any refund of Taxes (or any amended Tax Return) if such refund
could reasonably be expected to materially adversely affect the Purchaser, or
any Latisys Company (or any of their respective Affiliates) in any Tax period
commencing on or after the Closing Date.

 

(ii)Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, Purchaser
and Seller agree that the Companies may carry back any post-closing net
operating loss, post-closing loss from operations or any other post-closing
Tax attribute of the Companies to any taxable year that ends on or prior to
the Closing Date and Purchaser shall be entitled to receive any refund of
Taxes resulting from the carry back of such post-closing Tax attributes;
provided, however, that Purchaser must first agree that it will indemnify and
hold harmless the Seller against any Damages or liabilities for Taxes and
expenses related thereto that are attributable to, or result or arise from,
any such carry back.

   

(c)Consolidated Tax Return Claims. Notwithstanding any other provision in
this Agreement to the contrary, the Seller and its Affiliates shall control
the conduct of any notice of deficiency, proposed adjustment, assessment,
audit, examination or other administrative or court proceeding, suit, dispute
or other claim involving a Consolidated Tax Return for periods on or before,
and including the Closing Date, that includes the Latisys Companies, and the
Seller shall have sole discretion in administering any such claims including
the right to settle such claims, provided that Purchaser has consented to the
terms of such settlement, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. Seller shall keep Purchaser fully informed of the
events that occur in any such proceeding. The Purchaser and its Affiliates
shall control the conduct of any notice of deficiency, proposed adjustment,
assessment, audit, examination or other administrative or court proceeding,
suit, dispute or other claim involving a Consolidated Tax Return for periods
beginning after the Closing Date, that includes the Latisys Companies, and the
Purchaser shall have sole discretion in administering any such claims
including the right to settle such claims, except that Purchaser shall not
settle any such claim for which Seller may be responsible in whole or in part
under applicable law or under this Agreement without Seller's prior written
consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed. Purchaser shall keep Seller fully informed of the events that occur
in any such proceeding if the proceeding could result in liability for Seller
under applicable Law or under this Agreement.

 

(d)Cooperation and Controversies. The Purchaser and the Seller shall
reasonably cooperate, and shall cause their respective Affiliates, agents,
auditors, representatives, officers and employees reasonably to cooperate, in
preparing and filing all Tax Returns (including amended returns and claims for
refund), including maintaining and making available to each other all records
necessary in connection with Taxes and with respect to any claim with respect
to the Taxes of the Latisys Companies, which cooperation shall include but not
be limited to (i) providing all relevant information that is available to
Purchaser, Seller and/or the Latisys Companies, as the case may be, with
respect to such Tax claim; (ii) making personnel available at reasonable
times; and (iii) preparation of responses to requests for information;
provided, that the foregoing shall be done in a manner so as to not
unreasonably interfere with the conduct of business by Purchaser, Seller, the
Latisys Companies or any of their Affiliates, as the case may be. None of
Purchaser, Seller, the Latisys Companies or any of their Affiliates shall
dispose of any Tax Returns, Tax schedules, material Tax work-papers or any
material books or records with respect to the Latisys Companies unless it
first offers in writing to the other party the right to take possession of
such materials at such other party's sole expense and the other party fails to
accept such offer within fifteen (15) days of the offer being made. Any
information obtained under this Section 7.9(d) shall be kept confidential,
except as may be otherwise necessary in connection with the filing of Tax
Returns or claims with respect to any Tax.

 

(e)Seller Obligations. Except to the extent that any liability for Taxes is
specifically taken into account in determining Net Working Capital, the Seller
shall be responsible for and pay, and shall indemnify and hold harmless
Purchaser and the Latisys Companies with respect to (i) any and all Taxes
imposed on the Latisys

   

Companies, or for which the Latisys Companies are liable with respect to any
periods ending on or before the Closing Date and the Pre-Closing Tax Period
with respect to any Straddle Period, and (ii) all Taxes arising out of a
breach of the representations, warranties or covenants contained in Article IV
and Article V, and (iii) any reasonable costs or expenses with respect to
Taxes indemnified hereunder. Any claims for Damages relating to the foregoing
indemnity shall be governed by Section 10.3 through Section 10.8 of this
Agreement and any related Tax controversies shall be subject to the provisions
of Section 7.9(c) and Section 7.9(d), and, for purposes of Section 10.6 of
this Agreement this Section 7.9(e) shall expire on the third anniversary of
the Closing Date.

 

(f)Purchaser Obligations. Except as otherwise provided in this Section 7.9,
from and after the Closing Date, Purchaser and the Latisys Companies shall be
solely responsible for the payment or discharge of all Taxes imposed on the
Latisys Companies for (i) all periods beginning after the Closing Date and the
Post-Closing Tax Period with respect to any Straddle Period, and (ii) any
costs or expenses with respect to Taxes indemnified hereunder. Purchaser shall
indemnify, defend and hold the Seller and its Affiliates harmless from any and
all Taxes that are Purchaser's responsibility pursuant to the immediately
preceding sentence. Any claims for Damages relating to the foregoing indemnity
shall be governed by Section 10.3 through Section 10.8 of this Agreement and
any related Tax controversies shall be subject to the provisions of Section
7.9(c) and Section 7.9(d), and, for purposes of Section 10.6 of this Agreement
this Section 7.9(f) shall expire on the third anniversary of the Closing Date.

 

(g)Straddle Periods. For purposes of this Agreement, Taxes for a Tax period
that begins on or before the Closing Date and ends after the Closing Date (a
"Straddle Period") shall be apportioned to the portion of the Straddle Period
that ends on the Closing Date (the "Pre-Closing Tax Period") and the portion
that ends after the Closing Date (the "Post-Closing Tax Period") using the
following conventions: (A) in the case of property Taxes and other similar
Taxes imposed on a periodic basis, the amount apportioned to a Pre-Closing Tax
Period shall be determined by multiplying the Taxes for the entire Straddle
Period by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of calendar days in
the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date and the
denominator of which is the number of calendar days in the entire Straddle
Period and the balance of such Taxes shall be apportioned to the Post-Closing
Tax Period; and (B) in the case of all other Taxes (including income Taxes,
employment Taxes, and sales and use Taxes) the amount apportioned to the Pre-
Closing Tax Period shall be determined as if the Company had filed a separate
Return with respect to such Taxes for the portion of the Straddle Period
ending on the end of the day on the Closing Date using a closing of the books
methodology, and the balance of such Taxes shall be apportioned to the Post-
Closing Tax Period. For purposes of clause (B), any item determined on an
annual or periodic basis (including amortization and depreciation deductions
and the effects of graduated rates) shall be apportioned to the Pre-Closing
Tax Period based on the relative number of days in such portion of the
Straddle Period as compared to the number of days in the entire Straddle
Period and the balance of such items shall be apportioned to the Post-Closing
Tax Period.

   

(h)Except as required by Law, without the prior written consent of Seller,
none of Purchaser, any Latisys Company, or any Affiliate of Purchaser shall
file any amended Tax Return with respect to an taxable period ending on or
before the Closing Date that would be reasonably likely to cause a materially
adverse effect to the Seller, unless Purchaser indemnifies and holds Seller
harmless from and against any potential adverse Tax effect.

 

7.10Acquisition Proposals.

 

(a)From the date of this Agreement through the earlier of the termination of
this Agreement pursuant to Article IX and the Closing, as applicable, Seller
shall not and shall cause each of the Latisys Companies and its and their
representatives not to, directly or indirectly (except with respect to
Purchaser and its Affiliates), solicit or invite any inquiries, proposals or
indications of interest, or enter into any discussions, negotiations,
understandings, arrangements or contracts relating to the direct or indirect
disposition, whether by sale, merger or otherwise, of all or any material
portion of the Latisys Companies or their respective businesses or assets or
the Shares. 

 

(b)From the date of this Agreement through the earlier of the Closing Date and
the date of termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article IX, as
applicable, Seller shall not, and shall cause the Latisys Companies and
representatives to, cease and terminate immediately any existing discussions
or negotiations with respect to or in furtherance of any transaction described
in clause (a) above. 

 

7.11No Other Representations or Warranties. Purchaser acknowledges and agrees
that (a) the Companies and Seller are not making any representations or
warranties whatsoever, express or implied, beyond those expressly given by the
Companies in Article IV (as qualified by the Disclosure Schedules hereto),
those expressly given by Seller in Article V (as qualified by the Disclosure
Schedules hereto) and those expressly given by any Company or Seller, as
applicable, in any of the Company Documents and Seller Documents, and (b)
except for the representations and warranties contained in such provisions of
this Agreement and in any of the Company Documents and Seller Documents, the
Assets and the business of the Latisys Companies are being transferred on a
"where is" and, as to condition, "as is" basis. Any claims Purchaser may have
for breach of representation or warranty shall be based solely on the
representations and warranties of the Companies set forth in Article IV (as
qualified by the Disclosure Schedules hereto), the representations and
warranties of Seller set forth in Article V (as qualified by the Disclosure
Schedules hereto) and the representations and warranties of the Companies or
Seller, as applicable, in any of the Company Documents and Seller Documents.
Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that none of the Latisys Companies, nor
Seller or any of their respective Affiliates nor any other Person has made any
representation or warranty, express or implied, as to the accuracy or
completeness of any information regarding the Latisys Companies, or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement not expressly set forth within
this Agreement, any Company Document or any Seller Document, and Purchaser is
not relying on anything other than the express provisions of this Agreement,
the Company Documents and the Seller Documents in entering into this
Agreement. None of the Latisys Companies, nor Seller, any of their

   

respective Affiliates or any other Person will have or be subject to any
liability to Purchaser or any other Person resulting solely from the
distribution to Purchaser or its representatives of or Purchaser's use of, any
such information, including any confidential memoranda distributed on behalf
of Seller or the Companies relating to the Latisys Companies or other
publications, representations, warranties, forecasts, statements or
information, including any information provided in a "data room", "management
presentation", "break-out session" or otherwise to Purchaser or its Affiliates
or representatives, or any other document or information in any form provided
to Purchaser or its representatives in connection with the Share Sale and the
other transactions contemplated hereby. Purchaser acknowledges and agrees
that the representations and warranties made by the Companies and Seller in
this Agreement (as qualified by the Disclosure Schedules), the Company
Documents and the Seller Documents supersede, replace and nullify in every
respect all other information, whether written or oral, made available to
Purchaser, its Affiliates or its representatives. No Person is asserting the
truth of any representation or warranty set forth in this Agreement, any
Company Document or any Seller Document; rather the parties have agreed that
should any representations and warranties of any party prove untrue, the other
party shall, subject to Article X of this Agreement, have the specific rights
and remedies herein specified as the exclusive remedy therefor (except as
provided under Section 10.7), but (except as provided under Section 10.7) that
no other rights, remedies or causes of action (whether in law or in equity or
whether in contract or in tort) are permitted to any party hereto as a result
of the untruth of any such representation and warranty.

 

7.12Financing.

 

(a)(i) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Purchaser shall
use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Debt Financing on the terms and
conditions (including the flex provisions) described in the Debt Commitment
Letter pursuant to the terms thereof and satisfy the conditions to the Debt
Financing as described in the Debt Commitment Letter (including, without
limitation, the repayment of any indebtedness to the extent such repayment is
a condition to the Debt Financing) and shall not permit any termination,
amendment or modification to be made to, or any waiver of any provision under,
or any replacement of, the Debt Commitment Letter if such termination,
amendment, modification, waiver or replacement (A) reduces (or could have the
effect of reducing) the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing (including by
increasing the amount of fees to be paid or original issue discount unless (x)
the Debt Financing is increased by a corresponding amount or the Debt
Financing is otherwise made available to fund such fees or original issue
discount and (y) after giving effect to any of the transactions referred to in
clause (x) above, the representation and warranty set forth in Section 6.6
shall be true and correct) or (B) imposes new or additional conditions or
otherwise expands, amends or modifies any of the conditions to the receipt of
Debt Financing, or otherwise expands, amends or modifies any other provision
of the Debt Commitment Letter, in a manner that would reasonably be expected
to (x) delay or prevent or make less likely the funding of the Debt Financing
(or satisfaction of the conditions to the Debt Financing) on the Closing Date
or (y) adversely impact the ability of Purchaser to enforce its rights against
other parties to the Debt Commitment Letter or the definitive agreements with
respect thereto; provided that Purchaser may amend the

   

Debt Commitment Letter to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners,
syndication agents or similar entities who had not executed the Debt
Commitment Letter as of the date hereof provided that such addition does not
have the effect set forth in subclauses (A) or (B) of this sentence.
Purchaser shall promptly deliver to Seller copies of any such termination,
amendment, modification, waiver or replacement.

 

(ii)Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts (A) to maintain in effect
the Debt Commitment Letter, (B) to negotiate and enter into definitive
agreements with respect to the Debt Commitment Letter with, subject to the
restrictions contained in Section 7.12(a)(i), the conditions to funding
contained in the Debt Commitment Letter and on the terms (including the flex
provisions) contained in the Debt Commitment Letter (or on terms acceptable to
Purchaser and the Financing Sources that do not affect such conditions and
will not impair the Closing), (C) to satisfy on a timely basis (taking into
account the expected timing of the Marketing Period) all conditions to receipt
of the Debt Financing at the Closing set forth therein that are within its
control (other than any condition where the failure to be so satisfied is a
direct result of Seller's failure to furnish information described in Section
7.12(b)) and, upon satisfaction of the conditions set forth in the Debt
Commitment Letter, to consummate the Debt Financing at or prior to the
Closing, including using its reasonable best efforts to cause the Lenders and
the other persons committing to fund the Debt Financing at the Closing no
later than one (1) Business Day after the expiration of the Marketing Period,
(D) to enforce its rights under the Debt Commitment Letter and (E) to comply
with its obligations under the Debt Commitment Letter. Purchaser shall keep
Seller informed on a current basis and in reasonable detail of the status of
its efforts to arrange the Debt Financing and provide to Seller copies of
drafts and definitive agreements for the Debt Financing. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, Purchaser shall give Seller prompt notice (x) of
any breach or default by any party to any of the Debt Commitment Letter or
definitive agreements related to the Debt Financing of which Purchaser becomes
aware, (y) of the receipt of any written notice or other written communication
from any Financing Source with respect to any (1) actual breach, default,
termination or repudiation by any party to any of the Debt Commitment Letter
or definitive agreements related to the Debt Financing of any provisions of
the Debt Commitment Letter or definitive agreements related to the Debt
Financing or (2) material dispute or disagreement relating to the Debt
Financing with respect to the obligation to fund the Debt Financing or the
amount of the Debt Financing to be funded at Closing, and (z) if at any time
for any reason Purchaser believes in good faith that it will not be able to
obtain all or any portion of the Debt Financing on the terms and conditions,
in the manner or from the sources contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter
or definitive agreements related to the Debt Financing or no later than one
(1) Business Day after the expiration of the Marketing Period. As soon as
reasonably practicable, after the date Seller delivers to Purchaser a written
request, Purchaser shall provide information reasonably requested by Seller
relating to the circumstances referred to in clause (x), (y) or (z) of the
immediately preceding sentence. If any portion of the Debt Financing
otherwise becomes unavailable, and such portion is reasonably required to fund
the aggregate Purchase Price and all fees, expenses and other amounts
contemplated to be paid by Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement, Purchaser
shall use its reasonable best efforts to arrange and obtain in replacement
thereof, as promptly as reasonably practicable, alternative financing from
alternative sources in an

   

amount sufficient to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement with terms and conditions not materially less favorable to Purchaser
(or its Affiliates) than the terms and conditions set forth in the Debt
Commitment Letter, and no later than one (1) Business Day after the expiration
of the Marketing Period. Purchaser shall promptly deliver to Seller true and
complete copies of all contracts pursuant to which any such alternative source
shall have committed to provide any portion of the Debt Financing. Purchaser
acknowledges and agrees that the obtaining of the Debt Financing, or any
alternative financing, is not a condition to Closing. For purposes of this
Section 7.12 and Section 6.6, references to "Debt Financing" shall include the
financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter as permitted by this
Section 7.12 to be amended, modified or replaced and references to "Debt
Commitment Letter" shall include such documents as permitted by this Section
7.12 to be amended, modified or replaced, in each case from and after such
amendment, modification and replacement.

 

(b)Prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall cause the Latisys Companies to
provide, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its
representatives, including legal and accounting, to provide all cooperation
reasonably requested by Purchaser in connection with the Debt Financing or any
permitted replacement, amended, modified or alternative financing
(collectively with the Debt Financing, the "Available Financing") (provided
that such requested cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with the
ongoing operations of the Latisys Companies), including (i) assisting in the
preparation of pro forma financial statements to be included in rating agency
presentations, offering documents, bank information memoranda, private
placement memoranda, prospectuses and similar documents required in connection
with the Available Financing; (ii) cooperating reasonably with the due
diligence of the Financing Sources of the Debt Financing, to the extent
customary and reasonable and to the extent not unreasonably interfering with
the business of the Companies, (iii) performing agreed upon procedures with
respect to the Required Information and then obtain accountant's comfort
letter with respect to the Required Information, (iv) obtaining customary
authorization letters with respect to the Required Information included in any
bank information memoranda and consents of accountants to the use of their
reports in any materials relating to the Available Financing (subject to
releases customarily requested by such accountants), and (v) using reasonable
best efforts to arrange for customary payoff letters, lien terminations and
instruments of discharge to be delivered at Closing providing for the payoff,
discharge and termination on the Closing Date of all indebtedness contemplated
by the Debt Commitment Letter to be paid off, discharged and terminated on the
Closing Date; provided, however, that none of the Latisys Companies or
representatives shall be required to pay any commitment or other fee or incur
any other liability in connection with the Available Financing prior to the
Closing; and provided further that, for clarity, any failure by the Seller or
any Latisys Company to obtain any of the foregoing items from a third party
despite using reasonable best efforts shall not constitute a breach of the
foregoing covenant. Purchaser shall promptly, upon request by the Seller,
reimburse the Seller and the Latisys Companies, as applicable, for all
reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys'
fees) incurred by the Seller or the Latisys Companies in connection with the
cooperation of the Seller and the Latisys Companies contemplated by this
Section 7.12 and shall indemnify and hold harmless the Seller, the Latisys
Companies and their respective representatives from and against any and all

   

losses, damages, claims, costs or expenses suffered or incurred by any of them
in connection with the arrangement of the Debt Financing and any information
(other than information furnished by the Seller or on behalf of the Latisys
Companies) used in connection therewith. The parties to this Agreement
acknowledge and agree that the Purchaser created the information listed on
Exhibit D attached hereto (which shall be referred to herein as the "Required
Information") based on information that the Latisys Companies provided to the
Purchaser in good faith, it being understood and agreed that neither any
Latisys Company nor Seller is making any representation and warranty hereunder
or in any other Company Document about the Required Information or the
information from which the Required Information is derived; provided that the
foregoing disclaimer does not diminish or modify the representations and
warranties contained in Section 4.6. If the Closing occurs after February 15,
2015, the Seller shall provide the Purchaser with the information necessary to
update the Required Information through December 31, 2014.

(o)since the date of this Agreement, there shall not have occurred a Material
Adverse Effect.

 

If the Closing occurs, all Closing conditions set forth in this Section 8.1
that have not been fully satisfied as of the Closing shall be deemed to have
been waived by the Purchaser. 

 

8.2Conditions Precedent to Obligations of Seller. The obligations of Seller

the extent permitted by applicable Law):

 

(a)The representations and warranties of Purchaser contained in this Agreement
shall be true and correct as of the Closing Date (except to the extent made
with reference to an earlier date, in which case as of such earlier date),
except where the failure of any such representation or warranty to be true and
correct (without giving effect to any "materiality", "material" or "Material
Adverse Effect" qualifier set forth therein) as of the Closing Date (or
express earlier date) would not have a material and adverse effect on
Purchaser's ability to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby;

 

(b)Purchaser shall have performed and complied in all material respects with
all obligations and covenants required by this Agreement to be performed or
complied with by Purchaser on or prior to the Closing Date;

jurisdiction restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby and no action shall have been taken
nor any Law enacted by any Governmental Body that makes the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby illegal;

 

(e)the waiting period applicable to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement under the HSR Act shall have expired or early termination shall have
been granted; and

 

(f)Purchaser shall have made, or caused to have been made, the deliveries
contemplated by Section 3.3.

 

If the Closing occurs, all Closing conditions set forth in this Section 8.2
that have not been fully satisfied as of the Closing shall be deemed to have
been waived by the Seller.

   

Article IX 

TERMINATION

 

9.1Termination of Agreement. This Agreement may be terminated prior to the
Closing as follows:

 

(a)at the election of Seller on or after March 31, 2015, if the Closing shall
not have occurred by the close of business on such date, provided that Seller
is not then in material default of any of its obligations hereunder;

 

(b)at the election of Purchaser on or after May 1, 2015, if the Closing shall
not have occurred by the close of business of such date, provided that
Purchaser is not then in material default of any of its obligations hereunder;

 

(c)by mutual written consent of Seller and Purchaser;

 

(d)by Seller or Purchaser if there shall be in effect a final nonappealable
Order of a Governmental Body of competent jurisdiction restraining, enjoining
or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby; it being agreed that the parties hereto shall promptly appeal any
adverse determination that is not nonappealable (and pursue such appeal with
reasonable diligence);

 

(e)by Purchaser, if there has been a violation or breach by any Company or
Seller of any covenant, representation or warranty contained in this Agreement
which if not cured, would cause a condition to the obligations of Purchaser at
the Closing not to be satisfied, and such violation or breach has not been
waived by Purchaser or cured in all material respects by such Company or
Seller within forty-five (45) days after receipt by Seller of written notice
thereof from Purchaser; provided that the failure to deliver the certificates
representing the Shares at the Closing as required hereunder shall not be
subject to cure hereunder;

 

(f)by Seller, if there has been a violation or breach by Purchaser of any
covenant, representation or warranty contained in this Agreement which if not
cured, would cause a condition to the obligations of Seller and the Companies
at the Closing not to be satisfied, and such violation or breach has not been
waived by Seller or cured in all material respects by Purchaser within forty-
five (45) days after receipt by Purchaser of written notice thereof from
Seller; provided, that neither a breach by Purchaser of Section 6.6 hereof nor
the failure to deliver the Estimated Purchase Price at the Closing as required
hereunder shall be subject to cure hereunder.

 

9.2Procedure Upon Termination. In the event of termination and abandonment by
Purchaser or Seller, or both, pursuant to Section 9.1 hereof, the terminating
party shall forthwith deliver notice thereof to the other party or parties,
and this Agreement shall terminate, and the Share Sale contemplated hereunder
shall be abandoned, without further action by Purchaser or Seller.

   

9.3Effect of Termination. In the event that this Agreement is validly
terminated in accordance with Section 9.1, then each of the parties shall be
relieved of their duties and obligations arising under this Agreement after
the date of such termination and such termination shall be without liability
to Purchaser, Seller and the Latisys Companies provided, that no such
termination shall relieve any party hereto from liability for any breach of
this Agreement and, provided, further, that the obligations of the parties set
forth in Sections 7.5 and 7.7 and Article X hereof shall survive any such
termination and shall be enforceable hereunder.

 

Article X 

INDEMNIFICATION

 

10.1Indemnification of Purchaser.

 

(a)The Seller shall, after the Closing Date, indemnify, defend and hold
harmless Purchaser, the Latisys Companies and the Latisys Companies' officers,
directors, agents and representatives, and each Affiliate of Purchaser or the
Latisys Companies (each hereinafter referred to individually as a "Purchaser
Indemnified Person" and collectively as "Purchaser Indemnified Persons"), from
and against, any and all claims, demands, suits, actions, causes of action,
losses, costs, damages, liabilities and out-of-pocket expenses suffered,
incurred or paid, including reasonable attorneys' fees, but specifically
excluding punitive and exemplary damages except to the extent that punitive or
exemplary damages are included and awarded in a Third-Party Claim
(hereinafter collectively referred to as "Damages"), arising out of or
resulting from an inaccuracy in, breach of, default in, or failure to perform,
any of the representations, warranties or covenants given or made by the
Companies or Seller in this Agreement or in any Company Document or Seller
Document (giving effect to any "materiality", "material" or "Material Adverse
Effect" qualifier set forth therein for purposes of determining whether a
breach has occurred but not for purposes of determining the amount of Damages)
(collectively, "Company Breaches"). No Purchaser Indemnified Person will be
entitled to be indemnified pursuant to this Section 10.1 for any liability or
Company Indebtedness to the extent such liability or Company Indebtedness is
reflected in the Company Indebtedness, Company Transaction Expenses or Closing
Working Capital and used to determine the Adjusted Purchase Price.

 

(b) Any claim for indemnification made by a Purchaser Indemnified Person
under this Section 10.1 must be raised in a writing delivered to Seller by no
later than the applicable Survival Date and, if raised by such date, such
claim shall survive such Survival Date, and the relevant representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement shall survive as to such claim, until final
resolution thereof without the requirement of commencing any action in order
to extend such Survival Date or preserve such claim.

 

(c)The aggregate liability on account of Company Breaches pursuant to this
Section 10.1 shall be limited to the Indemnity Escrow Amount (the "Cap"). The
indemnification provided for in this Section 10.1 shall not apply unless and
until the

   

aggregate Damages so determined to be due for which one or more Purchaser
Indemnified Persons seeks or has sought indemnification hereunder exceeds a
cumulative aggregate amount of $3,375,000 (the "Basket"), in which event the
Purchaser Indemnified Persons shall, subject to the Cap and the other
limitations herein, be indemnified for all such Damages in excess of the
Basket; provided that in no event shall Seller be liable for indemnification
to Purchaser Indemnified Persons under this Section 10.1 with respect to any
Company Breach or Company Breaches arising out of a single course of conduct
or related set of facts, events or circumstances where the Damages relating
thereto are less than $50,000 (the "Pre-Basket Amount"), it being understood
that any such claims for amounts less than the Pre-Basket Amount shall be
ignored for purposes of determining whether the Basket has been exceeded and
thereafter. The Basket and Pre-Basket Amount shall not apply to any claims by
any Purchaser Indemnified Person based on Company Breaches of Fundamental
Representations or breaches of covenants, and therefore any claims based on
Fundamental Representations or breaches of covenants shall be ignored for
purposes of determining if the Basket has been exceeded. Notwithstanding the
foregoing sentence of this Section 10.1(c), costs of investigation and
attorneys' fees incurred in prosecuting the claim shall not count towards
achieving the Basket but shall count as Damages once such threshold has been
achieved and the breach proven. The Cap shall not apply to any claims by any
Purchaser Indemnified Person based on Company Breaches of Fundamental
Representations or willful breaches of covenants, provided that in no event
shall Seller be obligated to indemnify the Purchaser Indemnified Persons with
respect to Fundamental Representations for Damages in excess of the amount of
the Purchase Price actually received by Seller. 

 

(d)The amount to which a Purchaser Indemnified Person may become entitled
under this Article X shall be (i) net of the amount of any net reduction in
Tax liability actually realized by the Purchaser Indemnified Person in the
year that the Damages are incurred (calculated on a "with" and "without"
basis), (ii) net of any amount actually recovered (whether by way of payment,
discount, credit, off-set, counterclaim or otherwise) from a third party
(including any insurer) less any cost associated with receiving such recovery
in respect of a Claim and any increase in premium resulting therefrom, (iii)
net of any reserves established on the Latisys Companies' closing balance
sheet or liabilities that in either case are taken into account in the
calculation of Closing Working Capital and (iv) determined without duplication
of recovery by reason of the state of facts giving rise to such Damages
constituting a breach of more than one representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement. To the extent that insurance, "pass-through" warranty coverage
from a manufacturer or vendor or other form of recovery or reimbursement from
a third party is available to any Purchaser Indemnified Person to cover any
item for which indemnification may be sought hereunder, Purchaser will, or
will cause Purchaser Indemnified Person to, on a timely and expeditious basis,
use commercially reasonable efforts to effect recovery under applicable
insurance policies and warranties and otherwise pursue to conclusion available
remedies or causes of action to recover the amount of its claim as may be
available from such other party. To the extent a Purchaser Indemnified Person
is indemnified and paid the full amount of any claim, Purchaser will assign,
and Purchaser will cause any other Purchaser Indemnified Person to assign, to
Seller, to the fullest extent allowable, its claim against such

   

insurance, warranty coverage or third-party claim, or in the event assignment
is not permissible, but Purchaser or Purchaser Indemnified Person in question
is nonetheless permitted to pursue such claim on Seller's behalf, Purchaser
shall pursue, or shall cause any other Purchaser Indemnified Person to pursue,
such Claim, at Seller's direction and at Seller's cost and expense, with any
recovery thereon to be transmitted promptly to Seller upon receipt. To the
extent that any Purchaser Indemnified Person has not been indemnified on
account of any such claim, any Purchaser Indemnified Person may pursue
recovery against such insurance or warranty coverage or third party and will
be entitled to retain all recoveries made as a result of any such action.
Subject to any applicable confidentiality agreement, Seller shall have the
right, at mutually agreeable times during normal business hours, after
reasonable notice to Purchaser and without undue disruption to their normal
business activities, to inspect the assets and properties of the Latisys
Companies and to inspect and make abstracts and reproductions of all books and
records of the Latisys Companies relating to any such Claims. Subject to any
applicable confidentiality agreement, Purchaser shall, and shall cause the
Latisys Companies to, furnish Seller with such information respecting the
assets, business and financial records of the Latisys Companies relating to
any such claims as Seller may, from time to time, reasonably request.

 

10.2Indemnification of Seller. Purchaser and the Companies shall, after the
Closing Date, indemnify, defend and hold harmless Seller, its Affiliates and
their respective officers, directors, members, agents, representatives,
successors and assigns (the "Seller Indemnified Persons"), from and against
any and all Damages arising out of or resulting from an inaccuracy in, breach
of, default in, or failure to perform any representation, warranty or covenant
made by Purchaser in this Agreement or in any of the Purchaser Documents.

 

10.3Notice of Claim. As used herein, the term "Claim" means a claim for
indemnification by Purchaser or any other Purchaser Indemnified Person or any
Seller Indemnified Person, as the case may be, for Damages under this Article
X (such Person making a Claim, an "Indemnitee"). An Indemnitee shall give
notice of a Claim under this Agreement, whether for its own Damages or for
Damages incurred by any other Purchaser Indemnified Person or Seller
Indemnified Person, as applicable, pursuant to written notice of such Claim
executed by an officer of Purchaser or Seller, as applicable (a "Notice of
Claim"), and delivered to Seller or Purchaser, as applicable (such receiving
party, the "Indemnitor"), promptly after such Indemnitee becomes aware of the
existence of any potential claim by such Indemnitee for indemnification under
this Article X, but in any event before the applicable Survival Date, arising
out of or resulting from: (a) any item indemnified pursuant to the terms of
10.1 or 10.2, or (b) the assertion, whether orally or in writing, against any
Indemnitee of a claim, demand, suit, action, arbitration, investigation,
inquiry or proceeding brought by a third party against any Indemnitee (in each
such case, a "Third-Party Claim") that if successfully prosecuted, would give
rise to a right hereunder on the part of the Indemnitee to be indemnified by
the Indemnitor with respect thereto. So long as such Notice of Claim is given
on or prior to the applicable Survival Date, no delay on the part of an
Indemnitee in giving the Indemnitor a Notice of Claim shall limit or reduce
the Indemnitee's right to indemnity hereunder, nor relieve the

   

Indemnitor from any of its obligations under this Article X, unless (and then
only to the extent that) the Indemnitor is prejudiced thereby.

 

10.4Defense of Third-Party Claims. 

 

(a)Subject to the provisions hereof, the Indemnitor on behalf of the
Indemnitee shall have the right to elect to defend any Third-Party Claim if
the Indemnitor acknowledges in writing (within 30 days after receipt of any
Notice of Claim) that, assuming the truth and accuracy of the material facts
presented in the Notice of Claim, the Indemnitor is obligated to indemnify the
Indemnitee against any and all Damages that may result from such Third-Party
Claim; provided that any such obligations of the Indemnitor shall continue to
be subject to any limitation on any Claims contained herein; provided,
however, that the Indemnitor shall not have the right to assume control of the
defense of any Third-Party Claim (i) to the extent that the object of such
Third-Party Claim is to obtain an injunction, restraining order, declaratory
relief or other non-monetary relief against the Indemnitee which, if
successful, would materially adversely affect the business, operations,
assets, or financial condition of the Indemnitee, or (ii) if the named parties
to any such action or proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include
both the Indemnitee and the Indemnitor and the former shall have been
reasonably advised in writing by counsel (with a copy to the Indemnitor) that
there are one or more legal or equitable defenses available to them that are
different from or additional to those available to Indemnitor. If the
Indemnitor does not give such notice within the applicable 30-day period or
either proviso in this Section 10.4(a) applies, then the Indemnitee shall have
the right to assume control of the defense, and the Indemnitor shall be
responsible for the reasonable cost and expense thereof. If the Indemnitor
shall assume the control of the defense of the Third-Party Claim in accordance
with the provisions of this Section 10.4, the Indemnitor shall obtain the
prior written consent of the Indemnitee before entering into any settlement,
compromise, admission or acknowledgement of the validity of such Third-Party
Claim if the settlement does not unconditionally release the Indemnitee from
all liabilities and obligations with respect to such Third-Party Claim or the
settlement imposes injunctive or other equitable relief against the
Indemnitee. The Indemnitee may participate, at the Indemnitee's own expense,
through counsel of its own choice, in the defense of any Third-Party Claim.
Such assumption of the conduct and control of the settlement or defense shall
not be deemed to be an admission or assumption of liability by the Indemnitor.

 

(b)If the Indemnitee shall assume the control of the defense of any Third-
Party Claim in accordance with the provisions of this Section 10.4, the
Indemnitee shall have the sole right to assume the defense of and settle such
Third-Party Claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnitor shall be
entitled to participate, at its cost and expense, in the defense of such
Third-Party Claim and to employ separate counsel of its choice for such
purpose, and the Indemnitor shall be entitled to contest the reasonableness of
any such settlement to which it does not consent.

   

10.5Contents of Notice of Claim. Each Notice of Claim by an Indemnitee given
pursuant to Section 10.3 shall contain, to the extent known or reasonably
estimable, the following information:

 

(a)that Indemnitee has incurred or paid or, in good faith, believes it may
have to incur or pay, Damages in an aggregate stated amount (where
practicable) arising from such Claim (which amount may be the amount of
damages claimed by a third party in an action brought against any Indemnitee
based on alleged facts, which if true, would give rise to liability for
Damages to such Indemnitee under this Article X); and

 

(b)a description, in reasonable detail, of the facts, circumstances or events
giving rise to the alleged Damages, including the identity and address of any
third‑party claimant (to the extent reasonably available to Indemnitee).
Simultaneously with delivery of the Notice of Claim the Indemnitee shall
deliver copies of any demand or complaint covered by clause (a) of this
Section 10.5, the estimated amount of Damages, the date each such item was
incurred or paid, or the basis for such anticipated liability, and the
specific nature of the breach to which such item is related.

 

10.6Survival of Covenants, Representations and Warranties. All
representations and warranties and pre-Closing covenants of the Companies,
Seller and Purchaser contained in this Agreement or in any Company Document,
Seller Document or Purchaser Document, shall remain operative and in full
force and effect until the date that is twelve (12) months after the Closing
Date (the "Standard Survival Termination Date"), and all covenants of Seller
and Purchaser to be performed after the Closing Date shall survive in
accordance with their respective terms; provided that the representations set
forth in Sections 4.1 (Organization and Good Standing), 4.2 (Authorization of
Agreement), 4.4 (Capitalization), 4.5 (Subsidiaries), 5.1 (Organization and
Good Standing), 5.2 (Authorization of Agreement), 5.4 (Ownership), 6.1
(Organization and Good Standing), 6.2 (Authorization of Agreement), 6.4
(Investment Intention) and 6.7 (Informed Decision) (collectively, the
"Fundamental Representations") shall survive until the third anniversary of
the Closing Date (the applicable date as set forth in this sentence, the
"Survival Date"). 

 

10.7Exclusive Remedy; Source of Recovery; Mitigation. 

 

(a)Except as contemplated by Section 2.3 and as may be required to
specifically enforce post-closing covenants hereunder, after the Closing Date
the indemnification rights set forth in this Article X are and shall be the
sole and exclusive remedies of Purchaser, Purchaser Indemnified Persons,
Seller and Seller Indemnified Persons with respect to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, nothing herein is intended to limit the liability of any
Person for such Person's own fraud under Delaware law.

 

(b)The provisions of Article X were specifically bargained for and reflected
in the amounts payable to Seller in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby.

   

(c)Each Indemnitee shall use reasonable efforts to mitigate any Damages for
which it may claim indemnification under this Article X. To the extent any
Indemnitee has been found by an arbitrator or by a court of competent
jurisdiction to have failed to use reasonable efforts to mitigate such
Damages, such arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction, as the case may
be, shall be permitted to reduce the applicable Indemnitor's indemnification
obligation by the portion of such Damages attributable to such failure.

 

(d)Within five (5) Business Days after a Final Determination (as defined
below), Purchaser and Seller shall deliver to the Escrow Agent joint written
instructions signed by both Purchaser and Seller (attaching a copy of such
Final Determination) instructing the Escrow Agent to disburse all or a portion
of the Indemnity Escrow Amount (to the extent there are funds remaining in the
Indemnity Escrow Account and only up to the amount of such remaining funds) in
accordance with such Final Determination, as contemplated by the Escrow
Agreement. 

 

(e)Within five (5) Business Days after a Final Determination that a Seller
Indemnified Party has suffered Damages and is entitled to indemnification from
Purchaser pursuant to this Article X, the amount of such Damages shall be paid
by Purchaser, in cash by wire transfer of immediately available funds, to
Seller.

 

(f)(i) Except as provided in the last sentence of Section 10.1(c), the amount
of any Damages payable to the Purchaser Indemnified Persons under this Article
X shall, in each case, be paid to the applicable Purchaser Indemnified Persons
solely from the Indemnity Escrow Account to the extent of available funds in
the Indemnity Escrow Account. 

 

(ii) Within one (1) Business Day after the Standard Survival Termination
Date, the Purchaser and Seller shall deliver to the Escrow Agent joint written
instructions signed by both Purchaser and Seller instructing the Escrow Agent
to release the funds remaining in the Indemnity Escrow Account (including all
earnings thereon) minus the amount, if any, of claims for indemnification
under Article X, in each case properly asserted prior to such date by the
Purchaser Indemnified Persons in writing in accordance with this Article X but
not yet paid or resolved as of the Standard Survival Termination Date (the
"Unresolved Claims"), to Seller.

 

(iii) Following the Standard Survival Termination Date, to the extent that a
Final Determination is reached with respect to any Unresolved Claim, within
five (5) Business Days after such Final Determination, the Purchaser and
Seller shall deliver to the Escrow Agent joint written instructions signed by
both Purchaser and Seller instructing the Escrow Agent to release to Seller
any amount reserved in the Indemnity Escrow Account with respect to such
Unresolved Claim (including all earnings thereon) that is not payable to the
Purchaser Indemnified Persons pursuant to such Final Determination.

 

(iv) Such amount shall be released from the Indemnity Escrow Account to the
Seller through wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account
designated

   

by the Seller. The amounts retained in the Indemnity Escrow Account in respect
of any Unresolved Claim shall be released by the Escrow Agent upon final
resolution of any Unresolved Claim in respect of which such amounts had been
retained in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement.

 

(g)For purposes of this Article X, a "Final Determination" shall exist when
(i) the Indemnitor and the Indemnitee have entered into a written settlement
agreement with respect to the subject matter of a Claim or a Third-Party
Claim, as the case may be or (ii) a final non-appealable order has been
entered by a court of competent jurisdiction with respect to the subject
matter of a Claim or a Third-Party Claim.

 

10.8Tax Treatment of Indemnification Payments. Purchaser and Seller agree to
treat any indemnification payment made pursuant to this Agreement as an
adjustment to the Purchase Price for all Tax purposes, unless otherwise
required by Law.

 

Article XI

11.2Expenses. Whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby are
consummated, all costs and expenses (including any brokerage commissions or
any finder's or investment banker's fees and including attorneys' and
accountants' fees) incurred in connection with the negotiation and execution
of this Agreement and each other agreement, document and instrument
contemplated hereby and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby shall be paid by the party incurring such expenses, except
that all Company Transaction Expenses shall be borne by Seller.

 

11.3Submission to Jurisdiction; Consent to Service of Process; Waiver of Jury

(a)The parties hereto hereby irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction

dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby and each party hereby irrevocably agrees that
all claims in respect of such dispute or any suit, action proceeding related
thereto may be heard and determined in such courts. The parties hereby
irrevocably waive, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any
objection which they may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any
such dispute brought in such court or any defense of inconvenient forum for
the maintenance of such dispute. Each of the parties hereto agrees that a
judgment in any such dispute may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on
the judgment or in any other manner provided by law.

   

(b)Notwithstanding the foregoing, each of the parties hereto agrees that it
shall not, and it shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to not permit
any of its Affiliates to, bring or support anyone else in bringing any action,
cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim of any kind or
description, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or
otherwise, against the Financing Sources in any way relating to this Agreement
or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, including but not limited to
any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the Debt Commitment
Letter, in any forum other than any New York State court or federal court
sitting in the City of New York in the Borough of Manhattan (and appellate
courts thereof).

 

(c)Each of the parties hereto hereby consents to process being served by any
party to this Agreement in any suit, action or proceeding by delivery of a
copy thereof in accordance with the provisions of Section 11.6.

 

(d)TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW THAT CANNOT BE WAIVED, EACH
PARTY HEREBY WAIVES, AND COVENANTS THAT IT WILL NOT ASSERT (WHETHER AS
PLAINTIFF, DEFENDANT OR OTHERWISE), ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY FORUM IN
RESPECT OF ANY ISSUE, CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION OR CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING IN
WHOLE OR IN PART UNDER, RELATED TO, BASED ON OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS
AGREEMENT OR THE SUBJECT MATTER HEREOF, WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER
ARISING AND WHETHER SOUNDING IN TORT OR CONTRACT OR OTHERWISE. ANY PARTY
HERETO MAY FILE AN ORIGINAL COUNTERPART OR A COPY OF THIS SECTION 11.3 WITH
ANY COURT AS WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE CONSENT OF EACH SUCH PARTY TO THE WAIVER
OF ITS RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY.

 

11.4Entire Agreement; Amendments and Waivers. This Agreement (including the
Schedules and any exhibits hereto, the Company Documents, the Seller Documents
and the Purchaser Documents) and the Confidentiality Agreement represent the
entire understanding and agreement between the parties hereto with respect to
the subject matter hereof. This Agreement can be amended, supplemented or
changed, and any provision hereof can be waived, only by written instrument
making specific reference to this Agreement signed by Purchaser and Seller.
No action taken pursuant to this Agreement, including without limitation, any
investigation by or on behalf of any party, shall be deemed to constitute a
waiver by the party taking such action of compliance with any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement contained herein. The waiver by any party
hereto of a breach of any provision of this Agreement shall not operate or be
construed as a further or continuing waiver of such breach or as a waiver of
any other or subsequent breach. No failure on the part of any party to
exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right, power or remedy hereunder
shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of
such right, power or remedy by such party preclude any other or further
exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or remedy.

 

11.5Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware without giving effect to the
conflicts or

   

choice of law provisions thereof or of any other jurisdiction that would give
rise to the application of the domestic substantive law of any other
jurisdiction.

provided that the Financing Sources shall be express third party beneficiaries
and entitled to rely on Section 11.3(b) and (d). No assignment of this
Agreement or of any rights or obligations hereunder may be made by either
Seller or Purchaser, directly or indirectly (by operation of law or
otherwise), without the prior written consent of the other parties hereto and
any attempted assignment without the required consents shall be void. No
assignment of any obligations hereunder shall relieve the parties hereto of
any such obligations. Upon any such permitted assignment, the references in
this Agreement to Purchaser shall also apply to any such assignee unless the
context otherwise requires.

 

11.9No Recourse or Personal Liability. Except as set forth in Section
10.7(a), Purchaser agrees and acknowledges, both for itself and its
Affiliates, that no recourse under this Agreement or any documents or
instruments delivered in connection with this Agreement shall be had against
any current or future director, officer, employee, stockholder, member of any
Company, Seller, or of any Affiliate or assignee thereof, whether in their
capacity as such or otherwise, whether by the enforcement of any assessment or
by any legal or equitable proceeding, or by virtue of any statute, regulation
or other applicable Law, it being expressly agreed and acknowledged that no
personal liability whatsoever shall attach to, be imposed on or otherwise be
incurred by any current or future director, officer, employee, stockholder, or
member of any Company, Seller or any Affiliate or assignee thereof, whether in
their capacity as such or otherwise, for any obligation of any Company or
Seller under this Agreement or any documents or instruments delivered in
connection with this Agreement for any claim based on, in respect of or by
reason of such obligations or their creation. 

 

11.10Remedies. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, any and all
remedies provided herein will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of
any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such party, and
the exercise by a party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of
any other remedy. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage for which
monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would
occur in the event that one of the parties hereto does not perform its
obligations under the provisions of this Agreement (including failing to take
such actions as are required of them hereunder to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement) in accordance with their specific terms or
otherwise breaches such provisions. It is accordingly agreed that, prior to
the valid termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(e) or Section
9.1(f), the parties hereto shall be

   

entitled to an injunction or injunctions, specific performance and other
equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, in each case without
posting a bond or undertaking, this being in addition to any other remedy to
which they are entitled at law or in equity. Each of the parties hereto
agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific
performance and other equitable relief when expressly available pursuant to
the terms of this Agreement on the basis that the other Parties have an
adequate remedy at law or an award of specific performance is not an
appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity.

 

11.11Retention of Counsel. In any dispute or proceeding arising under or in
connection with this Agreement following the Closing, Seller and its owners
shall have the right, at their election, to retain Edwards Wildman Palmer LLP
to represent them in such matter, even if such representation shall be adverse
to Purchaser and/or the Companies. Purchaser and the Companies, for
themselves and for their respective Affiliates, successors and assigns, hereby
irrevocably consent to any such representation in any such matter. Purchaser
and the Companies, for themselves and for their respective Affiliates,
successors and assigns, hereby irrevocably waive any actual or potential
conflict arising from any such representation in the event of: (1) any
adversity between the interests of Seller and its owners on the one hand and
Purchaser and the Companies on the other hand, in any such matter; and/or (2)
any communication between Edwards Wildman Palmer LLP and any Company, its
Affiliates or employees, whether privileged or not, or any other information
known to such counsel, by reason of such counsel's representation of any of
the Latisys Companies prior to Closing.

 

11.12Protected Communication. The parties to this Agreement agree that,
immediately prior to the Closing, without the need for any further action (a)
all right, title and interest of any Latisys Company in and to all Protected
Communications shall thereupon transfer to and be vested solely in Seller and
its successors in interest, and (b) any and all protections from disclosure,
including, but not limited to, attorney client privileges and work product
protections, associated with or arising from any Protected Communications that
would have been exercisable by any Latisys Company shall thereupon be vested
exclusively in Seller and its successors in interest and shall be exercised or
waived solely as directed by Seller or its successors in interest. None of
the Latisys Companies, Purchaser or any Person acting on any of their behalf
shall, without the prior written consent of Seller or its successors in
interest, assert or waive or attempt to assert or waive any such protection
against disclosure, including, but not limited to, the attorney-client
privilege or work product protection, or to discover, obtain, use or disclose
or attempt to discover, obtain, use or disclose any Protected Communications
in any manner, including in connection with any dispute or legal proceeding
relating to or in connection with this Agreement, the events and negotiations
leading to this Agreement, or any of the transactions contemplated herein,
provided, however, the foregoing shall neither prohibit Purchaser from seeking
proper discovery of such documents nor Seller from asserting that such
documents are not discoverable to the extent that applicable attorney client
privileges and work product protections have attached thereto. Seller and its
successors in interest shall have the right at any time prior to or following
the Closing to remove, erase, delete, disable, copy or otherwise deal with any
Protected

   

Communications in whatever way they desire, and the Companies and Purchaser
shall provide full access to all Protected Communications in their possession
or within their direct or indirect control and shall provide reasonable
assistance at the expense of the Person requesting such assistance in order to
give full force and effect to the rights of Seller and its successors in
interest hereunder.

 

11.13No Waiver of Privilege, Protection from Disclosure or Use. The parties
hereto understand and agree that nothing in this Agreement, including the
foregoing provisions regarding the assertions of protection from disclosure
and use, privilege and conflicts of interest, shall be deemed to be a waiver
of any applicable attorney-client privilege or other protection from
disclosure or use. Each of the parties understands and agrees that it has
undertaken reasonable efforts to prevent the disclosure of Protected
Communications. Notwithstanding those efforts, the parties understand and
agree that the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
could result in the inadvertent disclosure of information that may be
confidential, eligible to be subject to a claim of privilege, or otherwise
protected from disclosure. The parties further understand and agree that any
disclosure of information that may be confidential, subject to a claim of
privilege, or otherwise protected from disclosure will not constitute a waiver
of or otherwise prejudice any claim of confidentiality, privilege, or
protection from disclosure, including, but not limited to, with respect to
information involving or concerning the same subject matter as the disclosed
information. The parties agree to use reasonable best efforts to return any
inadvertently disclosed information to the disclosing party promptly upon
becoming aware of its existence. The parties further agree that promptly
after the return of any inadvertently disclosed information, the party
returning such information shall destroy any and all copies, summaries,
descriptions and/or notes of such inadvertently disclosed information,
including electronic versions thereof, and all portions of larger documents or
communications that contain such copies, summaries, descriptions or notes.

 

11.14Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, each of which will be deemed to be an original copy of this
Agreement and all of which, when taken together, will be deemed to constitute
one and the same agreement.

 

11.15Time of Essence. With regard to all dates and time periods set forth or
referred to in this Agreement, time is of the essence.
