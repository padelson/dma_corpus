defined)) of the conditions set forth in ARTICLE  VI  (other  than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing,  but
subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions) or (ii) the  date 
of completion of the Marketing Period (or, if Parent so notifies the

Section  1.3 _Effective  Time_.  On the  Closing Date, the Company shall

duly filed with the Secretary of State of  the  State of Kansas, or at such
later date or time as may be agreed by Parent  and  the Company in writing
and specified in the Certificate of Merger in accordance  with the KGCC (such
time as the Merger becomes effective is referred to herein  as the "
_Effective  Time_ ").

 

 

Section  1.4 _Effects  of the Merger_.  The  Merger shall have the effects
set forth in this Agreement and the applicable  provisions of the KGCC.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section  1.5 _Articles  of Incorporation and By-laws of the Surviving
Corporation_.

 

 

 

(a) The  articles of incorporation of the Company, as in effect immediately
prior  to the  Effective Time, shall be the articles of incorporation of the

provisions  thereof,  hereof and applicable Law, in each case consistent
with the obligations  set  forth in Section  5.9.

 

 

 

(b) The  by-laws of Merger Sub, as in effect at the Effective Time, shall be
the by-laws  of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in
accordance with  the  provisions thereof, hereof and applicable Law, in each
case consistent with  the  obligations set forth in Section  5.9.

 

 

Section  1.6 _Directors_.  Subject  to applicable Law, the directors of
Merger Sub immediately prior to the  Effective Time shall be the initial
directors of the Surviving Corporation  and  shall hold office until their
respective successors are duly elected and  qualified, or their earlier

Section  1.7 _Officers_.  The  officers of the Company immediately prior to
the Closing Date shall be the  initial officers of the Surviving Corporation
and shall hold office until  their  respective successors are duly elected

**ARTICLE  II** 

 

 

**CONVERSION  OF SHARES; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES**

 

 

Section  2.1 _Effect  on Capital Stock_.  At the  Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part  of  the Company,
Merger Sub or the holders of any securities of the Company or  Merger Sub:

 

 

(a) _Conversion  of Company Common Stock_.  Subject  to Section  2.1(b), 
2.1(d)  and 2.1(e), each issued and outstanding share of common stock, par
value  $5.00  per share, of the Company outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective  Time  (such shares, collectively, " _Company  Common Stock_ ", 
and  each, a " _Share_ "),  other  than (i) any Shares held by any direct
or indirect wholly owned subsidiary  of  the Company, which Shares shall
remain outstanding except that the number  of  such Shares shall be
appropriately adjusted in the Merger (the " _Remaining  Shares_ "),  (ii) 
any Cancelled Shares (as defined, and to the extent provided in, Section 
2.1(b))  and  (iii) any Dissenting Shares (as defined, and to the extent
provided in, Section  2.1(e))  shall  thereupon be converted automatically
into and shall thereafter represent  the  right to receive $107.50 in cash
(the " _Merger  Consideration_ ").  All  Shares that have been converted
into the right to receive the Merger  Consideration as provided in this
Section  2.1  shall be  automatically cancelled and shall cease to exist,
and the holders of  certificates which immediately prior to the Effective
Time represented such  Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect to
such Shares other than  the  right to receive the Merger Consideration.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) _Parent  and Merger Sub-Owned Shares_.  Each  Share that is owned,
directly or indirectly, by Parent or Merger Sub immediately  prior to the
Effective Time, if any, or held by the Company immediately prior  to  the
Effective Time (in each case, other than any such Shares held on behalf  of 
third parties) (the " _Cancelled  Shares_ ")  shall,  by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holder  thereof, be
cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration  shall
be delivered in exchange for such cancellation and  retirement.

 

 

(c) _Conversion  of Merger Sub Common Stock_.  At the  Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part  of  the holder
thereof, each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share,  of  Merger
Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time  shall 
be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable  share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the
Surviving Corporation  and shall with the Remaining Shares constitute the
only outstanding shares  of  capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.
From and after the Effective  Time,  all certificates representing the
common stock of Merger Sub shall be deemed  for  all purposes to represent
the number of shares of common stock of the Surviving  Corporation into which
they were converted in accordance with the immediately  preceding sentence.

 

 

(d) _Adjustments_.  If at  any time during the period between the date of
this Agreement and the Effective  Time, any change in the outstanding shares
of capital stock of the Company,  or  securities convertible or exchangeable
into or exercisable for shares of  capital  stock, shall occur as a result
of any reclassification, recapitalization,  stock  split (including a
reverse stock split) or subdivision or combination, exchange  or readjustment
of shares, or any stock dividend or stock distribution with  a  record date
during such period (excluding, in each case, normal quarterly  cash 
dividends), merger or other similar transaction, the Merger Consideration 
shall  be equitably adjusted to reflect such change; _provided_   that 
nothing herein shall be construed to permit the Company to take any action 
with  respect to its securities that is prohibited by the terms of this 
Agreement.

 

 

(e) _Dissenters '  Rights_.  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, shares of Company  Common Stock that are issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective  Time and which are held by a stockholder
who did not vote in favor of the  Merger  (or consent thereto in writing)
and who is entitled to demand and properly  demands appraisal of such shares
pursuant to, and who complies in all respects  with, the provisions of
Section 17-6712 of the KGCC (the " _Dissenting  Stockholders_ "),  shall 
not be converted into or be exchangeable for the right to receive the Merger 
Consideration (the " _Dissenting  Shares_ ," and  together with the
Cancelled Shares, the " _Excluded  Shares_ "),  but  instead such holder
shall be entitled to payment of the appraised value of  such  shares in
accordance with the provisions of Section 17-6712 of the KGCC  (and at the
Effective Time, such Dissenting Shares shall no longer be  outstanding and
shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist,  and  such holder
shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the  right to
receive the appraised value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance  with the
provisions of Section 17-6712 of the KGCC), unless and until such  holder
shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or  lost 
rights to appraisal under the KGCC. If any Dissenting Stockholder shall have 
failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such right, 
such  holder's shares of Company Common Stock shall thereupon be treated as
if they  had been converted into and become exchangeable for the right to
receive,  as of  the Effective Time, the Merger Consideration for each such
share of Company  Common Stock, in accordance with Section  2.1(a), 
without  any interest thereon. The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt
notice of  any  written demands for appraisal of any shares of Company
Common Stock, attempted  withdrawals of such demands and any other
instruments served pursuant to  the  KGCC and received by the Company
relating to stockholders' rights of appraisal  and (ii) the opportunity to
participate in negotiations and proceedings with  respect to demands for
appraisal under the KGCC. The Company shall not, except  with the prior
written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with  respect to, or

Section  2.2 _Exchange  of Certificates_.

 

 

(a) _Paying  Agent_.  At or  prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall
deposit, or shall cause to be  deposited, with a U.S. bank or trust company
that shall be appointed by Parent  and approved by the Company in writing
(such approval not to be unreasonably  withheld) to act as a paying agent
hereunder (the " _Paying  Agent_ "),  in  trust for the benefit of holders
of the Shares, the Company Stock Options  (as  hereinafter defined) and the
Company Stock-Based Awards (as hereinafter  defined), cash in U.S. dollars
sufficient to pay (i) the aggregate Merger  Consideration in exchange for all
of the Shares outstanding immediately prior  to  the Effective Time (other
than the Excluded Shares and the Remaining Shares)  pursuant to the
provisions of this ARTICLE  II  and (ii)  the Option and Stock-Based
Consideration (as hereinafter defined) payable  pursuant to Section  5.5 
(such  cash referred to in subsections (a)(i) and (a)(ii) being hereinafter
referred  to  as the " _Exchange  Fund_ ").

 

 

(b) _Payment  Procedures_.

 

 

(i) As  soon  as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time and in any
event not later  than the fifth Business Day following the Effective Time,
the Paying Agent  shall  mail (x) to each holder of record of Shares whose
Shares were converted  into the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 
2.1,  (A) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall
be  effected, and risk of loss and title to the certificates that
immediately  prior  to the Effective Time represented Shares ("
_Certificates_ ")  shall  pass, only upon delivery of Certificates (to the
Paying Agent and shall be  in  such form and have such other provisions as
Parent and the Company may  reasonably determine prior to the Effective Time)
and (B) instructions for  use in effecting the surrender of Certificates (or
effective affidavits of  loss  in lieu thereof) or non-certificated Shares
represented by book-entry  (" _Book-Entry  Shares_ ")  in  exchange for
the Merger Consideration and (y) to each holder of a Company  Stock Option or
a Company Stock-Based Award, a check in an amount due and  payable to such
holder pursuant to Section  5.5  hereof  in respect of such Company Stock
Option or Company Stock-Based  Award.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(ii) Upon  surrender of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu
thereof)  or  Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent together with such
letter of transmittal,  duly completed and validly executed in accordance
with the instructions thereto,  and such other documents as may customarily
be required by the Paying Agent,  the  holder of such Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive  in  exchange therefor a check in
an amount equal to the product of (x) the  number of Shares represented by
such holder's properly surrendered Certificates  (or effective affidavits of
loss in lieu thereof) and Book-Entry Shares  multiplied by (y) the Merger
Consideration. No interest will be paid or  accrued on any amount payable
upon due surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry  Shares. In the event of a
transfer of ownership of Shares that is not registered  in the transfer or
stock records of the Company, a check for any cash to  be paid  upon due
surrender of the Certificate formerly representing such Shares may  be  paid
to such a transferee if such Certificate is presented to the Paying  Agent, 
accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer 
and  to evidence that any applicable stock transfer or other Taxes (as
hereinafter  defined) have been paid or are not applicable.

 

 

(iii) The  Surviving Corporation, Parent and the Paying Agent shall be
entitled to deduct  and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable
under this Agreement  to  any holder of Shares or holder of Company Stock
Options or Company Stock-Based  Awards, such amounts as are required to be
withheld or deducted under the  Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(the " _Code_ "),  or  any provision of U.S. state, local or foreign Tax Law
with respect to the  making  of such payment. To the extent that amounts are
so withheld or deducted and  paid  over to the applicable Governmental
Entity (as hereinafter defined), such  withheld or deducted amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement  as having been paid to the holder
of the Shares or holder of the Company  Stock  Options or Company Stock-
Based Awards, in respect of which such deduction  and  withholding were
made.

 

 

(c) _Closing  of Transfer Books_.  At the  Effective Time, the stock
transfer books of the Company shall be closed,  and  there shall be no
further registration of transfers on the stock transfer  books  of the
Surviving Corporation of the Shares that were outstanding immediately  prior
to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are 
presented to the Surviving Corporation or Parent for transfer, they shall 
be  cancelled and exchanged for a check in the proper amount pursuant to
and  subject  to the requirements of this ARTICLE  II.

 

 

(d) _Termination  of Exchange Fund_.  Any  portion of the Exchange Fund
(including the proceeds of any investments thereof)  that remains
undistributed to the former holders of Shares for one year after  the
Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation upon demand, 
and any former holders of Shares who have not surrendered their Shares in 
accordance with this Section  2.2  shall  thereafter look only to the
Surviving Corporation for payment of their claim  for  the Merger
Consideration, without any interest thereon, upon due surrender  of  their
Shares.

 

 

(e) _No  Liability_.  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, none
of the Company, Parent,  Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation, the Paying
Agent or any other person  shall be liable to any former holder of Shares for
any amount properly delivered  to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat  or  similar Law.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

6  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(f) _Investment  of Exchange Fund_.  The  Paying Agent shall invest all
cash included in the Exchange Fund as reasonably  directed by Parent;
provided, however, that any investment of such cash shall  be  limited to
direct short-term obligations of, or short-term obligations fully  guaranteed
as to principal and interest by, the U.S. government and that  no such 
investment or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to holders of 
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares pursuant to this ARTICLE  II.  Any 
interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to 
the  Surviving Corporation pursuant to Section  2.2(d).

 

 

(g) _Lost  Certificates_.  In the  case of any Certificate that has been
lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the  making  of an affidavit of that fact by
the person claiming such Certificate to be  lost,  stolen or destroyed and,
if required by Parent or the Paying Agent, the posting  by such person of an
indemnity agreement or, at the election of Parent or  the  Paying Agent, a
bond in customary amount as indemnity against any claim that  may  be made
against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will  issue 
in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate a check in the 
amount  of the number of Shares represented by such lost, stolen or
destroyed  Certificate multiplied by the Merger Consideration.

 

 

Section  2.3 _Timing  of Equity Rollover_.  For the  avoidance of doubt,
the parties acknowledge and agree that the contribution  of  Shares to
Parent or one of its Subsidiaries pursuant to the Rollover Commitments  (and
any subsequent contribution of such Shares prior to the Effective Time  by 
Parent to one or more of its Subsidiaries) shall be deemed to occur
immediately  prior to the Effective Time and prior to any other above-
described  event.

Subsidiaries and the Company Joint  Ventures has all requisite corporate,
partnership or similar power and authority  to own, lease and operate its

(b) Each  of  the Company and its Subsidiaries is qualified to do business
and is in good  standing as a foreign corporation in each jurisdiction where
the ownership,  leasing or operation of its assets or properties or conduct
of its business  requires such qualification, except where the failure to be
so qualified  or in  good standing would not, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Company  Material Adverse Effect. The organizational or
governing documents of the  Company and each of its Subsidiaries and Company

likely to prevent or materially delay or materially impair the ability of 
the  Company to perform its obligations hereunder or to consummate the
Merger  or the  other transactions contemplated hereby, or (b) without
limiting the  foregoing, a Partnership Event, but, in any case, shall not
include facts,  circumstances, events, changes, effects or occurrences (i)
generally  affecting the energy transportation, energy storage, oil and gas,

in the United  States or Canada (including general pricing changes) or the
economy or the  financial or securities markets in the United States or
elsewhere in the  world,  including any regulatory and political conditions
or developments, or any  outbreak or escalation of hostilities, declared or
undeclared acts of war  or  terrorism, except to the extent any fact,
circumstance, event, change, effect  or  occurrence that, relative to other
industry participants, disproportionately  impacts the assets, properties,
business, results of operation or financial  condition of the Company and its
Subsidiaries and the Company Joint Ventures,  taken as a whole (but with
respect to the Company's direct or indirect interests  in any non-wholly
owned entities only to the extent of such effects on the  Company's direct or
indirect interests therein), or  (ii) resulting from the announcement of (A)

Company Material Adverse Effect.

 

 

(c) The  execution and delivery by the Company of this Agreement does not,
and the  consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and compliance
with  the  provisions hereof by the Company will not, (i) result in any
violation of,  or default (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both)

cancellation or  acceleration of any obligation or to the loss of any benefit
under any loan,  guarantee of indebtedness or credit agreement, note, bond,
mortgage, indenture,  lease, agreement, contract, instrument, permit, Company
Permit, concession,  franchise, right or license binding upon the Company or

other than, in the  case  of clauses (i) and (iii), any such violation,
required consent, conflict,  default, termination, cancellation,
acceleration, right, loss or Lien that  would  not have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse  Effect.

required  by  Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act. The Company's, Kinder
Morgan Energy  Partners, L.P.'s, and Kinder Morgan Management, LLC's
disclosure controls and  procedures are reasonably designed to ensure that
all material information  required to be disclosed by the Company, Kinder
Morgan Energy Partners, L.P.,  and Kinder Morgan Management, LLC in the
reports that it or they file under  the  Exchange Act are recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the  time  periods specified in

**REPRESENTATIONS  AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT AND MERGER SUB**

 

 

Except  as  disclosed in the disclosure letter delivered by Parent to the
Company  immediately prior to the execution of this Agreement (the "
_Parent  Disclosure Letter_ "),  Parent and Merger Sub jointly and severally
represent and warrant to the  Company  as follows:

 

 

Section  4.1 _Qualification;  Organization_.

 

 

(a) Each  of  Parent and Merger Sub is a legal entity duly organized,
validly existing  and in  good standing under the Laws of its respective
jurisdiction of organization.  Each of Parent and Merger Sub has all
requisite corporate, limited liability  company, or similar power and
authority to own, lease and operate its properties  and assets and to carry
on its business as presently conducted, except where  the  failure to have
such power or authority would not, individually or in the  aggregate, have a
Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 

 

(b) Each  of  Parent and Merger Sub is qualified to do business and is in
good standing  as a  foreign corporation or limited liability company, as
applicable, in each  jurisdiction where the ownership, leasing or operation
of its assets or  properties or conduct of its business requires such
qualification, except  where  the failure to be so qualified or in good
standing would not, individually  or in  the aggregate, prevent or
materially delay or materially impair the ability  of  Parent or Merger Sub
to consummate the Merger and the other transactions  contemplated hereby (a "
_Parent  Material Adverse Effect_ ").  The  organizational or governing
documents of the Parent and Merger Sub, as  previously provided to the
Company, are in full force and effect. Neither  Parent  nor Merger Sub is in
violation of its organizational or governing  documents.

Violation_.

 

 

(a) Each  of  Parent and Merger Sub has all requisite corporate or limited
liability company,  as applicable, power and authority to enter into this
Agreement and to  consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The
execution and delivery  of  this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby  have  been duly and validly authorized by
the Members of Parent and the Board of  Directors of Merger Sub and no other
corporate proceedings on the part of  Parent  or Merger Sub are necessary to
authorize the consummation of the transactions  contemplated hereby. This
Agreement has been duly and validly executed and  delivered by Parent and
Merger Sub and, assuming this Agreement constitutes  the  valid and binding
agreement of the Company, this Agreement constitutes the  valid  and binding
agreement of Parent and Merger Sub, enforceable against each  of  Parent and
Merger Sub in accordance with its terms, subject to the effects  of 
bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium 
and  other similar laws relating to or affecting creditors' rights generally,
general  equitable principles (whether considered in a proceeding in equity
or at  law)  and any implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

24  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) Other  than in connection with or in compliance with (i) the provisions
of the  KGCC, (ii) the Exchange Act, (iii) the HSR Act, (iv) Competition 
Act (Canada) and (v) the approvals set forth on Section  4.2(b)  of the 
Parent Disclosure Letter (collectively, the " _Parent  Approvals_ "),  no 
authorization, consent or approval of, or filing with, any Governmental
Entity  is necessary for the consummation by Parent or Merger Sub of the
transactions  contemplated by this Agreement, except for such authorizations,
consents,  approvals or filings, that, if not obtained or made, would not
have,  individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 

 

(c) The  execution and delivery by Parent and Merger Sub of this Agreement
does not,  and  the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and
compliance with  the  provisions hereof will not (i) result in any violation
of, or default (with  or without notice or lapse of time, or both) under,
require consent under,  or  give rise to a right of termination,
cancellation or acceleration of any  obligation or to the loss of any benefit
under any loan, guarantee of  indebtedness or credit agreement, note, bond,
mortgage, indenture, lease,  agreement, contract, instrument, permit,
concession, franchise, right or  license  binding upon Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries or result in the creation  of any  Lien upon any of the
properties or assets of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries,  (ii) conflict
with or result in any violation of any provision of the  certificate of
incorporation or by-laws or other equivalent organizational  document, in
each case as amended, of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or  (iii) conflict
with or violate any applicable Laws, other than, in the case  of clauses (i)
and (iii), any such violation, conflict, default, termination,  cancellation,
acceleration, right, loss or Lien that would not have,  individually or in
the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 

 

Section  4.3 _Proxy  Statement; Other Information_.  None of  the
information supplied or to be supplied by Parent or Merger Sub in writing 
for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement will at 
the  time of the mailing of the Proxy Statement to the stockholders of the
Company,  at the time of the Company Meeting, and at the time of any
amendments thereof  or  supplements thereto, and none of the information
supplied or to be supplied  by  Parent or Merger Sub and contained in the
Schedule 13E-3 to be filed with  the SEC concurrently with the filing of the
Proxy Statement, will, at the  time  of its filing with the SEC, and at the
time of any amendments thereof or  supplements thereto, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit  to  state any material fact required
to be stated therein or necessary in order  to  make the statements therein,
in light of the circumstances under which they  were  made, not misleading.

 

 

Section  4.4 _Financing_.  Section  4.4  of the  Parent Disclosure Letter
sets forth true, accurate and complete copies, as  of the date hereof, of (i)
executed equity commitment letters to  provide equity financing to Parent
and/or Merger Sub, (ii) the Rollover  Commitments, (iii) executed debt
commitment letters and related term sheets  (the " _Debt  Commitment
Letters_ " and  together with the equity commitment letters described in
clause (i), the  " _Financing  Commitments_ ")  pursuant to which, and
subject to the terms and conditions thereof, certain  lenders have committed
to provide Parent or the Surviving Corporation with  loans  in the amounts
described therein, the proceeds of which may be used to  consummate the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby (the  " _Debt 
Financing_ " and,  together with the equity financing referred to in clause
(i) and the Rollover  Commitments, the " _Financing_ ").  As of  the date
hereof, each of the Financing Commitments, in the form so delivered,  is  a
legal, valid and binding obligation of Parent or Merger Sub, to the Parent's 
Knowledge, the other parties thereto. The Financing Commitments are in full 
force and effect and have not been withdrawn or terminated (and no party 
thereto  has indicated an intent to so withdraw or terminate) or otherwise
amended  or  modified in any respect (except that it is acknowledged that,
following the  date  hereof, amounts committed pursuant to the equity
commitment letters  referred to in clause (i) are contemplated to be
decreased in amounts equal  to  the increase in equity provided by the cash
and rollover equity value  represented by new Rollover Commitments) and
neither Parent nor Merger Sub  is in breach of any of the terms or conditions
set forth therein and no event  has occurred which, with or without notice,
lapse of time or both, could  reasonably be expected to constitute a material
breach or failure to satisfy  a  condition precedent set forth therein.
Assuming that the number of  shares to be rolled over pursuant to the
Rollover Commitments are  contributed to Parent or one of its Subsidiaries
prior to the Effective Time,  the proceeds from the Financing constitute all
of the financing required  for the  consummation of Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby, and  are  sufficient for the satisfaction
of all of Parent's and Merger Sub's obligations  under this Agreement,
including the payment of the Merger Consideration and  the  Option and
Stock-Based Consideration. Parent or Merger Sub has fully paid  any  and all
commitment fees or other fees on the dates and to the extent required  by 
the Financing Commitments. The Financing Commitments contain all of the 
conditions precedent to the obligations of the parties thereunder to make 
the  Financing available to Parent on the terms therein. Notwithstanding
anything  in  this Agreement to the contrary, the Debt Commitment Letters
may be superseded  at  the option of Parent or Merger Sub after the date of
this Agreement but prior  to  the Effective Time by the New Financing
Commitments in accordance with Section  5.10.  In such  event, the term
"Financing Commitment" as used herein shall be deemed to include  the New
Financing Commitments to the extent then in effect.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

25  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section  4.5 _Ownership  and Operations of Merger Sub_.  As of  the date
of this Agreement, the authorized capital stock of Merger Sub consists  of
100 shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, all of which are 
validly issued and outstanding. All of the issued and outstanding capital 
stock  of Merger Sub is, and at the Effective Time will be, owned by Parent
or a  direct  or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent. Neither Parent
nor Merger  Sub has  conducted any business other than incident to its
formation and pursuant  to this  Agreement, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby and  the  financing of such transactions.

 

 

Section  4.6 _Finders  or Brokers_.  Except  for Goldman, Sachs and Co.,
neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has  engaged any investment
banker, broker or finder in connection with the  transactions contemplated by
this Agreement who might be entitled to any  fee or  any commission in
connection with or upon consummation of the Merger or the  other transactions
contemplated hereby.

 

 

Section  4.7 _Ownership  of Shares_.  Neither  Parent, as of the date
hereof, nor Merger Sub owns any Shares, beneficially,  of  record or
otherwise. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, Parent or Merger  Sub
will only own those Shares subject to the Rollover Commitments.

 

 

Section  4.8 _Certain Arrangements_. Other than the Voting Agreement, the 
Rollover Commitments entered into on the date of this Agreement and the
Original  LLC Agreement, there are no Contracts between Parent, Merger Sub or
the  Guarantors, on the one hand, and any member of the Company's management
or  directors, on the other hand, as of the date hereof that relate in any
way  to  the Company or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Parent has  provided the Special Committee with true, correct and complete
copies of  the  Voting Agreement, the Rollover Commitments entered into on
the date of this  Agreement and the Original LLC Agreement. Prior to the
Board of Directors  of the Company approving this Agreement, the Voting
Agreement, the Rollover  Commitments entered into on the date of this
Agreement, the Merger and the  other transactions contemplated thereby for
purposes of Section 17-12, 100 _  et. seq._ of the KSA, neither Parent nor
Merger Sub, alone or together with  any other person, has taken any action
that would cause Section 17-12, 100  _et seq._ of the KSA to be applicable to
this Agreement, the Merger, or  any transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

26  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section  4.9 _Investigations;  Litigation_.  There  are no suits, claims,
actions, proceedings, arbitrations, mediations or  investigations pending or,
to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened against  Parent  or any of its
Subsidiaries, other than any such suit, claim, action, proceeding  or
investigation that would have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent 
Material Adverse Effect. As of the date hereof, neither Parent nor any of 
its  Subsidiaries nor any of their respective properties is or are subject
to  any  order, writ, judgment, injunction, decree or award that would have,
individually  or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 

 

Section  4.10 _Guarantees_.  Concurrently with the execution of this
Agreement, each of the Guarantors  has  delivered to the Company the
Guarantees, dated as of the date hereof, in  favor  of the Company, in the
form set forth in Section 4.10 of the Parent Disclosure  Letter, with respect
to the performance by Parent and Merger Sub, respectively,  of their
obligations under this Agreement.

 

 

Section  4.11 _No  Other Information_.  Parent  and Merger Sub acknowledge
that the Company makes no representations or  warranties as to any matter
whatsoever except as expressly set forth in ARTICLE  III.  The 
representations and warranties set forth in ARTICLE III are made solely by 
the  Company, and no Representative of the Company shall have any
responsibility  or  liability related thereto.

 

 

Section  4.12 _Access  to Information; Disclaimer_. Parent  and Merger Sub
each acknowledges and agrees that it (a) has had an opportunity  to discuss
the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries with the management  of the
Company, (b) has had reasonable access to the books and records of  the 
Company, its Subsidiaries and Company Joint Ventures, (c) has been afforded 
the  opportunity to ask questions of and receive answers from officers of the
Company  and (d) has conducted its own independent investigation of the
Company and  its  Subsidiaries, their respective businesses and the
transactions contemplated  hereby, and has not relied on any representation,
warranty or other statement  by  any Person on behalf of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries or Joint Venture  Companies, other than the
representations and warranties of the Company  expressly contained in ARTICLE
III of this Agreement and that all other  representations and warranties are
specifically disclaimed.

(b) Parent  hereby agrees that all information provided to it or its counsel,
financial  advisors, auditors and other authorized representatives in

that  any prospective co-investors or limited partners of the members of
Parent  to  whom Parent provides Confidential Information shall, prior to
receiving such  Confidential Information, agree in writing to be bound by the
confidentiality  provisions of the Confidentiality Agreements or shall
execute their own  confidentiality agreements with the Company.

 

 

Section  5.3 _No  Solicitation_.

 

 

(a) Subject  to Section  5.3(b)-(g)  and (k),  the  Company agrees that
neither it nor any Subsidiary of the Company shall, and  that  it shall
direct its and their respective officers, directors, employees,  agents  and
representatives, including any investment banker, attorney or accountant 
retained by it or any of its Subsidiaries (" _Representatives_ ")  not  to,
directly or indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit, knowingly encourage 
(including by providing information) or facilitate any inquiries, proposals 
or  offers with respect to, or the making or completion of, an Alternative
Proposal,  (ii) engage or participate in any negotiations concerning, or
provide or  cause to be provided any non-public information or data relating
to the Company,  any of its Subsidiaries, any Company Joint Venture, KMP or
KMR in connection  with, or have any discussions with any person relating to,

Proposal, (iii) approve,  endorse or recommend, or propose publicly to
approve, endorse or recommend,  any  Alternative Proposal, (iv) approve,
endorse or recommend, or propose to  approve, endorse or recommend, or
execute or enter into, any letter of intent,  agreement in principle, merger
agreement, acquisition agreement, option  agreement or other similar
agreement relating to any Alternative Proposal,  (v) amend, terminate, waive
or fail to enforce, or grant any consent under,  any confidentiality,
standstill or similar agreement (provided, that the  Company  shall be
permitted to waive any such agreement to permit the counterparty  thereto to
make a non-public offer or proposal to the Board of Directors  (or  Special
Committee) of the Company with respect to an Alternative Proposal  (except
that references in the definition thereof to "20%" shall be deemed  to be 
references to "50%" for purposes of this proviso), or (vi) resolve to 
propose or agree to do any of the foregoing; provided, however, it is
understood  and agreed that any determination or action by the Board of
Directors of  the  Company (acting through its Special Committee) permitted
under Section  5.3(c)  or (d),  or Section  7.1(c)(ii)  shall  not be
deemed to be a breach or violation of this Section 5.3(a). Without  limiting
the foregoing, it is understood that any violation of the foregoing 
restrictions by any Subsidiary of the Company or Representatives of the
Company  or any of its Subsidiaries shall be deemed to be a breach of this
Section  5.3  by the  Company.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

32  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) The  Company shall, shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, and shall
direct  each of  its Representatives to, immediately cease any existing
solicitations,  discussions or negotiations with any Person (other than the
parties hereto)  that  has made or indicated an intention to make an
Alternative Proposal.

 

 

(c) Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary in Section  5.3(a) 
or (b),  the  Company may, in response to an unsolicited Alternative
Proposal which did  not  result from or arise in connection with a breach of
Section  5.3(a)  and  which the Board of Directors of the Company (acting
through its Special  Committee) determines, in good faith, after consultation
with its outside  counsel and financial advisors, may reasonably be expected
to lead to a Superior  Proposal, (i) furnish non-public information with
respect to the Company  and its Subsidiaries and KMP, KMR and any Company
Joint Venture to the person  making such Alternative Proposal and its
Representatives pursuant to a customary  confidentiality agreement no less
restrictive of the other party than the  Confidentiality Agreements; provided
that such confidentiality agreement  need  not contain any standstill or
similar provision, and (ii) participate in  discussions or negotiations with
such person and its Representatives regarding  such Alternative Proposal;
_provided_ ,  _however_ ,  (i)  that Parent shall be entitled to receive an
executed copy of such  confidentiality agreement prior to or substantially
simultaneously with the  Company furnishing information to the person making
such Alternative Proposal  or  its Representatives and (ii) that the Company
shall simultaneously provide  or make available to Parent any material non-
public information concerning  the  Company or any of its Subsidiaries that
is provided to the person making  such  Alternative Proposal or its
Representatives which was not previously provided  or  made available to
Parent.

 

 

(d) Subject  to Section  7.1(c)(ii),  neither  the Board of Directors of

manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, or  publicly propose to withdraw or
modify in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger  Sub, the Recommendation, (ii)
approve any letter of intent, agreement in  principle, acquisition agreement
or similar agreement relating to any  Alternative Proposal or (iii) approve
or recommend, or publicly propose to  approve, endorse or recommend, any
Alternative Proposal. Notwithstanding  the  foregoing, but subject to
Section  5.4(b),  if,  prior to receipt of the Company Stockholder
Approval, the Board of Directors  of  the Company or the Special Committee
determines in good faith, after  consultation with outside counsel, that
failure to so withdraw or modify  its  Recommendation would be inconsistent
with the Board of Directors of the  Company's or the Special Committee's
exercise of its fiduciary duties, the Board  of Directors of the Company or
any committee thereof may withdraw or modify  its  Recommendation.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

33  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(e) The  Company promptly (and in any event within 48 hours) shall advise
Parent orally  and in writing of (i) any Alternative Proposal or indication
or inquiry  with respect to or that would reasonably be expected to lead to
any Alternative  Proposal, (ii) any request for non-public information
relating to the  Company, its Subsidiaries, a Company Joint Venture, KMP or
KMR, other than  requests for information not reasonably expected to be
related to an Alternative  Proposal, and (iii) any inquiry or request for
discussion or negotiation  regarding an Alternative Proposal, including in
each case the identity of  the  person making any such Alternative Proposal
or indication or inquiry and  the  material terms of any such Alternative
Proposal or indication or inquiry  (including copies of any document or
correspondence evidencing such Alternative  Proposal or inquiry). The Company
shall keep Parent reasonably informed on  a  reasonably current basis of the
status (including any material change to  the  terms thereof) of any such
Alternative Proposal or indication or  inquiry.

 

 

(f) Notwithstanding  the foregoing, the Company shall not waive Section 17

respective Affiliates.

Board of Directors  (or the Special Committee) from (i) disclosing to its
stockholders a position  contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated
under the Exchange  Act.

 

 

(h) As  used  in this Agreement, " _Alternative  Proposal_ " shall  mean

than Parent or one of its Subsidiaries for a merger, reorganization, 
consolidation, share exchange, business combination, recapitalization, 
liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving the Company (or 
any  Subsidiary or Subsidiaries of the Company whose business constitutes
20%  or more  of the net revenues, net income or assets of the Company and
its Subsidiaries,  taken as a whole), (ii) any proposal for the issuance by
the Company of  over 20% of its equity securities or (iii) any proposal or
offer to acquire  in any manner, directly or indirectly, over 20% of the
equity securities  or  consolidated total assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, in each case  other than the Merger.

 

 

(i) As  used  in this Agreement, " _Superior  Proposal_ " shall  mean any
Alternative Proposal (i) on terms which the Board of Directors of  the
Company (or the Special Committee) determines in good faith, after 
consultation with the Company's outside legal counsel and financial advisors,
to  be more favorable from a financial point of view to the holders of
Company  Common Stock than the Merger (other than those holders of Company
Common  Stock  who are party to a Rollover Commitment), taking into account
all the terms  and  conditions of such proposal, and this Agreement
(including any proposal or  offer  by Parent to amend the terms of this
Agreement and the Merger during the  5  Business Day period referred to
herein) and (ii) that the Board of  Directors (or Special Committee) believes
is reasonably capable of being  completed, taking into account all financial,
regulatory, legal and other  aspects of such proposal; provided that the
Board of Directors of the Company  (or the Special Committee) shall not so
determine that any such proposal  is a  Superior Proposal prior to the time
that is 5 Business Days after the time  at  which the Company has complied
in all respects with Section  5.3(e)  with  respect to such proposal, and
_provided_   that for  purposes of the definition of "Superior Proposal",
the references to "20%"  in  the definition of Company Acquisition Proposal
shall be deemed to be references  to "50%."

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

34  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(j) Subject  to applicable Law, the Company agrees that neither it nor any
Subsidiary  of the  Company shall, and that it shall direct its
Representatives not to, directly or  indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit,
encourage (including by providing  information) or facilitate any inquiries,
proposals or offers with respect  to,  or the making or completion of, a
KMP/KMR Proposal, (ii) engage or  participate in any negotiations concerning,
or provide or cause to be provided  any non-public information or data
relating to Kinder Morgan Energy Partners,  L.P. or Kinder Morgan Management,
LLC in connection with, or have any  discussions with any person relating to,
an actual or proposed KMP/KMR Proposal,  or otherwise knowingly encourage or
facilitate any effort or attempt to make  or  implement a KMP/KMR Proposal.
As used in this Agreement, a " _KMP/KMR  Proposal_ " shall  mean (i) any
inquiry, proposal or offer from any Person or group of Persons  other than
Parent or one of its Subsidiaries for a merger, consolidation,  dissolution,
recapitalization or other business combination involving Kinder  Morgan
Energy Partners, L.P. or Kinder Morgan Management, LLC or any of their 
respective Subsidiaries, (ii) any proposal for the issuance by Kinder  Morgan

Morgan Energy Partners, L.P. or Kinder Morgan Management, LLC or of the 
consolidated total assets of Kinder Morgan Energy Partners, L.P. or Kinder 
Morgan Management, LLC, in each case other than the Merger.

 

 

(k) Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary in this Section  5.3,  (i) 
none of the provisions of this Section  5.3  that  would require any action
or inaction on the part of a Person that is a  Representative of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries that is also a  Representative of KMP or KMR (or
KMGP when acting in any capacity on behalf  of  or with respect to KMR or
KMP) requires or shall be construed to require  such  Person to take or
refrain from taking any action when acting as a Representative  of KMP or KMR
(or KMGP), and (ii) no action or inaction taken or not taken  by  such
Person when acting as a Representative of KMP or KMR (or KMGP) shall  be 
deemed a breach of this Section  5.3.

(i) Except  as  otherwise agreed in writing by Parent and the applicable
holder thereof,  each  option or other award to purchase shares of Company
Common Stock (each, a  " _Company  Stock Option_ ")  granted under any
employee or director equity plans of the Company (the " _Company  Stock
Plans_ "),  whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding immediately prior
to the  Effective Time shall, as of the Effective Time, become fully vested
and be  converted into the right to receive within three Business Days
following  the  Effective Time an amount in cash in U.S. dollars equal to
the product of  (x) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to such  Company Stock Option and (y) the excess, if any, of the
amount of the  Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share of
Company Common  Stock  subject to such Company Stock Option (or if there is
not any such excess,  zero)  with the aggregate amount of such payment
rounded to the nearest cent (the  aggregate amount of such cash hereinafter
referred to as the " _Option  Consideration_ ")  less  such amounts as are
required to be withheld or deducted under the Code or  any  provision of
U.S., state, local or foreign Tax Law with respect to the making  of  such
payment.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

36  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(ii) Except  as  otherwise agreed in writing by Parent and the applicable
holder thereof,  at the  Effective Time, each right of any kind, contingent
or accrued, to receive  shares  of Company Common Stock or benefits measured
in whole or in part by the value  of  a number of shares of Company Common

(including performance shares, restricted stock,  restricted stock units,
phantom units, deferred stock units and dividend  equivalents), other than
Restricted Shares (as hereinafter defined), shares  acquired by participants
pursuant to the terms of the Company's Employee Stock  Purchase Plan and the
Company's Foreign Subsidiary Employees Stock Purchase  Plan, and Company
Stock Options (each, other than Restricted Shares, Purchase  Plan Shares and
Company Stock Options, a " _Company  Stock-Based Award_ "),  whether vested
or unvested, which is outstanding immediately prior to the  Effective Time
shall cease to represent a right or award with respect to  shares  of
Company Common Stock, shall become fully vested and shall entitle the 
holder  thereof to receive, at the Effective Time an amount in cash equal to
the  Merger  Consideration in respect of each Share underlying a particular
Company  Stock-Based Award (the aggregate amount of such cash, together with
the Option  Consideration, hereinafter referred to as the " _Option  and
Stock-Based Consideration_ ")  less  such amounts as are required to be
withheld or deducted under the Code or  any  provision of U.S., state, local
or foreign Tax Law with respect to the making  of  such payment.

 

 

(iii) Except  as  otherwise agreed in writing by Parent and the applicable
holder thereof,  immediately prior to the Effective Time, each award of
restricted Company  Common  Stock (the " _Restricted  Shares_ ")  shall 
vest in full and be converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration  as provided in Section 2.1(a).

 

 

(iv) At  the  Effective Time, the Company's Employees Stock Purchase Plan
and the Company's  Foreign Subsidiary Employees Stock Purchase Plan (the "
_Stock  Purchase Plans_ ")  shall  terminate. In connection with such

Company Common Stock pursuant to the terms of the Stock Purchase Plans for 
any  purchase period ending prior to the Effective Time and such shares of
Company  Common Stock shall be converted into the right to receive the
Merger  Consideration in accordance with Section  2.1(a).  After  the date
hereof, no participant in the Company\'s Foreign Subsidiary Employees  Stock
Purchase Plan may increase the percentage amount of his or her payroll 
deduction election from those in effect on the date hereof.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

37  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(v) Prior  to  the Effective Time, the Compensation Committee of the Board
of Directors  of the  Company, or the Board of Directors of the Company, as
appropriate, shall  make  such adjustments and amendments to, make such
determinations or take such  actions with respect to Company Stock Plans,
Company Stock Options, Company  Benefit Plans, Company Stock-Based Awards,
Restricted Shares and Purchase  Plan  Shares, including obtaining consents
where necessary, to implement the foregoing  provisions of this Section 
5.5.

 

 

(b) _Employee  Matters_. 

 

 

(i) From  and  after the Effective Time, Parent shall honor all Company
Benefit Plans and  compensation arrangements and agreements in accordance
with their terms as  in  effect immediately before the Effective Time,
provided that nothing herein  shall  limit the right of the Company or
Parent from amending or terminating such  plans, arrangements and agreements
in accordance with their terms. For a  period  of one (1) year following the
Effective Time, Parent shall provide, or shall  cause to be provided, to each
current and former employee of the Company  and its  Subsidiaries other than
such employees covered by collective bargaining  agreements (" _Company 
Employees_ ")  compensation opportunities (excluding the value of equity-
based awards) and  benefits that are substantially comparable, in the
aggregate, to the  compensation opportunities and benefits provided to
Company Employees  immediately before the Effective Time, it being understood
that that the  total  package of such compensation and benefits may be
different from the compensation  and benefits provided to the Company
Employees prior to the Effective  Time.

 

 

(ii) For  all  purposes (including purposes of vesting, eligibility to
participate and level  of  benefits) under the employee benefit plans of
Parent and its Subsidiaries  providing benefits to any Company Employees
after the Effective Time as required  pursuant to this Section  5.5(b) 
(the " _New  Plans_ "),  each  Company Employee shall be credited with his
or her years of service with  the  Company and its Subsidiaries and their
respective predecessors before the  Effective Time, to the same extent as
such Company Employee was entitled,  before  the Effective Time, to credit
for such service under any similar Company  employee benefit plan in which
such Company Employee participated or was  eligible to participate
immediately prior to the Effective Time, provided  that  the foregoing shall
not apply with respect to benefit accrual under any defined  benefit pension
plan (other than the Kinder Morgan Inc. Retirement Plan)  or to  the extent
that its application would result in a duplication of benefits.  In 
addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, to the
extent  permitted by such plans, (A) each Company Employee shall be
immediately eligible  to participate, without any waiting time, in any and
all New Plans to the  extent  coverage under such New Plan is comparable to
a Company Benefit Plan in which  such Company Employee participated
immediately before the consummation of  the  Merger (such plans,
collectively, the " _Old  Plans_ "),  and  (B) for purposes of each New
Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical  and/or vision benefits to any
Company Employee, Parent shall cause all  pre-existing condition exclusions
and actively-at-work requirements of such  New  Plan to be waived for such
employee and his or her covered dependents, unless  such conditions would not
have been waived under the comparable plans of  the  Company or its
Subsidiaries in which such employee participated immediately  prior to the
Effective Time and Parent shall cause any eligible expenses  incurred by such
employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion  of the plan
year of the Old Plan ending on the date such employee's  participation in the
corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into account  under such New Plan
for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance  and  maximum out-of-
pocket requirements applicable to such employee and his or  her  covered
dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been  paid 
in accordance with such New Plan.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

38  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(iii) Nothing  contained herein shall be construed as requiring Parent or the
Surviving  Corporation to continue (or resume) the employment of any
specific  person.

 

 

(iv) Without  limiting the generality of Section  8.10,  no  provision of
this Section  5.5  shall be  construed to create any third party

consummate the transactions  contemplated hereby; provided, however, that in
no event shall the Company  or  any of its Subsidiaries be required to pay
prior to the Effective Time any  fee,  penalties or other consideration to
any third party to obtain any consent  or  approval required for the
consummation of the Merger under any Contract (other  than de minimis amounts
or if Parent and Merger Sub have provided adequate  assurance of repayment).

(b) Subject  to the terms and conditions herein provided and without limiting
the foregoing,  the Company and Parent shall (i) promptly, but in no event
later than  fifteen (15) days after the date hereof, make their respective
filings and  thereafter make any other required submissions under the HSR Act
as promptly  as  reasonably practicable, (ii) use reasonable best efforts to
cooperate with  each other in (x) determining whether any filings are
required to be made  with, or consents, permits, authorizations, waivers or
approvals are required  to  be obtained from, any third parties or other
Governmental Entities in connection  with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement and the consummation of  the  transactions contemplated hereby and
(y) timely making all such filings and  timely seeking all such consents,
permits, authorizations or approvals,  including but not limited to approvals
from the California Public Utilities  Commission, the Colorado Public
Utilities Commission, the Wyoming Public  Services Commission, the Nebraska
Public Utilities Commission and under the  Investment Canada Act and the
Competition Act (Canada) (the " _Specified  Regulatory Clearances_ "), 
(iii) use reasonable best efforts to take, or to cause to be taken, all 
other actions and to do, or to cause to be done, all other things necessary, 
proper or advisable to consummate and make effective the Merger and the
other  transactions contemplated hereby, including taking all such further
action  as  reasonably may be necessary to resolve such objections, if any,
as the United  States Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust Division of the
United States  Department of Justice, state or foreign antitrust enforcement
authorities  or  competition authorities, other Governmental Entities in
connection with the  Specified Regulatory Clearances, or other state or
federal regulatory  authorities of any other nation or other jurisdiction or
any other person  may  assert under Regulatory Law (as hereinafter defined)
with respect to the  Merger  and the other transactions contemplated hereby,
and to avoid or eliminate  each  and every impediment under any Law that may
be asserted by any Governmental  Entity with respect to the Merger so as to
enable the Closing to occur as  soon  as reasonably possible (and in any
event no later than the End Date (as  hereinafter defined)), (iv) subject to
applicable legal limitations and the  instructions of any Governmental
Entity, keep each other apprised of the  status  of matters relating to the
completion of the transactions contemplated by  this  Agreement, including
to the extent permitted by Law promptly furnishing the  other with true and
complete copies of notices or other communications sent  or  received by the
Company or Parent, as the case may be, or any of their  Subsidiaries, to or
from any third party and/or any Governmental Entity with  respect thereto,
and permit the other to review in advance any proposed  communication by such
party to any supervisory or Governmental Entity and  (v)  give the other
reasonable notice of, and, to the extent permitted by such  Governmental
Entity, allow the other to attend and participate at any meeting  with any
Governmental Entity in respect of any filings, investigation or  other 
inquiry or proceeding relating thereto. Notwithstanding anything in this 
Agreement to the contrary, except as provided below, nothing contained in 
this  Agreement shall be deemed to require Parent, any of its Subsidiaries,
the  Company (unless requested by Parent), or the Surviving Corporation or
any  of its  Subsidiaries to take or agree to take any Action of Divestiture
or Limitation.  For purposes of this Agreement, an " _Action  of Divestiture
or Limitation_ " shall  mean (i) executing or carrying out agreements or
submitting to the  requirements of any Governmental Entity providing for a
license, sale or  other  disposition of any material assets or businesses or
material categories of  assets or businesses of the Company and its
Subsidiaries or the holding separate  of any material assets or businesses or
Company capital stock or imposing  or  seeking to impose any material
limitation on the ability of the Company or  any  of its Subsidiaries to own
such assets or to acquire, hold or exercise full  rights of ownership of the
Company's business or on the ability of the Company  to conduct the business
of the Company and its Subsidiaries,  (ii) modification of a Company Permit
or the terms of any Contract with any  customer of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries in a manner that would  materially affect the Company or (iii)
the imposition of any condition or  limitation that would materially affect
the Company on or in connection with  any  approval listed on Section 
6.3(e)  of the  Parent Disclosure Letter (other than any such condition or
limitation to  which  such approval is customarily subject) or that
materially restricts the business  of Parent or that materially restricts the
business of any of the Affiliates  of  Parent. The Company and Parent shall
permit counsel for the other party  reasonable opportunity to review in
advance, and consider in good faith the  views of the other party in
connection with, any proposed written communication  to any Governmental
Entity. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to  the  contrary, the
Company shall, upon the request of Parent, agree to take any  Action of
Divestiture or Limitation so long as such Action of Divestiture  or 
Limitation is binding on the Company only in the event the Closing occurs; 
provided, however, that the Company shall not be required to take, or cause 
to  be taken, any such action with respect to KMP or KMR unless such action
is  approved by the Conflicts and Audit Committee thereof in accordance
with  Section  6.9 of the Partnership Agreement. Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement  to  the contrary, the Company shall not undertake any Action
of Divestiture or  Limitation without the consent of Parent.

(c) Subject  to the rights of Parent in Section  5.12,  and in 
furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties contained 
in  this Section  5.6,  if any  administrative or judicial action or
proceeding, including any proceeding  by a  private party, is instituted (or
threatened to be instituted) challenging  the  Merger or any other
transaction contemplated by this Agreement, each of the  Company and Parent
shall cooperate in all respects with each other and shall  use  their
respective reasonable best efforts to contest and resist any such action  or
proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, 
judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or 
permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts 
consummation of the Merger or any other transactions contemplated hereby. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement,
nothing  in this Section  5.6  shall  limit a party's right to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to Section  7.1(b)(i)  or (ii)  so long as such
party has, prior to such termination, complied with its  obligations under
this Section  5.6.

 

 

(d) For  purposes of this Agreement, " _Regulatory  Law_ " means  any and
all state, federal and foreign statutes, rules, regulations, orders, 
decrees, administrative and judicial doctrines and other Laws requiring
notice  to, filings with, or the consent or approval of, any Governmental
Entity,  or  that otherwise may cause any restriction, in connection with
the Merger and  the  transactions contemplated thereby, including (i) the
Sherman Act of 1890,  the Clayton Antitrust Act of 1914, the HSR Act, the
Federal Trade Commission  Act  of 1914 and all other Laws that are designed
or intended to prohibit, restrict  or regulate actions having the purpose or
effect of monopolization or restraint  of trade or lessening competition
through merger or acquisition, (ii) any  Law governing the direct or indirect
ownership or control of any of the  operations or assets of the Company and
its Subsidiaries or (iii) any Law  with the purpose of protecting the
national security or the national economy  of  any nation.

 

 

Section  5.7 _Takeover  Statute_.  If any "fair price," "moratorium,"
"control share acquisition" or other form of  anti-takeover statute or
regulation shall become applicable to the Merger,  the  Voting Agreement,
the Rollover Commitments or the other transactions  contemplated by this
Agreement after the date of this Agreement, each of  the  Company and Parent
and the members of their respective Boards of Directors  shall  grant such
approvals and take such actions as are reasonably necessary so  that  the
Merger, the Voting Agreement, the Rollover Commitments and the other 
transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as promptly as
practicable  on the terms contemplated herein and otherwise act to eliminate
or minimize  the  effects of such statute or regulation on the Merger, the
Voting Agreement,  the  Rollover Commitments and the other transactions
contemplated  hereby.

 

 

Section  5.8 _Public  Announcements_.  The  Company and Parent will
consult with and provide each other the opportunity  to  review and comment
upon any press release or other public statement or comment  prior to the
issuance of such press release or other public statement or  comment 
relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated herein and shall 
not  issue any such press release or other public statement or comment prior
to  such  consultation except as may be required by applicable Law or by
obligations  pursuant to any listing agreement with any national securities
exchange.  Parent  and the Company agree to issue a joint press release
announcing the execution  and delivery of this Agreement.

Section  5.9 _Indemnification  and Insurance_.

 

 

(a) Parent  and Merger Sub agree that all rights to exculpation,
indemnification and  advancement of expenses for acts or omissions occurring
at or prior to the  Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at
or after the Effective  Time, now existing in favor of the current or former
directors, officers  or  employees (in their capacity as such and not as
stockholders or option holders  of the Company or its Subsidiaries), as the
case may be, of the Company or  its  Subsidiaries or KMP or KMR as provided
in their respective certificates of  incorporation or by-laws or other
organization documents or in any agreement  shall survive the Merger and
shall continue in full force and effect. For  a  period of six (6) years
from the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving  Corporation shall maintain
in effect the exculpation, indemnification and  advancement of expenses
provisions of the Company's and any of its Subsidiaries' (and, unless
otherwise required by the independent directors of Kinder Morgan  Management,
LLC, of KMP\'s and KMR\'s) articles of incorporation and by-laws  or 
similar organization documents in effect immediately prior to the Effective 
Time  or in any indemnification agreements of the Company or its Subsidiaries
(and,  unless otherwise required by the independent directors of Kinder
Morgan  Management, LLC, of KMP\'s and KMR\'s) with any of their respective
directors,  officers or employees in effect as of the date hereof, and shall
not amend,  repeal or otherwise modify any such provisions in any manner that
would  adversely affect the rights thereunder of any individuals who at the
Effective  Time were current or former directors, officers or employees of
the Company  or  any of its Subsidiaries or KMP or KMR; _provided_ , 
_however_ ,  that  all rights to indemnification in respect of any Action
(as hereinafter defined)  pending or asserted or any claim made within such
period shall continue until  the disposition of such Action or resolution of
such claim.

 

 

(b) From  and  after the Effective Time, each of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall,  to  the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law,
indemnify and hold harmless  (and advance funds in respect of each of the
foregoing) each current and  former  director, officer or employee of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries (each,  together with such person's heirs,
executors or administrators, an " _Indemnified  Party_ ")  against any costs
or expenses (including advancing reasonable attorneys' fees  and expenses in
advance of the final disposition of any claim, suit, proceeding  or
investigation to each Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted  by 
Law), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts 
paid in  settlement in connection with any actual or threatened claim,
action, suit,  proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or  investigative (an " _Action_ "),  arising out of,
relating to or in connection with any action or omission  occurring or
alleged to have occurred whether before or after the Effective  Time 
(including acts or omissions in connection with such persons serving as an 
officer, director or other fiduciary in any entity if such service was at 
the  request or for the benefit of the Company); _provided_ ,  _however_ , 
that  neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be liable for any
settlement  effected without either Parent's or the Surviving Corporation's
prior written  consent and Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not be
obligated to  pay  the fees and expenses of more than one counsel (selected
by a plurality of  the  applicable Indemnified Parties) for all Indemnified
Parties in any jurisdiction  with respect to any single such claim, action,
suit, proceeding or  investigation, unless the use of one counsel for such
Indemnified Parties  would  present such counsel with a conflict of interest
that would make such joint  representation inappropriate. It shall be a
condition to the advancement  of any  amounts to be paid in respect of legal
and other fees and expenses that Parent  or the Surviving Corporation receive
an undertaking by the Indemnified Party  to  repay such legal and other fees
and expenses paid in advance if it is ultimately  determined that such
Indemnified Party is not entitled to be indemnified  under  applicable Law.
In the event of any such Action, Parent and the Surviving  Corporation shall
reasonably cooperate with the Indemnified Party in the  defense  of any such
Action.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

42  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(c) For  a  period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, Parent shall
either cause  to be  maintained in effect the current policies of directors'
and officers' liability  insurance and fiduciary liability insurance
maintained by the Company and  its  Subsidiaries or provide substitute
policies or purchase or cause the Surviving  Corporation to purchase, a "tail
policy," in either case of at least the same  coverage and amounts containing
terms and conditions that are not less  advantageous in the aggregate than
such policy with respect to matters arising  on or before the Effective Time;
_provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that  after the Effective Time, Parent shall not
be required to pay with respect  to  such insurance policies in respect of
any one policy year more than 250%  of the  last annual premium paid by the
Company prior to the date hereof in respect  of  the coverages required to
be obtained pursuant hereto, but in such case shall  purchase as much
coverage as reasonably practicable 250% of such last annual  premium; and
further provided that if the Surviving Corporation purchases  a "tail
policy" and the same coverage costs more than 250% of such last annual 
premium, the Surviving Corporation shall purchase the maximum amount of
coverage  that can be obtained for 250% of such last annual premium.

 

 

(d) The  rights of each Indemnified Party hereunder shall be in addition to,
and not  in  limitation of, any other rights such Indemnified Party may have
under the  articles of incorporation or by-laws or other organization
documents of the  Company or any of its Subsidiaries or KMP or KMR or the
Surviving Corporation,  any other indemnification arrangement, the KGCC or
otherwise. The provisions  of  this Section  5.9  shall  survive the
consummation of the Merger and expressly are intended to benefit,  and are
enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties.

 

 

(e) In  the  event Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors  or  assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other person and shall not  be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity in such consolidation  or  merger or (ii) transfers all or
substantially all of its properties and  assets to any person, then, and in
either such case, proper provision shall  be  made so that the successors
and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation,  as the case may be,
shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section  5.9.

 

 

(f) Nothing  in this Section  5.9  shall  limit or restrict any actions
that KMP or KMR (or KMGP when acting in any  capacity on behalf of or with
respect to KMP or KMR) may take or amounts  that  they may expend with
respect to matters related to indemnification or  insurance.

Section  5.10 _Financing_.  Parent  shall use its reasonable best efforts
to obtain the Financing on the terms  and  conditions described in the
Financing Commitments or terms more favorable  to  Parent, including using
its reasonable best efforts (i) to negotiate  definitive agreements with
respect thereto on the terms and conditions contained  in the Financing
Commitments, (ii) to satisfy all conditions applicable to  Parent in such
definitive agreements, (iii) to comply with its obligations  under the
Financing Commitments and (iv) to enforce its rights under the  Financing
Commitments. Parent shall give the Company prompt notice upon becoming  aware
of any material breach by any party of the Financing Commitments or  any 
termination of the Financing Commitments. Parent shall keep the Company
informed  on a reasonably current basis and in reasonable detail of the
status of its  efforts to arrange the Financing and provide to the Company
copies of all  documents related to the Financing (other than any ancillary
documents subject  to confidentiality agreements). In connection with its
obligations under  this Section  5.10,  Parent  shall be permitted to
amend, modify or replace the Debt Commitment Letters  with  new Financing
Commitments, including through co-investment by or financing  from  one or
more other additional parties (the " _New  Financing Commitments_ "), 
_provided_   Parent  shall not permit any replacement of, or amendment or
modification to be made  to,  or any waiver of any material provision or
remedy under, the Debt Commitment   Letter if such replacement (including
through co-investment by or financing  from  one or more other additional
parties), amendment, modification, waiver or  remedy  reduces the aggregate
amount of the Financing required to consummate the  Merger  and the other
transactions contemplated hereby, adversely amends or expands  the 
conditions to the drawdown of the Financing in any respect that would make 
such  conditions less likely to be satisfied, that can reasonably be expected
to  delay  the Closing, or is adverse to the interests of the Company in any
other material  respect. In the event that Parent becomes aware of any event
or circumstance  that makes procurement of any portion of the Financing
unlikely to occur  in the  manner or from the sources contemplated in the
Financing Commitments, Parent  shall notify the Company and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to arrange  as  promptly as practicable any such
portion from alternative sources (including  through co-investment by one or
more other additional parties) on terms and  conditions no less favorable to
Parent or Merger Sub and no more adverse  to the  ability of Parent to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.  The Company
shall provide, and shall cause its Subsidiaries, and shall use  reasonable
best efforts to cause each of its and their respective  Representatives,
including legal and accounting, to provide, and if necessary  shall
reasonably request KMP and KMR to provide, all cooperation reasonably 
requested by Parent in connection with the Financing and the other
transactions  contemplated by this Agreement (provided that such requested
cooperation  does  not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of
the Company and  its  Subsidiaries or KMP or KMR), including (i) providing
reasonably required  information relating to the Company, its Subsidiaries
and KMP and KMR to  the  parties providing the Financing, which shall
include all financial statements  and financial data for the Company and its
Subsidiaries (A) of the type required  by Regulation S-X and Regulation S-K
under the Securities Act and of type  and  form customarily included in
private placements under Rule 144A of the  Securities Act to consummate any
offering of senior or senior subordinated  notes  of the Company (or any
direct or indirect parent thereof), including  replacements thereof prior to
any such information going stale or otherwise  being unusable for such
purpose and (B) all financial statements and information  necessary for the
satisfaction of the conditions set forth in the Debt  Commitment Letter (the
" _Required  Financial Information_ "),  (ii) participating in meetings,
drafting sessions and due diligence  sessions in connection with the
Financing, (iii) assisting in the  preparation of (A) one or more offering
documents or confidential  information memoranda for any of the Debt
Financing (including the execution  and  delivery of one or more customary
representation letters in connection  therewith) and (B) materials for rating
agency presentations,  (iv) reasonably cooperating with the marketing efforts
for any of the Debt  Financing, including providing assistance in the
preparation for, and  participating in, meetings, due diligence sessions and
similar presentations  to  and with, among others, prospective lenders,
investors and rating agencies,  and  (v) executing and delivering (or using
reasonable best efforts to obtain  from advisors), and causing its
Subsidiaries to execute and deliver (or use  reasonable best efforts to
obtain from advisors), and if necessary reasonably  requesting KMP and KMR to
execute and deliver or obtain from advisors, customary  certificates
(including a certificate of the chief financial officer of the  Company with
respect to solvency matters), accounting comfort letters, legal  opinions,
surveys, title insurance or other documents and instruments relating  to
guarantees, the pledge of collateral and other matters ancillary to the 
Financing as may be reasonably requested by Parent in connection with the 
Financing and otherwise reasonably facilitating the pledge of collateral 
and  providing of guarantees contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter;
_provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that no  obligation of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries under any such certificate,  document or instrument (other than
the representation letter referred to  above)  shall be effective until the
Effective Time and none of the Company or any  of  its Subsidiaries shall be
required to pay any commitment or other similar  fee or  incur any other
liability in connection with the Financing prior to the  Effective Time. For
purposes of this Agreement, " _Marketing  Period_ " shall  mean the first
period of 15 consecutive Business Days after the date hereof  throughout
which (A) Parent shall have the Required Financial Information  that the
Company is required to provide to Parent pursuant to this Section  5.10, 
(B) the conditions set forth in Section  6.1  and Section  6.3  (other 
than 6.3(c)) shall be satisfied, and (C) the applicable auditors shall not 
have  withdrawn their audit opinions for any applicable Required Financial 
Information; provided, that (x) such 15 Business Day period shall commence 
no earlier than (i) three Business Days after the condition set forth
in Section  6.1(a)  has been  satisfied, and (y) if such 15 Business Day
period would otherwise end on or  after December 18, 2006, but before January
19, 2007, the Marketing  Period shall end on January 22, 2007.

Section  5.11 [Intentionally  omitted.]

 

 

Section  5.12 _Stockholder  Litigation_.  The  Company shall give Parent
the opportunity to participate, subject to a customary  joint defense
agreement, in, but not control, the defense or settlement of  any 
stockholder litigation against the Company or its directors or officers
relating  to the Merger or any other transactions contemplated hereby;
_provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that no  such settlement shall be agreed to
without Parent's consent. In the event that  (i) a proposed settlement of any
stockholder litigation (of which Parent  has  been advised and kept informed
in accordance with the terms of this Section  5.12)  would  not have a
Company Material Adverse Effect, (ii) Parent does not consent  to such 
proposed settlement and (iii) the ultimate resolution of such litigation  is
less  favorable to the Company and its Subsidiaries than such proposed
settlement,  then such resolution and the effects thereof on the Company and
its Subsidiaries  (to the extent so less favorable) shall not constitute, or
be considered  in  determining the existence or occurrence of, a Company
Material Adverse  Effect.

Section  5.13 _Notification  of Certain Matters_.  The  Company shall give

from any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger or the other 
transactions contemplated hereby or from any person alleging that the
consent  of  such person is or may be required in connection with the Merger
or the other  transactions contemplated hereby, if the subject matter of such
communication  or  the failure of such party to obtain such consent could be
material to the  Company, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, (ii) any
actions, suits,  claims, investigations or proceedings commenced or, to such
party's Knowledge,  threatened against, relating to or involving or otherwise
affecting such  party  or any of its Subsidiaries which relate to the Merger
or the other transactions  contemplated hereby, (iii) the discovery of any
fact or circumstance that,  or the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event
the occurrence or  non-occurrence of which, would cause or result in any of
the Conditions to  the  Merger set forth in Article VI not being satisfied
or satisfaction of those  conditions being materially delayed in violation of
any provision of this  Agreement; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that  the
delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section  5.13  shall  not (x) cure
any breach of, or non-compliance with, any other provision of  this Agreement
or (y) limit the remedies available to the party receiving  such notice. The
Company shall notify Parent, on a reasonably current basis,  of  any events
or changes with respect to any criminal or material regulatory  investigation
or action involving the Company or any of its Affiliates (but,  excluding
traffic violations or similar misdemeanors), and shall reasonably  cooperate
with Parent or its Affiliates in efforts to mitigate any adverse 
consequences to Parent or its Affiliates which may arise (including by 
coordinating and providing assistance in meeting with regulators).

 

 

Section  5.14 _Rule  16b-3_.  Prior  to the Effective Time, the Company
shall take such steps as may be reasonably  requested by any party hereto to
cause dispositions of Company equity securities  (including derivative
securities) pursuant to the transactions contemplated  by  this Agreement by
each individual who is a director or officer of the Company  to  be exempt
under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act in accordance  with 
that certain No-Action Letter dated January 12, 1999 issued by the SEC 
regarding such matters.

 

 

Section  5.15 _Control  of Operations_.  Without  in any way limiting any
party's rights or obligations under this Agreement, the  parties understand
and agree that (i) nothing contained in this Agreement  shall  give Parent,
directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the  Company's
operations prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) prior to the  Effective
Time, the Company shall exercise, consistent with the terms and  conditions
of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over its  operations.

 

 

Section  5.16 _Certain  Transfer Taxes_.  Any  liability arising out of
any real estate transfer Tax with respect to interests  in real property
owned directly or indirectly by the Company or any of its  Subsidiaries
immediately prior to the Merger, if applicable and due with  respect  to the
Merger, shall be borne by the Surviving Corporation or Parent and  expressly
shall not be a liability of stockholders of the Company.

notified Parent in  writing of the determinations described in clause (B)
above, (D) at least 5  Business Days following receipt by Parent of the

Section 6.3(e) have been  satisfied; or

 

 

(d) by  Parent, if:

 

 

(i) the  Company shall have breached or failed to perform any of its

cannot be cured by the End Date, _provided_   that  Parent shall have given
the Company written notice, delivered at least thirty  (30) days prior to

(i) (A) an  Alternative Proposal that reasonably appears to be bona fide
shall have been  made known to the Company or shall have been made directly
to its stockholders  generally or any person shall have publicly announced an
intention (whether  or  not conditional or withdrawn) to make an Alternative
Proposal that reasonably  appears to be bona fide and thereafter, (B) this
Agreement is terminated by  the Company or Parent pursuant to Section 
7.1(b)(i),  Section  7.1(b)(iii)  (so long  as the Alternative Proposal

Meeting) or Section  7.1(d)(i),  and  (C) the Company enters into a
definitive agreement with respect to, or  consummates, a transaction
contemplated by any Alternative Proposal within  twelve (12) months of the
date this Agreement is terminated; _provided_   that for  purposes of this
Section 7.2(a)(i), the references to "20%" in the definition  of

(iii) this  Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 
7.1(d)(i),  (ii) or  (iii); _provided_ ,  that in  the event of a

7.2(a)(iii)  shall  apply only in the event that the Company shall have
willfully breached or  failed  to perform in any material respect any of its
representations, warranties,  covenants or other agreements contained in this
Agreement;

 

 

then  in  any such event under clause (i), (ii) or (iii) of this Section 
7.2(a),  the  Company shall pay to Parent a termination fee of $215 million
in cash (the  " _Termination  Fee_ "),  it  being understood that in no
event shall the Company be required to pay the  Termination Fee on more than
one occasion.

 

 

In  the  event that an Alternative Proposal shall have been made known to
the public  or shall have been made directly to its stockholders generally or
any person  shall have publicly announced an intention (whether or not

termination by the Company pursuant to Section 7.1(c)(i),  without  limiting
the Company's other rights and remedies under this Agreement, this  Section
7.2(b)  shall  only apply in the event that Parent or Merger Sub shall have
willfully breached  or failed to perform in any material respect any of their
representations,  warranties, covenants or other agreements contained in this
Agreement and  (y) at the time of such termination there is no state of facts
or  circumstances that would reasonably be expected to cause the conditions
in  Section 6.1, Section 6.3(a), Section 6.3(b), Section 6.3(d) or Section
6.3(e)  not to be satisfied on the End Date assuming the Closing were to be
scheduled  on  the End Date, (ii) Parent or the Company shall terminate this

demand for payment), and such payment  shall  be made by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account to  be  designated by Parent. In
circumstances in which Expenses or Required Expenses,  as the case may be,
are payable, such payment shall be made to Parent or  the  Company, as the
case may be not later than two Business Days after delivery  to  the Company
or Parent, as the case may be, of an itemization setting forth  in 
reasonable detail all Expenses or Required Expenses, as the case may be
(which  itemization may be supplemented and updated from time to time by
Parent or  the  Company, as the case may be, until the 60th day after Parent

payment), and all such  payments shall be made by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to  an  account to be designated by the Company

(d) In  the  event that the Company shall fail to pay the Termination Fee
and/or Expenses,  or  Parent shall fail to pay the Parent Termination Fee,
required pursuant to  this Section  7.2  when  due, such fee and/or
Expenses, as the case may be, shall accrue interest  for the  period
commencing on the date such fee and/or Expenses, as the case may be,  became
past due, at a rate equal to the rate of interest publicly announced  by 
Citibank, in the City of New York from time to time during such period, as 
such  bank's Prime Lending Rate. In addition, if either party shall fail to
pay such  fee and/or Expenses, as the case may be, when due, the such owing
party shall  also pay to the owed party all of the owed party's costs and
expenses (including  attorneys' fees) in connection with efforts to collect
such fee and/or Expenses,  as the case may be. Parent and the Company
acknowledges that the fees, Expense  reimbursement and the other provisions
of this Section  7.2  are an  integral part of the Merger and that, without
these agreements, Parent and  the  Company would not enter into this
Agreement.

 

 

(e) Each  of  the parties hereto acknowledges that the agreements contained
in this Section  7.2  are an  integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and that  neither the Termination Fee nor the
Parent Termination Fee is a penalty,  but  rather is liquidated damages in a
reasonable amount that will compensate  Parent  and Merger Sub or the
Company, as the case may be, for the efforts and resources  expended and
opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and  in  reliance on
this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of  the 
transactions contemplated hereby, which amount would otherwise be impossible 
to  calculate with precision. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this  Agreement, (i) the Company's right to receive payment of the Parent
Termination  Fee pursuant to this Section  7.2  or the  guarantee thereof
pursuant to the Guarantees shall be the exclusive remedy  of  the Company
against Parent, Merger Sub, the Guarantors or any of their  respective
stockholders, partners, members, directors, Affiliates, officers  or  agents
for (x) the loss suffered as a result of the failure of the Merger  to be 
consummated and (y) any other losses, damages, obligations or liabilities 
suffered as a result of or under this Agreement and the transactions 
contemplated hereby, and upon payment of the Parent Termination Fee in 
accordance with this Section  7.2,  none of  Parent, Merger Sub or the
Guarantors, or any of their respective stockholders,  partners, members,
directors, officers or agents, as the case may be, shall  have  any further
liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement  or the
transactions contemplated by hereby (except that Parent also shall  be 
obligated with respect to the provisions of Section  7.2(d),  Section 
5.2(b)  and Section  8.2,  it  being understood that no other person
(including the Guarantors) shall  have any liability or obligation under or
with respect to such provisions);  and  (ii) upon payment of the Company
Termination Fee, in accordance with this  Section 7.2, except as set forth in
Section 7.1(d), none of the Company or  any  of its respective stockholders,
directors, officers or agents, as the case  may  be, shall have any further
liability or obligation relating to or arising  out of  this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby (except that the Company  also shall be
obligated with respect to the provisions of Section 7.2(d)  and  5.2(b), it
being understood that no other person shall have any liability  or 
obligation under or with respect to such provisions).
