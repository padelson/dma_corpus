1.1    (vi)    AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER    This Agreement and
Plan of Merger is dated as of March 15, 2001, among Enbridge Inc., a Canadian
corporation ("Parent"), Marlin Acquisition, Inc., a Texas corporation and an
indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("Sub"), and Midcoast Energy
Resources, Inc., a Texas corporation (the "Company").   WHEREAS, the
respective Boards of Directors of each of Parent, Sub and the Company have
approved the acquisition of the Company by Parent on the terms and subject to
the conditions of this Agreement and Plan of Merger (this "Agreement");  
WHEREAS, in order to effect such acquisition of the Company, the
respective Boards of Directors of each of Parent, Sub and the Company have
approved the merger of the Sub with and into the Company (the "Merger"), upon
the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, whereby each
issued and outstanding share of common stock, $.01 par value, of the Company
(singularly "Share" and plurally "Shares") not owned directly or indirectly
by Parent or the Company, except Shares held by persons who object to the
Merger and comply with all of the provisions of Texas law concerning the
right of holders of Shares to dissent from the Merger and require appraisal
of their Shares ("Dissenting Shareholders"), will be converted into the right
to receive $27.00 per Share; and   WHEREAS, Parent, Sub and the Company
desire to make certain representations, warranties and agreements in
connection with the Merger and also to prescribe various conditions to the
Merger;   NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the
representations, warranties and agreements herein contained, the parties
agree as follows:   ARTICLE I   THE MERGER   1.1 The Merger. Upon the
terms and subject to the conditions hereof and in accordance with the Texas
Business Corporation Act (the "TBCA"), the Sub shall be merged with and into
the Company at the Effective Time (as defined below). Following the Merger,
the separate corporate existence of Sub shall cease and the Company shall
continue as the surviving corporation (the "Surviving Corporation") and shall
succeed to and assume all the rights and obligations of Sub in accordance
with the TBCA.   1.2 Effective Time. As soon as practicable following the
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VI, the parties
shall file articles of merger or other appropriate documents with the
Secretary of State of Texas (in any such case, the "Articles of Merger")
executed in accordance with the relevant provisions of the TBCA. The Merger
shall become effective at such time as the Articles of Merger are duly filed
with the Secretary of State of Texas or at such other time as Sub and the
Company shall agree should be specified in the Articles of Merger (the time
the Merger becomes effective being the "Effective Time").    1.3 Effects
of the Merger. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in Article 5.06 of
the TBCA.   1.4 Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws.   (a) The Articles
of Incorporation of Sub, as in effect at the Effective Time, shall be the
Articles of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter
changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable law, provided that
such Articles of Incorporation shall be amended hereby as of the Effective
Time to change the name of the Surviving Corporation to Enbridge Midcoast
Energy, Inc.   (b) The bylaws of Sub as in effect at the Effective Time
shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or
amended as provided therein or by applicable law.   1.5 Directors. The
persons listed in Schedule II to this Agreement shall be the initial
directors of the Surviving Corporation and shall hold office until the
earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective successors
are duly elected and qualified, as the case may be.   1.6 Officers. The
persons listed in Schedule III to this Agreement shall be the initial
officers of the Surviving Corporation and shall hold office until the earlier
of their resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly
elected and qualified, as the case may be.   1.7 Effect on Capital Stock. As
of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of the holder of any Shares:   (a) Capital Stock of Sub. Each issued
and outstanding share of the capital stock of Sub shall be converted into and
become one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $.01
per share, of the Surviving Corporation.   (b) Cancellation of Treasury
Shares and Parent Owned Shares. All Shares that are owned directly or
indirectly by the Company as treasury stock or by any wholly owned subsidiary
of the Company and any Shares owned by Parent, Sub or any other wholly owned
subsidiary of Parent shall be canceled, and no consideration shall be
delivered in exchange therefor.   (c) Conversion of Shares. At the Effective
Time, each issued and outstanding Share (other than Shares to be canceled in
accordance with Section 1.7(b)) shall be converted into the right to receive
from the Surviving Corporation in cash, without interest, $27.00 per Share
(the "Merger Consideration").   1.8 Shares of Dissenting Shareholders.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any issued and
outstanding shares held by a Dissenting Shareholder shall not be converted as
described in Section 1.7(c) but shall become the right to receive such
consideration as may be determined to be due to such Dissenting Shareholder
pursuant to the laws of the State of Texas; provided, that Shares  
-2-   outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a
Dissenting Shareholder who shall, after the Effective Time, withdraw such
Dissenting Shareholder\'s demand for appraisal or lose such Dissenting
Shareholder\'s right of appraisal, in either case pursuant to the TBCA, shall
be deemed to be converted, as of the Effective Time, into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration. The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt
notice of any written demands for appraisal of Shares received by the Company
and (ii) the opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to any such demands. The Company shall not, without the prior written
consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payments with respect to, or settle,
offer to settle or otherwise negotiate, any such demands.   1.9 Further
Assurances. If at any time after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall consider or be advised that any deeds, bills of sale,
assignments or assurances or any other acts or things are
necessary, desirable or proper (a) to vest, perfect or confirm, of record or
otherwise, in the Surviving Corporation, its right, title or interest in, to
or under any of the rights, privileges, powers, franchises, properties or
assets of either of the constituent corporations to the Merger or (b)
otherwise to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, the Surviving
Corporation and its appropriate officers and directors or their designees
shall be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of
either of the constituent corporations to the Merger, all such deeds, bills
of sale, assignments and assurances and do, in the name and on behalf of such
constituent corporations, all such other acts and things necessary, desirable
or proper to vest, perfect or confirm its right, title or interest in, to or
under any of the rights, privileges, powers, franchises, properties or assets
of such constituent corporation and otherwise to carry out the purposes of
this Agreement.   1.10 Closing. The closing of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement (the "Closing") shall take place at the offices of
Fulbright and Jaworski L.L.P., 1301 McKinney Street, Suite 5100, Houston, Texas
77010, at 10:00 a.m., Houston time, on the second business day after the day
on which the last of the conditions set forth in Article VI shall have been
fulfilled or waived or at such other time and place as Parent, Sub and the
Company shall agree.   ARTICLE II   EXCHANGE PROCEDURE   2.1 Exchange
of Certificates.   (a) Paying Agent. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent
shall select a bank or trust company to act as paying agent (the "Paying
Agent") for the payment of the Merger Consideration upon surrender of
certificates representing Shares.   (b) Parent to Provide Funds. Parent
shall take all steps necessary to enable and cause the Surviving Corporation
to provide the Paying Agent on a timely basis funds necessary to pay for the
Shares pursuant to Section 1.7(c).   -3-    (c) Exchange Procedure.
Promptly after the Effective Time, the Paying Agent shall mail to each holder
of record of a certificate or certificates that immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented Shares (the "Certificates"), other than the
Company, Parent and any subsidiary of the Company or Parent, (i) a letter of
transmittal which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of
the Certificates to the Paying Agent and which shall be in a form and have
such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify and (ii) instructions
for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the
Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the
Paying Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by the
Surviving Corporation, together with such letter of transmittal, duly
executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the
Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor the amount of cash into which the Shares theretofore
represented by such Certificate shall have been converted pursuant to Section
1.7(c), and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. No
interest will be paid or will accrue on the cash payable upon the surrender
of any Certificate. If payment is to be made to a person other than the
person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered, it shall
be a condition of payment that such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or
otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the person requesting such
payment shall pay any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the
payment to a person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or
establish to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such tax has
been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this
Section 2.1, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective
Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the amount of
cash, without interest, into which the Shares theretofore represented by such
Certificate shall have been converted pursuant to Section 1.7(c).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Paying Agent nor any party shall
be liable to a former shareholder of the Company for any cash or interest
delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar laws. If any Certificates shall not have been surrendered
prior to seven years after the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such
earlier date on which any payment pursuant to this Section 2.1
would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any governmental body or
agency) the payment in respect of such Certificate shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable law, become the property of the Surviving
Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any person
previously entitled thereto. Any funds made available to the Paying Agent
that remain unclaimed by holders of Certificates for six months after the
Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation upon demand
and any holder of Certificates who has not theretofore complied with this
Section 2.1(c) shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for
payment of their claim for Merger Consideration.   (d) No Further Ownership
Rights in Shares. All cash paid upon the surrender of Certificates in
accordance with the terms of this Article II shall be deemed to have been
paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Shares theretofore
represented by such Certificates. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer
books of the Company shall be closed, and no further registration of
transfers of Shares thereafter shall be made. If, after the Effective
Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason,
they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article II.  
-4-    ARTICLE III   REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES   3.1
Representations and Warranties of the Company. The Company represents and
warrants to, and agrees with, Parent and Sub as follows, subject to
any exceptions specified in the Disclosure Document in the form attached
hereto as Schedule I to the extent that such exceptions reference a specific
section of this Article III:   (a) Organization, Standing and Power. The
Company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the State of Texas and has the requisite corporate
power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on
its business as now being conducted. The Company is duly qualified to do
business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature of
its business or the ownership or leasing of its properties makes such
qualification necessary, other than in such jurisdictions where the failure
to be so qualified to do business or in good standing (individually or in the
aggregate) would not have, or would not reasonably be likely to have, a
material adverse effect (as defined in Section 9.3(b)) on the Company.  
(b) Subsidiaries. Each of the Company\'s subsidiaries (and its jurisdiction
of organization) is listed in Section 3.1(b) of the Disclosure Schedule. The
Company\'s subsidiaries are corporations, limited liability companies or
partnerships that are duly organized, validly existing and in good standing
under the laws of their respective jurisdictions of organization and have the
requisite corporate power and authority (or comparable power and authority in
the case of limited liability companies or partnerships) to own and operate
their respective properties and to carry on their respective businesses as
they are now being conducted. Each of the Company\'s subsidiaries is
duly qualified to do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in
which the nature of its respective businesses or the ownership or leasing of
its respective properties makes such qualification necessary, other than in
such jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified or in good standing
would not have, or would not reasonably be likely to have, a material adverse
effect on the Company. All of the outstanding shares of capital stock of the
Company\'s subsidiaries that are corporations, and all the ownership
interests of the Company in its other subsidiaries, have been duly authorized
and validly issued and are, except in the case of any subsidiary that is a
partnership, fully paid and non-assessable and were not issued in violation
of any preemptive rights or other preferential rights of subscription or
purchase of any person. All such stock and ownership interests of each of the
Company\'s subsidiaries are owned of record and beneficially by the Company
or by a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, free and clear of all liens,
mortgages, pledges, security interests, charges, claims and other
encumbrances of any kind or nature ("Liens"). Except for the capital stock
of, or ownership interests in, its subsidiaries, the Company does not own,
directly or indirectly, any capital stock, equity interest or other ownership
interest in any corporation, partnership, association, joint venture, limited
liability company or other entity.   (c) Capital Structure. As of the date
hereof, the authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 31,250,000
shares of common stock, $.01 par value ("Company Common Stock"), and
5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $.01 par value ("Company Preferred
Stock"). At the close of   -5-   business on March 14, 2001, (i)
12,552,893 Shares were issued and outstanding; (ii) 909,864 Shares were
reserved for issuance pursuant to options or stock awards granted under the
Company\'s 1996 Incentive Stock Option Plan, the 1997 Non-Employee Director
Stock Option Plan and the Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "Company\'s Stock
Plans"), (iii) 341,136 Shares were reserved for issuance pursuant to options
or stock awards not yet granted under the Company\'s Stock Plans, (iv)
270,271 Shares were reserved for issuance pursuant to outstanding warrants
and (v) no shares of Company Preferred Stock were issued or outstanding.
There are no outstanding stock appreciation rights ("SARs"). The Shares are
listed on the American Stock Exchange. Except as set forth above, no shares
of capital stock or other equity or voting securities of the Company
are reserved for issuance or are outstanding. All outstanding shares of
capital stock of the Company are, and all such Shares issuable upon the
exercise of stock options, stock awards or warrants will be when issued
thereunder, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and not subject to
preemptive rights. Except for Shares issued on exercise of options or
warrants, no capital stock has been issued by the Company since the Company
Balance Sheet Date (as defined in Section 3.1(e)), other than Shares issued
pursuant to options outstanding on or prior to such date in accordance with
their terms at such date. Except for options described above and warrants
described above, as of the date hereof there are no outstanding or authorized
securities, options, warrants, calls, rights, commitments, preemptive rights,
agreements, arrangements or undertakings of any kind to which the Company or
any of its subsidiaries is a party, or by which any of them is bound,
obligating the Company or any of its subsidiaries to issue, deliver or sell,
or cause to be issued, delivered or sold, any shares of capital stock or
other equity or voting securities of, or other ownership interests in, the
Company or of any of its subsidiaries or obligating the Company or any of its
subsidiaries to issue, grant, extend or enter into any such security, option,
warrant, call, right, commitment, agreement, arrangement or undertaking. Each
outstanding warrant to purchase Shares will, at the Effective Time, be
exercisable by the holder thereof only for the Merger Consideration. True and
correct copies of all agreements, instruments and other governing documents
relating to the Company\'s Stock Plans have been furnished to Parent.   (d)
Authority; Non-contravention. The Company has the requisite corporate power
and authority to enter into this Agreement and, subject to Company
Shareholder Approval (as defined in Section 3.1(j)), to consummate the Merger
and other transactions contemplated hereby and to take such actions, if any,
as shall have been taken with respect to the matters referred to in
Section 3.1(j). The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company
and the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby
have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of
the Company, subject to Company Shareholder Approval. This Agreement has been
duly and validly executed and delivered by the Company and constitutes a
valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company
in accordance with its terms, except as (i) such enforcement may be subject
to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws
or judicial decisions now or hereafter in effect relating to creditors\'
rights generally and (ii) the remedy of specific performance and injunctive
relief may be subject to equitable defenses and to the discretion of the
court before which any proceeding therefor may be brought. The execution and
delivery of this Agreement by the Company do not, and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and compliance with the provisions hereof
will not, conflict with, or result in any violation of, or default (with or
without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise to a right of
termination, cancellation or acceleration of or "put" right with respect to
any obligation or to loss of a material benefit under, or result in the
creation of any lien, security   -6-   interest, charge or encumbrance on
any of the properties or assets of the Company or any of its subsidiaries
under, any provision of (i) the Restated Articles of Incorporation, as
amended to the date hereof or bylaws of the Company (the "Company Charter")
or any provision of the comparable organizational documents of its
subsidiaries, (ii) any loan or credit agreement, note, bond, mortgage,
indenture, lease, or other agreement, instrument, permit, concession,
franchise or license applicable to the Company or any of its subsidiaries or
their respective properties or assets or (iii) subject to governmental
filings and other matters referred to in the following sentence, any
judgment, order, decree, statute, law, ordinance, rule or regulation
or arbitration award applicable to the Company or any of its subsidiaries or
their respective properties or assets, other than, in the case of clauses
(ii) and (iii), any such conflicts, violations, defaults, rights or liens,
security interests, charges or encumbrances that individually or in the
aggregate would not have, or would not reasonably be likely to have, a
material adverse effect on the Company and would not, or would not reasonably
be likely to, materially impair the ability of the Company to perform its
obligations hereunder or prevent the consummation of any of the transactions
contemplated hereby. No consent, approval, order or authorization of, or
registration, declaration or filing with, any court, administrative agency or
commission or other governmental authority or agency, domestic or foreign,
including local authorities (a "Governmental Entity"), is required by or with
respect to the Company or any of its subsidiaries in connection with the
execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company or the consummation
by the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby, except for (i) the
filing of a premerger notification and report form by the Company under the
Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the "HSR
Act"), (ii) a notice filing under the Competition Act (Canada), (iii) the
filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") of (A) a proxy
statement relating to the Company Shareholder Approval (such proxy statement
as amended or supplemented from time to time, the "Proxy Statement") and (B)
such reports under Section 13(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended (the "Exchange Act"), as may be filed in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, and (iv) the filing of
the Articles of Merger with the Secretary of State of Texas with respect to
the Merger as provided in the TBCA and appropriate documents with the
relevant authorities of other jurisdictions in which the Company is qualified
to do business and such other consents, approvals, orders, authorizations,
registrations, declarations and filings the failure of which to be obtained
or made would not have, or would not reasonably be likely to have, a material
adverse effect on the Company.   (e) SEC Documents. The Company has filed
all required reports, schedules, forms, statements and other documents with
the SEC since January 1, 1998 (such documents, together with all exhibits and
schedules thereto and documents incorporated by reference therein, as
amended, if applicable, collectively referred to herein as the "SEC
Documents"). As of their respective dates, the SEC Documents complied in all
material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (the "Securities Act"), or the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and
the rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder applicable to
such SEC Documents, and none of the SEC Documents contained any untrue
statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The
consolidated financial statements of the Company included in the SEC
Documents comply in all material respects with applicable
accounting requirements and the published rules and regulations of the SEC
with respect thereto, have been prepared in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles (except, in the case of unaudited statements,
as permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC)   -7-   applied on a consistent
basis during the periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes
thereto) and fairly present the consolidated financial position of the
Company and its consolidated subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the
consolidated results of their operations and cash flows for the periods then
ended (subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to normal year-end audit
adjustments and other adjustments described therein). There is no liability
or obligation of any kind, whether accrued, contingent, absolute, determined,
determinable or otherwise, of the Company or any subsidiary of the Company
which is required by generally accepted accounting principles to be reflected
or reserved against or otherwise disclosed in the most recent financial
statements of the Company included in the SEC Documents which is not so
reflected or reserved against that individually or in the aggregate
would have a material adverse effect on the Company. For purposes of this
Agreement, "Company Balance Sheet" means the consolidated balance sheet as of
September 30, 2000 set forth in the Company\'s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q
for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2000 and "Company Balance Sheet
Date" means September 30, 2000.   (f) Proxy Statement. None of the
information supplied or to be supplied by the Company for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement relating to the Shareholder
Meeting (defined below) will, at the date the Proxy Statement is mailed to
the Company\'s shareholders and at the time of the Company\'s shareholders
meeting convened for the purpose of obtaining the Company Shareholder
Approval (the "Shareholder Meeting"), contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. If at any time prior
to the Effective Time any event with respect to the Company, its officers and
directors or any of its subsidiaries shall occur which is required to
be described in the Proxy Statement, such event shall be so described, and
an amendment or supplement shall be filed promptly with the SEC and, as
required by law, disseminated to the shareholders of the Company. The Proxy
Statement, as it relates to the Shareholder Meeting, will comply as to form
in all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the
rules and regulations thereunder, except that no representation or warranty
is made by the Company in this Section 31 with respect to statements made or
incorporated by reference therein based on information supplied by Parent or
Sub in writing for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy
Statement.   (g) Absence of Certain Changes or Events. Except as disclosed
in the SEC Documents filed with the SEC prior to the date hereof, since the
Company Balance Sheet Date, the Company and its subsidiaries have conducted
their business only in the ordinary course consistent with past practice, and
there has not been   (i) any event, occurrence, circumstance or development
that  has had, or has been reasonably likely to have, a material adverse 
effect with respect to the Company;   (ii) any declaration, setting aside or
payment of any dividend  (whether in cash, stock or property) with respect to

outstanding shares of capital stock or other equity  securities of, or other
ownership interests in, the Company or any  subsidiary of the Company;  
-8-    (iii) any amendment of any term of any outstanding security of  the
Company or any subsidiary of the Company that would materially  increase the
obligations of the Company or such subsidiary under such  security;   (iv)
(A) any incurrence or assumption by the Company or any  subsidiary of the
Company of any indebtedness for borrowed money  other than under existing
credit facilities (or any renewals,  replacements or extensions thereof that
do not materially increase  the commitments thereunder) in the ordinary
course of business  consistent with past practices, or (B) any guaranty,
endorsement or  other incurrence or assumption of liability, whether
directly,  contingently or otherwise, by the Company or any subsidiary of
the  Company for the obligations of any other person (other than any 
subsidiary of the Company), other than in the ordinary course of  business
consistent with past practice or in connection with the  obligations of the
Company and its subsidiaries assumed at the  Effective Time;   (v) any
creation or assumption by the Company or any  subsidiary of the Company of
any Lien on any material asset of the  Company or any subsidiary of the
Company other than in the ordinary  course of business consistent with past

of the Company of  any contract, license or other right (including any
insurance policy  naming it as a beneficiary or loss payable payee) that
reasonably  would be likely to have a material adverse effect on the
Company,  other than transactions, commitments, contracts or agreements in
the  ordinary course of business consistent with past practices and those 
contemplated by this Agreement;   (viii) (A) any granting by the Company or
any of its subsidiaries  to any officer of the Company or any of its

of business  consistent with prior practice or as was required under
employment  agreements in effect as of the Company Balance Sheet Date, (B)
any  granting by the Company or any of its subsidiaries to any such  officer
of any increase in severance or termination pay, except as  was required
under employment, severance or termination agreements in  effect as of the
Company Balance Sheet Date, or (C) except in  accordance with past practice
as to officers, any entry by the  Company or any of its subsidiaries into any
employment, severance or  termination agreement with any such officer;  
-9-    (ix) any damage, destruction or loss, whether or not covered by 
insurance, that has or reasonably could be expected to have a  material
adverse effect on the Company;   (x) any change in accounting methods,
principles or practices  by the Company materially affecting its assets,
liabilities or  business, except insofar as may have been required by a
change in  generally accepted accounting principles; or   (xi) any event
which, if it had taken place following the  execution of this Agreement,
would not have been permitted by Section  4.1.   (h) No Undisclosed
Material Liabilities. Section 3.1(h) of the Disclosure Schedule lists all
liabilities or obligations, whether pursuant to contracts or otherwise, of
any kind whatsoever incurred by the Company or any subsidiary of the Company
whether accrued, contingent, absolute, determined, determinable or otherwise,
other than:   (i) liabilities or obligations which, individually and in
the  aggregate, have not had and are not reasonably likely to have a 
material adverse effect on the Company or   (ii) liabilities or obligations
under this Agreement or  incurred in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby.   (i) No Default. Neither the Company nor any of its
subsidiaries is in default or violation (and no event has occurred which,
with notice or the lapse of time or both, would constitute a default or

Company and its subsidiaries, their respective certificate or articles of
incorporation and bylaws or other organizational documents, (ii) any note,

properties or assets may be bound or (iii) any order, writ, injunction,
decree, statute, rule or regulation applicable to the Company or any of its
subsidiaries, except in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) for defaults or

the Company.   (j) State Takeover Statutes; Absence of Supermajority
Provision. The Company has taken all action to assure that no state takeover
statute or similar statute or regulation shall apply to the Merger or any of
the other transactions contemplated hereby. Except for the approval of the
Merger by the holders of a majority of the voting power of Shares entitled to
vote at the meeting of shareholders held for such purpose, voting together as
a class pursuant to which each Share is entitled to one vote ("Company
Shareholder Approval"), no other shareholder action on the part of the
Company is required for approval of the Merger and the transactions
contemplated hereby.   (k) Litigation. There is no suit, action, proceeding
or investigation pending or, to the Company\'s knowledge, threatened against

the ability of the Company to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, nor is there any judgment, decree, injunction, rule or order
of any Governmental Entity or arbitrator outstanding against the Company or

Company as defined in the preamble of this Agreement and any member of a
controlled group or affiliated service group, as defined in sections 414(b),
(c), (m) and (o) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended ("Code"),
of which the Company is a member. As used in this Section 3.1(1), "Company
Benefit Plan" shall mean (1) any employee welfare benefit plan or employee
pension benefit plan as defined in sections 3(1) and 3(2) of the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA"), including, but
not limited to, a plan that provides retirement income or results in
deferrals of income by employees for periods extending to their
terminations of employment or beyond, and a plan that provides medical,
surgical or hospital care benefits or benefits in the event of sickness,
accident, disability, death or unemployment and (2) any other material

including without limitation, any deferred compensation plan, incentive plan,

three-year period ending on the date of this Agreement, or with respect to
which the Employer may have any liability.   (i) Section 3.1(l)(i) of the
Disclosure Schedule contains a  complete and correct list of all Company
Benefit Plans. With respect  to each Company Benefit Plan, except as
disclosed in Section  3.1(l)(i) of the Disclosure Schedule, to the extent
applicable: (A)  the plan is in substantial compliance with the Code and
ERISA,  including all reporting and disclosure requirements of Part 1 of 
Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA; (B) the appropriate Form 5500 has  been
timely filed for each year of its existence or a "top-hat"  statement was
timely filed with the Department of Labor pursuant to  Department of Labor
Regulation section 2520.104-23; (C) there has  been no transaction described
in section 406 or section 407 of ERISA  or section 4975 of the Code unless
exempt under section 408 of ERISA  or section 4975 of the Code, as
applicable; (D) the bonding  requirements of section 412 of ERISA have been
satisfied; (E) there  is no issue pending nor any issue resolved adversely to
the Employer  which may subject the Employer to the payment of a penalty,
interest,  tax or other amount, (F) the plan can be unilaterally terminated
or  amended by the Employer on no more than 90 days notice; (G) all 
contributions or other amounts payable by the Employer as of the  Effective
Time with respect to the plan have either been paid or  accrued in the
Employer\'s most recent financial statements included  in the SEC Documents
and (H) no notice has been given or received by  the Employer of an increase
or proposed increase in the cost of the  plan. There are no pending or, to
the Company\'s knowledge, threatened  or anticipated claims (other than
routine claims for   -11-    benefits), actions, arbitrations,
investigations or suits by, on  behalf of, against or relating to any Company
Benefit Plan or their  related trusts. With respect to each Company Benefit
Plan, the  Company has provided to Parent true and correct copies of each of
the  following documents, to the extent applicable to such plan:   (A) the
Company Benefit Plan and any amendments thereto  (or if the Company Benefit
Plan is not a written agreement, a  description thereof);   (B) the three
most recent annual Form 5500 reports filed  with the Internal Revenue Service
("IRS");   (C) the most recent statement filed with the Department  of

funding of the Company  Benefit Plan;   (H) the most recent financial
statement; and   (I) the most recent determination letter received from 
the IRS with respect to each Company Benefit Plan that is  intended to
qualify under section 401 of the Code.   (ii) Neither the Company nor any
entity (whether or not  incorporated) that was at any time during the six
years before the  date of this Agreement treated as a single employer
together with the  Company under section 414 of the Code has ever maintained,
had any  obligation to contribute to or incurred any liability with respect
to  a pension plan that is or was subject to the provisions of Title IV  of
ERISA or section 412 of the Code. During the last six years, the  Employer
has not maintained, had an obligation to contribute to or  incurred any
liability with respect to a voluntary employees  beneficiary association that
is or was intended to satisfy the  requirements of section 501(c)(9) of the
Code. No plan, arrangement  or agreement with any one or more employees will
cause the Employer  to have liability for severance pay as a result of the
Merger, except  as disclosed in Section 3.1(1)(ii) of the Disclosure
Schedule. Except  as disclosed in Section 3.1(1)(ii) of   -12-    the
Disclosure Schedule, the Employer does not provide employee  benefits,
including without limitation, death, post-retirement  medical or health
coverage (whether or not insured) or contribute to  or maintain any employee
benefit plan which provides for benefit  coverage following termination of
employment except as is required by  section 4980B(f) of the Code or other
similar applicable statute, nor  has it made any representations, agreements,
covenants or commitments  to provide that coverage. Any employee benefit plan
that is disclosed  on Section 3.1(l)(ii) of the Disclosure Schedule has, at
all times  since its inception, provided that the sponsor of the plan has
the  right to amend and terminate the plan at any time without the consent 
of any party and no statements have been made to plan participants or  their
dependents that would lead such persons to reasonably conclude  the plan may
not be amended or terminated without their consent. All  Company Benefit
Plans that are group health plans have been operated  in material compliance
with section 4980B(f) of the Code.   (iii) All Company Benefit Plans that
are intended to qualify  under section 401(a) of the Code have been submitted
to and approved  as qualifying under section 401(a) of the Code by the IRS or
the  applicable remedial amendment period will not have ended prior to the 
Effective Time.   (iv) The transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
either  alone or in conjunction with another event (such as termination of 
employment) will not accelerate the time of payment or vesting, or  increase
the amount, of compensation directly or indirectly due any  person from the
Employer.   (v) With respect to any entity (whether or not incorporated) 
that is both treated as a single employer together with the Company  under
section 414 of the Code and located outside of the United  States, any
benefit plans maintained by it for the benefit of its  directors, officers,
employees or former employees (or any of their  beneficiaries) are in
compliance with applicable laws pertaining to  such plans in the jurisdiction
of such entity, except where such  failure to be in compliance would not,
either individually or in the  aggregate, have a material adverse effect on
the Company.   (m) Taxes. The Company and each of its subsidiaries, and
any consolidated, combined, unitary or aggregate group for Tax purposes of
which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is or has been a member, has
timely filed (taking into account any extensions) all Tax Returns required to
be filed by it on or before the Effective Time and has timely paid or
deposited (or the Company has paid or deposited on its behalf) all Taxes and
estimated Taxes which are required to be paid or deposited before the
Effective Time. Each of the Tax Returns filed by the Company or any of its
subsidiaries is accurate and complete in all material respects and has been
completed in all material respects in accordance with applicable laws. The
Company Balance Sheet reflects an adequate reserve for all Taxes payable by
the Company and its subsidiaries for all taxable periods and portions thereof
through the date thereof. Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries has
waived any statute of limitations in respect of Taxes of the Company, such
subsidiary or any group of such entities. No material deficiencies for any
Taxes have been   -13-   proposed, asserted or assessed against the
Company or any of its subsidiaries, no requests for waivers of the time to
assess any such Taxes have been granted or are pending, and there are no Tax
Liens upon any assets of the Company or any of its subsidiaries (except for
liens for ad valorem Taxes not yet delinquent and other Taxes not yet due and
payable). There are no current examinations of any Tax Return of the Company
or any of its subsidiaries being conducted and there are no settlements of
any prior examinations which could reasonably be expected to adversely affect
any taxable period for which the statute of limitations has not run. Neither
the Company nor any subsidiary of the Company is a party to a Tax allocation
agreement, Tax sharing agreement, Tax indemnity agreement or similar
agreement or arrangement. The Company and each of its subsidiaries have
complied in all material respects with all applicable laws, rules and
regulations relating to the payment and withholding of Taxes and has in all
respects timely withheld from employee wages and paid over such Taxes to the
appropriate Governmental Entity. As used herein, "Tax" or "Taxes" shall
mean all taxes of any kind, including, without limitation, those on or
measured by or referred to as federal, state, local or foreign income, gross
receipts, property, sales, use, ad valorem, franchise, profits, license,
withholding, payroll, withholding, alternative or added minimum, employment,
estimated, excise, transfer, severance, stamp, occupation, premium, value
added, or windfall profits taxes, customs, duties or similar fees,
assessments or charges of any kind whatsoever, together with any interest and
any penalties, additions to tax or additional amounts imposed by any
Governmental Entity. As used herein, "Tax Return" shall mean any return,
report, statement or information required to be filed with any Governmental
Entity with respect to Taxes.   (n) No Excess Parachute Payments. No amount
that could be paid (whether in cash or property or the vesting of property)
as a result of any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to any
person who is properly characterized as a "disqualified individual" (as such
term is defined by the IRS in proposed Treasury Regulation section 1.280G-1)
under any employment, severance or termination agreement, other compensation
arrangement or other Company Benefit Plan currently in effect would be
characterized as an "excess parachute payment" (as such term is defined in
section 280G(b)(1) of the Code).   (o) Environmental Matters. Except to the
extent that the inaccuracy of any of the following, individually or in the
aggregate, would not have a material adverse effect on the Company:   (i)
the Company and its subsidiaries hold, and are in  compliance with and have
been in compliance with all Environmental  Permits, and are otherwise in
compliance and have been in compliance  with, all applicable Environmental
Laws and there is no condition  that is reasonably likely to prevent or
materially interfere with  compliance by the Company and its subsidiaries
with Environmental  Laws;   (ii) no modification, revocation, reissuance,
alteration,  transfer or amendment of any Environmental Permit, or any review
by,  or approval of, any third party of any Environmental Permit is 
required in connection with the execution or delivery of this  Agreement or
the consummation by the Company of the transactions  contemplated hereby or
the operation of the business of the Company  or any of its subsidiaries;  
-14-    (iii) neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries has 
received any Environmental Claim, nor has any Environmental Claim  been
threatened against the Company or any of its subsidiaries;   (iv) neither
the Company nor any of its subsidiaries has  entered into, agreed to or is
subject to any outstanding judgment,  decree, order or consent arrangement
with any governmental authority  under any Environmental Laws, including
without limitation those  relating to compliance with any Environmental Laws
or to the  investigation, cleanup, remediation or removal of Hazardous 
Materials;   (v) there are no circumstances that are reasonably likely to 
give rise to liability under any agreements with any person pursuant  to
which the Company or any subsidiary of the Company would be  required to
defend, indemnify, hold harmless, or otherwise be  responsible for any
violation by or other liability or expense of  such person, or alleged
violation by or other liability or expense of  such person, arising out of
any Environmental Law; and   (vi) to the best of the Company\'s knowledge,
there are no other  circumstances or conditions that are reasonably likely to
give rise  to liability of the Company or any of its subsidiaries under any 
Environmental Laws.   For purposes of this Agreement, the terms below shall
have the following meanings:   "Environmental Claim" means any written
complaint, notice, claim, demand, action, suit or judicial, administrative or
arbitral proceeding by any person to the Company or any of its subsidiaries
asserting liability or potential liability (including without limitation,
liability or potential liability for investigatory costs, cleanup costs,
governmental response costs, natural resource damages, property damage,
personal injury, fines or penalties) arising out of, relating to, based on or
resulting from (i) the presence, discharge, emission, release or threatened
release of any Hazardous Materials at any location, (ii) circumstances
forming the basis of any violation or alleged violation of any Environmental
Laws or Environmental Permits, or (iii) otherwise relating to obligations or
liabilities of the Company or any of its subsidiaries under any Environmental
Law.   "Environmental Permits" means all permits, licenses,
registrations, exemptions and other governmental authorizations required
under Environmental Laws for the Company or any of its subsidiaries to
conduct its operations as presently conducted.   "Environmental Laws" means
all applicable foreign, federal, state and local statutes, rules,
regulations, ordinances, orders, decrees and common law relating in any
manner to pollution, protection of the environment or the use, storage,
treatment or disposal of Hazardous Materials.   "Hazardous Materials" means
all hazardous or toxic substances, wastes, materials or chemicals, petroleum
(including crude oil or any fraction thereof) and petroleum products,
asbestos and   -15-   asbestos-containing materials, pollutants,
contaminants and all other materials and substances, including but not
limited to radioactive materials, regulated pursuant to any Environmental
Laws.   (p) Compliance with Laws; Permits. The Company and its
subsidiaries hold all required, necessary or applicable federal, state,
provincial, local or foreign permits, licenses, variances, exemptions,
orders, franchises and approvals of all Governmental Entities, except where
the failure to so hold would not have a material adverse effect on the
Company (the "Company Permits"). The Company and its subsidiaries are in
compliance with the terms of the Company Permits except where the failure to
so comply would not have a material adverse effect on the Company. Neither
the Company nor any of its subsidiaries has received notice of any revocation
or modification of any of the Company Permits, the revocation or modification
of which would have a material adverse effect on the Company. Neither the
Company nor any of its subsidiaries has violated or failed to comply with any
statute, law, ordinance, regulation, rule, permit or order of any federal,
state or local government, domestic or foreign, or any Governmental Entity,
any arbitration award or any judgment, decree or order of any court or other
Governmental Entity, applicable to the Company or any of its subsidiaries or
their respective business, assets or operations, except for violations and
failures to comply that could not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company.  
(q) Material Contracts and Agreements. Except contracts, agreements and
arrangements made in the ordinary course of business, neither the Company nor
any of its subsidiaries is bound by any oral or written material contract (as
defined in Item 601(b)(10) of SEC Regulation S-K) to be performed after
the date hereof that has not been filed with or incorporated by reference in
the SEC Documents filed with the SEC prior to the date of this Agreement.
Section 3.1(q) of the Disclosure Schedule lists (i) each guaranty of the
Company and its subsidiaries and (ii) each oral or written contract,
agreement and arrangement to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is
a party or any of their respective assets are bound which would be required
to be filed as exhibits to the Company\'s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
year ended December 31, 2000 or Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the
quarterly period ending March 31, 2001.   (r) Title to Properties.   (i)
Each of the Company and the Company\'s subsidiaries has  good and defensible
title to, or valid leasehold interests in, all of  its material assets and
properties purported to be owned by it in the  SEC Documents, except for such
assets and properties as are no longer  used or useful in the conduct of its
businesses or as have been  disposed of in the ordinary course of business
and except for defects  in title set forth on Section 3.1(r)(i) of the
Disclosure Schedule.  All such assets and properties, other than assets and
properties in  which the Company or any of the subsidiaries has leasehold
interests,  are free and clear of all Liens, other than those set forth in
the  SEC Documents and except for Liens, that, in the aggregate, do not  and
will not materially interfere with the ability of the Company or  any of its
subsidiaries to conduct business as currently conducted or  as reasonably
expected to be conducted.   -16-    (ii) Except as would not have a
material adverse effect on the  Company, each of the Company and its
subsidiaries has complied in all  material respects with the terms of all

its subsidiaries  enjoys peaceful and undisturbed possession under all such
leases.   (iii) Section 3.1(r)(iii) of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth 
a description of all gathering systems, pipeline systems, processing  and
treating facilities, and other material real property interests  owned by the
Company or any of its subsidiaries (the "Real  Properties"). The Company
directly or through its subsidiaries, has  good and indefeasible title, free
and clear of all Liens, in and to  the Real Properties. The Real Properties
are all of the real  properties necessary for the Company and its
subsidiaries to operate  their business as currently operated or as
reasonably expected to be  operated. The Company or its subsidiaries own all
easements, rights-  of-way, surface leases, fee parcels and licenses that are
necessary  for the operation of each of the gathering systems and pipeline 
systems included in the Real Properties.   (s) Intellectual Property. The
Company and its subsidiaries own, or are licensed or otherwise have the right
to use, all patents, patent rights, trademarks, trademark rights, trade
names, trade name rights, service marks, service mark rights, copyrights,

rights and computer programs which are material to the condition (financial
or otherwise) or conduct of the business and operations of the Company and
its subsidiaries taken as a whole. To the Company\'s knowledge, (i) the use
of such patents, patent rights, trademarks, trademark rights, service marks,
service mark rights, trade names, copyrights, technology, know-how, processes
and other proprietary intellectual property rights and computer programs by
the Company and its subsidiaries does not infringe on the rights of any
person, subject to such claims and infringements as do not, in the aggregate,
give rise to any liability on the part of the Company and its subsidiaries
which could have a material adverse effect on the Company, and (ii) no person

relating  to a request for additional information pursuant to Section (e)(1)
of  the HSR Act, the obligation of the Company to furnish any such Company 
Regulatory Documents to Fulbright and Jaworski L.L.P. shall be satisfied  by
the delivery of such Company Regulatory Documents on a confidential  basis to
Fulbright and Jaworski L.L.P.   -28-    pursuant to a confidentiality
agreement in form and substance  reasonably satisfactory to Parent. Except as
otherwise required by  United States or Canadian regulatory considerations,
Parent and Sub  will furnish to Porter and Hedges L.L.P., counsel to the
Company, copies  of all correspondence, filings or communications (or
memoranda setting  forth the substance thereof (collectively, "Parent
Regulatory  Documents")) between Parent, Sub or any of their respective 
representatives, on the one hand, and any Governmental Entity, or  member of
the staff of such agency or authority, on the other hand,  with respect to
this Agreement or the Merger; provided, however, that  (A) with respect to
documents and other materials filed by or on  behalf of Parent or Sub with
the Antitrust Division of the United  States Department of Justice, the
United States Federal Trade  Commission, under the Competition Act (Canada),
or any state attorneys  general that are available for review by the Company,
copies will not  be required to be provided to Porter and Hedges L.L.P., and
(B) with  respect to any Parent Regulatory Documents (1) that contain 
information which, in the reasonable judgment of Fulbright and Jaworski 
L.L.P., should not be furnished to the Company because of antitrust 
considerations or (2) relating to a request for additional information 
pursuant to Section (e)(1) of the HSR Act, the obligation of Parent  and Sub
to furnish any such Parent Regulatory Documents to Porter and  Hedges L.L.P.
shall be satisfied by the delivery of such Parent  Regulatory Documents on a
confidential basis to Porter and Hedges L.L.P.  pursuant to a confidentiality
agreement in form and substance  reasonably satisfactory to the Company.  
(iv) At the election of Parent, the Company and Parent shall use 
commercially reasonable efforts to defend all litigation under the  federal
or state antitrust laws of the United States or federal or  provincial laws
of Canada which if adversely determined would, in the  reasonable opinion of
Parent (based on the advice of outside counsel),  be likely to result in the
failure of the condition set forth in  Section 6.1(c) not being satisfied,
and to appeal any order, judgment  or decree, which if not reversed, would
result in the failure of such  condition. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
nothing contained in this  Agreement shall be construed so as to require
Parent, Sub or the  Company, or any of their respective subsidiaries or
affiliates, to  sell, license, dispose of, or hold separate, or to operate in
any  specified manner, any assets or businesses of Parent, Sub, the Company 
or the Surviving Corporation (or to require Parent, Sub, the Company  or any
of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates to agree to any  of the
foregoing). The obligations of each party under Section 5.3(a)  to use
commercially reasonable efforts with respect to antitrust  matters shall be
limited to compliance with the reporting provisions  of the HSR Act, the
Competition Act (Canada), and with its obligations  under this Section
5.3(c).   5.4 Indemnification.   (a) The Company shall, and from and after
the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall, indemnify,
defend and hold harmless each person who is now, or has been at any time
prior to the date hereof or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, an
officer or director of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or an employee
of the Company or any of its subsidiaries who acts as a fiduciary  
-29-   under any Company Benefit Plans (but, with respect to such persons,
only to the extent, if any, indemnified by the Company as of the date hereof)
(the "Indemnified Parties") against all losses, claims, damages, costs,
expenses (including attorneys\' fees), liabilities or judgments or amounts
that are paid in settlement with the approval of the indemnifying party
(which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld) of or in connection with
any threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation
based in whole or in part on or arising in whole or in part out of the fact
that such person is or was a director, officer or such employee of the
Company or any subsidiary whether pertaining to any matter existing or
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time and whether asserted or claimed
prior to, or at or after, the Effective Time (including arising out of or
relating to the Merger, the consummation of the transactions contemplated
herein, and any action taken in connection therewith). Any Indemnified Party
wishing to claim indemnification under this Section 5.4, upon learning of any
such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, promptly shall notify
the Company (or after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving
Corporation), but the failure so to notify shall not relieve a party from any
liability that it may have under this Section 5.4, except to the extent such
failure materially prejudices such party. Parent or the Surviving Corporation
shall have the right to assume the defense thereof. If Parent or
the Surviving Corporation does not assume the defense, the Indemnified
Parties as a group may retain only one law firm to represent them with
respect to each such matter unless there is, under applicable standards of
professional conduct, a conflict between the positions of any two or more
Indemnified Parties. The Indemnified Party shall cooperate in the defense of
any such matter. Parent shall not be liable for any settlement effected
without Parent\'s prior written consent.   (b) Parent shall purchase and
maintain in effect for the benefit of the Indemnified Parties for a period of
six years after the Effective Time, directors\' and officers\' liability
insurance of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and
conditions that are no less advantageous in any material respect to the
Indemnified Parties than that maintained by the Company and its subsidiaries
as of the date of this Merger Agreement with respect to matters arising
before the Effective Time, provided that Parent shall not be required to pay
an annual premium of such insurance in excess of three times the last annual
premium paid by the Company prior to the date hereof, but in such case shall
purchase as much coverage as possible for such amount.   (c) All rights to
indemnification for acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time
now existing in favor of the Indemnified Parties as provided in the charter
documents or by-laws of the Company or its subsidiaries and in any
indemnification agreements to which they are parties shall survive the
Merger, and the Surviving Corporation shall continue such
indemnification rights for acts or omissions prior to the Effective Time in
full force and effect in accordance with their terms and Parent shall be
financially responsible therefor.   (d) If the Surviving Corporation or any
of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other
person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of
its properties and assets to any person, then and in each such case, proper
provisions shall be made, and Parent shall cause them to be so made, so that
the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation, which, in the
reasonable opinion of the Surviving Corporation, shall be financially
responsible persons or entities, assume the obligations set forth in this
Section 5.4.    -30-    (e) The provisions of this Section 5.4 are
intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, the parties
hereto and each Indemnified Party, his heirs and representatives.   5.5
Fees and Expenses. Except as provided in Article VIII, all fees and expenses
incurred in connection with the Merger, this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party incurring such fees or
expenses, whether or not the Merger is consummated.   5.6 Company Stock
Options. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each outstanding option to
purchase Shares shall be exchanged for a substitute option to purchase, on
substantially the same terms and vesting schedule as was applicable to the
surrendered option, after giving effect to any existing provisions in the
Company Stock Plans that provide for the automatic acceleration of vesting
upon consummation of a change of control of the Company, such number of
common shares of Parent as is necessary to produce an intrinsic value that
equals the intrinsic value of the surrendered option. However, an option to
purchase a fraction of a share of the common shares of Parent will not be
granted. For purposes of determining the intrinsic values of the
surrendered options and the options granted in exchange therefor pursuant to
this Section 5.6, the fair market value of the Shares will be $27.00 and the
fair market value of the Parent\'s common shares will be the average of the
means between the highest and lowest quoted selling prices of the shares on
the five trading days ending on the date of the Effective Time and
consideration will be given to the exchange rate of the Canadian dollar to
the U.S. dollar. In the case of any Company stock option to which Section 421
of the Code applies by reason of its qualification under any of Sections 422
and 424 of the Code ("qualified stock options"), the option price, the number
of shares purchasable pursuant to such option and the terms and conditions of
exercise of such substituted option shall be determined in such manner so as
to comply with Section 422 of the Code. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall take all actions necessary and obtain any consents or approvals
of holders of options to purchase Shares as may be necessary to effect the
provisions of this Section 5.6.   Immediately after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall prepare and file with the SEC a Registration
Statement on Form S-8 (the "S-8 Registration Statement") covering any
substituted options granted pursuant to Section 5.6. If necessary to permit
reoffers and resales by optionees, Parent also shall prepare a "reoffer
prospectus" (as that term is used in General Instruction C-1 of Form S-8) and
file the reoffer prospectus with a post- effective amendment to the S-8
Registration Statement and cause any such post- effective amendment to become
effective and remain effective for such period as is necessary to permit such
reoffers and resales.   5.7 Public Announcements. Parent and Sub, on the one
hand, and the Company, on the other hand, will consult with each other before
issuing any press release or otherwise making any public statements with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and shall not
issue any such press release or make any such public statement prior to such
consultation, except that each party may respond to questions from
shareholders, respond to inquiries from financial analysts and media
representatives in a manner consistent with its past practice and make such
disclosure as may be required by applicable law or by obligations pursuant to
any listing agreement with any national securities exchange without prior
consultation to the extent such consultation is not reasonably practicable.
The parties agree   -31-   that the initial press release or releases to
be issued in connection with the execution of this Agreement shall be
mutually agreed upon prior to the issuance thereof.   5.8 Shareholder
Litigation. The Company shall give Parent the opportunity to participate in
the defense or settlement of any shareholder litigation against the Company
and its directors as of the date hereof or arising as of any date immediately
prior to the Effective Time relating to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement until the Effective Time, and thereafter, Parent shall direct the
defense of such litigation, but Parent shall give any directors against whom
any such litigation is pending an opportunity to participate in such
litigation; provided, however, that no settlement of litigation shall be
agreed to without the consent of Parent, such directors and, prior to the
Effective Time, the Company, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld.   5.9 Pending Regulatory Rate Cases. The Company will not initiate
or participate in any settlement discussions, except in consultation
and participation with Parent, regarding (a) the remand in Missouri Public
Service Commission v. FERC, D.C. Circuit No. 99-1203, decided December 15,
2000, (b) the rate case filed on August 27, 1999 in FERC Docket No. RP99-485,
(c) all cases pending before the Missouri Public Service Commission,
including the Actual Cost Adjustment proceedings in GR-96-450, GR-98-167,
GR-99-304 and GR-2000-425 or (d) the litigation pending in Johnson County,
Kansas in Case No. 99-C06574 (the "Pending Regulatory Cases") from the date
hereof until the Effective Time. The Company promptly on receipt shall
provide to Parent copies of any notices, correspondence, orders or other
documents in respect of the Pending Regulatory Cases that it receives from
any third party or Governmental Entity.   5.10 Midcoast Energy Resources,
Inc. Employee Stock Purchase Plan. On or before March 31, 2001, the Company
shall take such actions as are necessary to amend the Midcoast Energy
Resources, Inc. Employee Stock Purchase Plan to provide that (a) at the
Effective Time the offering period under such plan in which the Effective
Time occurs shall expire, (b) no Shares shall be purchased with respect to
such offering period, and (c) the Company shall pay to each participant in
such plan in cash an amount equal to (i) the number of Shares that the
participant could have purchased on the last day immediately preceding the
Effective Time with the aggregate amount of such participant\'s
payroll deduction contributions accumulated during such offering period
through the Effective Time multiplied by (ii) $27.00.    ARTICLE VI

the Merger. The respective obligation of each party to effect the Merger is
subject to the satisfaction prior to the Effective Time of the following

restraining order, preliminary or permanent injunction or other order issued

provided, however, that each of the parties shall have used reasonable
efforts, subject to the limitations set forth in Section 5.3 hereof, to
prevent the entry of any such injunction or other order and to appeal as
promptly as possible any injunction or other order that may be entered.

representations and warranties that are by their express provisions made as
of a specific date need be true and correct only as of such specific
date.   (c) Third Party Consents. All required authorizations, consents
or approvals of any third party the failure of which to obtain would have
a material adverse effect on the Surviving Corporation, assuming the Merger
had taken place, shall have been obtained.   (d) Material Adverse Change.

Effective Time, whether before or after approval of matters presented
in connection with the Merger by the shareholders of the Company:   (a) by
mutual written consent of Parent and the Company;   (b) by either Parent or
the Company:   (i) if Company Shareholder Approval shall not have been 
obtained upon a vote at a duly held at the Company Shareholder Meeting  or at
any adjournment thereof;   (ii) if the Merger shall not have been
consummated on or before  August 31, 2001, unless the failure to consummate
the Merger is the  result of a material breach of this Agreement by the party
seeking to  terminate this Agreement; provided, however, that the passage of
such  period shall be tolled for any part thereof during which any party 
shall be subject to a non-final order, decree or ruling or action 
restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of  the
Merger or the calling or holding of a meeting of the shareholders  of the
Company called to approve the Merger and the other matters  contemplated
hereby; or   (iii) if any court of competent jurisdiction or any
governmental,  administrative or regulatory authority, agency or body shall
have  issued an order, decree or ruling or shall have taken any other
action  permanently enjoining, restraining or otherwise prohibiting the 
purchase of Shares pursuant to the Merger and such order, decree,  ruling or
other action shall have become final and nonappealable;   -34-    (c) by
the Company in accordance with the provisions of Section 8.2;   (d) by
Parent, if the Company breaches any of its representations or warranties
herein or fails to perform in any material respect any of its covenants,
agreements or obligations under this Agreement, which breach or failure (i)
would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in Section 6.1 or 6.2
and (ii) cannot be or has not been cured within 45 days following receipt of
written notice of such breach; or   (e) by the Company, if Parent or Sub
breaches any of its representations or warranties herein or fails to perform
in any material respect any of its covenants, agreements or obligations under
this Agreement, which breach or failure (i) would give rise to the failure of
a condition set forth in Section 6.1 or 6.3 and (ii) cannot be or has not
been cured within 45 days following receipt of written notice of such
breach.   7.2 Procedure for Termination, Amendment, Extension or Waiver.
A termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1, an amendment of
this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.4 or an extension or waiver pursuant to
Section 7.5 shall, in order to be effective, require in the case of Parent,
Sub or the Company, action by its Board of Directors or the duly authorized
designee of its Board of Directors.   7.3 Effect of Termination. In the
event of termination of this Agreement by either the Company or Parent as
provided in Section 7.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and have
no effect, without any further liability or obligation on the part of Parent,
Sub or the Company, or any director, officer, employee or shareholder
thereof, other than the confidentiality provisions of Sections 5.2(b) and
5.2(c) and the provisions of Sections 3.1(w), 3.2(d), 5.5, 7.3, 8.2, 8.3 and

instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties.   7.5

of the obligations or the other acts of the other parties, (b) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained herein or in any
document delivered pursuant hereto or (c) waive compliance with any of the
agreements or conditions contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a
party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. The failure of
any party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement
or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such rights.   -35-   
ARTICLE VIII   SPECIAL PROVISIONS AS TO CERTAIN MATTERS   8.1 Takeover
Defenses of the Company and Standstill Agreements. The Company hereby waives
the provisions of the letter agreement dated effective as of October 15, 2000
(the "Confidentiality Agreement"), between the Company and Parent,
prohibiting the purchase of Shares or acting to influence or control
the Company, solely in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby.   8.2 No Solicitation.   (a) The Company shall not, nor shall it
permit or cause any of its subsidiaries to, nor shall it authorize or permit
any officer, director or employee of, or any investment banker, attorney or
other advisor, agent or representative of, the Company or any of its
subsidiaries ("Company Representatives") to, and on becoming aware of will
take all reasonable actions to stop such person from continuing to, directly
or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or encourage or otherwise intentionally
facilitate (including by way of furnishing information) the making of any
Acquisition Proposal, (ii) enter into any agreement (other than
confidentiality and standstill agreements in accordance with the immediately
following proviso) with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, or (iii)
participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any
person any information with respect to, or take any other action to
facilitate any inquiries or the making of any proposal that constitutes, or
may reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal; provided,
however, that in the case of this clause (iii), to the extent required by the
fiduciary obligations of the Board of Directors of the Company, determined in
good faith by the members thereof taking into consideration the written
advice of outside counsel, the Company may at any time prior to
Company Shareholder Approval (the "Applicable Period"), but not thereafter if
the Merger is approved thereby, and subject to the Company providing written
notice to Parent of its decision to take such action in response and only in
response to an unsolicited written request therefor received without any
initiation, encouragement, discussion or negotiation by the Company or any
Company Representative and other than in contravention of this Section
8.2(a), furnish information to any person or "group" (within the meaning of
Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) pursuant to a confidentiality agreement
on substantially the same terms as provided in the Confidentiality Agreement
referred to in Section 8.1 hereof and otherwise enter into discussions and
negotiations with such person or group as to any superior proposal (as
defined in Section 8.2(c)) such person or group has made. Without limiting
the foregoing, it is understood that any violation of the restrictions set
forth in the preceding sentence by the Company or any Company Representative,
whether or not such person is purporting to act on behalf of the Company or
otherwise, shall be deemed to be a material breach of this Agreement by the
Company. The Company immediately shall cease and shall cause to be terminated
any existing solicitation, initiation, encouragement, activity, discussion or
negotiation with any parties conducted prior to the date hereof by the
Company or any Company Representatives with respect to any Acquisition
Proposal existing on the date hereof. The Company promptly will notify Parent
of the pendency of any negotiations respecting, or the receipt of, any
Acquisition Proposal. For purposes of this Agreement, "Acquisition Proposal"
means (i) any proposal, other than a proposal by Parent or any of its
affiliates, for a merger or other business combination involving the Company,
(ii) any proposal or offer, other than a proposal or offer by Parent or any
of its affiliates, to   -36-   acquire from the Company or any of its
affiliates in any manner, directly or indirectly, an equity interest in the
Company or any subsidiary, any voting securities of the Company or any
subsidiary or a material amount of the assets of the Company and its
subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (iii) any proposal or offer, other than a
proposal or offer by Parent or any of its affiliates, to acquire from the
shareholders of the Company by tender offer, exchange offer or otherwise more
than 20% of the outstanding Shares.   (b) Neither the Board of Directors of
the Company nor any committee thereof shall, except in connection with the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Sections 7.1(a), 7.1(b) or 7.1(e),
(i) withdraw or modify, or propose to withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse
to Parent or Sub, the approval or recommendation by the Board of Directors of
the Company or any such committee of this Agreement or the Merger or take any
action having such effect or (ii) approve or recommend, or propose to approve
or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the
event the Board of Directors of the Company receives an Acquisition Proposal
that, in the exercise of its fiduciary obligations (as determined in good
faith by a majority of the disinterested members thereof taking into
consideration the written advice of outside counsel), it determines to be a
superior proposal, the Board of Directors may withdraw or modify its approval
or recommendation of this Agreement or the Merger and may (subject to the
following sentence) terminate this Agreement, in each case at any time after
midnight on the third business day following Parent\'s receipt of written
notice (a "Notice of Superior Proposal") advising Parent that the Board of
Directors has received an Acquisition Proposal which it has determined to be
a superior proposal, specifying the material terms and conditions of such
Superior Proposal (including the proposed financing for such proposal and a
copy of any documents conveying such proposal) and identifying the party
making such Superior Proposal. Parent shall have the right, prior to the
expiration of the third business day following its receipt of a Notice of
Superior Proposal to agree to amend the terms of this Agreement such that
they are no less favorable than the terms of such Superior Proposal. The
Company may terminate this Agreement pursuant to the second sentence of this
Section 8.2(b) only if the shareholders of the Company shall not yet have
voted on the Merger, and the Company shall have paid to Parent the fees set
forth in Section 8.3. Nothing contained herein shall prohibit the Company
from taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by
Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act following Parent\'s receipt of a Notice
of Superior Proposal.   (c) For purposes of this Agreement, a "superior
proposal" means any bona fide Acquisition Proposal to acquire, directly or
indirectly, for consideration consisting of cash, securities or a combination
thereof, at least a majority of the Shares then outstanding or all or
substantially all the assets of the Company, and otherwise on terms which a
majority of the members of the Board of Directors of the Company determines
in its good faith reasonable judgment (taking into consideration the written
advice of a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation, a copy of
which shall be provided to Parent) to be more favorable to the Company\'s
shareholders than the Merger and which it intends to recommend that the
shareholders of the Company approve. In reaching such good faith
determination, the Board of Directors of the Company will give significant
consideration to whether an Acquisition Proposal includes
definite financing.   -37-    8.3 Fee and Expense Reimbursements. The
Company agrees to pay Parent a fee in immediately available funds (in
recognition of the fees and expenses incurred to date by Parent in connection
with the matters contemplated hereby) of $15,000,000 promptly upon   (a)
the termination of the Agreement   (i) by Parent or the Company as permitted
by Section 7.1(b)(i),  but only in the event that Company Shareholder
Approval shall not have  been obtained at the meeting of the Company\'s
shareholders convened  therefor and, prior to the meeting of the shareholders
of the Company  convened for the purpose of voting on the Merger, a third
party has  made a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal or   (ii) by the
Company as permitted by Section 8.2 or   (b) the Board of Directors of the
Company taking any of the actions  set forth in clause (i) or (ii) of Section
8.2(b) and the Board of  Directors of the Company has not reinstated its
recommendation of this  Agreement or withdrawn its approval or recommendation
or both of any such  Acquisition Proposal within two business days of taking
such actions.   ARTICLE IX   GENERAL PROVISIONS   9.1 Nonsurvival of
Representations and Warranties. None of the representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements in this Agreement or in any instrument delivered
pursuant to this Agreement shall survive the Effective Time. This Section 9.1
shall not limit any covenant or agreement of the parties which by its terms
contemplates performance after the Effective Time.   9.2 Notices. All
notices and other communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be
deemed given if delivered personally or by facsimile or sent by overnight

through one or more intermediaries, controls, is controlled by, or is under
common control with, such first person;   (b) "material adverse effect" or
"material adverse change" means, when used in connection with any person, any

foreseen, is likely to result in any change or effect) that is materially
adverse to the business, properties, assets, condition (financial or
otherwise) or results of operations of that person and its subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, provided, however, that no such change or effect shall be
deemed to have occurred to the extent such change or effect arises from

corporation, partnership, limited liability company, association, trust,

this Agreement to a Section, Exhibit or Schedule, such reference shall be to
a Section of, or an Exhibit or Schedule to, this Agreement unless otherwise
indicated. The words "hereof", "herein" and "hereunder" and similar terms
refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of
this Agreement, unless the context otherwise requires. The table of contents
and headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and

Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement (including the
Exhibits and Schedules hereto and the documents and instruments referred to
herein) and the Confidentiality Agreement (a) constitute the entire agreement
and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral,
among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and (b) except
for the provisions of Sections 5.4 and 5.6, are not intended to confer upon
any person other than the parties any rights or remedies hereunder.   9.7
Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in
accordance with, the laws of the State of Texas, regardless of the laws

thereof.   9.8 Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties
without the prior written consent of the other parties, except that Parent or
Sub may assign its rights and obligations under this Agreement to one of its
affiliates. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding
upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties and their
respective successors and assigns.   9.9 Enforcement of the Agreement. The
parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of
the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the
parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches
of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof
in any district court of the United States located in the States of Texas
(Southern District   -40-   only), this being in addition to any other
remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. In addition, each of
the parties hereto (a) consents to submit itself to the personal jurisdiction
of any federal district court sitting in the Southern District of Texas in
the event any dispute between the parties hereto arises out of this Agreement
solely in connection with such a suit between the parties, (b) agrees that it
will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or
other request for leave from any such court and (c) agrees that it will not
bring any action relating to this Agreement in any court other than such a

cause Sub to comply with its obligations under this Agreement.   9.11
Severability. In the event any one or more of the provisions contained in
this Agreement should be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any
respect, the validity, legality and enforceability of the
remaining provisions contained herein shall not in any way be affected or
impaired thereby. The parties shall endeavor in good-faith negotiations to
replace the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provisions with valid
provisions, the economic effect of which comes as close as possible to that
of the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provisions.   -41-    IN
WITNESS WHEREOF, Parent, Sub and the Company have caused this Agreement to be
signed by their respective officers thereunto duly authorized, all as of the
date first written above.   Enbridge Inc.   /s/ P.D. DANIEL  By
