will merge with and into the Company (the "Merger"), with the Company being
the surviving corporation (the "Surviving Corporation").

corporate existence under the DGCL as a wholly owned Subsidiary of Buyer.

  

  

1.2 Closing. On the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, the
consummation of the Merger and the closing of the Transactions (the "Closing")
will take place at the offices of Jones Day, 222 East 41st Street, New York,
New York, at 10:00 a.m. New York City time on the date which is three Business
Days after the date on which all conditions set forth in Article VII have been
satisfied or, to the extent permitted, waived (other than those conditions
that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction or, to the extent permitted, waiver of such conditions) or such
other time and place as Buyer (without joinder by Merger Sub) and the Company
may mutually agree (the "Closing Date"). The expected Closing Date is December
15, 2012. Notwithstanding anything to contrary contained in this Agreement
(including this Section 1.2), in no event will the Closing occur earlier than
5 p.m. New York City time on November 15, 2012.

  

  

 

 

 

    

  

 

 

 

  

  

1.3 Filing of Certificate of Merger; Effective Time. As soon as practicable on
the Closing Date, Merger Sub and the Company will cause a certificate of
merger for the Merger (the "Certificate of Merger") to be executed and filed
with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware as provided in Section

1.5 Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws. The certificate of incorporation

1.7 Merger Consideration and Conversion of Capital Stock.

  

  

(a) Merger Consideration. The aggregate amount payable by Buyer in the Merger
(the "Merger Consideration") will be the sum of (a) $243.0 million (the "Base
Cash Payment") and (b) the Final Book Value Amount, payable as follows: (i)
the issued and outstanding shares of Company Series A Preferred ("Company
Series A Preferred Shares") will be converted in the Merger on a one-for-one-
basis into issued and outstanding shares of Buyer Series A Preferred (the
foregoing portion of the Merger Consideration, the "Preferred Stock Merger
Consideration") and (ii) the issued and outstanding shares of Company Common
Stock ("Company Common Shares") immediately prior to the Effective Time will
be converted in the Merger into an aggregate amount in cash equal to the Base
Cash Payment plus the Closing Date Book Value, less the sum of (A) the amount
of the aggregate liquidation preference amount of the Buyer Series A Preferred
comprising the Preferred Stock Merger Consideration and (B) the amount that
otherwise would be payable hereunder in respect of Dissenting Shares, if any
(the foregoing amounts in clause (A) and this clause (B) the "Common Stock
Merger Consideration"). Immediately prior to the Effective Time, a portion of
the Common Stock Merger Consideration equal to $162.0 million, less the
aggregate liquidation preference amount of shares of Buyer Series A Preferred
issued in the Preferred Stock Merger Consideration (such amount, the
"Preferred Contribution"), will be deemed to be contributed to the capital of
the Buyer on behalf of the then-holders of Company Series A Preferred Shares
who are also holders of Company Common Stock, pro rata, out of their portion
of the Common Stock Merger Consideration in exchange for Buyer Series A
Preferred Shares having an aggregate liquidation preference amount equal to
the Preferred Contribution. Assuming that there is no change in the number of
shares of Company Preferred Stock outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time, 141,384.722 shares of Buyer Series A Preferred will be issued
as the Preferred Stock Merger Consideration, the Preferred Contribution will
equal $20,615,278 and the number of shares of Buyer Preferred Stock issued in
exchange for the Preferred Contribution will equal 20,615.278.

  

  

(b) Merger Sub. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of any holder thereof, each issued and outstanding share of
common stock, par value $.001 per share, of Merger Sub will be converted into
and become one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value
$.001 per share, of the Surviving Corporation and, upon surrender of the
certificate or certificates representing such shares of capital stock of
Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation will promptly issue to Buyer a
certificate or certificates representing the shares of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation into which it has been converted. As of immediately
after the Effective Time, such shares will be the only issued and outstanding
capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-3-  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) Treasury Stock. Notwithstanding anything else contained herein, each share
of Company Common Stock that is owned by the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time will no longer be outstanding and will automatically be
canceled and retired and will cease to exist without any conversion thereof or
payment therefor.

  

  

(d) Other Company Securities. Notwithstanding anything else contained herein,
except as otherwise expressly provided for in this Agreement or in Section 6.7
of the Company Disclosure Letter, each other equity security of the Company
(including any and all options, warrants, rights or other securities
convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for shares of the capital
stock of the Company) owned by any Person immediately prior to the Effective
Time will no longer be outstanding and will automatically be canceled and
retired and will cease to exist without any conversion thereof or payment
therefor.

  

  

1.8 Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this
Article I and to the extent available under Section 262 of the DGCL,
Dissenting Shares, if any, will not be converted into a right to receive the
applicable consideration set forth in Section 1.7, and the holders thereof
will be entitled only to such rights as are granted by Section 262 of the
DGCL. Each holder of Dissenting Shares who becomes entitled to payment for the
fair cash value of such shares pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL will
receive such payment therefor from the Surviving Corporation in accordance
with the DGCL; provided, however, that if any such holder of Dissenting Shares
(a) fails to establish such holder\'s entitlement to appraisal rights as
provided in Section 262 of the DGCL or (b) withdraws such holder\'s demand for
appraisal of such shares or waives or loses such holder\'s right to appraisal
and payment for such holder\'s shares under Section 262 of the DGCL, such
holder will forfeit the right to appraisal of such shares and each such share
will not constitute a Dissenting Share and will be treated as if it had been
converted, as of the Effective Time, into a solely right to receive from the
Surviving Corporation the portion of the applicable consideration set forth in
Section 1.7, deliverable in respect thereof as determined in accordance with
this Article I and Article II, without any interest thereon.

II. PAYMENT OF CONSIDERATION

  

  

2.1 Estimated Closing Statement.

  

  

(a) (i) Not less than ten Business Days prior to the anticipated Closing Date,
the Company will deliver to Buyer an estimated unaudited consolidated balance
sheet of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the close of business on the
day immediately prior to the Closing Date (the "Estimated Closing Date Balance
Sheet"), which will be prepared in good faith in accordance with the
Applicable Accounting Practices, as well as an estimate prepared in good faith
of the Book Value of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of such close of
business as derived therefrom (the "Estimated Book Value Amount").

  

  

(ii) The Representative and Buyer will cooperate in good faith to resolve any
dispute raised by Buyer as to whether the Estimated Closing Date Balance Sheet
was prepared in accordance with the Applicable Accounting Practices or the
Estimated Book Value Amount is consistent with the definition of Book Value as
of such close of business.

  

  

(iii) If, prior to the deadline for delivering the Estimated Closing Statement
pursuant to Section 2.1(b), the Representative and Buyer agree that changes
should be made to the Estimated Closing Date Balance Sheet or the Estimated
Book Value, then such changes will be incorporated into the Estimated Closing
Date Balance Sheet and the Estimated Book Value Amount contemplated by Section
2.1(a).

  

  

(b) Not less than two Business Days prior to the anticipated Closing Date, the
Company will deliver to Buyer a written statement (the "Estimated Closing
Statement") setting forth:

  

  

(i) the Estimated Book Value Amount, as changed (if applicable) pursuant to
Section 2.1(a); and

  

  

(ii) a schedule (the "Closing Schedule") setting forth the aggregate amount of
the Base Cash Payment, plus the Estimated Book Value Amount, less $85.0
million (which will be paid into the Escrow Fund for distribution in
accordance with this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement), less $162.0 million,
less the amount that would otherwise be payable hereunder in respect of
Dissenting Shares (if any) (such amount, as so calculated, the "Closing Cash
Payment"), together with wire transfer instructions, and the number of shares
of Buyer Series A Preferred Stock to be issued to each Person entitled to
receive such shares pursuant to Section 1.7(a).

  

  

2.2 Closing Payments. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
at the Closing, Buyer will deliver by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to:

  

  

(a) the Representative, as paying agent for each holder of Company Common

(b) the Escrow Agent, $85.0 million, to be held in the Escrow Fund and the
Costs Escrow.

  

  

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Parties acknowledge and
agree that none of Buyer, Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation or any of
their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates will have any liability for the
allocation or distribution by the Representative of the Merger Consideration
among the Company Interest Holders and that delivery of the cash and shares
constituting the Merger Consideration to the Representative and the Escrow
Agent pursuant to this Section 2.2 will satisfy any Buyer obligation to
deliver the Merger Consideration to shareholders and such Persons.

  

  

2.3 Closing Share Issuance. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, at the Closing, Buyer will deliver one or more validly issued share
certificates, duly executed by appropriate officers of Buyer, representing the
Buyer Series A Preferred shares issuable pursuant to Section 1.7(a) in
accordance with the Closing Schedule.

  

  

2.4 Book Value Adjustment.

  

  

(a) For purposes of this Agreement, the "Book Value" of the Company as of any
date means the consolidated assets of the Company as of such date minus the
consolidated liabilities of the Company as of such date, in each case
determined in accordance with GAAP as applied in a manner consistent with the
accounting policies and practices of the Company used to prepare its audited
consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2011, including the policies
and practices described in Section 2.4(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter,
before purchase accounting for the Transactions and without giving effect to
the Merger, any financing related to the Merger or any plan of Buyer for the
Company after the Closing (the Company\'s accounting policies and practices,
as modified by this Section 2.4(a), the "Applicable Accounting Practices");
provided, however, that (i) the Final Book Value Amount (A) will not include
any liabilities paid (or to be paid) pursuant to Section 2.2, or give effect
to any reduction or increase in any asset or liability as a result of the
Closing, including any write-down or write-off and (B) will be reduced by a
tax-affected amount to be paid (including employer-paid payroll taxes and
related taxes) by Buyer in respect of the Restricted Stock Unit Component and
Appreciation Right Component pursuant to Section 1(a) of Section 6.7 of the
Company Disclosure Letter.

  

  

(b) As soon as reasonably practicable following the Closing Date, and in any
event within 75 calendar days thereof, Buyer will cause to be prepared in good
faith and delivered to the Representative an unaudited consolidated balance
sheet of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the close of business on the
day immediately before the Closing Date (the "Closing Date Balance Sheet") and
a calculation prepared in good faith of the Book Value of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as of the day immediately preceding the Closing Date based on the
Closing Date Balance Sheet ("Proposed Final Book Value Amount"). The Closing
Date Balance Sheet will be prepared using the Applicable Accounting Practices.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-6-  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) Buyer will provide the Representative and its representatives with
reasonable access to the records, properties, personnel and auditors of the
Company and its Subsidiaries in connection with the determination of the Final
Book Value Amount pursuant to this Section 2.4, including for purposes of any
disagreement pursuant to Section 2.4(d), and will cause the personnel of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, including its officers, to cooperate reasonably
with the Representative in connection therewith. Without limiting the
generality or effect of the foregoing, Buyer will reasonably cooperate with
the Representative in connection with the development of the Closing Date
Balance Sheet and the calculation of the Proposed Final Book Value Amount
contemplated by Section 2.4(b), including furnishing estimates thereof and
participating in telephone conferences (not more frequently than weekly)
during the 75-day period contemplated by Section 2.4(b). Buyer will keep the
Representative reasonably apprised and involved in the process of preparation
of the Closing Date Balance Sheet and Proposed Final Book Value Amount in
advance of the 75-calendar day deadline set forth in Section 2.4(b).

  

  

(d) If the Representative disagrees with the calculation of the Proposed Final
Book Value Amount, it will notify Buyer of such disagreement in writing,
setting forth in reasonable detail the particulars of such disagreement (any
such disagreements so notified within such time frame, the "Specified Items"),
within 30 days after the delivery by Buyer of the Closing Date Balance Sheet.
In the event that the Representative does not provide such a notice of
disagreement within such 30-day period, the Representative will be deemed to
have accepted the Proposed Final Book Value Amount, and the Proposed Final
Book Value Amount will be deemed to be Final Book Value Amount. In the event
any such notice of disagreement is timely provided with respect to a Proposed
Final Book Value Amount, Buyer and the Representative will use commercially
reasonable efforts for a period of 20 days (or such longer period as they may
mutually agree) to resolve any Specified Items. If, at the end of such period,
they are unable to resolve such Specified Items, then Ernst and Young LLP (or
such other independent accounting firm or financial accounting consulting firm
of recognized national standing as may be mutually selected by Buyer and the
Representative) (the "Accounting Firm") will resolve any remaining
disagreements. The Accounting Firm will determine as promptly as practicable,
but in any event within 30 days of the date on which such dispute is referred
to the Accounting Firm, whether the Closing Date Balance Sheet was prepared in
accordance with the standards set forth in Section 2.4(b) and whether and to
what extent (if any) the Proposed Final Book Value Amount requires adjustment.
The fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm will be borne by the Party
(either the Company, in which case the amount will be paid out of the Escrow
Fund, or Buyer) whose last written settlement offer submitted to the other
Party prior to the engagement of the Accounting Firm differs the most from the
amount of the Final Book Value Amount, as finally determined by the Accounting
Firm. The determinations of the Accounting Firm will be final, conclusive and
binding on the Parties. The Accounting Firm will act to resolve only the
Specified Items that remain unresolved at the time of the Accounting Firm\'s
determination, and will resolve the dispute over the Specified Items based on
the submissions of Buyer and the Representative, without audit or discovery.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein and notwithstanding
any unresolved disputes between Buyer and the Representative regarding any
Specified Items relating to the Proposed Final Book Value Amount, to the
extent Buyer and the Representative agree on portions of the Proposed Final
Book Value Amount, the Parties agree that Buyer will pay or that the Escrow
Agent will be authorized to pay, as applicable, without reservation or delay,
any amounts which are not the subject of a good faith dispute.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-7-  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(e) The Book Value and the unaudited consolidated balance sheet of the Company
and its Subsidiaries, in each case as of the close of business on the day
immediately prior to the Closing Date and as finally determined pursuant to
this Section 2.4, are referred to herein as the "Final Book Value Amount" and
the "Final Closing Date Balance Sheet." Following the determination of the
Final Book Value Amount:

  

  

(i) if the Final Book Value Amount is greater than the Estimated Book Value
Amount, then within two Business Days after the determination of the Final
Book Value Amount, Buyer will pay or cause to be paid, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds, to the Representative, the full amount of such
excess;

  

  

(ii) if the Final Book Value Amount is less than the Estimated Book Value
Amount, then such shortfall will be deemed to constitute a Loss pursuant to
Section 9.1(a) and Buyer will be entitled to recover only from the Escrow Fund
an amount equal to the full amount of such shortfall, which amount the Parties
will instruct the Escrow Agent to pay or cause to be paid, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to Buyer; or

  

  

(iii) if the Final Book Value Amount is equal to the Estimated Book Value
Amount, then no adjustment will be made.

  

  

2.5 Payment and Exchange of Certificates; Acknowledgement Letters.
Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, in no event will any Person who is
entitled to receive any payment pursuant to this Agreement as a result of any
equity or equity-linked interest in the Company receive any such payment
unless and until such time as the applicable Person delivers to the
Representative (a) an acknowledgement letter substantially in the form
attached hereto as Exhibit A (each, an "Acknowledgement Letter") and, if
applicable, a properly executed substitute Form W-9 or similar document and
(b) with respect to holders of Company Common Shares and Company Series A
Preferred Shares, certificates ("Certificates") representing such shares,
which Certificates so surrendered will be cancelled and the holder of such
Certificate will receive in exchange therefor the right to receive the
applicable consideration set forth in Section 1.7, without interest. In the
event any Certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of
an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed, the Representative will, subject to this Article II,
issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the
applicable consideration therefor set forth in Section 1.7. Each issued
outstanding share of stock of the Company will be deemed cancelled from and
after the Effective Time and, for all corporate purposes, to evidence only the
right to receive the applicable payments in respect of the applicable
consideration therefor set in Section 1.7. For the avoidance of doubt, none of
the payments contemplated by this Article II will be required to be made
unless and until the Certificate of Merger has been filed with and accepted by
the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware and reasonably satisfactory
evidence thereof has been received by Buyer and the Representative; provided,
however, that the Company and the Representative reserve the right to revoke
such filing if the payments contemplated by this Article II to be made on the
Closing Date have not been received by close of business on the Closing Date.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-8-  

  

 

 

 

  

  

2.6 No Liability. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article II,
none of the Company, Buyer, the Representative or the Surviving Corporation
will be liable to any Person for any amount property paid to a public official
pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

  

  

2.7 Withholding. Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, Buyer, the
Company and the Representative will be entitled to deduct and withhold from
amounts otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to or in accordance with this
Agreement such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect
to the making of such payment under applicable Law. If Buyer, the Company or
the Representative so withholds (or causes to be withheld) any such amounts,
such amounts will be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to such Person, and Buyer will pay over such amounts to the applicable
Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable Law.

Except as set forth in the Company Disclosure Letter, the Company represents

Each of the Company and the U.S. Subsidiaries is duly licensed or qualified
and in good standing as a foreign corporation in each jurisdiction in which
the ownership of its property or the character of its activities is such as to
require it to be so licensed or qualified, except where the failure to be so
licensed or qualified would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
be expected to (a) materially impair the ability of the Company to enter into
and perform its obligations under this Agreement or (b) have a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company. The copies of the certificate of incorporation
and bylaws of the Company previously made available by the Company to Buyer
are true, correct and complete.

outstanding Company Series A Preferred Shares (collectively, the "Company
Stockholders Approval")). This Agreement has been duly and validly executed
and delivered by the Company and, assuming the due authorization, execution
and delivery hereof by the Representative, Buyer and Merger Sub constitutes a

affecting creditors\' rights generally and subject, as to enforceability, to
general principles of equity (such exception, the "Bankruptcy Exception").

Company to enter into and perform its obligations under this Agreement or (ii)
have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

to the Company\'s execution or delivery of this Agreement or the consummation
of the Transactions, except for (a) applicable requirements of the HSR Act,

Subsidiaries (collectively, (i) and (ii), a "Transfer"); provided, however,
that the foregoing will not prohibit Transfers by the Company to an Affiliate
or a Person that shares a common investment adviser, provided that such
Affiliate or Person, as applicable, agrees to be subject to the restrictions
set forth in this Section 6.1(b)(xx); or

  

  

(xxi) enter into any agreement, or otherwise become obligated, to do any
action prohibited under this Section 6.1(b).

  

  

(c) From the date of this Agreement through the Closing, Buyer will, and will
cause its Subsidiaries to, except as contemplated by this Agreement or as
consented to by the Company in writing (which consent may not be unreasonably
conditioned, withheld, delayed or denied), operate its business substantially
in the ordinary course consistent in all material respects with past practice;
provided, however, that no action taken or omitted to be taken by Buyer in
what an officer or employee of Buyer believed in good faith to be in or not
opposed to the best interests of Buyer which does not also involve a material
breach of Section 6.1(d) will constitute a breach of this Section 6.1(c).

  

  

(d) From the date of this Agreement through the Closing, without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, except as set forth on Section 6.1(d) of the
Company Disclosure Letter or as consented to by the Company in writing, Buyer
will not, and Buyer will cause its Subsidiaries not to, except as otherwise
contemplated by this Agreement:

  

  

(i) amend the certificate of incorporation, bylaws or other organizational
documents of Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries, except as required by Law or as
contemplated by this Agreement;

  

  

(ii) split, combine or reclassify any of its capital stock, declare or pay a
stock dividend or authorize the issuance of securities in lieu of or in
substitution for shares of its capital stock or purchase, redeem or acquire
any shares of its capital stock;

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-34-  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(iii) issue any warrants, options or other rights to purchase shares of its
capital stock or any securities convertible into shares of its capital stock;

  

  

(iv) restructure, recapitalize, reorganize or adopt any other corporate or
legal entity reorganization, otherwise alter its legal structure or form or
completely or partially liquidate;

  

  

(v) dissolve or liquidate or permit or allow the filing of a petition for
relief under any provisions of the United States Bankruptcy Code with respect
to the Company or any Subsidiary; or

  

  

(vi) enter into any agreement, or otherwise become obligated, to take any
action prohibited under this Section 6.1(d) or that would materially impair
the ability of Buyer or Merger Sub to timely consummate the Transactions.

  

  

6.2 Access to Information.

  

  

(a) Prior to the Closing, except as the Company determines, based on advice of
outside counsel, may violate any applicable Law, the Company will, and will
cause its Subsidiaries to, afford to Buyer and its accountants, counsel and
other representatives reasonable access, during normal business hours, in such
manner as to not interfere with normal operation of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, to all of their respective properties, books, Contracts,
personnel records and other information concerning the Company and its
Subsidiaries, properties and personnel as Buyer may reasonably request,
including all records, Contracts and other information regarding servicing
advances and collection accounts, and make reasonably available to the
authorized representatives of Buyer the employees of the Company or its
Subsidiaries whose assistance and expertise is reasonably necessary to assist
Buyer in connection with Buyer\'s preparation to integrate the Company, its
Subsidiaries and assets and the personnel related thereto with Buyer\'s
organization following the Closing (such integration, the "Pre-Closing
Integration"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Company nor any of
its Affiliates is under any obligation to disclose to Buyer any information
the disclosure of which (i) is restricted by applicable Law or any obligations
to any third party or (ii) is subject to attorney-client privilege. Buyer and
its representatives will not have access to employment records of individual
employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries prior to the Closing except on
such terms as may be agreed by the Company and Buyer in order to protect
confidential information and ensure compliance with all applicable Laws and
the applicable Company\'s policies. Any investigation pursuant to this Section
6.2(a) will be conducted in such manner as not to unreasonably interfere with
the conduct of the business of the Company or its Subsidiaries, and no such
investigation will affect any representation or warranty in this Agreement of
any Party or any condition to the obligations of the Parties.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-35-  

  

 

 

 

 

  

  

(b) Following the Closing, Buyer will, and will cause the Surviving
Corporation to, give the Representative reasonable access during the Surviving
Corporation\'s regular business hours upon reasonable advance notice and under
reasonable circumstances to books, records and personnel of the Surviving
Corporation in order to permit them to take any action contemplated to be
taken by them hereunder or as otherwise may be necessary to exercise any of
their rights or obligations hereunder, including in connection with any
Actions under Article IX. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Buyer nor any
of its Affiliates is under any obligation to disclose to the Company any
information the disclosure of which (i) is restricted by applicable Law or any
obligations to any third party or (ii) is subject to attorney-client
privilege.

  

  

(c) Without limiting the generality or effect of Section 6.2(a), the Company
and Buyer will each nominate a representative to act as the primary contact
persons with respect to all matters relating to the Pre-Closing Integration
(the "Integration Coordinators"). The initial Integration Coordinators will be
designated by the Company and Buyer as soon as practicable after the date of
this Agreement. Each of the Company and Buyer will be entitled to replace its
Integration Coordinator.

  

  

(d) The Company and Buyer will cause the Integration Coordinators to meet on a
weekly basis or with such other frequency as they may agree to discuss the
status and progress of the Pre-Closing Integration and concerns of the Parties
regarding the same. Nothing in this Section 6.2(d) will require the
cooperation of the Company prior to the Closing to the extent it would
interfere unreasonably with the business or the other operations of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or, as determined by the Company based on
advice of outside counsel, would reasonably be likely to be a violation of
applicable Law. Buyer will, promptly upon request by the Company, reimburse
the Company for any Losses suffered and for all documented and reasonable out-
of-pocket costs suffered by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to
this Section 6.2(d).

  

  

6.3 Reasonable Efforts. Without limiting the generality or effect of any other
covenant contained in this Article VI, Buyer and the Company will, and will
each cause their respective Subsidiaries to (a) use commercially reasonable
efforts to assemble, prepare and file any information (and, as needed, to
supplement such information) as may be reasonably necessary to obtain as
promptly as practicable all Authorizations of any Governmental Authority
required to be obtained in connection with the Transactions, (b) use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all material Authorizations of third
parties that any of Buyer, the Company or their respective Affiliates are
required to obtain in order to consummate the Transactions, and (c) use
commercially reasonable efforts take such other action as may reasonably be
necessary or as another Party may reasonably request to satisfy the conditions
of Article VII or otherwise to comply with this Agreement and to consummate
the Transactions as soon as practicable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no
event will Buyer or the Company or any of its Subsidiaries be obligated to
bear any material expense or pay any material fee or grant any material
concession in connection with obtaining any Authorizations required in order
to consummate the Merger pursuant to the terms of any Contract to which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party; provided, however, that Buyer
will bear the legal and other expenses incurred by it in connection with using
commercially reasonable efforts to obtaining the Authorizations required to
satisfy the condition set forth in Section 7.1(c) and, if requested by any
Governmental Authority as a condition to its granting the Authorization
required to satisfy the condition set forth in Section 7.1(c), Buyer will
agree to the matters set forth in Section 6.3 of the Company Disclosure
Letter, and any other reasonable requests of the Governmental Authority as
would not materially and adversely affect the economic benefits that Buyer
reasonably expects to realize from the Transactions.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-36-  

  

 

 

 

  

6.4 Antitrust Approvals.

  

  

(a) Each of Buyer and the Company will (i) make or cause to be made all
filings required of it or its Affiliates under the Antitrust Laws with respect
to the Transactions as promptly as practicable and, in any event, within five
Business Days from the date of this Agreement, (ii) comply at the earliest
practicable date with any request under the Antitrust Laws for additional
information, documents or other materials received by it or its Affiliates
from any Governmental Authority in respect of such filings or the
Transactions, and (iii) cooperate with the other in connection with any such
filing and in connection with resolving any investigation or other inquiry of
any Governmental Authority under any Antitrust Law with respect to any such
filing or the Transactions. Each of Buyer and the Company will use its
commercially reasonable efforts to furnish to the other all information
required for any application or other filing to be made pursuant to any
applicable Law in connection with the Transactions and promptly inform the
other of any oral communication with, and provide copies of written
communications with, any Governmental Authority regarding any such filings or
the Transactions. No Party will independently participate in any scheduled
meeting or teleconference with any Governmental Authority in respect of any
such filing, investigation or other inquiry without giving the other Party
prior notice of the meeting and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental
Authority, the opportunity to attend and participate in such meeting.

  

  

(b) Without limiting the generality or effect of Section 6.2(a) or 6.3, each
of Buyer and the Company will use its respective commercially reasonable
efforts to resolve such objections, if any, as may be asserted by any
Governmental Authority with respect to the Transactions under any Antitrust
Law and take such action as may be required to cause the expiration of the
waiting periods under the Antitrust Laws with respect to the Transactions as
promptly as possible after the execution of this Agreement. In connection
therewith, if any Action is instituted (or threatened to be instituted)
challenging the Transactions (or any portion thereof) as in violation of any
Antitrust Law, each of Buyer and the Company will cooperate and use its
commercially reasonable efforts to contest and resist any such Action and to
have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any Governmental Order, whether
temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits,
prevents or restricts consummation of the Transactions unless Buyer and the
Company mutually agree that litigation is not in their respective best
interests. In connection with and without limiting the foregoing, each of
Buyer and the Company will take promptly any and all commercially reasonable
steps necessary to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under any
Antitrust Law that may be asserted by any Governmental Authority, so as to
enable the Parties to close the Transactions as promptly as possible.

  

  

(c) Buyer will be solely responsible for and pay all filing fees payable to
Governmental Authorities under any Antitrust Law.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-37-  

  

 

 

 

  

6.5 Indemnification and Insurance.

  

  

(a) For a period of six years from the Effective Time, Buyer will cause each
Surviving Corporation to maintain in effect, directors\' and officers\'
liability insurance covering those Persons who are currently covered by the
Company\'s or any of its Subsidiaries\' directors\' and officers\' liability
insurance policies on terms not materially less favorable than the terms of
such current insurance coverage; provided, however, that if any claim is
asserted or made within such six-year period, such insurance will be continued
in respect of such claim until the final disposition thereof.

  

  

(b) The provisions of this Section 6.5 will survive the Closing and are
intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each
indemnified Person hereunder and its successors and representatives. The
rights of the indemnified Persons under this Section 6.5 will be in addition
to any rights such Persons may have under the organizational or
indemnification documents of Buyer, the Company or any of their Subsidiaries,
by contract or by Law and Buyer will not amend or fail to perform thereunder
and will keep each of such rights and documents in effect for a period of six
years after the Effective Time, in each case other than any such amendments or
other changes that are not adverse to any such indemnified Person.

  

  

(c) The obligations under this Section 6.5 will not be terminated or modified
by Buyer or the Surviving Corporation in a manner as to adversely affect any
indemnified Person to whom this Section 6.5 applies without the consent of the
affected indemnified Person. In the event that either Buyer or the Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates
with or merges into any other Persons or (ii) transfers 50% or more of its
properties or assets to any Person, then and in each case, proper provision
will be made so that the applicable successors and assigns or transferees
assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.5.

  

  

6.6 Escrow Agreement. At or prior to the Closing, Buyer, the Escrow Agent and
an authorized representative of the Representative will execute and deliver
the Escrow Agreement.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-38-  

  

 

 

 

  

6.7 Employment Matters. Prior to and after the Closing, as applicable, Buyer
and the Company will take the actions specified in Section 6.7 of the Company
Disclosure Letter.

  

  

6.8 Public Announcements. The initial press release announcing this Agreement
will be in substantially the form previously agreed to by representatives of
the Parties. Thereafter, no Party will issue any press release or otherwise
make any similar public announcement with respect to the Transactions, without
the prior written consent of Buyer (without joinder by Merger Sub) and the
Company; provided, however, that any Party may make any public disclosure it
believes in good faith is required by Law or legal process, in which case it
will, if reasonably practicable in the circumstances, use its commercially
reasonable efforts to consult with the other Party with respect to the timing
and content thereof.

  

  

6.9 Termination of Certain Arrangements. Effective immediately prior to the
Closing, the Company will take such action as is required to cause the
Contracts set forth in Section 6.9 of the Company Disclosure Letter to be
terminated.

  

  

6.10 No Solicitation; Exclusivity. From the date of this Agreement until the
Closing Date, the Company will not, and will direct its Affiliates, directors,
officers, agents and other representatives acting on behalf or at the
direction of the Company not to, deliberately initiate any contact with,
solicit, encourage or enter into or continue any discussions, negotiations,
understandings or agreements with any third party with respect to or in
connection with, or furnish or disclose any non-public information regarding
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any third party in connection with,
any merger, consolidation, share exchange, recapitalization or other business
combination or sale transaction involving the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, in each case other than the Transactions. Any action taken,
whether directly or indirectly by the Representative or any Company Interest
Holder or their respective officers, directors (or the equivalent thereof) or,
employees or their respective agents or representatives with their Knowledge,
that would be a breach of this Section 6.10 if taken by the Company, will be
deemed to be a breach of this Agreement for purposes of this Agreement.

  

  

6.11 Disclosure Letters. The Company and Buyer may, at their option on or
before the date of this Agreement, include in the Company Disclosure Letter
and Buyer Disclosure Letter (as applicable) items that are not material in
order to avoid any misunderstanding, and such inclusion, or any references to
dollar amounts, will not be deemed to be an acknowledgement or representation
that such items are material, to establish any standard of materiality or to
define further the meaning of such terms for purposes of this Agreement.
Information disclosed in the Company Disclosure Letter or the Buyer Disclosure
Letter will qualify any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement herein
to the extent that the relevance or applicability of the information disclosed
to the representation, warranty, covenant or agreement is reasonably apparent
on its face, notwithstanding the absence of a reference or cross-reference to
such representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on any such Company
Disclosure Letter or Buyer Disclosure Letter or the absence of a reference or
cross-reference to such Company Disclosure Letter or Buyer Disclosure Letter
in such representation, warranty, covenant or agreement. Descriptions of terms
or documents summarized in the Company Disclosure Letter or the Buyer
Disclosure Letter will be qualified in their entirety by the documents
themselves.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-39-  

  

 

 

 

  

6.12 Notice of Certain Events. From the date of this Agreement until the
Closing Date, each Party will, subject to applicable Law, promptly notify the
other Party if it has Knowledge of:

  

  

(a) any material notice or other communication from any Person alleging that
the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the
Transactions;

  

  

(b) any written notice or other written communication from any Governmental
Authority in connection with the Transactions;

  

  

(c) the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event that is likely to cause any
representation or warranty of such Party in this Agreement to be untrue or
inaccurate in any material respect at or prior to the Closing Date;

  

  

(d) any change or event that, individually or in the aggregate, has had or
would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect;

  

  

(e) any written material Action commenced or, to such Party\'s Knowledge,
threatened against, relating to or involving or otherwise affecting such Party
that, if pending on the date of this Agreement, would have been required to
have been disclosed pursuant to Section 3.10 of this Agreement; and

  

  

(f) any change or fact of which it is aware that will or is reasonably
expected to result in any of the conditions set forth in Article VII becoming
incapable of being satisfied.

  

  

Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) no delivery of any notice pursuant to this
Section 6.12 will (A) have any effect for the purpose of qualifying the
representations and warranties of the notifying Party contained herein, or be
deemed to cure any misrepresentation or breach of warranty that might
otherwise have existed hereunder by reason of the omission of such item from
the Company Disclosure Letter or the Buyer Disclosure Letter, as applicable,
(B) limit or otherwise affect any of the remedies available to any Party
pursuant to this Agreement or the representations, warranties, covenants,
agreements or conditions to the obligation of the Parties under this Agreement
and (ii) the Parties\' respective obligations to give notice under this
Section 6.12 and any breach thereof will not be deemed a breach of a covenant
for purposes of Article VII or Article IX unless the failure to give such
notice would individually reasonably be expected to either materially delay
the consummation of the Transactions or prejudice in a material manner the
Party to whom notice was owed pursuant to this Section 6.12.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-40-  

  

 

 

 

  

6.13 Assistance on Financing Matters. Prior to the Closing, the Company will,
and will cause its Subsidiaries to, and will use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause its and its Subsidiaries\' employees and advisors (including
legal, financial and accounting advisors) to, provide to Buyer such
cooperation in connection with Buyer\'s efforts (at Buyer\'s discretion) to
(a) enter into new financing arrangements in connection with the Transactions,
(b) extinguish, retire or refinance all or any portion of the Company\'s
Indebtedness effective upon the Closing, or (c) maintain following the Closing
all or any portion of the Company\'s existing Indebtedness, in each case, as
may be reasonably requested by Buyer, which cooperation will include, but not
be limited to (i) furnishing Buyer or any current or prospective lenders with
reasonably requested financial and other reasonably available information
regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries, (ii) participating in a reasonable
number of meetings, presentations and due diligence sessions with current or
prospective lenders, (iii) providing notices to, making any filings with, and
using commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any authorizations, waivers,
consents and approvals of, any current or prospective lenders; provided,
however, that, (A) the Company shall not be required to commit to take any
action that is not contingent upon the Closing (including the entry into any
agreement) or that would be effective prior to the Closing and (B) Buyer
shall, promptly upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company for all
reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or Affiliates in connection with such cooperation in accordance
with the terms hereof (and all expenses related to the actions herein
contemplated will be excluded from the calculation of the Book Value).

VIII. TERMINATION/EFFECTIVENESS

  

  

8.1 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated and the Transactions
abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time:

  

  

(a) by mutual consent of Buyer (without joinder of Merger Sub) and the
Company;

  

  

(b) by either the Company, on the one hand, or Buyer (without joinder of
Merger Sub), on the other hand, if the Closing shall not have occurred on or
before December 31, 2012 (the "Initial Termination Date"); provided, however,
that if on the Initial Termination Date one or more of the conditions to
Closing set forth in Sections 7.1(a), 7.1(b) or 7.1(c) shall have not been
satisfied or duly waived by Buyer (without joinder by Merger Sub) and the
Company, but all other conditions to the Closing have been satisfied (or, in
the case of conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing,
are capable of being satisfied on the Initial Termination Date), then the
Initial Termination Date will, at the option of the Company or Buyer, be
extended to and include March 31, 2013 (as so extended, if applicable, the
"Outside Date"), if the Company or Buyer notifies the other Party in writing
on or prior to the Initial Termination Date of its election to so extend the
Initial Termination Date; and provided, further, that the right to extend the
Initial Termination Date or to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 8.1(b) will not be available to any Party whose breach of any
provision of this Agreement results in or causes the failure of the
Transactions to be completed by the Initial Termination Date or the Outside
Date;

  

  

(c) by either the Company, on the one hand, or Buyer (without joinder of
Merger Sub), on the other hand, if the consummation of the Transactions (or
any portion thereof) is enjoined, prohibited or otherwise restrained by the
terms of a final, non-appealable Governmental Order of a court of competent
jurisdiction; provided, however, that the right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 8.1(c) will not be available to any Party whose
breach of any provision of this Agreement results in or causes such
Governmental Order or the failure of such Governmental Order to be removed;

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-44-  

  

 

 

 

  

(d) by Buyer (without joinder of Merger Sub), on the one hand, or the Company,
on the other hand, if there is any material breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of the Company, on the one hand,
or Buyer or Merger Sub, on the other hand, set forth in this Agreement, such
that the conditions specified in Section 7.2(a) or 7.2(b) (in the case of a
termination by Buyer) or Section 7.3(a) or 7.3(b) (in the case of a
termination by the Company) would not be satisfied at the Closing and, in
either such case, such breach cannot be cured by the Termination Date, or if
capable of being cured, is not cured within 30 days after written notice of
such breach is given by the applicable Party (or, if earlier, the Termination
Date); provided, however, that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant
to this Section 8.1(d) will not be available to any Party who is then in
material breach of any of its obligations under this Agreement so as to
prevent the conditions to Closing set forth in Section 7.1, Section 7.2 (if
the breaching Party is the Company or the Representative) or 7.3 (if the
breaching Party is Buyer or Merger Sub) from being satisfied;

  

  

(e) by the Company, if Buyer shall publish a press release or file or become
obligated to file a report with the SEC to the effect that its audit committee
has commenced an investigation into any accounting matter, its independent

in each case arising solely out of any (i) knowing material breach of any of
the Company\'s or the Representative\'s representations and warranties in this
Agreement, (ii) knowing breach of Annex 4 of any of the WLR Acknowledgement
Letters, or (iii) deliberate material breach of any covenant of this Agreement

of investigation or verification other than an actual reading of the
representations and warranties as they appear in this Agreement by such
Party\'s chief executive officer and chief operating officer) and (ii) a
"deliberate" breach of any covenant will be deemed to have occurred only if an
executive officer of the Party alleged to have breached took or failed to take
action with actual knowledge that there was a substantial likelihood that the
action so taken or omitted to be taken constituted a breach of such covenant.
For purposes of this Section 8.2(b), an "executive officer" will have the
meaning given to the term "officer" in Rule 16a-1(f) under the Exchange Act.

  

  

IX. INDEMNIFICATION

  

  

9.1 Indemnification by the Company Indemnitors.

  

  

(a) From and after the Closing, on the terms and subject to the conditions of
this Article IX, the Company Indemnitors will, on a several and not joint
basis (with several liability allocated in accordance with their pro rata
share of the Merger Consideration) defend, indemnify and hold harmless Buyer
(including on behalf of the other Buyer Indemnitees) and its Affiliates,
officers, directors, managers, stockholders, employees and assigns
(collectively, the "Buyer Indemnitees") from and against, and pay or reimburse
the Buyer Indemnitees for, any and all losses or damages, including reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses, court costs, reasonable expert witness fees and
reasonable attorneys\' fees (collectively, "Losses"), resulting from or
arising out of:

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-46-  

  

 

 

 

  

(i) any breach of a Specified Rep of the Company;

  

  

(ii) any breach of a representation and warranty set forth in Article III that
is not a Specified Rep;

  

  

(iii) any breach by the Company of any of the covenants contained in Section
6.1(b);

  

  

(iv) any claim made by any Person who was a shareholder or holder of other
equity rights or equity-linked rights of the Company at any time prior to the
Effective Time, including any holder of Dissenting Shares, in each case,
relating to such Person\'s status as a shareholder or holder of other equity
right or equity-linked right of the Company;

  

  

(v) Pre-Closing Taxes; or

  

  

(vi) 75% of the Retained Liabilities.

  

  

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company Indemnitors will not be required to
indemnify the Buyer Indemnitees (A) with respect to any individual matter that
is a Retained Liability indemnified pursuant to Section 9.1(a)(vi), unless the
aggregate amount of Losses with respect thereto exceeds $5,000, (B) with
respect to any individual matter described in Section 9.1(a)(i), Section
9.1(a)(ii) or Section 9.1(a)(iv) unless the aggregate amount of Losses with
respect thereto exceeds $50,000, provided that multiple matters involving the
same underlying facts, similar underlying facts and the same borrower,
mortgage or Servicing Contract or identical servicing process or accounting
process errors made by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries repeatedly for a
period will be aggregated and considered a single individual matter for the
purposes of this Section 9.1(a), (C) with respect to matters described in
Section 9.1(a)(i) and Section 9.1(a)(ii) unless, and then only to the extent
that, the aggregate amount of all Losses thereunder exceeds $7.5 million, and
(C) for any Losses indemnified collectively pursuant to Section 9.1(a)(ii),
Section 9.1(a)(iii), Section 9.1(a)(iv), Section 9.1(a)(v), and Section
9.1(a)(vi) in excess of the Escrow Fund in the aggregate, and (D) for any
Losses indemnified collectively pursuant to Section 9.1(a)(i), Section
9.1(a)(ii), Section 9.1(a)(iii), Section 9.1(a)(iv), Section 9.1(a)(v) and
Section 9.1(a)(vi), together with an amount for which the Company Interest
Holders, collectively, are liable under the Acknowledgements, in excess of an
amount equal to the Merger Consideration (in the aggregate). The limitations
contained in this Section 9.1(a) and elsewhere in this Article IX will not
apply in the case of Specified Fraud.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-47-  

  

 

 

 

  

(b) All Losses relating to claims for indemnification pursuant to Section
9.1(a) (except for Section 9.1(a)(i), which will first be satisfied out of the
Escrow Funds) will be satisfied solely out of the Escrow Funds. Subject to the
limitations set forth in this Article IX, any additional Losses indemnified
pursuant to Section 9.1(a)(i) will then be satisfied by the Company
Indemnitors.

  

  

(c) Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, in no event will any Buyer
Indemnitee make any claim for indemnification under Section 9.1 after the date
of expiration of the applicable survival period set forth in this Section
9.1(c). The representations and warranties of the Company (other than the
Specified Reps) contained herein and the covenants of the Company contained in
Section 6.1(b) will survive until the first anniversary of the Closing Date.
The covenants of the Company herein, except for the covenants in Section
6.1(b), will not survive the Closing. Specified Reps of the Company will
survive until sixty days after the expiration of the applicable statute of
limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, claims for indemnification asserted
prior to the end of the applicable survival period will survive until the
final resolution thereof.

  

  

(d) Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, in the event that any Losses
may reasonably be expected to be indemnifiable hereunder pursuant to Section
9.1(a)(vi), on the one hand, and also pursuant to Section 9.1(a)(i), Section
9.1(a)(ii), Section 9.1(a)(iii), Section 9.1(a)(iv) or Section 9.1(a)(v), on
the other hand, such Losses will be deemed to be indemnifiable solely pursuant
to Section 9.1(a)(vi), and in no event will any Buyer Indemnitee make claim
for indemnification for any such Losses under Section 9.1(a)(i), Section
9.1(a)(ii), Section 9.1(a)(iii), Section 9.1(a)(iv) or Section 9.1(a)(v).

  

  

9.2 Indemnification by Buyer.

  

  

(a) From and after the Closing, on the terms and subject to the conditions of
this Article IX, Buyer will defend, indemnify and hold harmless the Company
Interest Holders and the Representative (including on behalf of the other
Company Indemnitees) and their respective Affiliates, officers, directors,
managers, members, direct or indirect shareholders, employees, heirs and
assigns (collectively, the "Company Indemnitees") from and against any and all
Losses resulting from or arising out of:

  

  

(i) any breach of a Specified Rep of Buyer;

  

  

(ii) any breach of a representation and warranty set forth in Article IV that
is not a Specified Rep; and

  

  

(iii) any breach by Buyer of any of the covenants contained in Section 6.1(d).

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-48-  

  

 

 

 

  

(b) Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, in no event will any Company
Indemnitee make any claim for indemnification under Section 9.2 after the date
of expiration of the applicable survival period set forth in this Section
9.2(b). The representations and warranties of Buyer contained herein (other
than the Specified Reps) and the covenants of Buyer contained in Section
6.1(d) will survive until the first anniversary of the Closing Date. The
covenants of Buyer herein, except the covenants contained in Section 6.1(d),
will not survive the Closing. Specified Reps of Buyer will survive until 60
days after the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations. For the
avoidance of doubt, claims for indemnification asserted prior to the end of
the applicable survival period will survive until the final resolution
thereof.

  

  

9.3 Indemnification Procedures.

  

  

(a) Notice and Opportunity to Defend Claims. If an event occurs that a Person
entitled to indemnification with respect thereto under this Agreement
(together with the Representative, an "Indemnified Party") asserts is an
indemnifiable event pursuant to Section 9.1 or 9.2, the Indemnified Party
seeking indemnification will notify the Representative (in the case of a claim
by a Buyer Indemnitee) or Buyer (in the case of a claim by a Company
Indemnitee) (in either such case, the "Indemnifying Party") promptly, but no
later than 30 days, after such Indemnified Party receives written notice, in
the case of a third-party claim, or otherwise becomes aware, in the case of a
direct claim, of any such claim, event or matter as to which indemnity may be
sought; provided, however, that (i) the failure of the Indemnified Party to
give notice as provided in this Section 9.3(a) will not relieve any
Indemnifying Party of its obligations under Section 9.1 or 9.2, except to the
extent that such failure materially prejudices the rights of any such
Indemnifying Party and (ii) for the avoidance of doubt, the Representative is
referred to herein as an "Indemnifying Party" solely for purposes of receiving
notice and controlling the defense and settlement of claims hereunder (and in
no circumstances will a Representative or any member thereof, in its, his or
her capacity as such a "representative" or member thereof have any obligation
to indemnify any Person hereunder). Any notice of a claim, event or matter as
to which indemnity may be sought will include a reasonably detailed
description of such claim, event or matter, the basis of the claim for
indemnification, copies of material documentation reasonably accessible to or
in the possession of the Indemnified Party that the Indemnified Party believes
supports such claim for indemnification and a good faith estimate (if capable
of then being estimated) of the amount of Losses incurred or which reasonably
could be expected to be incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with
such claim.

  

  

(b) Retained Liabilities. In the event of a claim asserted by a third party
against a Buyer Indemnitee in an Action that, if adversely resolved, would be
indemnifiable pursuant to Section 9.1(a)(vi) taking into account Sections 9.5
and 9.6 (a "Retained Liability Claim"), such claim will be subject to the
additional procedures set forth in Exhibit D. Reasonable out-of-pocket costs
and expenses, including attorneys\' fees and costs ("Costs"), incurred by the
Representative or Buyer, as the case may be, to the extent relating to a
Retained Liability Claim will be paid 75% out of the Escrow Fund and 25% by
Buyer.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-49-  

  

 

 

 

  

(c) Third-Party Claims. In the case of any claim asserted by a third party
against an Indemnified Party in an Action (other than any Retained Liability
Claims, which are addressed in Exhibit D), the Indemnified Party will give
written notice to the Indemnifying Party (or, with respect to a claim for
which indemnification is sought pursuant to Section 9.1, the Representative)
of the third-party claim in accordance with Section 9.3(a), and the
Indemnified Party will permit the Indemnifying Party (at the expense of such
Indemnifying Party) to assume (which assumption may be made under a
reservation of rights) the defense of any third-party claim or any litigation
with a third party resulting therefrom; provided, however, that the
Indemnified Party may participate in such defense at such Indemnified Party\'s
expense. Except with the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, no
Indemnifying Party, in the defense of any such claim or litigation, will
consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement that provides
for injunctive or other non-monetary relief affecting the Indemnified Party or
that does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by each
claimant or plaintiff to such Indemnified Party of a general release from all
liability with respect to such claim or litigation. If the Indemnifying Party
does not assume the defense of any matter as above provided, the Indemnified
Party will have the right to defend such matter and to settle such matter;
provided, however, that the Indemnified Party may not settle such claim
without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party (which consent
will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). In any event, the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party will reasonably cooperate in the
defense of any third-party claim or litigation subject to this Article IX and
will each provide the other reasonable access to its records in order to
facilitate the defense and settlement of such matter. In the case of claims
for income Taxes, the Indemnified Party shall only be entitled to assume an
Action to the extent solely related to an item for which indemnity is sought.

  

  

9.4 Exclusive Remedy. Following the Closing, except in the case of Specified
Fraud or where a Party seeks to obtain specific performance or other equitable
relief pursuant to Section 12.12, the indemnification provided for in this
Article IX will be the sole and exclusive remedy available to any Party
against another Party for any claims under or based upon this Agreement or the
Transactions. Neither Buyer nor any other Buyer Indemnitee will be entitled to
recovery for indemnification claims under this Article IX directly from the
Company Interest Holders or any of their Affiliates, other than as
specifically provided in the Acknowledgement Letters. Without limiting the
foregoing, in no event will Buyer or any other Buyer Indemnitee be entitled to
offset any amounts owed to it pursuant to this Article IX against any amounts
owed by Buyer, any Buyer Indemnitee, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective Affiliates to any employee or former employee of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries pursuant to any Contract or against the Merger
Consideration.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-50-  

  

 

 

 

  

9.5 Additional Limitations on Indemnification.

  

  

(a) No Buyer Indemnitee will be entitled to indemnification pursuant to
Section 9.1 for any special, punitive or exemplary damages; provided, however,
that this Section 9.5(a) will not apply to any claim asserted in an Action by
a third party against an Indemnified Party.

  

  

(b) Any indemnifiable Loss hereunder will be calculated net of any (i) amounts
actually recovered by the Indemnified Party under insurance policies, (ii)
actual reduction in cash Taxes otherwise payable by such Indemnified Party
arising from the incurrence of payment of any such Losses for the Tax year in
which such Losses arise, calculated based on the excess of the Tax liability
of such Indemnified Party if the applicable Tax items were not included on its
Tax Returns over such Indemnified Party\'s actual Tax liability for such year,
and (iii) amounts actually recovered by the Indemnified Party from third
parties pursuant to indemnification or otherwise. If the Indemnifying Party
makes any payment on any claim pursuant to Section 9.1, the Indemnifying Party
will be subrogated, to the extent of such payment, to all rights and remedies
of the Indemnified Party to any insurance benefits or other claims of the
Indemnified Party with respect to such claim.

  

  

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no Buyer
Indemnitee will be indemnified for any Loss to the extent (i) arising or
resulting from any change in applicable Law or accounting principles from and
after the date of this Agreement, (ii) that Buyer Indemnitees have otherwise
been compensated for such Loss pursuant to this Article IX, or (iii) to the
extent that reserves exist therefor on the Final Closing Balance Sheet.

  

  

(d) In the event the Closing occurs and any Company Interest Holder (either
before or after Closing) has made (or is required to make) any payment
(including any payment made from the Escrow Fund) to any Buyer Indemnitee in
satisfaction of all or some of its indemnification obligation hereunder, in no
event will any Company Interest Holder (or any Affiliate thereof) or any
Company Indemnitee be entitled to seek indemnification or contribution (or any
similar theory) from the Company or its Subsidiaries (including any of
officers, directors, employees, agents, shareholders and Affiliates of the
Company or its Subsidiaries) in respect of any such payments made (or required
to be made) by such Company Interest Holder (or any Affiliate thereof).

  

  

(e) Without limiting the generality or effect of the foregoing, in no event
will Buyer be entitled to indemnification pursuant to Section 9.1(a)(vi)
unless and until the indemnifiable Losses pursuant to such Section 9.1(a)(vi)
exceed the aggregate amount of all reserves for Retained Liabilities that are
reflected in the Final Closing Date Balance Sheet. Section 2.4(a) of the
Company Disclosure Letter shows the amounts of reserves for Retained
Liabilities (which will be aggregated for purposes of this Section 9.4(e)),
that are included on the balance sheet included in the Unaudited Financial
Statements.

  

  

(f) Neither the existence of nor any payment from the Costs Escrow will affect
any Company Indemnitee's rights or obligations hereunder.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-51-  

  

 

 

 

  

9.6 No Double Recovery. For the avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Agreement, including Exhibit D, "Indemnified Retained
Liabilities" (as defined in Exhibit D) will not include, and no Company
Indemnitor will have any obligation under Section 9.1 for, any increase in a
liability or reserve or decrease in asset to the extent that such change was
taken into account in the calculation of the Final Book Value Amount pursuant
to Section 2.4.

  

  

9.7 Treatment of Indemnity Payments. Any payment made pursuant to this Article
IX will be treated as an adjustment to the Merger Consideration for all Tax
purposes, to the extent permitted by applicable Law.

  

  

9.8 Release of Escrow Amount. On the first Business Day following the Survival
Date, the Escrow Agent will distribute from the Escrow Fund, by wire transfer
of immediately available funds to the accounts specified by the
Representative, the aggregate amount by which the amount remaining in the
Escrow Fund, not to exceed $75 million plus interest and other earnings
thereon, reduced by the sum of the aggregate amount of indemnification claims
validly made under this Article IX and then pending ("Pending Claims"), in
accordance with the instructions provided by the Representative. With respect
to any Pending Claims, as soon as reasonably practicable following resolution
of any such Pending Claims, the amount, if any, of such Pending Claims which
has not been paid to a Buyer Indemnitee in connection with such resolution
will be distributed from the Escrow Account, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds in the same manner as described in the immediately preceding
sentence. Upon prior written request of the Representative, all or any portion
of the Costs Escrow will be released by the Escrow Agent without the consent
or joinder of Buyer, the Company or any other Person.

  

  

X. REPRESENTATIVE

specified, and Buyer acknowledges that nothing herein or otherwise will be
deemed to preclude any former Company Interest Holders or the Representative

Representative and (b) the Representative to act on behalf of the Company
Interest Holders. The Representative may designate one or more individual
representatives thereof to act on its behalf for purposes of communicating
with Buyer in connection with this Agreement, and Buyer will be permitted to

-52-  

  

 

 

 

  

10.2 Authority and Rights of the Representative; Limitations on Liability. The

Indemnitee under this Agreement and comply with Governmental Orders with

Agreement pursuant to its Acknowledgement Letter), each Company Interest
Holder hereby agrees that:

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-53-  

  

 

 

 

  

(a) in all matters in which action by any Company Interest Holder or the
Representative is required or permitted under this Agreement, the
Representative is exclusively authorized to act on behalf of any Company
Interest Holder, notwithstanding any dispute or disagreement among Company
Interest Holders, or between any Company Interest Holder and the
Representative, and each of Buyer, the Escrow Agent and the Accounting Firm
will be entitled to rely conclusively on any and all instructions or decisions
of, or actions taken by, such Representative under this Agreement without any
liability or duty of independent investigation;

  

  

(b) any decision, act, consent or instruction of the Representative will
constitute a decision of all of the Company Interest Holders and will be
final, binding and conclusive upon each Company Interest Holder;

  

  

(c) the power and authority of the Representative, as described in this
Agreement, will continue in force until all rights and obligations of the
Company Interest Holders under this Agreement have terminated, expired or been
fully performed; and

  

  

(d) the Representative will not have by reason of this Agreement or otherwise
a fiduciary relationship in respect of any Company Interest Holder, and no
Company Interest Holder will have any cause of action against the
Representative for, and the Representative will not be liable to any Company
Interest Holder for, and the Company Interest Holders will indemnify the
Representative for any Losses arising out of, any action taken or not taken,
decision made or instruction given by the Representative under this Agreement,
except for actual fraud in which the Representative receives a direct
financial benefit not proportionately realized by the Company Interest
Holders. Without limiting the foregoing, the Representative will not be liable
to any Company Interest Holder for any apportionment or distribution of
payments made by it in good faith, and if any such apportionment or
distribution is subsequently determined to have been made in error, the sole
recourse of any Company Interest Holder to whom payment was due, but not made,
will be to recover from the other Company Interest Holders any payment in
excess of the amount to which they are determined to have been entitled
pursuant to this Agreement.

12.3 Assignment. No Party may assign this Agreement or any part hereof without
the prior written consent of the other Parties, except that any consent by
Buyer will not require the joinder of Merger Sub, provided, however, that (i)
Buyer may assign this Agreement to any Subsidiary of Buyer or to any lender to
Buyer or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof as security for obligations to
such lender in respect of the financing arrangements entered into in
connection with the Transactions and any refinancings, extensions, refundings
or renewals thereof; provided, further however, that in no event will any such
lender (or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof) be required or deemed to
assume any obligations or liabilities of the Parties. Any assignment in
violation of this Section 12.3 will be void and of no effect. Subject to the
foregoing, this Agreement will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the
Parties and their respective permitted successors and assigns. In the event
that either Buyer or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person or
(ii) transfers 50% or more of its properties or assets to any Person, then and
in each case, proper provision will be made so that the applicable successors
and assigns or transferees assume the obligations set forth in this Agreement.

12.4 Rights of Third Parties. Except for the provisions of Sections 1.7, 6.5,
9.2 and 12.14, nothing expressed or implied in this Agreement is intended or
will be construed to confer upon or give any Person, other than the Parties,
any right or remedies under or by reason of this Agreement. No Party may
assert any claim against any officer, director, direct or indirect
stockholder, partner or member of another Party under this Agreement or in
connection with the Transactions.

  

  

12.5 Expenses. Except as otherwise provided herein, each Party, other than the
Representative, will bear its own expenses incurred in connection with this
Agreement and the Transactions whether or not such Transactions are
consummated, including all fees of its legal counsel, financial advisers and
accountants; provided that the Company Interest Holders will bear all out of
pocket fees and expenses of (a) the Representative and (b) the Company and its
Subsidiaries incurred and not paid by the Company prior to the Closing,
including any amounts due to outside counsel, advisors and accountants, in
connection with the negotiation and preparation of this Agreement and the
documents ancillary hereto and the performance and consummation of the
Transactions.

  

  

12.6 Governing Law. This Agreement will be construed and enforced in
accordance with the Laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to the
conflict of laws principles that would result in the application of any Law
other than the Law of the State of Delaware.

  

  

12.7 Captions; Counterparts. The captions in this Agreement are for
convenience only and will not be considered a part of or affect the
construction or interpretation of any provision of this Agreement. This
Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which will be deemed an

instrument.

12.8 Entire Agreement. This Agreement (together with the Company Disclosure
Letter, the Buyer Disclosure Letter and Exhibits to this Agreement) and the
confidentiality letter agreement previously entered into between Buyer and the
Company (the "Confidentiality Agreement") constitute the entire agreement
among the Parties relating to the Transactions and supersede any other
agreements, whether written or oral, that may have been made or entered into
by or among any of the Parties or any of their respective Subsidiaries
relating to the Transactions, including such confidentiality agreement. The
Parties negotiated this Agreement with the assistance of professional advisors
and intend that this Agreement encompass the entire relationship among them.
As such, the Parties hereby confirm that there are no, and hereby expressly
waive and disclaim, extra-contractual rights or obligations among them,
including arising under theories of implied duties of good faith or fair
dealing, actual or constructive fraud (other than in any case of Specified
Fraud) or other theories.

  

  

12.9 Amendments. This Agreement may be amended or modified in whole or in
part, only by a duly authorized agreement in writing executed by Buyer
(without the joinder of Merger Sub) and the Company in the same manner as this
Agreement and which makes reference to this Agreement. The approval of this
Agreement by the requisite stockholders of the Company will not restrict the
ability of the Board of Directors of the Company to terminate this Agreement
in accordance with Section 8.1 or to cause the Company to enter into an
amendment to this Agreement pursuant to this Section 12.9 to the extent
permitted under the DGCL.

  

  

12.10 Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid or
unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction, the other provisions of
this Agreement will remain in full force and effect. The Parties further agree
that if any provision contained herein is, to any extent, held invalid or
unenforceable in any respect under applicable Law, they will take any actions
necessary to render the remaining provisions of this Agreement valid and
enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by Law and, to the extent
necessary, will amend or otherwise modify this Agreement to replace any
provision contained herein that is held invalid or unenforceable with a valid
and enforceable provision giving effect to the intent of the Parties.

  

  

12.11 Jurisdiction. Except as set forth in Section 2.4 and Exhibit D, all
Actions arising out of or relating to this Agreement will be heard and
determined in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, only if the
Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware declines to accept jurisdiction
over a particular matter, any federal court within the State of Delaware). The
Parties hereby (a) submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, only if the Court of Chancery of the
State of Delaware declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter,
any federal court within the State of Delaware) for the purpose of any Action
(other than any dispute under Section 2.4) arising out of or relating to this
Agreement brought by any Party and (b) irrevocably waive, and agree not to
assert by way of motion, defense or otherwise, in any such Action, any claim
that they are not subject personally to the jurisdiction of the above-named
courts, that the property is exempt or immune from attachment or execution,
that any such Action is brought in an inconvenient forum, that the venue of
such Action is improper or that this Agreement or the Transactions may not be
enforced in or by any of the above-named courts. Each of the Parties agrees
that mailing of process or other papers in connection with any action or
proceeding in the manner provided in Section 12.2 or such other manner as may
be permitted by Law will be valid and sufficient service of process.

12.12 Enforcement. Subject to Section 9.1(b), the Parties agree that
irreparable damage will occur in the event that any of the provisions of this
Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were
otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the Parties will be entitled
to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to
specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement, in addition
to any other remedy to which any Party is entitled at law or in equity. In the
event that any Action is brought in equity to enforce the provisions of this
Agreement, no Party will allege, and each Party hereby waives the defense,
that there is an adequate remedy at law.

  

  

12.13 Attorneys Fees. Prior to Closing and subject to Section 8.2(a), if a
Party initiates any Action arising out of or in connection with this Agreement
and does not prevail on such Action, the prevailing Party will be entitled to
recover from the other all Costs incurred by the prevailing Party in
connection therewith.

  

  

12.14 Company Professional Advisors. Each Party hereby acknowledges, on its
own behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates, that each of the Company
Professional Advisors may advise and represent the Company and their
Affiliates in connection with the negotiation, preparation, execution and
delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions, and that,
following consummation of the Transactions, each of the Company Professional
Advisors may advise and represent the Representative or its Affiliates, if
such Persons so request, in connection with any Action or obligation arising
out of or relating to this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or the
Transactions, and each Party hereby consents thereto and waives any conflict
of interest arising therefrom, and each Party and their respective Boards of
Directors (or committees thereof) will cause any Affiliate thereof to consent
to and waive any conflict of interest arising from any such representation.
Buyer, for itself, Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation and for their
respective successors and assigns, irrevocably acknowledges and agrees that
all communications between the Company and their respective shareholders and
the Company Professional Advisors that are legal counsel that were made in
connection with the negotiation, preparation, execution, delivery and closing
under, or any dispute or proceeding arising under or in connection with, this
Agreement which, immediately prior to the Closing, would be deemed to be
privileged communications of the Company and such shareholders and their legal
counsel and would not be subject to disclosure to Buyer, Merger Sub or the
Surviving Corporation in connection with any process relating to a dispute
arising under or in connection with this Agreement or otherwise, will continue
after the Closing to be privileged communications between such Persons and
such legal counsel, and none of Buyer, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation
or any Person acting or purporting to act on behalf of or through Buyer,
Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation will seek to obtain the same by any
process on the grounds that the privilege attaching to such communications
belongs to Buyer, Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation.
