NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual covenants and
agreements hereinafter contained, the parties hereby agree as follows: 

ARTICLE I

SALE AND PURCHASE OF SECURITIES; CLOSING

1.1 Sale and Purchase of Purchased Securities. Upon the terms and subject to
the conditions contained herein, on the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall
purchase the Purchased Securities from the Sellers for an aggregate cash
amount equal to the Gross Purchase Price (payable and subject to adjustment as
provided in Article II), and each Seller shall sell to the Purchaser the
number of Purchased Securities set forth opposite such Seller's name on
Appendix II hereto for an amount (payable and subject to adjustment as
provided in Article II) equal to the amount set forth opposite such Seller's
name in the Waterfall Spreadsheet under the heading "Purchase Price Allocable
to Seller," in each case, free and clear of any and all Liens (the
"Transaction").

1.2 Closing Date. The closing of the Transaction (the "Closing") shall take
place on the last Business Day of the month during which all of the conditions
set forth in Article VIII (other than conditions which by their terms are
required to be satisfied or waived at the Closing) shall have been satisfied
or, if permissible, waived by the party entitled to the benefit of the same,
and, subject to the foregoing, shall take place at such time and on a date to
be specified by the parties provided, however, that in no event shall the
Closing occur prior to January 31, 2014 (the "Closing Date"). The Closing
shall take place at the offices of Goodwin Procter LLP, Exchange Place,
Boston, Massachusetts 02109 (or at such other place as the parties may
designate in writing). The Closing shall be deemed to be effective at 11:59
p.m. Eastern time on the Closing Date.

ARTICLE II 
CONSIDERATION; PURCHASE PRICE ADJUSTMENT; EARN-OUT

2.1 Closing Consideration. The aggregate purchase price to be paid by the
Purchaser for the Purchased Securities on the Closing Date shall be an amount
equal to $380,000,000 (the "Gross Purchase Price"), plus the Estimated Cash
and Cash Equivalents, plus or minus the Estimated Closing Net Working Capital
Adjustment Amount, minus the Estimated Indebtedness, minus the Estimated
Transaction Expenses, minus the Blocker Company Indebtedness, minus the
Sellers' Representative Fund Amount, minus the Escrow Amount (the "Net
Purchase Price").

2.2 Payment of Closing Consideration. On the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall
pay the following amounts by wire transfer of immediately available United
States funds into the account or accounts designated by each of the following
recipients prior to the Closing Date:

(a) to the Persons entitled thereto (or to the Company for payment to the
Persons entitled thereto), the amount of Estimated Indebtedness;

(b) to the Persons entitled thereto (or to the Company for payment to the
Persons entitled thereto), the amount of the Estimated Transaction Expenses;

(c) to the Blocker Company Sellers, the amount of the Blocker Company
Indebtedness;

(d) to the Sellers' Representative, the Sellers' Representative Fund Amount; 

(e) to the Escrow Agent, the Escrow Amount; and

(f) to the Sellers, an amount equal to the Net Purchase Price, paid in
accordance with the Waterfall Spreadsheet.

The parties hereby agree that the Waterfall Spreadsheet shall govern the
allocation amongst the Sellers (and shall not serve as a limitation as to the
Purchaser's rights under this Agreement) of any payments to or from the
Sellers that are contemplated by this Agreement or any other Transaction
Document in accordance with the priorities set forth in Section 5.1(b) of the
Company Operating Agreement (as in effect on the date hereof). The parties
further agree that the Sellers' Representative shall be required to update the
Waterfall Spreadsheet from time to time to reflect the allocation of any such
payment and to promptly furnish any such update to the Purchaser. For the sake
of clarity, the Waterfall Spreadsheet shall be used to allocate amongst the
Sellers (i) any adjustment to the Net Purchase Price at the Closing, (ii) any
Gross Purchase Price adjustment pursuant to Section 2.3(f), (iii) any Earn-out
Amount pursuant to Section 2.4(g), (iv) any release of the Escrow Amount
pursuant to Section 2.5(b) and (v) any Losses required to be indemnified by
the Sellers in the aggregate pursuant to Article IX. For avoidance of doubt,
the Purchaser shall have no responsibility for the accuracy of the Waterfall
Spreadsheet and the payment of the Net Purchase Price by the Purchaser in
accordance with the Waterfall Spreadsheet shall be deemed to satisfy the
Purchaser's obligation to each Seller pursuant to Section 2.2(f).

2.3 Purchase Price Adjustment.

(a) No later than three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the
Company shall prepare and deliver to the Purchaser a written estimate, dated
the date of its delivery, setting forth a good faith estimate by the Company
of (i) the Net Working Capital of the Group Companies and the Blocker
Companies as of the close of business on the Closing Date, calculated without
giving effect to the Transaction (the "Estimated Net Working Capital"), (ii)
the Group Companies' and the Blocker Companies' Indebtedness (including, but
not limited to, the Blocker Company Indebtedness) as of immediately prior to
the Closing (the "Estimated Indebtedness"), (iii) the Group Companies' and the
Blocker Companies' Cash and Cash Equivalents as of the close of business on
the Closing Date (the "Estimated Cash and Cash Equivalents"), (iv) the Group
Companies' and the Blocker Companies' Transaction Expenses as of immediately
prior to the Closing (the "Estimated Transaction Expenses") and (v) an updated
Waterfall Spreadsheet that sets forth the amount payable at the Closing to
each Seller, such amounts to reflect any adjustment to the Gross Purchase
Price pursuant to this Section 2.3(a), all in reasonable detail prepared in
accordance with the Accounting Principles and, with respect to the calculation
of the Net Working Capital, in a manner consistent with the illustration set
forth in Exhibit A. For the sake of clarity, any item that is accounted for in
one of the foregoing clauses (i) through (iv) shall not be accounted for in
any other clause (i) through (iv). Exhibit A sets forth, for illustrative
purposes only, the calculation of Net Working Capital as if the Closing
occurred as of November 1, 2013 (using data as of the close of business on
October 31, 2013). For purposes of calculating Net Working Capital, (A)
whether or not the date as of which Net Working Capital is required to be
calculated hereunder coincides with a fiscal quarter-end of the Group
Companies or the Blocker Companies, Net Working Capital shall be calculated
using customary fiscal quarter-end close procedures for the preparation
thereof, including procedures with respect to accruals and adjustments, and
(B) the results of the physical inventory of the Group Companies described in
Section 7.17 shall have been reflected in the Company's inventory as of the
date of such physical inventory. The Purchaser shall be entitled to review,
comment on and request reasonable changes to the estimate of the Estimated Net
Working Capital, Estimated Cash and Cash Equivalents, Estimated Indebtedness
and Estimated Transaction Expenses, and Company shall cooperate with the
Purchaser in connection therewith and consider the Purchaser's proposed
changes to the estimated statements in good faith. If the Estimated Net
Working Capital is less than the Target Net Working Capital Amount, then the
Gross Purchase Price payable on the Closing Date shall be reduced by the
amount of such deficiency. If the Estimated Net Working Capital is greater
than the Target Net Working Capital Amount, then the Gross Purchase Price
payable on the Closing Date shall be increased by the amount of such
difference. Any increase or decrease to the Gross Purchase Price pursuant to
this Section 2.3(a) shall be referred to herein as the "Estimated Closing Net
Working Capital Adjustment Amount". 

(b) As promptly as practicable, but no later than seventy-five (75) calendar
days after the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall cause to be prepared and
delivered to the Sellers' Representative a closing statement certified by the
Chief Financial Officer of the Purchaser (the "Closing Statement") setting
forth the Purchaser's calculation of (i) the Net Working Capital of the Group
Companies and the Blocker Companies as of the close of business on the Closing
Date, calculated without giving effect to the Transaction ("Closing Net
Working Capital"), (ii) the Group Companies' and the Blocker Companies'
Indebtedness (including, but not limited to, the Blocker Company Indebtedness)
as of immediately prior to the Closing (the "Closing Indebtedness"), (iii) the
Group Companies' and the Blocker Companies' Cash and Cash Equivalents as of
the close of business on the Closing Date (the "Closing Cash and Cash
Equivalents") and (iv) the Group Companies' and the Blocker Companies'
Transaction Expenses as of immediately prior to the Closing (the "Closing
Transaction Expenses" and, together with the Closing Net Working Capital, the
Closing Indebtedness and the Closing Cash and Cash Equivalents, the "Closing
Adjustments"), all in reasonable detail prepared in accordance with the
Accounting Principles and, with respect to the calculation of the Net Working
Capital, in a manner consistent with the illustration set forth in Exhibit A.
For the sake of clarity, any item that is accounted for in one of the
foregoing Closing Adjustments shall not be accounted for in any other Closing
Adjustment, and the results of the physical inventory of the Group Companies
described in Section 7.17 shall be updated as of the Closing in accordance
with the Group Companies' past practices to account for any change in the
Group Companies' inventory between the date of such physical inventory and the
Closing Date.

(c) If the Sellers' Representative disagrees with the Purchaser's calculation
of any or all of the Closing Adjustments set forth in the Closing Statement,
the Sellers' Representative may, within forty-five (45) calendar days after
the Sellers' Representative's receipt of the Closing Statement, deliver a
notice executed by the Sellers' Representative to the Purchaser disagreeing
with such calculation and setting forth the Sellers' Representative's
calculation of such amount. During such forty-five (45) day period, the
Purchaser and the Company shall on a timely basis provide to the Sellers'
Representative and its authorized representatives, upon reasonable notice,
reasonable access to all records (and financial staff of the Purchaser and the
Company who were involved in the preparation of the Closing Statement) and the
Company's outside accountants and their work papers and other documents used
in preparing the Closing Statement. If the Sellers' Representative fails to
object in writing to the calculation of all or any portion of the Closing
Adjustments within such forty-five (45) calendar day period, the Sellers'
Representative will be deemed conclusively to have agreed to all or such
portion of that calculation and that calculation or portion thereof shall be
final and binding upon the Purchaser and the Sellers. 

(d) If a notice of disagreement is delivered pursuant to Section 2.3(c), the
Sellers' Representative and the Purchaser shall, during the thirty (30)
calendar days following such delivery (or such longer period as they may
mutually agree), use their commercially reasonable efforts to reach agreement
on the disputed items or amounts in order to determine the Closing
Adjustments. During such thirty (30) day period, the Purchaser and the Company
shall on a timely basis provide to the Sellers' Representative and its
authorized representatives, upon reasonable notice, reasonable access to all
records (and financial staff of the Purchaser and the Company who were
involved in the preparation of the Closing Statement) and the Company's
outside accountants and their work papers and other documents used in
preparing the Closing Statement. If, after such thirty (30) day period, the
Sellers' Representative and the Purchaser are unable to reach an agreement,
the Sellers' Representative or the Purchaser may request that the dispute be
resolved by Grant Thornton LLP (the "Accounting Referee") or, if such firm is
unable or unwilling to act, such other nationally recognized independent
public accounting firm (other than Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Limited, KPMG
International Cooperative, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, Ernst and Young Americas
LLC or any of their Affiliates) as shall be agreed upon in writing by the
Sellers' Representative and the Purchaser or, if no such agreement can be
reached, the Sellers' Representative and the Purchaser shall, within ten (10)
days thereof, each select a candidate that satisfies the foregoing criteria
and the two candidates shall promptly select a third candidate that satisfies
the foregoing criteria who shall be appointed as Accounting Referee in lieu of
Grant Thornton LLP, in which case each such party shall submit materials in
support of their position to the Accounting Referee who shall review this
Agreement and the disputed items or amounts for the purpose of resolving the
disputed Closing Adjustments. The Accounting Referee shall deliver to the
Sellers' Representative and the Purchaser, as promptly as practicable (but in
any case no later than thirty (30) calendar days from the date of engagement
of the Accounting Referee), a report setting forth its calculation of the
final amount of each of the Closing Adjustments which shall not be less or
more (as applicable) than the amount of each Closing Adjustment shown in the
Closing Statement nor less or more (as applicable) than the amount thereof
shown in the Sellers' Representative's calculation delivered pursuant to
Section 2.3(c) and shall be limited to the matters which the Sellers'
Representative disputed in its calculation delivered pursuant to Section
2.3(c). Such report shall be final and binding upon the Sellers and the
Purchaser. The fees and costs of the Accounting Referee shall be payable (i)
by the Sellers (in proportion to their respective Pro Rata Percentage), on the
one hand and (ii) by the Purchaser, on the other hand, on the basis, for each
such party, of the percentage which the portion of the contested amount not
awarded to each party bears to the amount actually contested by such party (as
specified in the supporting materials that each of the Purchaser and Sellers'
Representative furnished to the Accounting Referee), as determined by the
Accounting Referee.

(e) The Sellers' Representative, the Purchaser, the Group Companies and the
Blocker Companies shall, and shall cause their respective representatives to,
cooperate and assist in the preparation of the Closing Statement, the
calculation of the Closing Adjustments and in the conduct of the review
referred to in Section 2.3(d), including, without limitation, making available
as necessary relevant books, records, work papers and personnel. 

(f) Upon determination of the Net Closing Adjustment Amount: (A) if the amount
of the Net Closing Adjustment Amount is a positive number, the Gross Purchase
Price shall be increased by the absolute value of the Net Closing Adjustment
Amount, and the Purchaser shall pay such amount to the Sellers in the manner
provided in Section 2.3(g); or (B) if the Net Closing Adjustment Amount is a
negative number, the Gross Purchase Price shall be decreased by the absolute
value of the Net Closing Adjustment Amount, and such amount shall be paid to
the Purchaser, to the extent available, from the Escrow Amount, in the manner
provided in Section 2.3(g).

(g) Any payment pursuant to Section 2.3(f) shall be made within five (5)
Business Days after the Net Closing Adjustment Amount has been determined:

(i) In the case of any payment due from the Purchaser to the Sellers pursuant
to Section 2.3(f), to the extent that the Purchaser has insufficient funds,
Post shall fund the Purchaser with a cash payment equal to such amount, which
the Purchaser shall thereafter pay to the Sellers by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the account(s) designated in writing by each
Seller in accordance with the Waterfall Spreadsheet.

(ii) In the case of any payment due from the Sellers to the Purchaser, the
Sellers' Representative and the Purchaser shall jointly instruct the Escrow
Agent to release the payment due to the Purchaser from the Escrow Amount.

2.4 Earn-out.

(a) The Sellers are eligible to receive from the Purchaser a cash payment (the
"Earn-out Payment") in an aggregate amount of up to Seventeen Million Five
Hundred Thousand Dollars ($17,500,000) based upon the amount of Company Gross
Profit achieved during the fiscal year commencing on January 1, 2014 and
ending on December 31, 2014 (the "Earn-out Measurement Period) as further
described in this Section 2.4.

(b) If and only to the extent that the Actual 2014 Company Gross Profit Amount
is equal to or in excess of the Company Gross Profit Baseline Target, the
Purchaser shall be obligated to pay to the Sellers (in accordance with Section
2.4(g)) an Earn-out Payment equal to the sum of (x) Ten Million Dollars
($10,000,000) plus (y) the product of (A) the amount, if any, by which the
Actual 2014 Company Gross Profit Amount exceeds the Company Gross Profit
Baseline Target (provided that, for purposes of this calculation, such amount
shall in no event exceed Four Million Dollars ($4,000,000)) and (B) 1.875
(such sum, rounded to the nearest dollar, the "Earn-out Amount").

(c) Within thirty (30) days following the conclusion of each calendar month in
the Earn-out Measurement Period, the Company shall prepare and deliver to the
Sellers' Representative an internally prepared unaudited income statement for
the immediately preceding month that shall be used solely for informational
purposes. Within forty-five (45) days following the conclusion of the Earn-out
Measurement Period, the Purchaser shall prepare and deliver to the Sellers'
Representative a written statement setting forth the Purchaser's calculation
of the Company Gross Profit achieved during the Earn-out Measurement Period,
accompanied by the calculations, explanations and assumptions for the
calculation of such amount in reasonable detail (the "Purchaser Earn-out
Statement"). 

(d) If the Sellers' Representative agrees with the Purchaser's calculation of
the Company Gross Profit set forth in the Purchaser Earn-out Statement, the
Sellers' Representative shall provide written notice of such agreement to the
Purchaser, and the Purchaser shall upon receipt of such notice promptly pay
the Earn-out Amount, if any, to the Sellers pursuant to Section 2.4(g). If the
Sellers' Representative disagrees with the Purchaser's calculation of the
Company Gross Profit (or any component thereof) set forth in the Purchaser
Earn-out Statement, the Sellers' Representative may, within ninety (90)
calendar days after the Sellers' Representative's receipt of the Purchaser
Earn-out Statement, deliver a notice executed by the Sellers' Representative
to the Purchaser disagreeing with such calculation and setting forth the
Sellers' Representative's calculation of such amount. During such ninety (90)
day period, the Purchaser and the Company shall on a timely basis provide to
the Sellers' Representative and its authorized representatives, upon
reasonable notice, reasonable access to all records (and financial staff of
the Purchaser and the Company who were involved in the preparation of the
Purchaser Earn-out Statement) and the Company's outside accountants and their
work papers and other documents used in preparing the Purchaser Earn-out
Statement. If the Sellers' Representative fails to object in writing to the
Purchaser's calculation of the Company Gross Profit (or any component thereof)
set forth in the Purchaser Earn-out Statement within such ninety (90) calendar
day period, the Sellers' Representative will be deemed conclusively to have
agreed to that calculation (or such component thereof) and that calculation
(or such component thereof) shall be final and binding upon the Purchaser and
the Sellers.

(e) If a notice of disagreement is delivered pursuant to Section 2.4(d), the
Sellers' Representative and the Purchaser shall, during the thirty (30)
calendar days following such delivery (or such longer period as they may
mutually agree), use their commercially reasonable efforts to reach agreement
on the disputed items or amounts in order to determine the Actual 2014 Company
Gross Profit Amount. During such thirty (30) day period, the Purchaser and the
Company shall on a timely basis provide to the Sellers' Representative and its
authorized representatives, upon reasonable notice, reasonable access to all
records (and financial staff of the Purchaser and the Company who were
involved in the preparation of the Purchaser Earn-out Statement) and the
Company's outside accountants and their work papers and other documents used
in preparing the Purchaser Earn-out Statement. If, after such thirty (30) day
period, the Sellers' Representative and the Purchaser are unable to reach an
agreement, the Sellers' Representative or the Purchaser may request that the
dispute be resolved by the Accounting Referee, in which case each such party
shall submit materials in support of their position to the Accounting Referee
who shall review this Agreement and the disputed items or amounts for the
purpose of determining the Actual 2014 Company Gross Profit Amount. The
Accounting Referee shall deliver to the Sellers' Representative and the
Purchaser, as promptly as practicable (but in any case no later than thirty
(30) calendar days from the date of engagement of the Accounting Referee), a
report setting forth its calculation of the Actual 2014 Company Gross Profit
Amount which shall not be less than the amount of Company Gross Profit shown
in the Purchaser Earn-out Statement nor more than the amount thereof shown in
the Sellers' Representative's calculation delivered pursuant to Section 2.4(d)
and shall be limited to the matters which the Sellers' Representative disputed
in its calculation delivered pursuant to Section 2.4(d). Such report shall be
final and binding upon the Sellers and the Purchaser. The fees and costs of
the Accounting Referee shall be payable (i) by the Sellers (in proportion to
their respective Pro Rata Percentage), on the one hand and (ii) by the
Purchaser, on the other hand, on the basis, for each such party, of the
percentage which the portion of the contested amount not awarded to each party
bears to the amount actually contested by such party (as specified in the
supporting materials that each of the Purchaser and Sellers' Representative
furnished to the Accounting Referee), as determined by the Accounting Referee. 

(f) The Sellers' Representative, the Purchaser and the Company shall, and
shall cause their respective representatives to, cooperate and assist in the
preparation of the Purchaser Earn-out Statement and in the conduct of the
review referred to in Section 2.4(e), including, without limitation, making
available as necessary relevant books, records, work papers and personnel.

(g) If the Purchaser becomes obligated to pay the Sellers an Earn-out Payment
pursuant to this Section 2.4, to the extent that the Purchaser has
insufficient funds, then Post shall fund the Purchaser with an amount of cash
equal to the Earn-out Amount and the Purchaser shall thereafter pay to the
Sellers the Earn-out Amount by wire transfer of immediately available funds to
the account designated in writing by each such Seller in accordance with the
Waterfall Spreadsheet within five (5) days from the date that the Earn-out
Amount is finally determined. Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, if and
only to the extent that the Escrow Amount has been exhausted, or has been
released in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Escrow Agreement,
or any claims have theretofore been made by the Purchaser or any other
Purchaser Indemnified Party for indemnification under Article IX and such
claims remain unpaid or unresolved that exceed the balance of the Escrow
Amount as of the date that an Earn-out Payment shall otherwise have been
payable by the Purchaser to the Sellers under this Section 2.4, then, in lieu
of paying such Earn-out Payment to the Sellers under this Section 2.4, the
Purchaser shall retain all or a portion of the Earn-out Payment otherwise
payable by the Purchaser to the Sellers under this Section 2.4 equal to the
amount of Losses claimed by the Purchaser or such other Purchaser Indemnified
Party to be attributable to such claims until such claims are finally resolved
by agreement of the Purchaser and the Sellers' Representative or by a final
order of a court of competent jurisdiction (at which point any such amount
retained in excess of the amount of such Losses actually so determined to be
applicable to such claims shall be promptly paid by the Purchaser to the
Sellers as provided in this Section 2.4(g)).

(h) In the event that the Purchaser fails to timely pay to the Sellers the
finally determined Earn-out Amount pursuant to Section 2.4(g), the Sellers'
Representative shall by written notice promptly inform the Purchaser of its
failure to make such payment (such notice, the "Deficiency Notice"). If the
Purchaser fails to pay to the Sellers the finally determined Earn-out Amount
specified in the Deficiency Notice within ten (10) days following the
Purchaser's receipt of such Deficiency Notice, then, in addition to the
Sellers' other rights and remedies under Applicable Law, the Earn-out Amount
shall accrue interest retroactive to the date that it was originally due at a
rate of ten percent (10%) per annum.

(i) The Purchaser agrees not to take any actions during the Earn-out
Measurement Period with the intent or purpose of (i) delaying or preventing
the Earn-out Payment from being achieved or (ii) reducing the amount of the
Earn-out Payment. Except as set forth in this Section 2.4, from and after the
Closing, the Purchaser shall have the sole discretion with regard to all
matters relating to the management and operation of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries. The parties acknowledge and agree that (1) the potential
Earn-out Amount is contingent on the performance of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries and there is no assurance or guarantee of any payment
hereunder, (2) the Purchaser has not promised or projected any Earn-out Amount
and the Purchaser makes no representation and expresses no opinion as to the
value of any Earn-out Payment, and (3) no other terms or conditions, other
than those expressly set forth in this Section 2.4, govern their contractual
relationship with respect to the Earn-out Payment. 

(j) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (i) the Purchaser shall
become obligated to pay the maximum Earn-out Payment achievable under this
Section 2.4 (i.e., $17,500,000) immediately upon the consummation of an
Acceleration Event (pursuant to parts (i)(x), (ii) or (iii) of such
definition), which amount shall be paid in the manner provided in Section
2.4(g), (ii) the Purchaser shall become obligated to pay the projected amount
of the Earn-Out Payment to be achieved under this Section 2.4 immediately upon
the consummation of an Acceleration Event (pursuant to part (i)(y) of such
definition), which amount shall be paid in the manner provided in Section
2.4(g), and (iii) in the event that the Company is sold or otherwise acquired
during the Earn-out Measurement Period and an Acceleration Event is not
consummated, the Purchaser hereby agrees to cause the acquirer in any such
sale to unconditionally assume all of its obligations under this Section 2.4.
In the case of the foregoing (ii), prior to any such Acceleration Event, the
Purchaser shall deliver to the Sellers' Representative a written report
setting forth the Purchaser's good faith estimate of the Company Gross Profit
achieved as of the most recently completed month prior to the consummation of
any such Acceleration Event (the "Acceleration Event Earn-out Statement").

2.5 Escrow.

(a) At the Closing, the Escrow Amount shall be deposited into an escrow
account (the "Escrow Account") to be established with and held by the Escrow
Agent pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement, to serve as the initial
source of payment for any claim for Losses for which any Purchaser Indemnified
Party is entitled to recovery pursuant to Article IX and to serve as the sole
source of payment for any Net Closing Adjustment Amount due the Purchaser.

(b) On the Escrow Release Date, each Seller shall be entitled to receive that
portion of the Escrow Amount then remaining in the Escrow Account to which
such Seller is entitled, if any, as determined in accordance with the
Waterfall Spreadsheet and the Escrow Agreement.

(c) Any fees and expenses of the Escrow Agent shall be paid one-half by the
Purchaser and one-half by the Sellers (which shall be treated as a Transaction
Expense) in accordance with the Escrow Agreement. During the period in which
the Escrow Amount is retained in the Escrow Account, all interest or other
income earned from the investment of the Escrow Amount shall be retained as
additional amounts in the Escrow Account. 

2.6 Tax Withholding. After consultation with and providing notice to the
Sellers' Representative, Purchaser and Escrow Agent shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from the Net Purchase Price and escrow payments all Taxes
that Purchaser, Escrow Agent or any Group Company may be required to deduct
and withhold under any provision of Tax Law. All such withheld amounts to the
extent paid over to the applicable Governmental Body shall be treated as
delivered to Sellers hereunder.

2.7 Tax Treatment of Escrow Account. All parties hereto agree for all tax
purposes: (i) the right of the Sellers to proceeds in the Escrow Account and
the Earn-Out Payment shall be treated as deferred contingent purchase price
eligible for installment sale treatment under Section 453 of the Code and any
corresponding provision of foreign, state or local law, as appropriate; (ii)
the Purchaser shall be treated as the owner of the Escrow Account solely for
tax purposes, and all interest and earnings earned from the investment and
reinvestment of the Escrow Account, or any portion thereof, shall be allocable
to the Purchaser pursuant to Section 468B(g) of the Code and Proposed Treasury
Regulation Section 1.468B-8; (iii) if and to the extent any amount of the
Escrow Account and Earn-Out Payment is actually distributed to the Sellers,
interest may be imputed on such amount, as required by Section 483 or 1274 of
the Code; and (iv) in the event that the total amount of any interest and
earnings earned on the Escrow Account exceeds the imputed interest, such
excess amount shall be treated as interest or other income and not as purchase
price. Clause (iv) of the preceding sentence is intended to ensure that the
right of the Sellers to the Escrow Account and any interest and earnings
earned thereon is not treated as a contingent payment without a stated maximum
selling price under Section 453 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations
promulgated thereunder. All parties hereto shall file all Tax Returns
consistently with the foregoing.

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE PURCHASER

The Purchaser hereby represents and warrants to the Sellers as of the date
hereof and as of the Closing that:

6.1 Organization and Good Standing. The Purchaser is a Delaware limited
liability company, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
state of its formation and has all requisite company power and authority to
conduct its business as heretofore conducted. The Purchaser is duly qualified
or authorized to do business as a foreign company and is in good standing
under the laws of each jurisdiction in which it owns or leases real property
and each other jurisdiction in which the conduct of its business or the
ownership of its properties requires such qualification or authorization,
except where the failure to be so qualified, authorized or in good standing
would not have a material and adverse effect on the Purchaser's ability timely
to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.

6.2 Authorization of Agreement. The Purchaser has full company power and
authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and each other agreement,
document, instrument or certificate contemplated by this Agreement or to be
executed by the Purchaser in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby (including this Agreement, the "Purchaser
Documents"), and to consummate the transactions contemplated thereby. The
execution, delivery and performance by the Purchaser of each Purchaser
Document has been duly authorized by all necessary company action on behalf of
the Purchaser. This Agreement has been, and each other Purchaser Document will
be as of the date hereof, duly executed and delivered by the Purchaser and
(assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by the other parties
hereto and thereto) this Agreement constitutes, and each Purchaser Document
when so executed and delivered will constitute, the legal, valid and binding
obligation of the Purchaser, enforceable against the Purchaser in accordance
with its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium and similar laws affecting creditors' rights and remedies
generally, and subject, as to enforceability, to general principles of equity,
including principles of commercial reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing
(regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a proceeding at law or in
equity). 

6.3 Conflicts; Consents of Third Parties.

(a) Except as set forth on Schedule 6.3(a) hereto, none of the execution and
delivery by the Purchaser of Purchaser Documents, the consummation of the
Transaction, or compliance by the Purchaser with any of the provisions thereof
will: (i) cause the Purchaser to materially breach any Law or Order of any
Governmental Body that is applicable to the Purchaser; (ii) conflict with or
result in a violation of any organizational document of the Purchaser; or
(iii) conflict with or result in a material breach of any of the terms,
conditions or provisions of any material agreement or instrument to which the
Purchaser is a party or by which the Purchaser may be bound, or constitute a
default thereunder.

(b) No waiver, Order or Permit of, or declaration or filing with, or
notification to, any Person or Governmental Body is required on the part of
the Purchaser in connection with the execution and delivery of any Purchaser
Documents or the compliance by the Purchaser with any of the provisions
thereof, except for: (i) such waivers, Orders or Permits the failure of which
to obtain would not have a material and adverse effect on the Purchaser's
ability timely to consummate the Transactions contemplated hereby; and (ii)
the filing of a Notification and Report Form For Certain Mergers and
Acquisitions by the Purchaser under the HSR Act, and the expiration or
termination of the applicable waiting period thereunder.

6.4 Litigation. There are no material Actions pending or, to the knowledge of
the Purchaser, threatened that are reasonably likely to prohibit or restrain
the ability of the Purchaser to enter into this Agreement or consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby.

6.5 Investment Intention. The Purchaser is acquiring the Purchased Securities
for its own account, for investment purposes only and not with a view to the
distribution (as such term is used in Section 2(11) of the Securities Act of
1933, as amended (the "Securities Act")) thereof. The Purchaser understands
that the Purchased Securities have not been registered under the Securities
Act and cannot be sold unless subsequently registered under the Securities Act
or an exemption from such registration is available. The Purchaser is entering
into the Purchaser Documents to which it is a party with a full understanding
of all the terms, conditions and risks hereof and thereof (economic and
otherwise), and it is capable of and willing to assume (financially and
otherwise) those risks; and the Purchaser is a sophisticated entity familiar
with transactions similar to those contemplated by the Purchaser Documents. 

6.6 Financial Advisors. Except for SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., no Person
has acted, directly or indirectly, as a broker, finder, agent, representative
or similar intermediary for the Purchaser in connection with this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and no other Person is
entitled to any fee or commission or like payment in respect thereof.

6.7 Condition of the Business. Notwithstanding anything contained in this
Agreement to the contrary, the Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that the
Company, the Blocker Companies and the Sellers are not making any
representations or warranties whatsoever, express or implied, beyond those
expressly given by the Company, the Blocker Companies and the Sellers, as the
case may be, in this Agreement or in any of the Transaction Documents, and the
Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that, except for the representations and
warranties contained herein and therein, the assets and the business of the
Company, the Company Subsidiaries and the Blocker Companies are being
transferred on a "where is" and, as to condition, "as is" basis. The Purchaser
further represents that none of the Company, the Blocker Companies, the
Sellers, any of their respective Affiliates nor any other Person has made any
representation or warranty, express or implied, as to the accuracy or
completeness of any information regarding the Company, the Company
Subsidiaries, the Blocker Companies, the Sellers, or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement not expressly set forth in this Agreement or in
any of the Transaction Documents, and none of the Company, the Company
Subsidiaries, the Blocker Companies, the Sellers, any of their respective
Affiliates nor any other Person will have or be subject to any Liability to
the Purchaser or any other Person resulting from the distribution to the
Purchaser or its representatives or the Purchaser's use of, any such
information, including any confidential memoranda distributed on behalf of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries relating to the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries or other publications or data room information provided to the
Purchaser or its representatives, or any other document or information in any
form provided to the Purchaser or its representatives in connection with the
sale of the Purchased Securities and the transactions contemplated hereby. The
Purchaser further acknowledges that any projections provided by the Company
are for illustrative purposes only and do not form the basis of any Liability.

6.8 Required Financing.The Purchaser has sufficient currently-available funds
on hand to consummate the Transaction, including, without limitation, to (a)
pay the Gross Purchase Price and adjustments thereto pursuant to this
Agreement, and (b) pay any fees and expenses for which the Purchaser is
responsible pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.

Agreement and the Closing Date, the Sellers and the Company shall, and shall
cause each of the Group Companies and each of their respective officers,
employees and agents to, give the Purchaser and its authorized
representatives, upon reasonable notice and during times mutually convenient
to the Purchaser and the Company's senior management, reasonable access to the
facilities, properties, key employees, books and records of the Group
Companies as from time to time may be reasonably requested in writing.

(b) Neither the Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates shall prior to the Closing
Date, without the prior consent of the Sellers' Representative (which shall
not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), have any contact
whatsoever with respect to the Group Companies or with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement with any partner, lender, lessor,
landlord, vendor, franchisee, supplier, employee or consultant of the Company
or any of the Company Subsidiaries. All requests by the Purchaser for access
or information shall be submitted or directed exclusively to an individual or
individuals to be designated by the Company in writing.

7.3 Confidentiality. The parties shall adhere to the terms and conditions of
that certain confidentiality agreement, dated as of June 27, 2013, by and
among the Company and the Purchaser (the "Confidentiality Agreement"). Upon
Closing, the Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate.

7.4 Regulatory and other Authorizations; Consents.

(a) The parties hereto shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to
obtain the authorizations, consents, orders and approvals necessary for their
execution and delivery of, and the performance of their obligations pursuant
to, this Agreement, subject to the further provisions of this Section 7.4. If
required by the HSR Act and if the appropriate filing of a Notification and
Report Form For Certain Mergers and Acquisitions pursuant to the HSR Act has
not been filed prior to the date hereof, each party hereto agrees to make an
appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form For Certain Mergers and
Acquisitions with respect to the Transaction within five (5) Business Days
after the date hereof and to supply promptly any additional information and
documentary material that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act. The
parties hereto will not take any action that will have the effect of delaying,
impairing or impeding the receipt of any required approvals and shall promptly
respond to any requests for additional information or objections from any
Governmental Body or filings in respect thereof, including using reasonable
best efforts to take all such action as may reasonably be necessary to resolve
such objections, if any, as may be asserted by any Governmental Body with
respect to the Transaction. The Purchaser shall pay all filing and related
fees in connection with any such filings that must be made by any of the
parties under the HSR Act. Each of the Company and the Purchaser hereby
covenants and agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to secure termination
of any waiting periods under the HSR Act or any other applicable law and to
obtain the approval of the FTC, the Antitrust Division of the United States
Department of Justice or any other Governmental Body, as applicable, for the
Transaction as may be necessary to secure termination of such waiting periods
or obtain such approval. The Company and the Purchaser each shall keep the
other apprised of the status of matters relating to completion of the
transactions contemplated hereby. The Purchaser further agrees to take such
action (including agreeing to hold separate or to divest any of the
businesses, products or assets of the Purchaser, any of the Company
Subsidiaries and their respective Affiliates) as may be required (i) by the
applicable Governmental Body in order to resolve such objections as such
Governmental Body may have to the Transaction under Applicable Law, or (ii) by
any court or similar tribunal, in any Action brought by a private party or
Governmental Body challenging the Transaction as violative of any Applicable
Law, in order to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any
injunction, temporary restraining order or other order that has the effect of
preventing the consummation of the Transaction. For the avoidance of doubt,
the Purchaser shall take any and all actions necessary in order to ensure that
(i) no requirement for a waiver, consent or approval of the FTC, the 

Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice or other
Governmental Body, (ii) no decree, judgment, injunction, temporary restraining
order or any other order in any Action, and (iii) no other matter relating to
any antitrust or competition Law, would preclude consummation of the
Transaction.

(b) The Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts to assist the Company
in obtaining the consents of third parties listed in Schedule 3.3(c),
including (i) providing to such third parties such financial statements and
other financial information as such third parties may reasonably request and
(ii) executing agreements to effect the assumption of such agreements on or
before the Closing Date.

7.5 Indemnification.

(a) In the event of any threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding
or investigation, whether civil, criminal or administrative, including,
without limitation, any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation
in which any Person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date
hereof, or who becomes prior to the Closing Date, a manager, director,
officer, employee, fiduciary or agent of the Company or the Company
Subsidiaries (the "Indemnified Parties") is, or is threatened to be, made a
party based in whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out of, or
pertaining to the fact that he or she is or was a manager, director, officer,
employee, fiduciary or agent of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries, or is
or was serving at the request of the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries as a manager, director, officer, employee, fiduciary or agent of
another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise,
the Company hereby agrees to cooperate and use its reasonable best efforts to
defend against and respond thereto. It is understood and agreed that after the
Closing Date the Company shall indemnify and hold harmless, as and to the full
extent permitted by applicable law, each Indemnified Party against any losses,
claims, damages, liabilities, costs, expenses (including reasonable attorneys'
fees and expenses), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement in
connection with any such threatened or actual claim, action, suit, demand,
proceeding or investigation, and in the event of any such threatened or actual
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether asserted or arising
before or after the Closing Date), (A) the Company shall promptly pay expenses
incurred by each Indemnified Party as the same are incurred in advance of the
final disposition of any claim, suit, proceeding or investigation to such
Indemnified Party, (B) the Indemnified Parties may retain counsel satisfactory
to the Company, and the Company shall pay all fees and expenses of such
counsel for the Indemnified Parties within fifteen (15) days after statements
therefor are received, and (C) the Company will use its reasonable best
efforts to assist in the vigorous defense of any such matter; provided,
however, that the Company shall not be liable for any settlement effected
without its prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld); and provided, further that the Company shall have no obligation
hereunder to any Indemnified Party when and if a court of competent
jurisdiction shall ultimately determine, and such determination shall have
become final and non‑appealable, that indemnification of such Indemnified
Party in the manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by Applicable Law. Any
Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under this Section 7.5,
upon learning of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation,
must notify the Company thereof; provided, however, that the failure to so
notify shall not affect the obligations of the Company except to the extent
such failure to notify materially prejudices the Company. 

(b) The Purchaser agrees that all rights to indemnification or exculpation
existing in favor of, and all limitations on the personal liability of, each
present and former manager, director, officer, employee, fiduciary and agent
of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries provided for in their respective
organizational documents or otherwise in effect as of the date hereof shall
continue in full force and effect indefinitely. Without limiting the general
indemnification rights of the Indemnified Parties under this Section 7.5, from
and after the Closing Date, the Company also agrees to indemnify and hold
harmless the present and former officers, managers and directors of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries in respect of acts or omissions occurring
prior to the Closing Date to the extent provided in any written
indemnification agreements between the Company or the Company Subsidiaries to
the extent listed as a Material Contract in Schedule 3.12(a).

(c) The parties hereby acknowledge that certain of the Indemnified Parties
(the "Fund Indemnitees") have certain rights to indemnification, advancement
of expenses or insurance provided by the TA Funds and certain of their
respective affiliates (collectively, the "Fund Indemnitors"). The parties
hereby agree that, for purposes of this Section 7.5, (i) the Company is the
indemnitor of first resort (i.e., its obligations to the Fund Indemnitees are
primary and any obligation of the Fund Indemnitors to advance expenses or to
provide indemnification for the same expenses or liabilities incurred by the
Fund Indemnitees are secondary), (ii) the Company shall be required to advance
the full amount of any and all expenses incurred by the Fund Indemnitees and
shall be liable for the full amount of any and all expenses, judgments,
penalties, fines and amounts paid in settlement to the extent legally
permitted and as required by the Company's organizational documents (or any
agreement between the Company and the Fund Indemnitees listed in Schedule
3.12(a)), without regard to any rights that the Fund Indemnitee may have
against the Fund Indemnitors, and, (iii) the Company irrevocably waives,
relinquishes and releases the Fund Indemnitors from any and all claims against
the Fund Indemnitors for contribution, subrogation or any other recovery of
any kind in respect thereof. The parties further agree that no advancement or
payment by the Fund Indemnitors on behalf of the Fund Indemnitees with respect
to any claim for which any Fund Indemnitee has sought indemnification from the
Company shall affect the foregoing and that the Fund Indemnitors shall have a
right of contribution or be subrogated to the extent of such advancement or
payment to all of the rights of recovery of the Fund Indemnitees against the
Company. The parties further agree that the Fund Indemnitors are express third
party beneficiaries of the terms hereof. 

(d) On or prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall purchase an extended
reporting period endorsement under the Company's existing managers' and
officers' liability insurance coverage (the "DandO Tail") for the Company's
managers and officers in a form acceptable to the Company that shall provide
such managers and officers with coverage for six (6) years following the
Closing Date of not less than the existing coverage and have other terms not
materially less favorable to, the insured persons than the managers' and
officers' liability insurance coverage presently maintained by the Company.
The Sellers shall bear the cost of the DandO Tail as a Transaction Expense, and
after the Closing Date shall maintain such policy in full force and effect,
and continue to honor the obligations thereunder.

(e) The obligations under this Section 7.5 shall not be terminated or modified
in such a manner as to adversely affect any Indemnified Party to whom this
Section 7.5 applies without the consent of such affected Indemnified Party (it
being expressly agreed that the Indemnified Parties to whom this Section 7.5
applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this Section 7.5 and shall be
entitled to enforce the covenants contained herein).

(f) If, after the Closing Date, the Company or any of its successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be
the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties
and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, to the extent necessary
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the
Company, as the case may be, assume the obligations set forth in this Section
7.5.

7.6 Books and Records. In order to facilitate the resolution of any claims
made against or incurred by any party hereto prior to or after the Closing, or
to the extent that such access may reasonably be required by Sellers in
connection with any matter relating to or affected by the operations of the
Blocker Companies or the Group Companies on or prior to the Closing Date, for
a period of six (6) years after the Closing, the Purchaser shall (and shall
cause the Company to):

(a) retain the books and records (including personnel files) relating to the
business of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries relating to periods prior
to the Closing Date in a manner reasonably consistent with the prior practices
of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries; and

(b) upon reasonable notice, afford the Sellers' Representative reasonable
access (including the right to make photocopies), during normal business
hours, to such books and records; provided, however, that the Purchaser, the
Blocker Companies and the Group Companies shall not be required to violate any
obligation of confidentiality to which the Purchaser, the Blocker Companies or
any Group Company is subject or to waive any privilege which any of them may
possess in discharging its obligations pursuant to this Section 7.6; provided
further, however, that in any such case, the Purchaser shall, and shall cause
any applicable Blocker Company or Group Company to, reasonably cooperate with
the Sellers' Representative to seek an appropriate remedy to permit the access
contemplated hereby. Such access shall be afforded by the Purchaser upon
receipt of reasonable advance notice and during normal business hours;
provided, however, that the Sellers and the Sellers' Representative
acknowledge and agree that such access shall not interfere unreasonably with
the operations of the Blocker Companies, the Group Companies or the Purchaser.
The Sellers' Representative shall be solely responsible for any costs or
expenses incurred by it pursuant to this Section 7.6. If the Purchaser, the
Blocker Companies or the Group Companies shall desire to dispose of any of
such books and records prior to the expiration of such six (6) year period,
the Purchaser shall, prior to such disposition, give the Sellers'
Representative a reasonable opportunity, at the Sellers' Representative's
expense, to segregate and remove such books and records as Sellers'
Representative may select and thereafter the Purchaser may dispose of any such
books and records not so segregated or removed by the Sellers' Representative. 

7.7 Publicity. None of the parties hereto shall issue any press release or
public announcement concerning this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby without obtaining the prior written approval of the other parties
hereto, which approval will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed, unless, in the judgment of such Person, disclosure is otherwise
required by Applicable Law; provided, that, to the extent required by
Applicable Law, the party intending to make such release shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts consistent with Applicable Law to consult with
the other parties with respect to the text thereof. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the TA Funds and their respective Affiliates may disclose the terms
and conditions of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby to
their current or potential investors in the ordinary course of their private
equity businesses; provided, however, that such disclosure shall in all cases
be subject to a confidentiality, non-disclosure or similar agreement to which
any such current or potential investor shall be bound.

7.8 Employee Matters. Immediately following the Closing Date, all Company
Employees will remain employed with total compensation and benefits, in the
aggregate, substantially comparable to the total compensation and benefits, in
the aggregate, for similarly situated employees of the Purchaser. Post and the
Purchaser shall cause the Company to perform all of its obligations in any
employment agreement by and between a Company Employee and the Company or any
of the Company Subsidiaries. With respect to any Company Employee, the
Purchaser shall and/or shall cause its Affiliate to, as applicable, (i) cause
to be waived any waiting period and restrictions and limitations for pre-
existing conditions or insurability (except for pre-existing conditions that
were excluded under employee welfare benefit plans maintained by the Company),
(ii) provide all Company Employees with service credit for purposes of
eligibility, participation, vesting and levels of benefits under any
applicable benefit plans or compensation plans of the Purchaser or its
affiliates for all periods of employment with the Company and/or the Company
Subsidiaries (or any predecessor entities) prior to the Closing Date, and
(iii) cause to be credited any deductible or maximum out-of-pocket payments
made by such Company Employees under employee welfare benefit plans maintained
by the Company or the Company Subsidiaries, so as to reduce the amount of any
deductible or maximum out-of-pocket payments payable by such Company Employees
under applicable welfare benefit plans of the Purchaser (or its affiliates).
Nothing in this Agreement shall create any obligation on the part of Purchaser
or its affiliates to continue the employment of any Company Employee for any
definite period following the Closing Date, and nothing in this Agreement
shall preclude Purchaser or its affiliates from altering, amending, or
terminating any employee benefit plans, or the participation of any of its
employees in such plans, at any time. The Purchaser shall not, at any time
prior to 180 days after the Closing Date, effectuate a "mass layoff" as that
term is defined in WARN, or comparable conduct under any applicable state law,
affecting in whole or in part any facility, site of employment, operating unit
or employee of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries without complying fully
with the requirements of WARN or such applicable state law. Nothing herein
shall or shall be deemed to amend any employee benefit plans or arrangements
or create any rights or obligations except between the parties hereto. Except
as provided in Section 7.5, no Company Employee (other than the Company
Employees set forth on Schedule 7.8, who shall each be deemed an express third
party beneficiary of this Agreement solely with respect to the second sentence
of this Section 7.8 as it relates to their particular employment agreement set
forth on Schedule 7.8) or other current or former employee or service provider
of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries, including any beneficiary or
dependent thereof, shall be a third party beneficiary of any of the agreements
or obligations of the parties hereunder or otherwise be entitled to assert any
claim hereunder. Prior to the Closing, the Group Companies and Blocker
Companies, as applicable, shall adopt resolutions of the applicable Board(s)
to terminate the Dymatize Enterprises, Inc. 401(k) Savings Plan, and any other
Company Benefit Plan intended to be qualified under Code Section 401(a),
effective prior to the Closing Date or such other time reasonably requested by
Purchaser. In addition, prior to the Closing, the Group Companies and Blocker
Companies shall take such reasonable actions as Purchaser may reasonably
request to terminate, freeze or amend all or certain of the Company Benefit
Plans in the manner requested by Purchaser, effective immediately prior to the
Closing Date or such other time reasonably requested by Purchaser. 

7.9 Tax Matters.

(a) Cooperation on Tax Matters. No Group Company nor Blocker Company shall
amend, file, re-file or otherwise modify any applicable portion of any Tax
Return or Tax election of any Group Company or Blocker Company for any taxable
period ending on or before the Closing Date or any Straddle Period, or take
any other action with respect to such a Tax Return, that could reasonably be
expected to increase the liability of any Seller for Taxes, without the prior
written consent of the Sellers' Representative. Except as otherwise
contemplated by this Agreement, no Group Company nor Blocker Company shall
take any action on the Closing Date or after the Closing that is outside the
ordinary course of business, including, for the avoidance of doubt, filing an
election pursuant to Section 338(g) of the Code. After the date of this
Agreement, no Group Company or Blocker Company shall, without the written
consent of the Sellers' Representative, agree to waive or extend the statute
of limitations relating to any Taxes of any Group Company or Blocker Company
for any taxable period ending on or prior to the Closing Date or any Straddle
Period. Following the Closing, the Purchaser and the Sellers shall provide
each other with such assistance as may reasonably be requested by any of them
in connection with the preparation of any Tax Return, any audit or other
examination by any taxing authority, or any judicial or administrative
proceedings relating to Liability for Taxes of the Group Companies and the
Blocker Companies. The party requesting assistance hereunder shall reimburse
the other for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in providing such
assistance. 

(b) The Parties agree that, for all applicable Tax purposes, the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall not, in themselves, constitute a
termination of the Company within the meaning of Code Section 708\. The
Parties agree that there shall be an interim closing of the books of the
Company with respect to the membership interests in the Company held by
Management Holdco and Dymatize Equity Plan prior to the Closing Date under
Code Section 706 with respect to Management Holdco and Dymatize Equity Plan,
effective as of the Closing Date, and accordingly, the income, gain, loss and
deduction (and items thereof) for the portion of the taxable year of the
Company in which the Closing occurs prior to and including the Closing Date
shall be allocated solely to the holders of record prior to the Closing Date
and not the Purchaser.

(c) Tax Returns. The Sellers' Representative shall prepare and file or cause
to be prepared and filed, at the expense of the Sellers, all Tax Returns that
are filed after the Closing Date by or with respect to the Group Companies and
the Blocker Companies with respect to taxable periods ending on or prior to
the Closing Date or Straddle Periods ("Pre-Closing Tax Returns"). The Sellers'
Representative shall prepare or cause to be prepared such Pre-Closing Tax
Returns in a manner consistent with such Group Company's or Blocker Company's,
as applicable, past practice unless otherwise required by Applicable Law. The
applicable Group Company or Blocker Company shall deliver a draft of such Pre-
Closing Tax Returns to the Purchaser for its review and comment not less than
thirty (30) Business Days prior to the date on which such Tax Returns are due
to be filed (taking into account any applicable extensions). The Sellers'
Representative shall consider any such reasonable comments in good faith prior
to filing such Pre-Closing Tax Returns. The parties agree that in filing the
income Tax Returns for the Company for the taxable year of the Company that
includes the Closing Date the Sellers' Representative shall cause the Company
to make an election under Section 754 and the corresponding provisions of
foreign, state and local income Tax Law, if the Company does not already have
a valid election under Section 754 of the Code for such taxable year of the
Company.

(d) Tax Refunds.

(i) Company Tax Refunds. Any refunds for Taxes (including any interest in
respect thereof) received by the Company or Company Subsidiaries and any
amounts credited against Taxes to which any of the Company or Company
Subsidiaries becomes entitled (including by way of any amended Tax Return),
that relate to a taxable period ending on or prior to the Closing Date or a
Straddle Period of the Company or Company Subsidiaries shall be property of
the Sellers. The applicable Company or Company Subsidiaries shall pay to the
Seller Representative any such refund or the amount of any such credit within
fifteen (15) days after receipt of such a Tax refund or entitlement to such an
amount credited against Taxes; provided that, if and only to the extent that
the Escrow Amount has been exhausted or has been released in accordance with
the terms and conditions of the Escrow Agreement, the Purchaser may first
apply any such refund against any indemnity obligations of the Sellers under
this Agreement at the time the refund is received by the Purchaser or the
Company or Company Subsidiaries, and shall only be required to pay the net
amount remaining after satisfaction of such indemnity obligations to the
Seller Representative. Upon a request from the Sellers' Representative, the
Purchaser shall, as soon as is reasonably practicable, cause the Group
Companies or the Blocker Companies, at Sellers' expense, to file any amended
Tax Return or application for Tax refund in order to obtain a Tax refund (or
credit for overpayment) that the Sellers are entitled to pursuant to this
Section, and the Purchaser, Company or Company Subsidiaries shall execute all
other documents, take reasonable additional actions and otherwise reasonably
cooperate as may be necessary for the Purchaser and the Company or Company
Subsidiaries to perfect their rights in and obtain the Tax refunds
contemplated by this Section; provided that Purchaser shall not be required to
file such amended Tax Returns if advised by its Tax Return preparer that doing
so may subject the Group Companies to penalties or as a result the Tax Return
preparer refuses to sign a Tax Return. 

(ii) Blocker Company Tax Refunds. Any refunds for Taxes (including any
interest in respect thereof) received by the Blocker Companies and any amounts
credited against Taxes to which any of the Blocker Companies becomes entitled
(including by way of any amended Tax Return), that relate to a taxable period
ending on or prior to the Closing Date or a Straddle Period of the Blocker
Companies shall be property of the Blocker Company Sellers that previously
owned the Blocker Company that is entitled to such Tax refund or credit. The
applicable Blocker Company shall pay to the Seller Representative any such
refund or the amount of any such credit within fifteen (15) days after receipt
of such a Tax refund or entitlement to such an amount credited against Taxes;
provided that, if and only to the extent that the Escrow Amount has been
exhausted or has been released in accordance with the terms and conditions of
the Escrow Agreement, the Purchaser may first apply any such refund against
any indemnity obligations of the Blocker Company Sellers with respect to such
Blocker Company that received such Tax refund under this Agreement at the time
the refund or credit is received by the Purchaser or the applicable Blocker
Company and shall only be required to pay the net amount remaining after
satisfaction of such indemnity obligations of such Blocker Company Sellers to
the Seller Representative. Upon a request from the Sellers' Representative,
the Purchaser shall, as soon as is reasonably practicable, cause Blocker
Companies, at appropriate Blocker Company Sellers' expense, to file any
amended Tax Return or application for Tax refund in order to obtain a Tax
refund (or credit for overpayment) that the Blocker Company Sellers are
entitled to pursuant to this Section, and the Purchaser and Blocker Companies
shall execute all other documents, take reasonable additional actions and
otherwise reasonably cooperate as may be necessary for the Purchaser and the
Blocker Companies to perfect their rights in and obtain the Tax refunds
contemplated by this Section; provided that Purchaser shall not be required to
file such amended Tax Returns if advised by its Tax Return preparer that doing
so may subject the Blocker Companies to penalties or as a result the Tax
Return preparer refuses to sign a Tax Return.

(e) For purposes of this Agreement, in the case of any taxable year or period
that begins before and ends after the Closing Date (a "Straddle Period"), the
parties agree to use the following conventions for determining the amount of
Taxes attributable to the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing
Date: (A) in the case of a Tax that is an income Tax or that is otherwise
based on gross income, sales or gross receipts, or specific transactions, the
amount attributable to the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the
Closing Date shall be determined as if a separate Tax Return was filed with
respect to such Taxes for the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the
Closing Date (as of the end of the day) using a "closing of the books
methodology;" (and for such purposes the taxable year of any partnership,
pass-through entity or other person whose taxable year does not end on the
Closing Date in which a Group Company or Blocker Company owns a beneficial
interest shall be deemed to terminate on the Closing Date) except that
exemptions, allowances, deductions or credits that are calculated on an annual
basis (such as, for example, depreciation or capital allowances) shall be
apportioned on a per-diem basis, and (B) in the case of a tax, including real
property Taxes, that is not an income Tax, the amount attributable to the
portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date shall be determined
by multiplying the total amount of such Tax for the entire Straddle Period by
a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the taxable period
up to and including the Closing Date, and the denominator of which is the
total number of days in such Straddle Period. 

(f) As promptly as practicable after determination of the Net Purchase Price,
the Purchaser shall prepare or cause to be prepared, and shall submit to the
Sellers' Representative, (x) a balance sheet of the Company, as of the Closing
Date, that sets out the tax basis of the assets owned by the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries on the Closing Date and the amount of the liabilities of
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries on the Closing Date (the "Tax Basis
Balance Sheet") and (y) a balance sheet of the Company, as of the Closing
Date, that sets out the fair market value of the assets owned by the Company
on the Closing Date and the amount of the liabilities of the Company on the
Closing Date (the "Fair Market Value Balance Sheet"). The Fair Market Value
Balance Sheet shall (A) be computed by reference to the principles for the
allocation of the Net Purchase Price attached hereto as Schedule 7.9(f) and
(B) contain sufficient detail to permit the parties to make the computations
and adjustments required under Section 743(b), Section 751 and Section 755 of
the Code with respect to the transactions contemplated under this Agreement.
The parties shall cooperate to update the Fair Market Value Balance Sheet to
reflect any further adjustments to the Net Purchase Price in a manner
consistent with the principles used to create the Fair Market Value Balance
Sheet. The parties shall, and shall cause the Company to, report the Tax
consequences of the sale and other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
in a manner consistent with the Tax Basis Balance Sheet and the Fair Market
Value Balance Sheet, and shall not take any action or position that is
inconsistent therewith.

7.10 No Solicitations. Until the earlier of (i) the termination of this
Agreement or (ii) the consummation of the Transaction, none of the Sellers,
the Sellers' Representative, the Blocker Companies, nor the Group Companies
will, nor will they permit any of their respective Affiliates or any of the
managers, directors, officers, employees, advisors, representatives or agents
to, directly or indirectly, (a) discuss, negotiate, undertake, authorize,
recommend, propose or enter into, either as the proposed surviving, merged,
acquiring or acquired corporation, any transaction involving a merger,
consolidation, business combination, purchase or disposition of any material
portion of the assets of any of the Blocker Companies or the Group Companies
or any equity interests of the Blocker Companies or the Group Companies other
than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (an "Acquisition
Transaction"), (b) facilitate, encourage, solicit or initiate discussions,
negotiations or submissions of proposals or offers in respect of an
Acquisition Transaction, (c) furnish or cause to be furnished, to any Person
or entity, any information concerning the business, operations, properties or
assets of the Group Companies in connection with an Acquisition Transaction,
or (d) otherwise cooperate in any way with, or assist or participate in,
facilitate or encourage, any effort or attempt by any other Person or entity
to do or seek any of the foregoing. 

7.11 Title Commitments, Title Policies and Surveys. In the event requested by
the Purchaser, the Sellers and the Group Companies shall reasonably cooperate
and use commercially reasonable efforts to assist the Purchaser in obtaining,
with respect to each parcel of Owned Property, (i) title commitments for
owner's and lender's policies (if applicable) of title insurance (each, a
"Title Commitment") prepared by a national title insurance company acceptable
to the Purchaser ("Title Company"), and (ii) certified ALTA/ACSM or other on-
the-ground, staked, boundary survey maps of the Owned Properties, or any
portion thereof, prepared by surveyors reasonably acceptable to the Purchaser
and reflecting the matters disclosed on the Title Commitment related thereto;
provided, however, that neither the Sellers, the Blocker Companies nor the
Group Companies shall incur any liability or expense in connection with the
foregoing and receipt of the foregoing or the title insurance described below
shall not be a condition to Closing. If requested by the Purchaser no later
than two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing, the Sellers, the Group
Companies and the Blocker Companies, as applicable, shall deliver at the
Closing with respect to each parcel of Owned Property: an owner's affidavit,
in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Title Company, customary
transfer declarations (to the extent required by Applicable Law), and
corporate authority documents reasonably required by the Title Company to
issue basic (not extended coverage) owner's policies of title insurance at or
about the Closing, including any name change/conversion affidavit in
recordable form, and, to the extent that the Purchaser is not obtaining title
insurance, such affidavits and other evidence reasonably requested by the
Title Company to issue the Purchaser a non-imputation endorsement to any
existing owner's policy.

7.12 Further Action. Each of the parties hereto shall use its respective
reasonable best efforts to take or cause to be taken all appropriate action,
do or cause to be done all things necessary, proper or advisable and execute
and deliver such documents and other papers, as may be required to carry out
the provisions of this Agreement and consummate and make effective the
Transaction.

7.13 Financing Cooperation. In the event requested by the Purchaser, the
Sellers, the Blocker Companies and the Group Companies shall, at the
Purchaser's sole cost and expense, take all commercially reasonable actions
and do all things as reasonably requested by the Purchaser, that are within
their control, to facilitate the Purchaser's efforts to pledge any of the
Group Companies' and Blocker Companies' assets as collateral to secure any
indebtedness of the Purchaser or its Affiliates (provided such pledging of
collateral, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not be effective prior to the
Closing); provided, however, that such actions do not unreasonably interfere
with the normal operations or employee relations of the Group Companies or the
Blocker Companies; and, provided, further, that the Group Companies or the
Blocker Companies shall not be required to pay any commitment fee or other fee
or payment to obtain consent or to incur any liability (other than reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses subject to reimbursement by the Purchaser in accordance
herewith) with respect to such matters. 

7.14 Financial Statement Deliveries.

(a) As soon as practicable after the date hereof, the Sellers' Representative
shall cause the Company to engage (after consultation with the Purchaser, at
the Purchaser's sole expense) an independent accounting firm in accordance
with Section 7.14(b) to commence an audit of the consolidated financial
statements of the Group Companies and the Blocker Companies, including a
balance sheet and statements of income, cash flows and changes in
stockholder's equity, as of December 31, 2013 (the "Consolidated Financial
Statements").

(b) The audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements described in Section
7.14(a) shall be conducted by Montgomery Coscia Greilich LLP or an accounting
firm of national standing reasonably acceptable to the Purchaser and
registered with the U.S. Public Company Accounting Oversight Board ("PCAOB")
and shall be conducted in accordance with GAAP. The engagement agreement or
agreements for the audits of the Consolidated Financial Statements shall
provide for (1) the Consolidated Financial Statements to satisfy the
requirements of Regulation S X (17 C.F.R. Part 210) under the Securities Act
of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, including the applicable
requirements of Rule 3-05 of Regulation S-X and (2) the audit of the
Consolidated Financial Statements to be conducted in accordance with PCAOB
standards, with the audit report for the Consolidated Financial Statements to
refer to PCAOB standards.

(c) The Sellers shall provide reasonable access to such documentation and
other information, and provide such assistance as is reasonably necessary, for
any accounting firm responsible for reviewing and auditing the Consolidated
Financial Statements to perform any audits or review provided for in this
Section 7.14, including the execution and delivery of reasonable and customary
representation letters to any such accounting firm (if and to the extent
required by any such accounting firm).

7.15 Confidential Information. Each Seller acknowledges the confidential and
proprietary nature of the Confidential Company Information and agrees, that
from and after the Closing, such Seller shall: (i) keep the Confidential
Company Information confidential and deliver promptly to the Purchaser, or
immediately destroy at the Purchaser's option, all embodiments and copies of
the Confidential Company Information that are in such Seller's possession;
(ii) not use the Confidential Company Information for any reason or purpose;
and (iii) without limiting the foregoing, not disclose the Confidential
Company Information to any Person, except with the Purchaser's prior written
consent or as otherwise required by Applicable Law (subject to the terms and
conditions of this Section 7.15). This Section 7.15 shall not apply to that
part of the Confidential Company Information that following the Closing (i)
becomes generally available to the public, (ii) is independently developed or
(iii) becomes known on a non-confidential basis from a third party source, in
each case, other than as a result of a breach of this Section 7.15 by any of
the Sellers. Confidential Company Information shall not be deemed "generally
available to the public" merely because it is included or incorporated in more
general information that is publicly available or because it combines features
which individually may be publicly available. If a Seller becomes compelled in
any action or proceeding to make any disclosure that is prohibited by this
Section 7.15, such Seller shall, to the extent legally permissible, provide
the Purchaser with prompt notice of such compulsion so that the Purchaser may
seek (at its sole expense) an appropriate protective order or other
appropriate remedy or waive compliance with the provisions of this Section
7.15. In the absence of a protective order or other remedy, such Seller may
disclose that portion (and only that portion) of the Confidential Company
Information that, based upon the opinion of such Seller's counsel, such Seller
is legally compelled to disclose; provided, however, that such Seller shall
use its reasonable best efforts to obtain written assurance that any Person to
whom any Confidential Company Information is so disclosed shall accord
confidential treatment to such Confidential Company Information. Nothing in
this Section 7.15 shall diminish the protections and benefits under Applicable
Law to which any trade secret of any of the Group Companies is entitled. If
any information that the Purchaser, the Blocker Companies or any of the Group
Companies asserts to be a trade secret under Applicable Law is found by a
court of competent jurisdiction not to be such a trade secret, such
information shall nonetheless be considered Confidential Company Information
for purposes of this Section 7.15. 

7.16 Lease Estoppels. The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain and deliver to the Purchaser certificates of estoppel in a form and
substance reasonably acceptable to the Purchaser from each third party
(lessors, lessees, and sublessees, as applicable) to each Real Property Lease.

7.17 Physical Inventory. The Company shall conduct a physical inventory of the
Group Companies on or about December 31, 2013 in a manner that is consistent
with the Group Companies' past practices, and the Purchaser shall be provided,
with at least two (2) Business Days' prior written notice, the opportunity to
observe such physical inventory.

7.18 Dymatize Equity Plan Member Releases. Dymatize Equity Plan shall
distribute the applicable portion of the Net Purchase Price that it receives
at the Closing and any other consideration paid to it pursuant to this
Agreement or any other Transaction Document following the Closing, in each
case in accordance with the Waterfall Spreadsheet, to a member of Dymatize
Equity Plan upon delivery by such member to Dymatize Equity Plan and the
Purchaser of a release in the form attached as Exhibit B. Dymatize Equity Plan
and Company shall request a signed copy of such release from each member of
the Dymatize Equity Plan prior to the Closing Date and specify that the
delivery of such release is a condition to the payments described in the
immediately preceding sentence.

7.19 Transaction Bonuses. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the
Company shall have the right to pay transaction bonuses to one or more Company
Employees at, or at any time prior to, the Closing (each such payment, a
"Transaction Bonus Payment").

7.20 Company Employees. The Company shall, no earlier than ten (10) days prior
to the Closing Date, deliver to the Purchaser an updated Schedule 3.13(a).

7.21 Post Funding Obligation. Prior to the Closing, Post shall fund the
Purchaser with an amount of cash equal to the Gross Purchase Price.
Thereafter, Post shall from time to time fund the Purchaser with an amount of
cash necessary to permit the Purchaser to timely satisfy its obligations under
this Agreement, including without limitation, its obligations to pay (i) any
Net Closing Adjustment Amount payable to the Sellers pursuant to Section
2.3(g), (ii) any Earn-out Amount payable to the Sellers pursuant to Section
2.4(g) and (iii) any amounts required to be paid to the Sellers Indemnified
Parties pursuant to Article IX. 

7.22 Supreme Seller Earn-out. The Purchaser shall promptly provide the
Sellers' Representative with copies of any (i) Purchaser Earn-out Measurement
Statement (as such term is defined in the Supreme APA) and any interim
quarterly reports that are in each case delivered by Supreme to the Supreme
Seller pursuant to Section 2.4(a) of the Supreme APA, (ii) notice delivered by
the Supreme Seller to Supreme pursuant to Section 2.4(f) of the Supreme APA,
and (iii) report delivered by the Accounting Referee (as such term is defined
in the Supreme APA) to Supreme and the Supreme Seller pursuant to Section
2.4(g) of the Supreme APA. Further, neither the Company, Supreme, the
Purchaser nor any of their respective Affiliates shall amend, modify or waive
any provision of the Supreme APA (or cause any such amendment, modification,
or waiver) in a manner that alters the earn-out rights and obligations
thereunder (including, without limitation, Section 2.4 thereof and the defined
terms referenced therein) without the prior written consent of the Sellers'
Representative.

ARTICLE IX 
INDEMNIFICATION

9.1 Survival. All of the representations and warranties made by the parties
herein or in any Transaction Document shall survive the Closing until the
Escrow Release Date; provided, however, that the Fundamental Representations
shall survive until the date that is thirty (30) days after the expiration of
the statute of limitation period applicable to the matters covered thereby (as
applicable, the "Expiration Date"); provided, further, however, that any
written claim for indemnification setting forth with reasonable specificity
the nature of such claim and an estimate of damages in respect of such claim
that is submitted prior to the applicable Expiration Date in accordance with
this Article IX shall survive such Expiration Date until such claim is finally
resolved and satisfied. All covenants and agreements contained herein which by
their terms are to be performed following the Closing (including the
indemnification obligations set forth in this Article IX) shall survive the
Closing until performed in accordance with their respective terms or, if no
term is expressly stated, upon the expiration of the statute of limitations
period applicable to the matters covered thereby. 

9.2 Indemnification of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties. Subject to the
limitations set forth in this Article IX, from and after the Closing, each
Seller (severally and not jointly and, in the case of Sections 9.2(a), 9.2(b),
9.2(c), 9.2(i), 9.2(j), 9.2(k) and 9.2(n) below, in proportion to its
respective Pro Rata Percentage) agrees that the Purchaser Indemnified Parties
shall be entitled to indemnification for any and all Losses (without
duplication) that are suffered by, imposed upon or asserted against any of
them as a result of, in respect of, connected with, or arising out of, under,
or pursuant to:

(a) any breach or inaccuracy of the representations or warranties made by the
Company in this Agreement or any other any Transaction Document; provided,
however, that for purposes of determining whether there has been a breach or
inaccuracy of such representations and warranties and the amount of Losses due
to such breach or inaccuracy, all "Material Adverse Effect" qualifications and
other materiality qualifications contained in such representations and
warranties shall be disregarded;

(b) any breach of, or failure to perform, any covenant or agreement of the
Company forth in any Transaction Document;

(c) any Taxes that are imposed on, assessed against, or collected from a
Purchaser Indemnified Party, the Company or a Company Subsidiary (or for which
any of the Company or a Company Subsidiaries may otherwise be liable) that
relate to any taxable period of the Company or a Company Subsidiary ending on
or prior to the Closing Date or the portion of a Straddle Period ending on the
Closing Date that are not included as a liability in Closing Net Working
Capital. For the avoidance of doubt, Taxes imposed on, assessed against, or
collected from a Purchaser Indemnified Party, the Company or a Company
Subsidiary in respect of any taxable period of the Company or a Company

them as a result of, in respect of, connected with, or arising out of, under,
or pursuant to:

(a) any breach of the representations or warranties made by the Purchaser in

(b) any breach of, or failure to perform, any covenant or agreement of the
Purchaser set forth in any Transaction Document.

9.4 Limitations on Indemnification.

(a) The Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to indemnification
from the Sellers in respect of any Losses for which recovery is sought
pursuant to Sections 9.2(a)¸ 9.2(e) and 9.2(g) (in each case, other than with
respect to breaches or inaccuracies of the Fundamental Representations or the
Tax Representations), except to the extent the cumulative amount of such
Losses exceeds one percent (1.0%) of the Gross Purchase Price (the "Deductible
Amount"), whereupon the full cumulative amount of such Losses above the
Deductible Amount shall be recoverable by the Purchaser Indemnified Parties in
accordance with the terms of this Article IX. For avoidance of doubt, the
Deductible Amount shall not apply to any claims under Sections 9.2(b), 9.2(c),
9.2(d), 9.2(f), and 9.2(h) through (n).

(b) Except to the extent such Losses arise out of any fraud committed by the
Sellers, (i) the Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to
indemnification from the Sellers in respect of any Losses for which recovery
is sought pursuant to Sections 9.2(a) (other than with respect to breaches or
inaccuracies of the Fundamental Representations), 9.2(c), 9.2(d), 9.2(e)
(other than with respect to breaches or inaccuracies of the Fundamental
Representations), 9.2(g) (other than with respect to breaches or inaccuracies
of the Fundamental Representations), 9.2(i) and 9.2(n) in excess of the sum of
the Escrow Amount plus the finally determined Earn-out Amount pursuant to
Section 2.4(g) (the "Aggregate Seller Indemnification Cap"); (ii) in no event
shall any Seller be liable in the aggregate under Sections 9.2(a), 9.2(b),
9.2(c), 9.2(i), 9.2(j), 9.2(k) or 9.2(n) for any amount that would result in
indemnification payments by such Seller to the Purchaser Indemnified Parties
in excess of such Seller's Pro Rata Percentage of such payment; and (iii) in
no event shall any Seller be liable in the aggregate under Sections 9.2(a)
through 9.2(n) for any amount that would result in indemnification payments by
such Seller to the Purchaser Indemnified Parties in excess of the amount set
forth opposite such Seller's name in the Waterfall Spreadsheet under the
heading "Purchase Price Allocable to Seller." For the avoidance of doubt, the
Aggregate Seller Indemnification Cap shall not apply to any claims with
respect to breaches or inaccuracies of the Fundamental Representations under
Sections 9.2(a), 9.2(e) or 9.2(g) or any claims under Sections 9.2(b), 9.2(f),
9.2(h), 9.2(j), 9.2(k), 9.2(l) or 9.2(m).

(c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, from and after the time
at which the Purchaser Indemnified Parties no longer have the right to recover
indemnification payments against the Escrow Account or the finally determined
Earn-out Amount in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
the Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall only be entitled to recover
indemnifications payments (i) pursuant to Sections 9.2(d), 9.2(g), 9.2(h),
9.2(l) and 9.2(m), solely from the TA Funds and (ii) pursuant to Sections
9.2(e) and 9.2(f), solely from the Seller whose acts or omissions were the
direct cause of the indemnifiable Losses, in each case, subject to the
limitations set forth in this Article IX. 

(d) No representation or warranty of the Sellers, the Company or the Blocker
Companies contained herein shall be deemed untrue or incorrect, and the
Sellers, the Company and the Blocker Companies shall not be deemed to have
breached a representation or warranty, as a consequence of the existence of
any fact, circumstance or event which is disclosed in the Schedules in
response to another representation or warranty contained in this Agreement so
long as it is reasonably apparent from the face of such disclosure that such
disclosure relates to the subject matter of such representation and warranty.

(e) The Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall not make any claim for
indemnification under this Article IX in respect of any matter, but limited to
the dollar amount thereof, that is: (i) included in the statement of Estimated
Net Working Capital, Estimated Indebtedness, Estimated Cash and Cash
Equivalents or Estimated Transaction Expenses delivered by the Company; or
(ii) otherwise taken into account in the calculation of any adjustment to the
Gross Purchase Price pursuant to Section 2.3.

(f) The Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall take, and shall cause the Company
to take, commercially reasonable steps to mitigate any Loss upon becoming
aware of any event which could reasonably be expected to, or does, give rise
thereto, including incurring costs only to the extent necessary to remedy the
breach which gives rise to the Loss and using reasonable best efforts to
pursue available remedies, contribution from or participation in any remedial
action by third parties; provided Purchaser shall not be required to pay Taxes
or file Tax Returns for which the Sellers' Representative is responsible under
this Agreement in order to mitigate penalties and interest with respect to
such Taxes or Tax Returns.

(g) The amount of any and all Losses eligible for indemnification under this
Article IX shall be determined net of (i) any amounts actually recovered by an
indemnified party under any insurance policies or otherwise with respect to
such Losses; provided, however, that while the Purchaser is not responsible
for obtaining insurance for any Losses, it shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to seek recovery for any such Losses from any of its or its
Affiliates' (including, without limitation, the Group Companies') then-
existing insurance policies and (ii) the value of any Tax benefit actually
realized by an indemnified party to the extent such Losses give rise to
deductible loss, credit or expense. If, subsequent to an indemnification
payment by the indemnifying party, an indemnified party receives any Tax
benefit, any amounts under applicable insurance policies or any other payment
in respect of a Loss pursuant to which such indemnification payment was made,
then such indemnified party shall promptly reimburse the indemnifying party
for any payment made or expense incurred by such indemnifying party in
connection with providing such indemnification payment in an amount equal to
that which was received by the indemnified party until such time as the
indemnifying party is fully reimbursed.

(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Article IX, no
breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained herein
shall, in the absence of fraud, give rise to any right on the part of the
Purchaser, after the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, to
rescind this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby. 

(i) Any Loss for which the Purchaser Indemnified Parties are entitled to
indemnification under this Article IX shall be determined without duplication
of recovery by reason of the state of facts giving rise to such Loss
constituting a breach of more than one representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement.

(j) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no
Seller shall have any obligation to indemnify or hold harmless the Purchaser
from and against any Taxes of any Person (i) except with respect to breaches
of Section 3.8(o), for any taxable period (or portion thereof) beginning after
the Closing Date (or any other Losses related to any such Taxes), (ii) that
are attributable to any transaction undertaken by the Purchaser, the Blocker
Companies or the Group Companies occurring after the Closing, not including
the Transaction, or (iii) except for breaches of Section 7.1(g), that are due
to the unavailability in any taxable period (or portion thereof) beginning
after the Closing Date of any net operating losses, credits or other Tax
attribute from a taxable period (or portion thereof) ending on or prior to the
Closing Date, provided, however, that the foregoing shall not apply to the
adoption of depreciation methods for, or the expensing of, property acquired
by the Group Companies.

9.5 Indemnification Procedures.

(a) In the event that any Action shall be instituted, or that any claim shall
be asserted, by any Person in respect of which payment may be sought under
this Article IX (an "Indemnification Claim"), the indemnified party shall
promptly (but in any case within thirty (30) days of the indemnified party's
receipt of any assertion of an Indemnification Claim) cause written notice of
the assertion of any Indemnification Claim of which it has knowledge which is
covered by this Article IX to be forwarded to the indemnifying party. The
failure to give such prompt written notice shall not, however, relieve the
indemnifying party of its indemnification obligations, except and only to the
extent that the indemnifying party is materially prejudiced by such delay or
otherwise forfeits rights or defenses by reason of such failure. Except as
provided below, the indemnifying party shall have the right, at its sole
option and expense, to be represented by counsel of its choice and to defend
against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with any Indemnification Claim
which relates to any Losses indemnified against hereunder; provided, however,
that the indemnifying party may not assume the defense of an Indemnification
Claim if (i) the indemnifying party is a Seller, a reasonable assessment of
the likely amount of such Indemnification Claim is in excess of the sum of (x)
the amount of the funds then on deposit under the Escrow Agreement, (y) any
finally determined Earn-out Amount pursuant to Section 2.4(g) and (z) any
refunds for Taxes due to the Sellers pursuant to Section 7.9(d), or (ii) the
Indemnification Claim seeks an injunction or equitable relief against any
indemnified party. If, subject to the foregoing, the indemnifying party elects
to defend against any Indemnification Claim which relates to any Losses
indemnified against hereunder, it shall within thirty (30) days (or sooner, if
the nature of the Indemnification Claim so requires) notify the indemnified
party of its intent to do so. If the indemnifying party elects not to defend
against any Indemnification Claim which relates to any Losses indemnified
against hereunder, the indemnified party may defend against, negotiate, settle
or otherwise deal with such Indemnification Claim at its own expense (which
expenses shall be recoverable from time to time from the indemnifying party)
without foregoing its right to indemnification pursuant to this Article IX. If
the indemnifying party shall assume the defense of any Indemnification Claim,
the indemnified party may participate, at his or its own expense, in the
defense of such Indemnification Claim. The parties hereto agree to cooperate
fully with each other in connection with the defense, negotiation or
settlement of any such Indemnification Claim. Neither the indemnifying party
nor the indemnified party may settle any Indemnification Claim which
settlement obligates the other party to pay money, to specifically perform or
to admit liability without the consent of the other party, such consent not to
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. 

(b) After any final decision, judgment or award shall have been rendered by a
Governmental Body of competent jurisdiction and the expiration of the time in
which to appeal therefrom, or a settlement shall have been consummated, or the
indemnified party and the indemnifying party shall have arrived at a mutually
binding agreement with respect to an Indemnification Claim hereunder, the
indemnified party shall forward to the indemnifying party notice of any sums
due and owing by the indemnifying party pursuant to this Agreement with
respect to such matter. The Sellers' Representative and the Purchaser shall
give joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent to pay the Purchaser such
amount from the Escrow Account.

9.6 Tax Treatment of Indemnity Payments. The Sellers and the Purchaser agree
to treat any indemnity payment made pursuant to this Article IX as an
adjustment to the Gross Purchase Price for federal, state, local and foreign
income tax purposes.

9.7 Exclusive Remedy. Except in the case of fraud and except for equitable
remedies as provided in Sections 10.2 and 13.13, from and after the Closing,
the parties agree that the sole and exclusive remedy for (x) any breach or
inaccuracy, or alleged breach or inaccuracy, of any representation or warranty
contained in this Agreement or any Transaction Document and (y) any breach of,
or failure to perform, any covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement
or in any Transaction Document, shall in each case be indemnification in
accordance with this Article IX.

9.8 No Contribution. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, other
than as set forth in Section 7.5, after the Closing no Seller shall have, and
each hereby irrevocably waives, any claims, causes of action and rights to sue
or seek contribution, reimbursement or indemnification against or from any of
the Group Companies or Blocker Companies for any Losses incurred, suffered,
paid, sustained or indemnified by the Sellers in connection with, arising out
of, based upon, relating to or otherwise involving this Agreement.

9.9 Independent Significance. The parties intend that each representation,
warranty, covenant and agreement contained in this Agreement has independent
significance. If any party has breached any representation, warranty, covenant
or agreement contained in this Agreement in any respect, the fact that there
exists another representation, warranty, covenant or agreement relating to the
same subject matter (regardless of the relative levels of specificity) which
the party has not breached shall not detract from or mitigate the fact that
the party is in breach of the first representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement. 

ARTICLE X

10.1 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the
Closing as follows:

(a) by mutual written consent of the parties hereto;

before such date;

the Company are not then in material breach of any terms of this Agreement,

Date; and

terms of this Agreement, upon written notice to the Sellers' Representative,

the Company contained in this Agreement; provided, that such breach is not

the giving of notice thereof by the Purchaser to the Sellers' Representative,

or cured prior to the Termination Date.

10.2 Effect of Termination. In the event of the termination of this Agreement
pursuant to Section 10.1, except as provided in Section 13.13, this Agreement
shall forthwith become null and void and have no effect, without any liability
on the part of any party hereto and their respective directors, managers,
officers, employees, partners or equityholders and all rights and obligations

party hereto of any fraud or willful and material breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement set forth in this Agreement
prior to such termination and in the event of such breach the parties hereto
shall be entitled to exercise any and all remedies available under law or
equity.

Representative shall be effective until the delivery of a signed
acknowledgment by the successor Sellers' Representative to the Purchaser and
the Company that the successor Sellers' Representative accepts the
responsibility of successor Sellers' Representative and agrees to perform and
be bound by all of the provisions of this Agreement applicable to the Sellers'
Representative. For all purposes hereunder, a "majority-in-interest of the
Sellers" shall be determined on the basis of each Seller's share of the Net
Purchase Price. Each successor Sellers' Representative shall have all of the

13.7 Severability. Wherever possible, each provision hereof shall be
interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under Applicable Law,
but in case any one or more of the provisions contained herein shall, for any
reason, be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such
provision shall be ineffective to the extent, but only to the extent, of such
invalidity, illegality or unenforceability without invalidating the remainder
of such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision or provisions or any other
provisions hereof; provided, however, if such severability will negate in any
material respect any material terms of this Agreement, then the parties shall
negotiate in good faith to amend the invalid terms in a manner so that such
terms shall not be invalid and shall effect the original intent of the parties
as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the
transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to
the greatest extent possible.

13.8 Binding Effect; Assignment. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of the parties and their respective successors and
permitted assigns. Except as set forth in Section 7.5(c) and Section 7.8,
nothing in this Agreement shall create or be deemed to create any third party
beneficiary rights in any person or entity not a party to this Agreement
including without limitation any Company Employee (other than the Company
Employees set forth on Schedule 7.8, who shall each be deemed an express third
party beneficiary of this Agreement solely with respect to the second sentence
of Section 7.8 as it relates to their particular employment agreement set
forth on Schedule 7.8) or any Contingent Worker. No assignment of this
Agreement or of any rights or obligations hereunder may be made by the
Sellers, the Blocker Companies or the Purchaser, directly or indirectly (by
operation of law or otherwise), without the prior written consent of the other
parties hereto and any attempted assignment without the required consents
shall be void, except that Purchaser may assign or delegate, as applicable,
any of its rights and obligations hereunder 

to any of its Affiliates, or in whole or in part through a collateral
assignment to any lender providing financing in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby, in each case without the prior written
consent of Sellers provided that Purchaser and Post shall remain liable for
all of its obligations under this Agreement. No assignment of any obligations
hereunder shall relieve the parties hereto of any such obligations.

13.9 Release.

(a) For and in consideration of the amount to be paid to the Sellers under
this Agreement, and the additional covenants and promises set forth in this
Agreement, each of the Sellers, on behalf of themselves and their assigns,
heirs, beneficiaries, creditors, representatives, agents and affiliates (the
"Releasing Parties"), hereby fully, finally and irrevocably releases, acquit
and forever discharge each of the Group Companies and the Blocker Companies
and their respective officers, directors, managers, managing member, partners,
general partners, limited partners, managing directors, members, trustees,
shareholders, representatives, employees, principals, agents, Affiliates,
parents, subsidiaries, joint ventures, predecessors, successors, assigns,
beneficiaries, heirs, executors, personal or legal representatives, insurers
and attorneys of any of them (collectively, the "Released Parties") from any
and all commitments, actions, debts, claims, counterclaims, suits, causes of
action, damages, demands, liabilities, obligations, costs, expenses, and
compensation of every kind and nature whatsoever, past, present, or future, at
law or in equity, whether known or unknown, contingent or otherwise, which
such Releasing Parties, or any of them, had, has, or may have had at any time
in the past until and including the date of this Agreement against the
Released Parties, or any of them, including but not limited to any claims
which relate to or arise out of such Releasing Party's prior relationship with
a Group Company or a Blocker Company (including its present and former
subsidiaries, parent entities or any predecessors-in-interest) or its rights
or status as a member, officer, director, manager or managing member of any
Group Company or any Blocker Company (collectively, for the purposes of this
Section 13.9, "Causes of Action"); provided, however, that this release shall
not affect or impair (i) any of the rights of the Releasing Parties or any
obligations of the Released Parties to the Releasing Parties arising under
this Agreement or in any of the Transaction Documents; (ii) if the Releasing
Party is an employee of a Group Company or a Blocker Company as of the date
hereof, any rights of the Releasing Parties to payments in respect of such
Releasing Parties' employment with a Group Company or a Blocker Company to the
extent accrued for on the Closing Statement or (iii) the Releasing Parties'
rights to indemnification under a Group Company's or a Blocker Company's
organizational documents or Applicable Law; provided, further, however, that
this Section 13.9 shall not be construed as a release or discharge by the
Blocker Companies of the obligations of the "Seller" or the "Beneficial
Owners" (as such terms are defined in the UPA) under the UPA. 

(b) The Releasing Parties hereby represent to the Released Parties that the
Releasing Parties (i) have not assigned any Causes of Action or possible
Causes of Action against any Released Party, (ii) fully intend to release all
Causes of Action against the Released Parties including, without limitation,
unknown and contingent Causes of Action (other than those specifically
reserved above), and (iii) have consulted with counsel with respect to the
execution and delivery of this general release and has been fully apprised of
the consequences hereof.

(c) The Releasing Parties hereby irrevocably covenant to refrain from,
directly or indirectly, (i) asserting any Causes of Action, or commencing,
instituting or causing to be commenced, or continuing with any claim, action
or proceeding for a Cause of Action, and this Agreement may be raised by any
Released Party or Purchaser as an estoppel to any such claims, actions or
proceedings; and (ii) making any claim or commencing any action or proceeding
against any Person (or assisting or encouraging any other Person in connection
therewith) in which any claim, action or proceeding would arise against any
Released Party for contribution or indemnity or other relief from, over and
against any Released Party or which otherwise results in a Released Party
suffering or incurring any Losses, whether under common law, equity, statute,
Contract or otherwise, with respect a Cause of Action. Without in any way
limiting any of the rights and remedies otherwise available to any Released
Party, the Releasing Parties shall indemnify and hold harmless each Released
Party and Purchaser from and against all Losses whether or not involving
third-party claims, actions or proceedings, arising directly or indirectly
from or in connection with the assertion by or on behalf of each Releasing
Party or any of its Affiliates of any claim, action or proceeding or other
matter which is, or is purported to be, a Cause of Action. It is the intention
of Sellers and the Releasing Parties that the release described in this
Section 13.9 be effective as a bar to each Cause of Action hereinabove
specified. In furtherance of this intention Sellers and the Releasing Parties
hereby expressly waive any and all rights and benefits conferred upon it by
the provisions of Applicable Law with respect to any Cause of Action and
expressly consents that the release described in this Section 13.9 shall be
given full force and effect according to each and all of its express terms and
provisions.

(d) Each Seller shall deliver to the Purchaser at the Closing a release
agreement in form reasonably satisfactory to the Purchaser re-affirming its
obligations under this Section 13.9 and extending the coverage of the release
for such Seller set forth in this Section 13.9 to include the period from the
date hereof through and including the Closing and the Closing Date.

13.10 Non-Recourse. No past, present or future director, officer, manager,
employee, incorporator, member, partner, stockholder, Affiliate, agent,
attorney or representative of the Sellers, the Blocker Companies or the
Company or any of their respective Affiliates (other than the Sellers) shall
have any liability for any obligations or liabilities of the Sellers, the
Blocker Companies or the Company under this Agreement of or for any claim
based on, in respect of, or by reason of, the transactions contemplated hereby
and thereby. 

13.11 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts
(including by way of electronic transmission), each of which will be deemed to
be an original copy of this Agreement and all of which, when taken together,
will be deemed to constitute one and the same agreement.

13.12 Other Definitional and Interpretive Matters. Unless otherwise expressly
provided, for purposes of this Agreement, the following rules of
interpretation shall apply:

(a) Calculation of Time Period. When calculating the period of time before
which, within which or following which any act is to be done or step taken
pursuant to this Agreement, the date that is the reference date in calculating
such period shall be excluded. If the last day of such period is a non-
Business Day, the period in question shall end on the next succeeding Business
Day.

(b) Dollars. Any reference in this Agreement to $ shall mean U.S. dollars.

(c) Exhibits/Schedules. The Exhibits and Schedules to this Agreement are
hereby incorporated and made a part hereof and are an integral part of this
Agreement. All Exhibits and Schedules annexed hereto or referred to herein are
hereby incorporated in and made a part of this Agreement as if set forth in
full herein. Any capitalized terms used in any Schedule or Exhibit but not
otherwise defined therein shall be defined as set forth in this Agreement.

(d) Gender and Number. Any reference in this Agreement to gender shall include
all genders, and words imparting the singular number only shall include the
plural and vice versa.

(e) Headings. The provision of a Table of Contents, the division of this
Agreement into Articles, Sections and other subdivisions and the insertion of
headings are for convenience of reference only and shall not affect or be
utilized in construing or interpreting this Agreement. All references in this
Agreement to any "Section" are to the corresponding Section of this Agreement
unless otherwise specified.

(f) Herein. The words such as "herein," "hereinafter," "hereof," and
"hereunder" refer to this Agreement as a whole and not merely to a subdivision
in which such words appear unless the context otherwise requires.

(g) Including and Or. The word "including" or any variation thereof means
"including, without limitation" and shall not be construed to limit any
general statement that it follows to the specific or similar items or matters
immediately following it. The word "or" is not exclusive.

(h) Reflected On or Set Forth In. An item arising with respect to a specific
representation or warranty shall be deemed to be "reflected on" or "set forth
in" a balance sheet or financial statements, to the extent any such phrase
appears in such representation or warranty, if (a) there is a reserve, accrual
or other similar item underlying a number on such balance sheet or financial
statements that relates to the subject matter of such representation, (b) such
item is otherwise specifically set forth on the balance sheet or financial
statements or (c) such item is reflected on the balance sheet or financial
statements and is specifically set forth in the notes thereto. 

(i) The parties hereto have participated jointly in the negotiation and
drafting of this Agreement and, in the event an ambiguity or question of
intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as jointly
drafted by the parties hereto and no presumption or burden of proof shall
arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any
provision of this Agreement.

13.13 Specific Performance; Remedies.

(a) Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that money damages would not be a
sufficient remedy for any breach or threatened breach of this Agreement and
that irreparable harm would result if this Agreement were not specifically
enforced. Therefore, in addition to any other remedy to which such party is
entitled at law or in equity, the rights and obligations of the parties shall
be enforceable by a decree of specific performance issued by any court of
competent jurisdiction, and appropriate injunctive relief may be applied for
and granted in connection therewith, without the necessity of posting a bond
or other security or proving actual damages and without regard to the adequacy
of any remedy at law. Each party hereto agrees that it will not oppose the
granting of an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief
when expressly available pursuant to the terms of this Agreement on the basis
that the other party has an adequate remedy at law or an award of specific
performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity. Any
party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement when expressly available pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and
to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement when
expressly available pursuant to the terms of this Agreement shall not be
required to provide any bond or other security in connection with any such
order or injunction. Each party hereto further agrees that the seeking of the
remedies pursuant to this Section 13.13 shall not constitute a waiver by
either party seeking such remedies of its right to seek any other form of
relief that may be available to it under this Agreement or otherwise.

(b) It is further agreed that, notwithstanding anything set forth in Section
13.3(a), the Sellers' Representative (on behalf of the Sellers and on behalf
of the Company) shall be entitled to seek an injunction, specific performance
or other equitable remedy to specifically enforce the Purchaser's obligations
to effect the Closing and Post's obligations to fund the Purchaser on the
terms and conditions set forth herein only in the event that (A) all
conditions in Section 8.1 and Section 8.2 have been satisfied (other than
those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied by actions taken at
the Closing, each of which is then capable of being satisfied at a Closing on
such date) at the time when the Closing would have occurred but for the
failure of the Purchaser to comply with its obligations to effect the Closing
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, and (B) the Sellers' Representative
(on behalf of the Sellers and on behalf of the Company) has irrevocably
confirmed that if specific performance is granted, then the Closing will
occur. 

(c) It is further agreed that, notwithstanding anything set forth in Section
13.3(a), the Purchaser and Post shall be entitled to seek an injunction,
specific performance or other equitable remedy to specifically enforce the
Sellers', Company's or Blocker Companies' obligations to effect the Closing on
the terms and conditions set forth herein only in the event that (A) all
conditions in Section 8.1 and Section 8.3 have been satisfied (other than
those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied by actions taken at
the Closing, each of which is then capable of being satisfied at a Closing on
such date) at the time when the Closing would have occurred but for the
failure of the Sellers, the Company or the Blocker Companies to comply with
their respective obligations to effect the Closing pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement, and (B) the Purchaser has irrevocably confirmed that if
specific performance is granted, then the Closing will occur.
