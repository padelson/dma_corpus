as set forth in Section 3.2(d) or Section 3.2(e), Purchaser shall be entitled
to the return of the Deposit, in addition to all interest accrued on the
Deposit, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the bank and
account designated by Purchaser in accordance with Section 4.4(d).

  

  

(d) If the Closing is not consummated before this Agreement terminates because
of the failure of Purchaser to perform or observe in any material respect its
covenants and agreements contained herein that are to be performed or observed
at or prior to Closing such that the condition set forth in Section 9.1(b) is
not satisfied, then Seller shall be entitled at its option to (i) enforce
specific performance of this Agreement, in which event the Deposit and the
interest accrued on the Deposit will be applied as called for herein, or (ii)
if Seller does not seek and successfully enforce specific performance, seek
damages for Purchaser's breach and retain the Deposit and the interest accrued
on the Deposit as an initial minimum payment toward those damages, in either
case without prejudice to any other remedy available to Seller (whether at
law, in equity or otherwise).

  

  

(e) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 10.1(d), then Seller
shall be entitled to seek damages for Purchaser's breach and retain the
Initial Deposit and the interest accrued on the Initial Deposit as an initial
minimum payment toward those damages, in either case without prejudice to any
other remedy available to Seller (whether at law, in equity or otherwise).

  

  

3.3 Adjustments to Purchase Price. The Purchase Price for the Shares shall be
adjusted as follows:

  

  

(a) Working Capital Adjustment. The Purchase Price shall be increased by the
amount of Effective Time Net Working Capital, if positive, and decreased by
the amount of Effective Time Net Working Capital, if negative.

  

  

(b) Prepaid Expenses. The Purchase Price shall be increased by the amount of
any prepaid expenses made, directly or indirectly, by any Company Group Member
prior to the Effective Time that apply to the period following the Effective
Time and which are not included in the calculation of Effective Time Net
Working Capital.

  

  

(c) Intergroup Advances and Intergroup Receipts. The Purchase Price shall be
increased by the amount of any Intergroup Advances from the Effective Time to
the Closing and decreased by the amount of any Intergroup Receipts from the
Effective Time to the Closing.

  

  

(d) Preferential Right Exercise; Exclusions. The Purchase Price shall be
decreased by the Allocated Value of any Property as to which a preferential
right to purchase has been properly exercised by a third Person and the
transfer of such Property to such third Person has been consummated, or which
have been excluded from Closing because a consent requirement that must be
satisfied under Section 7.4 remains unsatisfied.

  

   
  
 

 

 

 

 

  

 

  

 

4  

  

 

 

 

   
 


 

  

(e) Other. The Purchase Price shall be increased or decreased, as the case may
be, by any other amounts expressly provided in this Agreement to be
adjustments to the Purchase Price.

  

  

The Purchase Price, adjusted as set forth in (a) through (e), shall be the
"Adjusted Purchase Price."

  

  

3.4 Allocated Values. The "Allocated Value" for any Property shall be the
portion of the unadjusted Purchase Price allocated to such Property on
Schedule 3.4, increased or decreased by the adjustments to the unadjusted
Purchase Price described in Section 3.3 that are applicable to the relevant
Property. Seller has accepted such Allocated Values for purposes of this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, but otherwise makes no
representation or warranty as to the accuracy of such values. Seller and
Purchaser agree that the Allocated Values shall be used by Seller and
Purchaser as the basis for reporting asset values and other items for purposes
of all Tax Returns, including, to the extent required to be filed by Seller,
United States Internal Revenue Service Form 8594, and that neither they nor
their Affiliates will take positions inconsistent with the Allocated Values in
notices to Governmental Bodies, in audit or other proceedings with respect to
Taxes, except as otherwise required with respect to applicable Tax Laws, in
notices to preferential purchase right holders, or in other documents or
notices relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

  

3.5 Escrow Account.

  

  

(a) On or prior to the Closing Date, the Parties shall establish an interest-
bearing escrow account (the "Escrow Account") with the Houston, Texas branch
of JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A., or, if such Person is unwilling or unable to
serve, another financial institution reasonably satisfactory to Seller and
Purchaser (the "Escrow Agent"). The Escrow Agent shall hold and maintain the
Escrow Amount in the Escrow Account in accordance with an escrow agreement
(the "Escrow Agreement") between the Escrow Agent and the Parties, in
substantially the form of Exhibit G, with such changes as Seller and Purchaser
may negotiate in good faith after the date of this Agreement. At the Closing,
Purchaser shall deliver the Escrow Amount to the Escrow Agent to be held,
invested and disbursed in accordance with this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement.

  

  

(b) The Escrow Agent may only be removed by the unanimous action of the
Parties. Should the Escrow Agent resign or be removed, the Parties shall,
within ten (10) days after such removal decision or notice of recommendation,
unanimously agree on the appointment of a successor Escrow Agent, provided
that, should the Parties fail to reach agreement within such ten (10) day
period, either Party may request that the LCIA select a successor Escrow Agent
meeting the criteria set forth in this Section. Any successor Escrow Agent
shall be a US national bank having a credit rating for long-term unsecured
debt of at least A+ (long term) (as rated by Standard and Poor's Rating Group).
The successor Escrow Agent shall be asked to sign an escrow agreement that is
substantially identical to the Escrow Agreement, subject to such changes as
both Parties may approve, and such substitute Escrow Agreement shall following
execution by both Parties and the successor Escrow Agent become the Escrow
Agreement under this Agreement.

  

   
  
 

 

 

 

  

 

5  

  

 

 

 

   
 


 

  

(c) The Escrow Amount shall be maintained in the Escrow Account until
distributed in accordance with Section 7.4(d) or Section 7.4(e), as
applicable. Interest that accrues on the balance in the Escrow Account shall
be credited to the Escrow Amount for each Property pro rata, in the proportion
that the balance held in the Escrow Account with respect to such Property
bears to the total balance in the Escrow Account. The Party ultimately
entitled to the applicable Escrow Amount shall bear any Taxes attributable to
the interest included in such amount.

  

  

(d) The Escrow Agent shall be authorized to release from escrow any of the
Escrow Amount only pursuant to (i) any written instruction, order, award or
judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction or (ii) by joint written
instruction of the Parties.

  

  

(e) Each Party agrees to execute such notices to the Escrow Agent or
certificates as may be required to cause the Escrow Amount to be distributed
in accordance with Section 3.5(c) or 3.5(d) when called for pursuant to that
Section. In the event either Party disputes the amount to be released pursuant
to a proposed written disbursement instruction, but not that some portion of
the Escrow Amount is to be released, the Parties agree to execute and deliver
a disbursement instruction for the undisputed amounts, and thereafter to
execute a disbursement instruction for any remaining disputed amounts that are
required to be released in accordance with the subsequent agreement of the
Parties or determination of the arbitrators pursuant to Section 12.5. The
costs of the Escrow Agent shall, to the extent not paid out of interest or
income on or attributable to the Escrow Amount, be borne equally by Seller and
Purchaser.

  

  

(f) If Purchaser is not required to deposit any amount into the Escrow Account
at Closing pursuant to Section 7.4(d), then (i) if the Parties have not
established the Escrow Account or entered into the Escrow Agreement prior to
Closing, the Parties shall not establish the Escrow Account or enter into the
Escrow Agreement, and (ii) if the Parties have established the Escrow Account
or entered into the Escrow Agreement prior to Closing, the Parties shall cause
the Escrow Account to be closed or the Escrow Agreement to be terminated, as
applicable.

4.4 Closing Amount and Post-Closing Purchase Price Adjustment.

  

  

(a) Not later than five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Seller
shall prepare and deliver to Purchaser, using and based upon the best
information available to Seller, a preliminary statement estimating each
individual Purchase Price adjustment set forth in Section 3.3 (and, as
applicable, showing the calculation thereof, including the calculation of any
adjustments that are applicable to Pending Assets) and the Adjusted Purchase
Price after giving effect to all Purchase Price adjustments set forth in
Section 3.3. The estimate of the Adjusted Purchase Price delivered in
accordance with this Section 4.4(a) (the "Closing Amount"), minus the Deposit
and all interest accrued on the Deposit, shall constitute the dollar amount to
be paid by Purchaser to Seller or into the Escrow Account, as applicable, at
the Closing.

  

  

(b) On or before the one hundred and twentieth (120th) day following the
Closing Date, Seller will prepare and deliver to Purchaser a statement setting
forth the final calculation of the Adjusted Purchase Price and showing the
calculation of each adjustment. As soon as reasonably practicable but not
later than the thirtieth (30th) day following Purchaser's receipt of Seller's
statement hereunder, Purchaser shall deliver to Seller a written report
containing any changes that Purchaser proposes be made to such statement. The
Parties shall undertake to agree on the final statement of the Adjusted
Purchase Price no later than ninety (90) days after Purchaser's receipt of
Seller's statement. In the event that the Parties cannot reach agreement
within such period of time, either Party may refer the remaining matters in
dispute to an independent accounting firm agreed by the Parties (being one of
the four internationally recognized independent accountancy firms) for review
and final determination. Should the Parties fail to agree on the identity of
the independent accounting firm, or should the independent accounting firm
agreed by the Parties fail or refuse to serve under this Section within twenty
(20) days after written request from any Party to serve, and should the
Parties fail to agree in writing on a replacement within ten (10) days after
the end of such twenty (20) day period, or should no replacement agree to
serve within forty-five (45) days after the original written request pursuant
to this sentence, another nationally recognized independent accounting firm
shall be appointed by the LCIA. The independent accounting firm, once
appointed (the "Accounting Firm"), shall have no ex parte communications with
any of the Parties concerning the determination required hereunder. All
communications between any Party, or its Affiliates, and the Accounting Firm
shall be conducted in writing, with copies sent simultaneously to the other
Party in the same manner, or at a meeting to which the representatives of both
Parties have been invited and of which such Parties have been provided at
least five (5) days prior written notice. Within ten (10) days of appointment
of the Accounting Firm, Purchaser shall present the Accounting Firm with its
proposed changes, which shall be limited to matters raised in Purchaser's
written report previously delivered to Seller, and Seller shall present the
Accounting Firm with the final statement that it delivered to Purchaser and
Seller's response to Purchaser's proposed changes, in each case together with
all other supporting information that it desires, with a copy to the other
Party. The Accounting Firm's determination shall be made within thirty (30)
days after the deadline for Seller's submissions and shall be final and
binding on both Parties, without right of appeal. In determining the proper
amount of any adjustment to the Purchase Price, the Accounting Firm shall not
increase the Purchase Price more than the increase proposed by Seller nor
decrease the Purchase Price more than the decrease proposed by Purchaser, as
applicable. The Accounting Firm shall act as an expert for the limited purpose
of determining the specific disputed matters submitted by either Party in
accordance with this Section, shall not act as an

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

9  

  

 

 

 

   
 


 

  

arbitrator, and may not award damages or penalties to either Party with
respect to any matter. Each of Seller and Purchaser shall bear its own legal
fees and other costs of presenting its case. Seller shall bear one-half and
Purchaser shall bear one-half of the costs and expenses of the Accounting
Firm.

  

  

(c) Within ten (10) days after the earlier of (i) the expiration of
Purchaser's thirty (30) day review period without delivery of any written
report and (ii) the date on which the Parties or the Accounting Firm, as
applicable, finally determines the disputed matters, (x) Purchaser shall pay
to Seller the amount by which the Adjusted Purchase Price exceeds the Closing
Amount or (y) Seller shall pay to Purchaser the amount by which the Closing
Amount exceeds the Adjusted Purchase Price, as applicable. Any payment made
pursuant to this Section 4.4 shall bear interest (A) from the Closing Date
until the date payment is due at the Agreed Interest Rate and (B) after the
date payment is due at the Default Interest Rate.

  

  

(d) All payments made or to be made under this Agreement to Seller shall be
made to Seller, without deduction or offset, by electronic transfer of
immediately available funds in US dollars to the bank account specified by
Seller in writing to Purchaser, for the credit of Seller. All payments made or
to be made hereunder to Purchaser shall be made to Purchaser, without
deduction or offset, by electronic transfer of immediately available funds in
US dollars to a bank and account specified by Purchaser in writing to Seller,
for the credit of Purchaser.

granted within ten (10) days (unless a shorter time is reasonably required by
the circumstances and such shorter time is specified in Seller's notice) of
receipt by Purchaser of Seller's notice requesting such consent unless
Purchaser notifies Seller to the contrary during that period. In the event of
an emergency, while such emergency is continuing, Seller may take such action
as a prudent owner or operator would take and shall notify Purchaser of such
action promptly thereafter. When such emergency is no longer continuing,
Seller shall, to the extent reasonably practicable in the circumstances,
consult with Purchaser regarding any further actions to be taken by Seller.

  

  

7.2 Access. During the period from the date hereof until the earlier of the
Closing Date or the termination of this Agreement, Seller shall give Purchaser
and its directors, officers, employees, agents and representatives
(collectively, "Representatives") access, at Purchaser's risk and expense, to
the Company Group's Properties, and access to and a right to copy, at
Purchaser's expense, the Records in Seller's and each Company Group Member's
possession which are not already available to Purchaser, but in each case only
to the extent that Seller may do so without violating applicable Laws or any
obligations to any third Person, to the extent that Seller has access to such
information and has authority to grant such access without breaching any
restriction binding on Seller and, in the case of access to offshore
Properties, to the extent

space on regularly scheduled transportation is available. Purchaser shall
provide three (3) Business Days advance notice to Seller of its request for
access hereunder, and such access by personnel of Purchaser and its
Representatives shall be subject to compliance by such personnel and
Representatives with Seller's (or any other operator's) safety, health,
environmental and other policies relating to access. Neither Purchaser nor any
of its Representatives shall make any requests for access directly or
indirectly to any Representative of the Company Group. Such access by
Purchaser shall be limited to Seller's or the Company Group Member's normal
business hours, as applicable, and Purchaser's investigation shall be
conducted in a manner that minimizes interference with the operations of such
Persons. Neither Purchaser nor its Representatives shall operate equipment or
conduct any sampling, testing or analysis of any materials without Seller's
prior written consent. In addition, Purchaser and its Representatives shall
not have access to employment records of individual employees of the Company
Group prior to the Closing except on such terms as may be agreed by Seller and
Purchaser in order to protect confidential information and ensure compliance
with all applicable Laws and Seller's policies. All information obtained by
Purchaser and its Representatives under this Section shall be subject to the
terms of that certain confidentiality agreement between Newfield Exploration
Company (an Affiliate of Seller) and Purchaser dated June 10, 2013 (the
"Confidentiality Agreement").

  

  

7.3 Government Authorizations; Cooperation. Seller and Purchaser shall in a
timely manner (i) make all required filings, provide all required notices,
prepare all required applications and conduct negotiations with each
Governmental Body as to which such filings, notices, applications or
negotiations are necessary or appropriate in the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the filings, notices and
applications listed on Schedule 7.3 (the "Government Authorizations"), and
(ii) provide such information as each may reasonably request to make or obtain
the Government Authorizations. Each Party shall reasonably cooperate with and
use commercially reasonable efforts to assist the other with respect to the
Government Authorizations. Each Party shall supply promptly any additional
information and documentary material that may be requested in connection with
the filings, notices and applications for the Government Authorizations.
Purchaser shall bear the cost of all filing or application fees payable to any
Governmental Body with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, regardless of which Party, or Affiliate of a Party, is required to
make the payments.

  

  

7.4 Consents to Assignment, Preferential Rights to Purchase and Required
Notices; Purchaser Shareholder Consent.

  

  

(a) Seller shall, after the date hereof, prepare and send (i) notices to the
holders of any required consents to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement as set forth on Schedule 5.20, Part 1 of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule in compliance with the terms of such requirements, requesting such
consents, and (ii) notices to the holders of any applicable preferential
rights to purchase or similar rights as set forth on Schedule 5.20, Part 2 of
the Seller Disclosure Schedule (collectively, "Preferential Rights")
substantially in the form of the Preferential Right Notices, accompanied by a
form of asset purchase agreement substantially in the form of the Asset
Purchase Agreement. The Parties agree to review further the forms of
Preferential Right Notices and Asset Purchase Agreement after the date of
execution of this Agreement, in relation to the terms of the applicable Joint
Operating Agreements and this

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

24  

  

 

 

 

   
  
 


 

  

Agreement, and to determine whether any mutually agreeable revisions are
required. Notices required under clause (i) above shall be delivered promptly
after the receipt of the full amount of the Deposit pursuant to Section 3.2,
or as otherwise provided in the relevant instruments, and notices required
under clause (ii) above shall be delivered promptly after the receipt of
Purchaser's shareholder approval pursuant to Section 7.4(h). In providing
notices to the holders of any applicable Preferential Rights under clause (ii)
above and consummating a transaction pursuant to any properly exercised
Preferential Right, Seller shall comply with the requirements of the
applicable Joint Operating Agreement. Any Preferential Right must be exercised
subject to all terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, including the
successful closing of this Agreement pursuant to Article 4. The consideration
payable under this Agreement for any particular Assets shall be the Allocated
Value for such Assets, as described in Section 3.4. Seller shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause any such consents to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and waivers of the Preferential Rights (or the
exercise thereof) to be obtained and delivered prior to Closing, provided that
Seller shall not be required to make payments or undertake obligations to or
for the benefit of the holders of such rights in order to obtain the required
consents or waivers. Purchaser shall reasonably cooperate with Seller in
seeking to obtain such consents to assignment and waivers of Preferential
Rights, including, if requested by Seller, providing confirmation to the
relevant third party as to deal terms and Allocated Values for the affected
Properties.

  

  

(b) If any required consent affecting any Asset is not obtained, the affected
Assets shall become Excluded Assets (and the assets, liabilities, revenues and
expenses with respect thereto shall not be taken into account for purposes of
the adjustments in Section 3.3) and the affected Asset shall not be
transferred to Purchaser at Closing. If the affected Asset is a Property, the
Purchase Price shall be decreased by the Allocated Value, if any, for such
Property. There shall be no adjustment to the Purchase Price with respect to
Assets other than Properties that are not transferred as a result of a failure
to obtain a consent.

  

  

(c) If any Preferential Right is properly exercised and the transfer of the
affected Assets to the holder of the Preferential Right is consummated prior
to Closing, the affected Assets shall become Excluded Assets (and the assets,
liabilities, revenues and expenses with respect thereto shall not be taken
into account for purposes of the adjustments in Section 3.3), and, if the
affected Asset is a Property, the Purchase Price shall be decreased by the
Allocated Value, if any, for such Property pursuant to Section 3.3(d). Seller
shall retain the consideration paid by the third Person. There shall be no
adjustment to the Purchase Price with respect to Assets other than Properties
that are not transferred as a result of the exercise of a Preferential Right.

  

  

(d) Should (i) a third Person properly exercise its Preferential Right prior
to Closing, but the transfer of the affected Assets to such third Person is
not consummated prior to Closing, or (ii) a third Person fail to exercise or
waive its Preferential Right prior to Closing and at Closing the time for
exercise has not yet expired, the amount of the Allocated Values for the
affected Property or Properties (the "Pending Assets") (as adjusted by the
adjustments to the unadjusted Purchase Price described in Section 3.3 that are
applicable to such Pending Assets, as described in Section 3.4) shall be
deposited at Closing into the Escrow Account, to be applied pursuant to
Section 3.5, in lieu of being paid to Seller under Section 4.3(a). Such
amount, together with interest earned thereon, shall be referred to herein as
the "Escrow Amount."

  

   
 

 

 

  

 

  

 

25  

  

 

 

 

   
  
 


 

  

Purchaser agrees to cause the relevant Subsidiary to comply with the terms of
such Preferential Right after Closing. In the event that (A) in the case of
clause (i) above, the transfer of any affected Property to the third Person is
consummated after Closing, or (B) in the case of clause (ii) above, such a
Preferential Right to purchase any Property is properly exercised after
Closing and the transfer of the affected Property to the third Person is
consummated, then (1) Seller shall be entitled to receive the Escrow Amount
with respect to the relevant Property, and (2) Purchaser shall be entitled to
the consideration paid by the third Person. There shall be no adjustment to
the Purchase Price or payment to Seller with respect to Assets other than
Properties that are conveyed to a third Person as a result of the exercise of
a Preferential Right.

  

  

(e) Should any Escrow Amount be held with respect to any Property or
Properties pursuant to Section 7.4(d) and the time for exercise of the
Preferential Right with respect to the Property or Properties by the third
Person holding it expires without the right having been exercised, then Seller
shall be entitled to receive the Escrow Amount with respect to the relevant
Property or Properties.

  

  

(f) In the event that a Preferential Right is properly exercised prior to
Closing Seller shall, and in the event that a Preferential Right is properly
exercised after Closing Purchaser shall, procure that the relevant Company
Group Member shall enter into an asset purchase agreement substantially in the
form of the Asset Purchase Agreement with the Preferential Right holder.

  

  

(g) In the event that a Preferential Right is properly exercised and the
transfer of the affected Assets to the Preferential Right holder is
consummated, Seller agrees to reimburse Purchaser, within thirty (30) days
following the later of the Closing or the consummation of such transfer, for
the following specific amounts to reflect an agreed compensation for excess
capacity which Purchaser may be left holding following such exercise
(regardless of the actual costs Purchaser may or may not incur):

  

  

(i) With respect to personnel, an amount equal to $31,500,000 multiplied by a
fraction, the numerator of which is the Allocated Value of the Properties
transferred pursuant to the Preferential Right and the denominator of which is
the total Allocated Value of all Properties.

  

  

(ii) In the case of any transferred Property where one or more wells are
scheduled to be drilled by the Ensco 106 drilling rig, as shown on Schedule
7.4(g)(ii), an amount equal to $155,000/day (being the contract rate as of the
date hereof) multiplied by the number of days on which the Ensco 106 drilling
rig is scheduled to be on location at that Property, as shown on Schedule
7.4(g)(ii), but instead is not in use on behalf of the Company Group or any of
their Affiliates. This payment shall be reduced by any revenues received by
any of the Company Group or their Affiliates, or any reduction in payments due
to Ensco, with respect to that period as a result of the Ensco 106 drilling
rig being subchartered, leased, released back to Ensco or otherwise assigned
to others during this period. Purchaser agrees to use reasonable efforts to
subcharter, lease, release back to Ensco or otherwise assign such drilling rig
to obtain commercial compensation, or reduction in payments due to Ensco,
during any portion of such a period when the Company Group is not utilizing
such drilling rig.

  

   
 

 

 

 

 

  

 

  

 

26  

  

 

 

 

   
  
 


 

  

(iii) In the case of any transferred Property that is producing Hydrocarbons
as of the date hereof and is held by Newfield Peninsula (and therefore is
serviced by one or more of the three supply boats under long term contract on
the date hereof), an amount equal to $17,421/day (being the sum of the
contract rates for the three supply boats as of the date hereof) multiplied by
1,178 (the average term expressed in days remaining on the three supply boat
contracts at the Effective Time), and further multiplied by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the Allocated Value of the transferred Property and the
denominator of which is the total Allocated Values of all Properties that are
producing Hydrocarbons as of the date hereof and are held by Newfield
Peninsula. This payment shall be reduced by any revenues received by any of
the Company Group or their Affiliates, or any reduction in payments due to the
contract counterparty, with respect to that period as a result of the
applicable supply boat being subchartered, leased, released back to the
contract counterparty or otherwise assigned to others during this period.
Purchaser agrees to use reasonable efforts to subcharter, lease, release back
to the contract counterparty or otherwise assign each supply boat to obtain
commercial compensation, or reduction in payments due to the contract
counterparty, during any portion of such a period when the Company Group is
not utilizing such supply boat.

  

  

The Parties agree that no other amounts are payable to Purchaser by Seller as
a consequence of any exercise of Preferential Rights except (x) any adjustment
required pursuant to Section 7.4(c) or Section 7.4(d), (y) any payment
required pursuant to Section 8.1 or Section 11.1(b)(iii) and (z) any amount
payable under this Section 7.4(g).

  

  

(h) Purchaser shall, promptly after the date hereof, prepare and submit (i) a
valuation report and valuation certificate as required by applicable Law to
Bursa Malaysia Securities Berhad for its approval, (ii) a draft circular as
required by applicable Law to Bursa Malaysia Securities Berhad for its
approval, and make any other filing or submission required by applicable Law
or the rules of any stock exchange on which the shares of Purchaser or any of
its Affiliates is listed or requirements of any guidelines issued by the
Securities Commission Malaysia, (iii) all necessary materials to its
shareholders and solicit their approval for this Agreement and every action
contemplated by this Agreement for which such approval is required,
accompanied by a favorable recommendation of Purchaser's management. Purchaser
shall maintain its favorable recommendation by its Board for the transaction
through the conclusion of its extraordinary general meeting with respect to
such approval and shall hold such meeting promptly (as permitted by Law) after
issuance of all necessary materials to its shareholders. Purchaser shall use
its best efforts to cause such shareholder approval to be obtained and
delivered prior to the scheduled Closing Date under Section 4.1(a), provided
that Purchaser shall not be required to make payments or undertake obligations
to or for the benefit of any shareholder in order to obtain the required
consents or waivers.

  

  

7.5 Notification of Breaches. Until the Closing:

  

  

(a) Purchaser shall notify Seller promptly after Purchaser obtains actual
knowledge that any representation or warranty of Seller contained in this
Agreement is untrue in any material respect or will be untrue in any material
respect as of the Closing Date or that any covenant or agreement to be
performed or observed by Seller prior to or on the Closing Date has not been
so performed or observed in any material respect.

  

   
 

 

 

 

 

  

 

  

 

27  

  

 

 

 

   
  
 


 

  

(b) Seller shall notify Purchaser promptly after Seller obtains actual
knowledge that any representation or warranty of Purchaser contained in this
Agreement is untrue in any material respect or will be untrue in any material
respect as of the Closing Date or that any covenant or agreement to be
performed or observed by Purchaser prior to or on the Closing Date has not
been so performed or observed in any material respect.

  

  

(c) If any of Purchaser's or Seller's representations or warranties is untrue
or shall become untrue in any material respect between the date of this
Agreement and the Closing Date, or if any of Purchaser's or Seller's covenants
or agreements to be performed or observed prior to or on the Closing Date
shall not have been so performed or observed in any material respect, and if
such breach of representation, warranty, covenant or agreement shall (if
curable) be cured by the Closing (or, if the Closing does not occur, by the
date set forth in Section 10.1), then such breach shall be considered not to
have occurred for all purposes of this Agreement.

  

  

7.6 Public Announcements. Until the Closing, no Party, nor any Affiliate of a
Party, shall make any press release or other public announcement regarding the
existence of this Agreement, the contents hereof or the transactions
contemplated hereby without the prior written consent of the other. The
Parties agree that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement consist of
the sale of the Shares, and no public statement or press release shall
characterize the transactions contemplated hereby as a sale of the
Subsidiaries or a sale of assets. Each Party acknowledges that the other Party
(or its Affiliates) intends to issue a press release concerning this Agreement
shortly after the execution of this Agreement in substantially the form
previously provided to and approved by the other Party. The foregoing shall
not restrict disclosures by Purchaser or Seller or any of their Affiliates (a)
that are required by applicable securities or other Laws or regulations or the
applicable rules of any stock exchange having jurisdiction over the disclosing
Party or its Affiliates, (b) to Governmental Bodies and third Persons holding
Preferential Rights or rights of consent or rights to receive notice that may
be applicable to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, as
reasonably necessary to obtain waivers of such rights or such consents or to
provide such notice or (c) as otherwise permitted for "Confidential
Information" under the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement (regardless of
whether the Confidentiality Agreement has terminated at the time in question);
provided that, in each case to which such an exception applies, the releasing
Party shall provide the other Party not less than twenty-four (24) hours to
comment on a draft of such disclosure, and such releasing Party shall consider
in good faith all comments provided by such other Party. Seller and Purchaser
shall each be liable for compliance by its respective Affiliates with the
terms of this Section.

  

  

7.7 Affiliate Debt. At or prior to the Closing, Seller and its Affiliates
shall (a) cause the repayment of or capitalize any net Affiliate Debt of each
Company Group Member to Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than the
Company Group) and (b) distribute to Seller or repay any net Affiliate Debt of
Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than the Company Group) to each Company
Group Member (subject in the case of repayment to adjustment pursuant to
Section 3.3(a) for any current assets resulting from such repayment and
remaining in the Company at Closing).

  

  

7.8 Indemnity Regarding Access. Purchaser agrees to indemnify, defend and hold
harmless Seller, the Company Group, Seller's other Affiliates, and all such
Persons' Representatives from and against any and all claims, liabilities,
losses, costs and expenses

  

   
 

 

 

 

 

  

 

  

 

28  

  

 

 

 

   
  
 


 

  

(including court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees), including claims,
liabilities, losses, costs and expenses attributable to personal injury,
illness or death, or property damage, arising out of or relating to access to
the Company Group, their respective Properties and Assets and to the Records
and other related information prior to the Closing by Purchaser, its
Affiliates, or its or their Representatives, even if caused in whole or in
part by the negligence (whether sole, joint or concurrent), strict liability
or other legal fault of any indemnified Person. Claims for indemnification
under this Section 7.8 shall be asserted and resolved in accordance with the
procedures set forth in Section 11.2.

  

  

7.9 Assumption of Obligations. By the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement at the Closing, and without limiting the
indemnification obligations of any Party under Article 11 or the obligations
of either Party for Purchase Price adjustments under Section 3.3, Purchaser
assumes and agrees to pay, perform and discharge all obligations of Seller or
any of its Affiliates set forth on Schedule 7.9. Seller's sole recourse for
breach of the covenants in this Section 7.9 shall be indemnification pursuant
to Section 11.1(a)(i).

  

  

7.10 Employee Matters. The provisions of Exhibit E shall apply in respect of
employees of each Company Group Member or of Affiliates of Seller if
designated on Schedule 7.10.

  

  

7.11 Change of Name. On the Closing Date, Purchaser shall make the necessary
filings required in each Company Group Member's jurisdiction of organization
and any other jurisdictions in which such entity is qualified to do business
to eliminate the Newfield Names and any variants thereof from the name of each
Company Group Member. As promptly as practicable, but in any case within one
hundred twenty (120) days after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall eliminate
the Newfield Names and any variants thereof from the assets of the Company
Group, and, except with respect to such grace period for eliminating existing
usage, shall have no right to use the Newfield Names or any other logos,
trademarks or trade names belonging to Seller or any of its Affiliates.

  

  

7.12 Replacement of Bonds, Letters of Credit and Guarantees. The Parties
understand that none of the bonds, letters of credit and guarantees posted by
Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than the Company Group) with
Governmental Bodies or third Persons for the benefit of any Company Group
Member will be transferred to Purchaser. On or before the Closing, Purchaser
shall have obtained, or cause to have been obtained in the name of Purchaser
or its Affiliates, replacements for such bonds, letters of credit and
guarantees, and any other bonds, letters of credit or guarantees required to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and shall have
caused the cancellation or return of the bonds, letters of credit and
guarantees posted by Seller and its Affiliates (other than the Company Group),
including those set forth on Schedule 7.12, in each case effective as of the
Closing.

  

  

7.13 Casualty Loss. If any asset of any Company Group Member (other than an
Excluded Asset) is damaged or destroyed by Casualty Loss after the date hereof
and prior to the Closing, and the cost of restoring such damaged or destroyed
asset to a condition reasonably comparable to its prior condition (net of and
after giving effect to any insurance proceeds available to such Company Group
Member for such restoration) (such cost, the "Restoration

  

   
 

 

 

 

 

  

 

  

 

29  

  

 

 

 

   
  
 


 

  

Cost") is greater than $2,500,000, Seller may elect by notice to Purchaser,
after consultation with Purchaser, either (i) to reduce the amount of the
Purchase Price by the estimated Restoration Cost (as estimated by a qualified
firm reasonably acceptable to Purchaser and Seller and selected by Purchaser
and Seller in good faith and promptly after the date of the event giving rise
to the Casualty Loss), (ii) to restore, at Seller's cost, such damaged or
destroyed asset to a condition reasonably comparable to its prior condition
(in which case Seller shall retain all rights to insurance and claims against
third Persons with respect to the casualty), or (iii) to indemnify Purchaser
through a document reasonably acceptable to Seller and Purchaser against any
costs or expenses that Purchaser reasonably incurs to repair the Assets
subject to any Casualty Loss, and such Casualty Loss shall not affect the
Closing. If Seller does not provide notice of such election within sixty (60)
days after the date of such Casualty Loss, Seller shall be deemed to have
selected alternative (i). In the event that the Assets are repaired or
restored by Seller under clause (ii) or by Purchaser under clause (iii) and
the repaired or restored Assets are upgraded from the Assets that were damaged
or destroyed, Purchaser shall bear the portion of the cost of repair or
restoration attributable to the upgrade. Notwithstanding the preceding, if the
Restoration Cost is in excess of 20% of the Purchase Price, either Party may,
by notice to the other at least five (5) Business Days prior to Closing, elect
to terminate this Agreement. If the Restoration Cost of any Casualty Loss is
$2,500,000 or less, (x) neither Purchaser nor Seller shall have the right or
option to terminate this Agreement and (y) there shall be no reduction in the
amount of the Purchase Price. To the extent Seller elects to reduce the amount
of the Purchase Price by the estimated Restoration Cost pursuant to this
Section 7.13, Seller shall assign to Purchaser or its assignee any rights to
insurance claims or recoveries available under insurance policies covering the
applicable Company Group Members or any of their properties or assets with
respect to the Casualty Loss (excluding insurance policies issued by Seller
and its Affiliates) and all rights against third Persons with respect to the
Casualty Loss.

  

  

7.14 Prohibited Payments. With respect to the matters provided for hereunder,
none of the Parties nor any of their respective Affiliates have made or will
make any offer, payment, promise to pay or authorization of the payment of any
money, or any offer, gift, promise to give, or authorization of giving of
anything of value, directly or indirectly, to or for the use or benefit of any
official or employee of a Governmental Body or public international
organization or to or for the use or benefit of any candidate, political party
official, or political party, unless such offer, payment, gift, promise or
authorization is authorized by applicable written laws and will not violate a
law applicable to either Party, including without limitation the United States
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Further, each of the Parties covenants that
neither it nor its Affiliates will make any such offer, payment, gift, promise
or authorization to for the use or benefit of any other Person where it knows
or has a firm belief, or is aware that there is a high probability that the
other Person will use such offer, payment, gift, promise or authorization for
any of the purposes described in the preceding sentence. Each Party shall
respond promptly, and in reasonable detail, to any notice from the other Party
or its auditors pertaining to the subject matter of this Section 7.14 and
shall furnish documentary support for such response upon request from such
other Party.

  

  

7.15 Further Assurances. At and after the Closing, Seller and Purchaser agree
to take such further actions and to execute, acknowledge and deliver all such
further documents as are reasonably requested by the other Party for carrying
out the purposes of this Agreement or of any document delivered pursuant to
this Agreement.

7.16 Records. Seller shall deliver the Records of the Company Group in
Seller's possession to Purchaser as promptly as practicable following the
Closing Date if such Records are not present at the Company Group on the
Closing Date (it being agreed that Seller may retain a copy thereof).

  

  

7.17 Seller's Post Closing Access to Records. Purchaser shall maintain the
Records received from Seller for seven (7) years after the Closing Date and
afford Seller reasonable access to the Records and to Purchaser's and its
Affiliates' personnel who have knowledge of the Records, and a right to copy
the Records at Seller's expense as reasonably requested by Seller. If
Purchaser desires to destroy the Records within such seven (7) year period, it
shall notify Seller prior to such destruction, and provide Seller an
opportunity to take possession of them at Seller's expense. In addition,
Purchaser shall afford Seller full access to records and data produced after
the Closing Date and reasonably requested by Seller in connection with any
post-closing settlement statement or any Dispute, claim for indemnification
hereunder, or breach of representation and warranty under this Agreement
(excluding, however, attorney work product and attorney-client communication
entitled to legal privilege) and a right to copy such records and data at
Seller's expense.

  

  

7.18 Schedule Update. From time to time prior to the Closing, Seller may at
its option supplement or amend and deliver updates to the Seller Disclosure
Schedule to include reference to any matter relating to Seller, the Company
Group or the Assets which first arises or occurs after the date of this
Agreement and does not represent a breach of Seller's covenants in this
Article 7, provided that any such supplement, amendment or update shall be
without prejudice to and shall not limit the effect of the Fundamental
Representations.

for all periods ending on or prior to the Effective Time which are filed after
the Closing Date. At the request of Purchaser, Seller shall provide to
Purchaser a copy of such Tax Returns.

  

  

(c) Straddle Tax Returns. Purchaser shall prepare or cause to be prepared in a
manner consistent with past practice (except as otherwise required by Law) and
file or cause to be filed any Tax Returns of the Company Group Members for
periods that begin before the Effective Time and end after the Effective Time
(a "Straddle Period"). Purchaser shall deliver to Seller copies of all such
Tax Returns at least thirty (30) days prior to the applicable due date for the
filing of such Tax Returns (taking into account extensions). Purchaser shall
permit Seller to review and comment on all such Tax Returns prior to filing
and shall not file any such Tax Returns without the consent of Seller, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

  

  

(i) For the purpose of this Agreement, Taxes arising in a Straddle Period
shall be allocated among the Pre-Effective Time Period and Post-Effective Time
Period as follows:

  

  

(A) In the case of Taxes arising in a Straddle Period, except as provided in
Section 8.2(c)(i)(B), the allocation of such Taxes between the Pre-Effective
Time Period and the Post-Effective Time Period portions of the Straddle Period
shall be made on the basis of an interim closing of the books as of the
Effective Time.

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

32  

  

 

 

 

   
 


 

  

(B) In the case of any Taxes that are imposed on a periodic basis (for
example, ad valorem and property taxes) and are payable for a Straddle Period,
the portion of such Taxes that relates to the Pre-Effective Time Period
portion of the Straddle Period shall be deemed to be the amount of such Tax
for the entire Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of
which is the number of days in the Pre-Effective Time Period portion of the
Straddle Period and the denominator of which is the number of days in the
entire Straddle Period. The remainder of such Taxes for the Straddle Period
shall relate to the Post-Effective Time Period.

  

  

(d) Amended Returns. Except as required by Law, Purchaser shall not amend any
Tax Return of any Company Group Member that relates to a Pre-Effective Time
Period or a Straddle Period, change any Tax accounting or Tax Return filing
procedures, or enter into any voluntary disclosure process for a Pre-Effective
Time Period or a Straddle Period, in each case, without the prior written
consent of Seller.

  

  

(e) No Closing Date Tax Actions. Neither Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates
shall cause to be made any extraordinary transaction or event on the Closing
Date that would reasonably be expected to result in any increased Tax
liability for which Seller would be required to provide indemnification
pursuant to this Agreement.

  

  

(f) Cooperation. Each of Purchaser and Seller shall provide the other Party
with such information and records and make such of its officers, directors,
employees, and agents available as may reasonably be requested by such other
Party in connection with the preparation of any Tax Return or any audit or
other proceeding with respect to any Company Group Member or the Assets. Such
cooperation and information shall include providing copies of the relevant
portions of Tax Returns, together with accompanying schedules and work papers,
relevant documents reflecting rulings and other determinations by Taxing
authorities, and relevant records concerning the ownership and Tax basis of
property, which such Party or its Affiliates may possess.

  

  

8.3 Refunds. Seller shall be entitled to retain, or receive immediate payment
from Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including, without limitation, any
Company Group Member) of, any refund or credit with respect to Taxes
(including, without limitation, refunds and credits arising by reason of
amended Tax Returns filed after the Closing Date or otherwise) with respect to
any Tax period ending at or before the Effective Time relating to any Company
Group Member. Purchaser and Seller shall equitably apportion any refund with
respect to Taxes with respect to a Straddle Period, and any credit with
respect to the Straddle Period, in accordance with the principles set forth in
Section 8.2(c)(i). Purchaser agrees to provide written notice to Seller within
ten (10) days after discovery of a right to claim any refund or credit with
respect to Taxes to which Seller is entitled and agrees to claim any such
refund on behalf of Seller as soon as reasonably possible after such
discovery.

  

  

8.4 Transfer Taxes.

  

  

(a) Except for any Taxes measured by income or capital gains of Seller,
including real property gains Tax, if any, associated with this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated, which shall be borne by Seller, Purchaser shall
be responsible for, pay, and

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

33  

  

 

 

 

   
  
 


 

  

indemnify Seller for any Transfer Taxes associated with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby. Purchaser shall promptly file all necessary
documentation and Tax Returns with respect to such Transfer Taxes and Seller
shall provide such cooperation in connection with the preparation and filing
of such documentation and Tax Returns as may be reasonably requested by
Purchaser.

  

  

(b) Except for any Taxes measured by income or capital gains of Seller,
including real property gains Tax, if any, associated with this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated, if Seller is required to pay after the Closing
any Transfer Tax, or interest or penalty thereon, associated with this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, Purchaser shall reimburse
Seller within thirty (30) days after receipt of Seller's written notice of the
payment. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary,
Purchaser releases Seller from and, except as aforesaid, shall fully protect,
defend, indemnify and hold Seller harmless from and against any and all claims
(no matter when asserted) relating to, arising out of, or connected with,
directly or indirectly, Transfer Tax resulting from or associated with
Seller's transfer of the Shares to Purchaser.

  

  

8.5 Tax Proceedings. In the event Purchaser, the Company or any Subsidiary
receives notice of any examination, claim, adjustment or other proceeding with
respect to the liability of the Company or any Subsidiary for Taxes
attributable to any period for which Seller is responsible, in whole or in
part, for Taxes under the terms of Section 8.1, Purchaser shall, within twenty
(20) days, notify Seller in writing thereof. As to any such Taxes attributable
to a period for which Seller is exclusively responsible, Seller shall be
entitled, at its expense, to control the contest or settlement of such
examination, claim, adjustment or other proceeding, provided that Seller
notifies Purchaser of its desire to control or settle such contest no later
than fifteen (15) days after receipt by Seller of such notice. If Seller does
not timely elect to control the contest or settlement of such examination,
claim, adjustment or other proceeding, Purchaser shall, at Purchaser's
expense, control or settle such contest (subject to the limitations on
settlement set forth below). Seller and Purchaser shall cooperate with each
other, and with their respective Affiliates, and will consult with each other
in the negotiation and settlement of any proceeding described in this Section
8.5 that could affect the other, and neither shall agree without the prior
written consent of the other to any settlement of any such proceeding which
could result in an increase in the amount of Taxes of the Company or any
Subsidiary for any period for which the other is responsible, in whole or in
part, for Taxes under the terms of Section 8.1. Purchaser shall provide, or
cause to be provided, to Seller and its Affiliates necessary authorizations,
including powers of attorney, to control any proceeding which Seller is
entitled to control pursuant to this Section 8.5.

TERMINATION

  

  

10.1 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to
Closing:

  

  

(a) by the mutual prior written consent of Seller and Purchaser;

  

  

(b) by either Seller or Purchaser, if Closing has not occurred on or before
April 30, 2014, provided, however, that no Party shall be entitled to
terminate this Agreement under this Section 10.1(b) if the Closing has failed
to occur because such Party failed to perform or observe in any material
respect its covenants and agreements hereunder;

  

  

(c) by either Party in accordance with Section 7.13; or

  

  

(d) by Seller if Purchaser has failed to pay the full amount of the Deposit
within ten (10) Business Days after the date hereof in accordance with Section
3.2(a).

  

  

The Party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Sections 10.1(a),
(b), or (c) shall give written notice of such termination to the other Party
hereto specifying the provision hereof pursuant to which such termination is
made.

10.2 Effect of Termination. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to

effect (except for the provisions of Sections 3.2, 5.12, 6.5, 7.2 (the last

11.1 Indemnification.

  

  

(a) From and after the Closing, Purchaser shall indemnify, defend and hold
harmless Seller from and against all Damages incurred or suffered by Seller:

  

  

(i) caused by or arising out of the activities, operations or assets of the
Company Group Members whether before, at or after the Effective Time;

  

  

(ii) caused by or arising out of or resulting from Purchaser's breach of any
of Purchaser's covenants or agreements contained in Article 7;

  

  

(iii) caused by or arising out of or resulting from any breach of any
representation or warranty made by Purchaser contained in Article 6 of this
Agreement or in the certificate delivered by Purchaser at Closing pursuant to

(iv) arising out of or relating to the preparation and submission of the
valuation report and valuation certificate, circular and other filings,
submissions and materials, and solicitation of the approvals, referred to in

even if such Damages are caused in whole or in part by the negligence (whether
sole, joint or concurrent), strict liability or other legal fault of any
Indemnified Person, but excepting in each case (x) Damages (other than in the
case of Section 11.1(a)(iv)) against which Seller would be required to
indemnify Purchaser under Section 11.1(b) at the time the Claim Notice is
presented by Seller and (y) Damages caused by the willful misconduct or fraud
of Seller.

  

  

(b) From and after the Closing, Seller shall indemnify, defend and hold
harmless Purchaser against and from all Damages incurred or suffered by
Purchaser:

  

  

(i) caused by or arising out of or resulting from Seller's breach of any of
Seller's covenants or agreements contained in Article 7;

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

37  

  

 

 

 

  

(ii) caused by or arising out of or resulting from any breach of any
representation or warranty made by Seller contained in Article 5 of this
Agreement, or in the certificate delivered by Seller at Closing pursuant to
Section 4.2(f); or

  

  

(iii) caused by or arising out of or resulting from any claim, action, suit or
proceeding by a third Person holder of a Preferential Right alleging a breach
of such Preferential Right in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement,

  

  

even if such Damages are caused in whole or in part by the negligence (whether
sole, joint or concurrent), strict liability or other legal fault of any
Indemnified Person, but excepting in each case Damages caused by the willful
misconduct or fraud of Purchaser.

  


 

  

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, this
Section 11.1 (and, as applicable, Section 11.3(e)) contains the Parties'
exclusive remedies against each other with respect to breaches of the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of the Parties contained
in Article 5, Article 6 and Article 7 (excluding the last sentence of Section
7.2, and Section 7.6, Section 7.11, Section 7.14, Section 7.16 and Section
7.17, for which specific performance, injunction and other equitable remedies
will also be available) and the affirmations of such representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements contained in the certificate delivered by
each Party at the Closing pursuant to Sections 4.2(f) or 4.3(e), as applicable
(subject to the stated exclusions, the "Exclusive Representations and
Covenants"). Except for the remedies contained in this Section 11.1 (and, as
applicable, Section 11.3(e)), and any other remedies available to the Parties
at law or in equity for breaches of the provisions of this Agreement other
than the Exclusive Representations and Covenants, Seller and Purchaser each
release, remise and forever discharge the other and its or their Affiliates
and all such Parties' officers, directors, employees, agents, advisors and
representatives from any and all suits, legal or administrative proceedings,
claims, demands, damages, losses, costs, liabilities, interest, or causes of
action whatsoever, in law or in equity, known or unknown, which such Parties
might now or subsequently may have, based on, relating to or arising out of
this Agreement, Seller's ownership of the Shares, the activities, operations
or assets of the Company Group, whether before or after the Effective Time, or
the use, condition, quality, status or nature of the Assets, including,
without limitation, rights to contribution under any Law, breaches of
statutory or implied warranties, nuisance or other tort actions, rights to
punitive damages and rights of contribution, rights under agreements between
any Company Group Member and Seller or any Affiliates of Seller, and rights
under insurance maintained by Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than the
Company Group), even if caused in whole or in part by the negligence (whether
sole, joint or concurrent), strict liability or other legal fault of any
released Person.

  

  

(d) Sections 11.1(a), 11.1(b), 11.1(e), 11.3(c) and 11.3(d) shall not apply to
the indemnities in Article 8, and provided without limiting the preceding that
there shall be no duplication of remedies for the same liability, loss, cost,
expense, claim, award or judgment between this Article 11 and Article 8. This
Article 11 shall not apply to matters with respect to and to the extent for
which an adjustment to the Purchase Price is made under Section 3.3 (including
the adjustment for breach of Section 5.8(a) as described in Section 11.3(e)
below).

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

38  

  

 

 

 

  

(e) "Damages," for purposes of this Article 11, shall mean the amount of any
actual liability, loss, cost, expense, claim, award or judgment incurred or
suffered by any Indemnified Person arising out of or resulting from the
indemnified matter, whether attributable to personal injury or death, property
damage, contract claims (including contractual indemnity claims), torts, or
otherwise, including the costs of enforcement of the indemnity and, in the
case of Third Party Claims but not other indemnification claims, (i)
reasonable fees and expenses of attorneys, consultants, accountants or other
agents and experts reasonably incident to matters indemnified against, and
(ii) the costs of investigation and/or monitoring of such matters. No
Indemnified Person shall be entitled to indemnification under this Section
11.1 for, and "Damages" shall not include, (A) loss of profits, whether direct
or consequential, or other consequential damages suffered by the Party
claiming indemnification, or any punitive damages (other than loss of profits,
consequential damages or punitive damages claimed by Persons other than
Indemnified Persons for which an Indemnified Person has been held liable, to
the extent such liability was not caused by the fraud or willful misconduct of
the Indemnified Person), (B) any Taxes that may be assessed on payments made
under this Article 11 or the loss, reduction or limitation of any Tax benefits
to which the Indemnified Person may be entitled (nor shall any offset be made
for Tax benefits to which the Indemnified Person becomes entitled as a
consequence of the liability, loss, cost, expense, claim, award or judgment),
and (C) any liability, loss, cost, expense, claim, award or judgment to the
extent resulting from or to the extent increased by the actions or omissions
of any Indemnified Person after the Closing Date.

  

  

(f) The indemnity in favor of each Party provided in this Section 11.1 shall
be for the benefit of and extend to such Party's present and former Affiliates
(and, with respect to the indemnity in Section 11.1(b)(iii), shall be for the
benefit of and extend to the Company Group Members becoming Purchaser's
Affiliates following Closing) and its and their directors, officers,
employees, and agents. Any claim for indemnity under this Section 11.1 by any
such Affiliate, director, officer, employee, or agent must be brought and
administered by a Party to this Agreement. No Indemnified Person other than
Seller and Purchaser shall have any rights against either Seller or Purchaser
under the terms of this Section 11.1 except as may be exercised on its behalf
by Purchaser or Seller, as applicable, pursuant to this Section 11.1(f).
Seller and Purchaser may each elect to exercise or not exercise
indemnification rights under this Section on behalf of the other Indemnified
Person affiliated with it in its sole discretion and shall have no liability
to any such other Indemnified Person for any action or inaction under this
Section.

  

  

(g) In addition to the other limitations set forth in this Agreement and
notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, with respect to
any Damages (i) relating to any breach of any representation or warranty set
forth in Section 5.15; or (ii) otherwise arising out of or relating to
Environmental Laws ("Environmental Damages"), Seller shall have no obligation
to indemnify, defend or hold harmless Purchaser for any Environmental Damage
(A) that arises out of a Third Party Claim that is instigated or encouraged by
Purchaser, its successors or assigns or their respective Affiliates, agents or
representatives; (B) that would not have arisen but for any intrusive
investigation or any disclosure to a third Person (including a Governmental
Body) by or on behalf of Purchaser, its successors or assigns or their
respective Affiliates, agents or representatives, except to the extent such
investigation or disclosure was required by applicable Environmental Laws; (C)
to the extent such Environmental Damage exceeds the cost of implementing the
least restrictive standard or remedy that complies with applicable
Environmental Laws (including, where applicable, engineering or institutional
controls or any less stringent standards or remedies resulting from site
specific risk assessments) based on an industrial use of the relevant facility
or property; and (D) to the extent that Purchaser, its successors, assigns or
their respective Affiliates, agents or representatives or any other Person
after Closing contributed to or exacerbated the condition or circumstance
forming the basis of such Environmental Damage.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

39  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(h) The Parties shall treat, for Tax purposes, any amounts paid under this
Article 11 as an adjustment to the Purchase Price.

  

  

11.2 Indemnification Actions. All claims for indemnification under Section
11.1 or Section 7.8 shall be asserted and resolved as follows:

  

  

(a) For purposes of this Article 11, the term "Indemnifying Person" when used
in connection with particular Damages shall mean the Person or Persons having
an obligation to indemnify another Person or Persons with respect to such
Damages pursuant to this Article 11, and the term "Indemnified Person" when
used in connection with particular Damages shall mean the Person or Persons
having the right to be indemnified with respect to such Damages by another
Person or Persons pursuant to this Article 11.

  

  

(b) To make a claim for indemnification under Section 11.1, an Indemnified
Person shall notify the Indemnifying Person of its claim under this Section
11.2 in writing, including the specific details of and specific basis under
this Agreement for its claim (the "Claim Notice"). In the event that the claim
for indemnification is based upon a claim by a third Person against the
Indemnified Person (a "Third Party Claim"), the Indemnified Person shall
provide its Claim Notice promptly after the Indemnified Person has actual
knowledge of the Third Party Claim and shall enclose a copy of all papers (if
any) served with respect to the Third Party Claim; provided that the failure
of any Indemnified Person to give notice of a Third Party Claim as provided in
this Section 11.2 shall not relieve the Indemnifying Person of its obligations
under Section 11.1 except to the extent such failure results in insufficient
time being available to permit the Indemnifying Person to effectively defend
against the Third Party Claim or otherwise prejudices the Indemnifying
Person's ability to defend against the Third Party Claim. In the event that
the claim for indemnification is based upon an inaccuracy or breach of a
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement, the Claim Notice shall
specify the representation, warranty, covenant or agreement which was
inaccurate or breached.

  

  

(c) In the case of a claim for indemnification based upon a Third Party Claim,
the Indemnifying Person shall have thirty (30) days from its receipt of the
Claim Notice to notify the Indemnified Person whether it admits or denies its
obligation to defend the Indemnified Person against such Third Party Claim
under this Article 11. If the Indemnifying Person does not notify the
Indemnified Person within such thirty (30) day period whether the Indemnifying
Person admits or denies its obligation to defend the Indemnified Person, it
shall be conclusively deemed obligated to provide such indemnification
hereunder. The Indemnified Person is authorized, prior to and during such
thirty (30) day period, to file any motion, answer or other pleading that it
shall deem necessary or appropriate to protect its interests or those of the
Indemnifying Person and that is not prejudicial to the Indemnifying Person.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

40  

  

 

 

 

  

(d) If the Indemnifying Person admits its obligation, it shall have the right
and obligation to diligently defend, at its sole cost and expense, the Third
Party Claim, and shall have full control of such defense and proceedings,
including any compromise or settlement thereof, provided that if the Third
Party Claim consists of a criminal proceeding or regulatory proceeding with
potential criminal sanctions by any Governmental Body against the Indemnified
Person, the Indemnified Person shall have the option, by notice to the
Indemnifying Person within the thirty (30) day period set forth in Section
11.2(c), to control such defense and proceedings. If requested by the
Indemnifying Person, the Indemnified Person agrees to cooperate in contesting
any Third Party Claim which the Indemnifying Person elects to contest
(provided, however, that the Indemnified Person shall not be required to bring
any counterclaim or cross-complaint against any Person). The Indemnified
Person may at its own expense participate in, but not control, any defense or
settlement of any Third Party Claim controlled by the Indemnifying Person
pursuant to this Section 11.2(d). An Indemnifying Person shall not, without
the written consent of the Indemnified Person, settle any Third Party Claim or
consent to the entry of any judgment with respect thereto which (i) does not
result in a final resolution of the Indemnified Person's liability with
respect to the Third Party Claim (including, in the case of a settlement, an
unconditional written release of the Indemnified Person from all further
liability with respect to the Third Party Claim) or (ii) may materially and
adversely affect the Indemnified Person (other than as a result of money
damages covered by the indemnity).

  

  

(e) If the Indemnifying Person does not admit its obligation or admits its
obligation but fails to diligently defend or settle the Third Party Claim,
then the Indemnified Person shall have the right to defend against the Third
Party Claim (at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Person, if the
Indemnified Person is entitled to indemnification hereunder), with counsel of
the Indemnified Person's choosing, subject to the right of the Indemnifying
Person to admit its obligation and assume the defense of the Third Party Claim
at any time prior to settlement or final determination thereof. If the
Indemnifying Person has not yet admitted its obligation to provide
indemnification with respect to a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Person
shall send written notice to the Indemnifying Person of any proposed
settlement and the Indemnifying Person shall have the option for ten (10) days
following receipt of such notice to (i) admit in writing its obligation to
provide indemnification with respect to the Third Party Claim and (ii) if its
obligation is so admitted, assume the defense of the Third Party Claim and
reject the proposed settlement. If the Indemnified Person settles any Third
Party Claim, other than a Third Party Claim consisting of a criminal
proceeding or regulatory proceeding with potential criminal sanctions by any
Governmental Body against the Indemnified Person, over the objection of the
Indemnifying Person after the Indemnifying Person has timely admitted its
obligation in writing and assumed the defense of a Third Party Claim, the
Indemnified Person shall be deemed to have waived any right to indemnity
therefor.

  

  

(f) In the case of a claim for indemnification not based upon a Third Party
Claim, the Indemnifying Person shall have thirty (30) days from its receipt of
the Claim Notice to (i) cure the Damages complained of, (ii) admit its
obligation to provide indemnification with respect to such Damages or (iii)
dispute the claim for such Damages. If the Indemnifying Person does not notify
the Indemnified Person within such thirty (30) day period that it has cured
the Damages or that it disputes the claim for such Damages, the Indemnifying
Person shall be conclusively deemed obligated to provide such indemnification
hereunder.

11.3 Limitation on Actions.

  

  

(a) The representations and warranties of the Parties in Article 5 and Article
6 (other than the Fundamental Representations and the representations and
warranties in Section 5.14) and the covenants and agreements of the Parties in
Sections 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4, 7.5, 7.7, 7.12, 7.16, and 7.18 and the
corresponding representations and warranties given in the certificates
delivered at the Closing pursuant to Sections 4.2(f) and 4.3(e), as
applicable, shall survive the Closing for a period of one (1) year (unless a
shorter period is expressly provided within the applicable section), except
that the representations and warranties in Section 5.15 shall survive closing
for a period of eighteen (18) months. The Fundamental Representations, the
representations and warranties of Seller in Section 5.14, and the
corresponding representations and warranties given in the certificates
delivered at the Closing pursuant to Sections 4.2(f) and 4.3(e), as
applicable, shall survive the Closing indefinitely. The remainder of this
Agreement shall survive the Closing without time limit except as may otherwise
be expressly provided herein. Representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements shall be of no further force and effect after the date of their
expiration, provided that there shall be no termination of any bona fide claim
asserted pursuant to this Agreement with respect to such a representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement prior to its expiration date.

  

  

(b) The indemnities in Section 8.1 and Sections 11.1(a)(i), 11.1(a)(iv) and
11.1(b)(iii) shall continue without time limit. The indemnities in Sections
11.1(a)(ii), 11.1(a)(iii), 11.1(b)(i) and 11.1(b)(ii) shall terminate as of
the termination date of each respective representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement that is subject to indemnification thereunder, except in each case
as to matters for which a specific written claim for indemnity has been
delivered to the Indemnifying Person on or before such termination date.

  

  

(c) Seller shall not have any liability for any indemnification under Sections
11.1(b)(i) or 11.1(b)(ii): (i) for any Damages with respect to any occurrence,
claim, award or judgment that do not individually exceed $500,000 (the
"Individual Claim Threshold"); or (ii) unless and until the aggregate Damages
for which Claim Notices for claims meeting the Individual Claim Threshold are
delivered by Purchaser exceed $13,470,000, and then only to the extent such
Damages exceed $13,470,000, provided that this Section 11.3(c) shall not limit
Seller's liability with respect to any claims under (A) Section 11.1(b)(i) for
any breach by Seller of Section 7.4(g), (B) Section 11.1(b)(ii) for any breach
by Seller of a Fundamental Representation or Section 5.31, or (C) for the
avoidance of doubt, Section 11.1(b)(iii).

  

  

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
Seller shall not collectively be required to indemnify Purchaser under this
Article 11 for aggregate Damages in excess of $179,600,000, provided that this
Section 11.3(d) shall not limit Seller's liability with respect to any claims
under (i) Section 11.1(b)(ii) for any breach by Seller of a Fundamental
Representation or (ii) Section 11.1(b)(iii).

  

  

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
sole remedy for Seller's breach of its representation and warranty in Section
5.8(a) shall be the adjustment to the Purchase Price provided in Section
3.3(a).

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

42  

  

 

 

 

  

(f) The amount of any Damages for which an Indemnified Person is entitled to
indemnity under this Article 11 shall be reduced by the amount of insurance or
indemnification proceeds realized by the Indemnified Person or its Affiliates
with respect to such Damages (net of any collection costs, and excluding the
proceeds of any insurance policy issued or underwritten, or indemnity granted,
by the Indemnified Person or its Affiliates).

  

  

(g) Any Indemnified Person that becomes aware of a loss for which it seeks
indemnification shall be required to use commercially reasonable efforts to
mitigate the loss, including taking any actions reasonably requested by the
Indemnifying Party, and an Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any loss
to the extent that it is attributable to the Indemnified Party's failure to
use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate.

  

  

(h) In no event shall any Indemnified Person be entitled to duplicate
compensation with respect to the same Damage, liability, loss, cost, expense,
claim, award or judgment under more than one provision of this Agreement and
the various documents delivered in connection with the Closing.

  

  

(i) Seller shall not have any liability for any breach of Sections 5.13, 5.15,
5.16, 5.17, 5.18, 5.19, 5.20, 5.21, 5.22, 5.23, 5.28, 5.29, 5.31 or 7.1(a) of
this Agreement or the corresponding representation, warranty or covenant given
in any certificate relating hereto delivered by or on behalf of Seller if
Purchaser as an existing owner or operator of an interest in properties
comprising the Assets had knowledge of the facts causing such breach as of the
date of execution of this Agreement.

  

  

(j) Purchaser shall not have any liability for any indemnification under (i)
Section 11.1(a)(ii) for any breach by Purchaser of Section 7.3 or 7.5 or (ii)
Section 11.1(a)(iii) for any breach by Purchaser of Section 6.4, 6.5, 6.6 or
6.10: (A) for any Damages with respect to any occurrence, claim, award or
judgment that do not individually exceed the Individual Claim Threshold; or
(B) unless and until the aggregate Damages for which Claim Notices for claims
meeting the Individual Claim Threshold are delivered by Seller exceed
$13,470,000, and then only to the extent such Damages exceed $13,470,000.

  

  

(k) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
Purchaser shall not collectively be required to indemnify Seller under (i)
Section 11.1(a)(ii) for any breach by Purchaser of Section 7.3 or 7.5 or (ii)
Section 11.1(a)(iii) for any breach by Purchaser of Section 6.4, 6.5, 6.6 or
6.10 for aggregate Damages in excess of $179,600,000.

45  

  

 

 

 

  

12.4 Governing Law. The laws of the State of Texas (without giving effect to
its conflicts of laws principles) govern all matters arising out of or
relating to this Agreement, including its validity, interpretation,
construction, performance and enforcement.

  

  

12.5 Arbitration.

  

  

 

(a) The Parties shall attempt to resolve any Dispute promptly by negotiation
between representatives who have authority to settle the Dispute. Either Party
may give the other Party written notice (a "Dispute Notice") of any Dispute
not resolved in the normal course of business. Within twenty (20) days after
delivery of the Dispute Notice, the receiving Party shall submit to the other
Party a written response. The Dispute Notice and response shall include (i) a
statement of that Party's position and a summary of arguments supporting that
position, and (ii) the name and title of that Party's representative and of
any other Person who will accompany the representative. Within thirty (30)
days after delivery of the Dispute Notice, the representatives of both Parties
shall meet at a mutually acceptable time and place, and thereafter continue to
meet as often as they reasonably deem necessary, to use their good faith and
reasonable efforts to attempt to resolve the Dispute. All negotiations
pursuant to this clause shall be confidential and shall be treated as
compromise and settlement negotiations for purposes of applicable rules of
evidence.

  

  

(b) If a Dispute has not been resolved within sixty (60) days after delivery
of a Dispute Notice pursuant to Section 12.5(a), then either Party (the
"Claimant") may submit such Dispute in writing (the "Initiation Request") to
binding arbitration in accordance with the LCIA Arbitration Rules then in
effect (the "LCIA Rules").

  

  

(c) The arbitration will be conducted before a panel that shall consist of two
(2) Party-appointed arbitrators, one (1) appointed by each Party, and a third
neutral arbitrator who shall chair the panel. Unless expressly provided
otherwise in this Agreement, arbitrators must be lawyers having not less than
ten (10) years experience in merger and acquisition transactions. No
arbitrator may be a current or former employee of a Party or any of its
Affiliates. The Claimant shall name its appointed arbitrator in the Initiation
Request. The other Party shall select its arbitrator and notify the Claimant
and LCIA of its selection within thirty (30) days of receipt of the Initiation
Request. The two (2) Party-appointed arbitrators so chosen shall select a
third arbitrator. If either Party fails to appoint its Party-appointed
arbitrator within the time permitted or the two (2) Party-appointed
arbitrators are unable to agree on a third arbitrator within thirty (30) days
from the date the second arbitrator has been appointed, then, at either
Party's request, the missing arbitrator shall be selected by the LCIA, with
due regard given to the selection criteria above and input from the Parties
and other arbitrators. The LCIA shall select any missing arbitrator not later
than ninety (90) days from the date of the Initiation Request. If any
arbitrator should die, withdraw or otherwise become incapable of serving, a
successor arbitrator shall be appointed in the same manner as the original
arbitrator.

  

  

(d) The arbitration shall proceed under the LCIA Rules. The arbitrators may,
in their discretion, limit or expand discovery in any arbitration proceeding.
Unless the Parties otherwise agree, the arbitrators shall require witnesses to
testify under oath or affirmation and witnesses shall be subject to cross-
examination. The arbitrators' award shall be in writing and shall be a
reasoned award. The Parties expressly covenant and agree to be bound by the
award of the arbitrators as a final determination of the matter in dispute,
and a judgment thereon may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.
In rendering an award, the arbitrators shall abide by (i) the terms and
conditions of this Agreement and (ii) the Laws of the State of Texas. The
arbitrators shall not have jurisdiction or authority to add to, detract from
or alter in any way the provisions of this Agreement. The arbitrators may
award equitable relief, such as specific performance, as well as monetary
damages for any Party's breach of such Party's obligations under this
Agreement, but in no event may the arbitrators award consequential, punitive
or exemplary damages. If the LCIA Rules are in conflict with this Section
12.5, the provisions of this Section 12.5 shall prevail.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

46  

  

 

 

 

  

(e) The legal seat of the arbitration and the hearing shall be in London,
England and the language to be used in the arbitration proceedings will be
English.

  

  

(f) Legal professional privilege, including privileges protecting attorney-
client communications and attorney work product of each Party from compelled
disclosure or use in evidence, legal advice privilege and litigation
privilege, as recognized by the Laws governing each Party's relationship with
its counsel, shall apply to and be binding in any proceeding conducted under
this Section 12.5.

  

  

(g) Each Party, as to itself (and, as to its Affiliates that are beneficiaries
of or bound by the terms of this Agreement) and its (and their) assets, hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally waives any right of immunity and agrees not to
claim or assert any immunity with respect to this Agreement, whether arising
by statute or otherwise, which it may have or may subsequently acquire,
including immunity from legal process (including service of process or notice,
pre-judgment or pre-award attachment, attachment in aid of execution, or
otherwise), immunity from jurisdiction or judgment of any court, arbitrator or
tribunal (including any objection or claim on the basis of inconvenient
forum), and immunity from enforcement or execution of any award of judgment or
any other remedy.

  

  

(h) The arbitration panel may apportion the costs of arbitration between the
Parties in such manner as it deems reasonable, taking into account the
circumstances of the Dispute, the conduct of the Parties and the result of
arbitration. The arbitration panel shall be empowered and directed to enter an
award by default against any Party to the arbitration who declines to pay when
required by the arbitration panel its share of such fees and costs. In
addition, the arbitration panel, shall be entitled to award to a Party such
Party's reasonable attorneys' fees and expert fees, as determined by the
arbitration panel considering those factors mentioned in the first sentence of
this Section 12.5(h), incurred in connection with such Party's preparation for
and participation in the arbitration.

  

  

(i) All aspects of the arbitration shall be confidential, and the Parties and
arbitrators shall maintain the confidentiality of all information related to
the proceedings, including but not limited to discovery, testimony and other
evidence, briefs and the award, and shall not disclose the same to any Person
except as expressly authorized in this Section. Upon motion of either Party,
and for good cause shown, the arbitrators may make any order justice requires
to protect a Party from the disclosure of proprietary, privileged or
confidential business information, including that depositions, exhibits and
other documents filed with the arbitrators or transcripts of the hearing be
sealed and not be disclosed except as specified by the arbitrators.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Party shall be entitled to disclose such
information (i) to its Affiliates and its and their directors, officers,
employees, agents and attorneys, (ii) to financial or lending institutions,
outside auditors, insurers, and entities involved in negotiation or bidding
for the acquisition of a Party or its Affiliates or any of its or their
assets, provided that such Person is bound by a written agreement to keep such
information confidential, (iii) as may be required by Law or by the rules of
any stock exchange applicable to such Person or its Affiliates, or as part of
such Party's or its Affiliates' good faith effort to comply with disclosure
obligations under any of the same, or (iv) as may be necessary or desirable to
enforce such Party's rights hereunder.

  

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

47  

  

 

 

 

   
 

(j) To the extent permitted by law, each Party waives any right to appeal or
challenge any arbitral decision or award, or to oppose enforcement of any such
decision or award, or to refer any question of law or fact, before any court
or governmental authority. Without prejudice to the foregoing, each Party
agrees to exclude any right to appeal any question of law to the courts of
England under Sections 45 or 69 of the United Kingdom Arbitration Act of 1996.
The Parties further waive the application of (i) Article 22.1(g) of the LCIA
Rules (regarding the power of an arbitral tribunal to order correction of a
contract), (ii) Article 25.1(a) of the LCIA Rules (regarding the power of the
arbitral tribunal to order respondent parties to provide security for claims),
and (iii) Article 25.1(c) of the LCIA Rules, but only to the extent that that
Article would allow the arbitral tribunal to order a provisional payment of
money from one Party to the other prior to the award.

  

    

(k) Following delivery of the Dispute Notice, and prior to the appointment of
all arbitrators, nothing contained herein shall prevent a Party from applying
to a court that would otherwise have jurisdiction for provisional or interim
measures. After the arbitrators have been appointed, they shall have sole
jurisdiction to hear such applications, except that any measure ordered by the
arbitrators may be immediately and specifically enforced by a court otherwise
having jurisdiction over the Parties.

 

  

  

12.6 Captions. The captions in this Agreement are for convenience only and
shall not be considered a part of or affect the construction or interpretation
of any provision of this Agreement.

  

  

12.7 Waivers. Any failure by any Party or Parties to comply with any of its or
their obligations, agreements or conditions herein contained may be waived by
the Party or Parties to whom such compliance is owed by an instrument signed
by such Party or Parties and expressly identified as a waiver, but not in any
other manner. No waiver of, or consent to a change in, any of the provisions
of this Agreement shall be deemed or shall constitute a waiver of, or consent
to a change in, other provisions hereof (whether or not similar), nor shall
such waiver constitute a continuing waiver unless otherwise expressly
provided.

  

  

12.8 Assignment.

  

  

(a) Subject to Section 12.8(b) and Section 12.8(c), no Party shall assign all
or any part of this Agreement, nor shall any Party assign or delegate any of
its rights or duties hereunder, without the prior written consent of the other
Party, and any assignment or delegation made without such consent shall be
void. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure
to the benefit of the Parties hereto and their respective successors and
assigns.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

48  

  

 

 

 

  

(b) Purchaser shall be entitled to assign or delegate all of its rights and
duties under this Agreement to any direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary
Affiliate of Purchaser (a "Nominated Affiliate"), provided that, in the event
of such assignment or delegation, Purchaser shall remain liable for all of its
duties, liabilities and obligations under this Agreement, and Purchaser hereby
guarantees to Seller the performance by such Nominated Affiliate of all such
duties, liabilities and obligations, until such time as Seller consents
otherwise in writing.

  

  

(c) With the prior written approval of Seller, which Seller may withhold in
its sole discretion, Purchaser (and any Nominated Affiliate) shall be entitled
to assign or delegate all of its rights under this Agreement to a Person who
has a Malaysian credit rating of BBB or is listed on a recognized stock
exchange with a market capitalization of not less than US$1,000,000,000.

  

  

12.9 Entire Agreement. The Confidentiality Agreements, this Agreement and the
documents to be executed hereunder and the Exhibits, Attachments and Schedules
attached hereto constitute the entire agreement between the Parties pertaining
to the subject matter hereof, and supersede all prior agreements,
understandings, negotiations and discussions, whether oral or written, of the
Parties pertaining to the subject matter hereof.

  

  

12.10 Amendment. This Agreement may be amended or modified only by an
agreement in writing executed by all Parties and expressly identified as an
amendment or modification.

  

  

12.11 Rights of Third Persons. Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied,
shall entitle any Person other than the Parties to any claim, cause of action,
remedy or right of any kind, excepting those Persons expressly entitled to
indemnification pursuant to Section 7.8 or Section 11.1(f). The Parties
reserve the right to rescind, waive or vary the terms of this Agreement
without notice to or the consent of any such third Person, even if, as a
result, such third Person's right to enforce a term hereof will be varied or
extinguished.

  

  

12.12 References. In this Agreement:

12.13 Construction. Purchaser is a party capable of making such investigation,
inspection, review and evaluation of the Company and the Shares as a prudent
purchaser would deem appropriate under the circumstances including with
respect to all matters relating to the value, operation and suitability of the
assets of the Company Group. Seller and Purchaser have had the opportunity to
exercise business discretion in relation to the negotiation of the details of
the transaction contemplated hereby. This Agreement is the result of
arm's-length negotiations from equal bargaining positions. Based on the
foregoing, any rule of construction that a contract be construed against the
drafter shall not apply to the interpretation or construction of this
Agreement.

  

  

12.14 Limitation on Damages; Specific Performance.

  

  

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
except in connection with (i) breach of Section 7.6 or the confidentiality
obligations in Section 7.2, in each case occurring prior to Closing, and (ii)
any such damages claimed by Persons other than the Parties or their Affiliates
for which indemnification is available under the terms of this Agreement, none
of Purchaser, Seller or any of their respective Affiliates shall be entitled
to consequential, punitive or exemplary damages in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and, except as otherwise
provided in this sentence, Purchaser and Seller, for themselves and on behalf
of their Affiliates, hereby expressly waive any right to consequential,
punitive or exemplary damages in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby.

  

  

(b) The Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that
any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed by Purchaser in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached by Purchaser.
The Parties accordingly agree that, prior to the termination of this Agreement
pursuant to Section 10.1, in addition to any other remedy to which Seller is
entitled at law or in equity, Seller is entitled to injunctive relief to
prevent breaches of this Agreement by Purchaser and otherwise to enforce
specifically the provisions of this Agreement against Purchaser.
