THE MERGER

 

 

1.1 The Merger. (a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in this Agreement, and in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the
State of Delaware (the "DGCL"), at the Effective Time MergerCo shall merge
with and into the Company. As a result of the Merger, the separate corporate
existence of MergerCo shall cease and the Company shall continue as the

the "Surviving Company").


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) Parent, MergerCo and the Company may at any time mutually agree to change
the method of effecting the business combination, including by entering into
an appropriate amendment to this Agreement (to the extent such amendment only
changes the method of effecting the business combination and does not
substantively affect this Agreement or the rights and obligations of the
parties or their respective stockholders hereunder); provided, however, that
the business combination shall be effected through a triangular merger
structure and, further provided, that no such change shall (i) alter or
change the amount or kind of the Merger Consideration (as defined in Section
2.1(a)) provided for in this Agreement or (ii) materially impede or delay
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

 

1.2 Closing. The closing of the Merger (the "Closing") shall take place

Law) waiver of the conditions set forth in Article 8 (other than those
conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the satisfaction or, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
waiver of those conditions), at the offices of Fasken Martineau DuMoulin LLP,
333 Bay Street, Suite 2400, Toronto, Ontario M5H 2T6, Canada, unless another

Date".

 

 

1.3 Effective Time. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, at the
time of the Closing, the parties shall cause the Merger to be consummated by
filing with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware a certificate of
merger (the "Certificate of Merger"), in such form as required by, and
executed and acknowledged by the parties in accordance with, the relevant
provisions of the DGCL, and shall make all other filings or recordings
required under the DGCL in connection with the Merger. The Merger shall
become effective upon the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at such later time as Parent
and the Company shall agree and shall specify in the Certificate of Merger
(the time at which the Merger becomes effective being hereinafter referred to
as the "Effective Time").

 

 

1.4  Effects of the Merger. The Merger shall have the effects set forth
herein and in the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all
the property, rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises of the
Company and MergerCo shall vest in the Surviving Company, and all debts,
liabilities and duties of the Company and MergerCo shall become the debts,
liabilities and duties of the Surviving Company.

1.5 Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws.

 

 

(a) At the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving
Company, shall, subject to Section 7.8 hereof, be amended in its entirety to
contain the provisions set forth in the certificate of incorporation of
MergerCo, attached hereto as Exhibit B, except that the name of the Surviving
Company may be changed at the Effective Time.

 

 

(b) At the Effective Time, the by-laws of the Surviving Company, shall,
subject to Section 7.8 hereof, be amended in their entirety to contain the
provisions set forth in the by-laws of MergerCo, attached hereto as Exhibit

Effective Time, until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by
applicable Law (subject to Section 7.8(a)).

 

 

1.6 Directors of the Surviving Company. The directors of MergerCo immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Company
until the earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective
successors are duly elected and qualified, as the case may be.

 

 

1.7 Officers of the Surviving Company. The officers of MergerCo immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial officers of the Surviving
Company, each to hold office until the earlier of their resignation or

1.8 Company Director Designee.

 

 

(a) Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause one of the
nominees proposed by the Company (the "Company Director Designee") to be
appointed to the Parent board of directors promptly after the Effective Time.
If the Company Director Designee cannot be appointed to the Parent board of
directors promptly after the Effective Time, then the Company Director
Designee shall be granted observer status at Parent board of
directors meetings that occur at any time following the Effective Time and
prior to the earlier of (i) the date on which the Company Director Designee
is appointed to the Parent board of directors and (ii) the annual general
meeting of Parent stockholders to be held in 2011. Subject to applicable Law
and subject to the Company Director Designee's execution of a
confidentiality agreement acceptable to Parent, acting reasonably, and his
compliance with Parent's insider trading, corporate governance and disclosure
policies, during such time period Parent shall cause to be delivered to the
Company Director Designee all information distributed to regular
board members. Following the Closing, the nominating and
corporate governance committee of Parent's board of directors, or such
successor committee with comparable responsibilities, shall, if deemed
advisable by such committee, nominate the Company Director Designee for
election, or re-election, as the case may be, for the position of director at
each of the 2011 and 2012 annual general meetings of Parent stockholders
following the Closing.

 

 

ARTICLE 2

 

EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK AND OTHER SECURITIES

 

OF THE CONSTITUENT CORPORATIONS

 

 

2.1 Effect on the Company Capital Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, MergerCo, the
Company or the holder of any of the following securities:


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

\- 3 -  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(a)  Subject to Section 3.2(d), each share of the common stock of the
Company (including all Company Restricted Stock (as defined herein)) issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time ("Company Common
Stock"), except for shares of Company Common Stock owned by Parent, MergerCo
or the Company, shall be converted into the right to receive (i) 0.5209 (the
"Exchange Ratio") validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable common shares
("Parent Common Shares") of Parent, and (ii) US$0.79 in cash. Such number of
Parent Common Shares, as may be adjusted in Section 2.1(b), and $0.79 in cash
being the "Merger Consideration". The Merger Consideration was derived from
the volume weighted average closing price of Parent Common Shares on the NYSE
for the 10 trading days prior to September 27, 2010.

 

 

(b) All of the shares of Company Common Stock converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Article 2 shall no longer
be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist
as of the Effective Time, and each certificate representing any such shares
of Company Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time (each a
"Certificate") shall thereafter represent only the right to receive (i) the
Merger Consideration and (ii) cash in lieu of fractional shares into which
the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificate have been
converted pursuant to this Section 2.1 and Section 3.2(d) upon surrender of
such Certificate in accordance with Section 3.2, without interest. The right
of any holder of a Certificate to receive the Merger Consideration and cash
in lieu of any fractional shares payable pursuant to Section 3.2(d) shall, to
the extent provided in Section 3.3, be subject to and reduced by the amount
of any withholding that is required under applicable Tax Law.

 

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at the
Effective Time, all shares of Company Common Stock that are owned by the
Company, Parent or MergerCo shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist and
no Parent Common Shares or other consideration shall be delivered in exchange
therefor.


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

\- 4 -  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2.2   Effect on Securities Exercisable for or Convertible into Company
Common Stock.

 

 

(a) Company Stock Options. Effective as of the Effective Time, each
then outstanding option to purchase shares of Company Common Stock (each a
"Company Stock Option") pursuant to the equity-based compensation plan
identified on Section 4.16(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter (the "Company
Stock Plan") and the award agreements evidencing the grants thereunder shall
be assumed, subject to approval by the Toronto Stock Exchange ("TSX") and New
York Stock Exchange ("NYSE"), by Parent and shall thereafter be exercisable
to purchase a number of Parent Common Shares (an "Assumed Stock Option")
equal to (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such
Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by
(ii) the Conversion Number (rounded down to the nearest whole share); at a
per share exercise price for Parent Common Shares issuable upon the exercise
of such Assumed Stock Option equal to (i) the exercise price per share of
Company Common Stock at which such Company Stock Option was
exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by (ii) the
Conversion number (rounded up to the nearest whole cent); provided, however,
that the exercise price and the number of Parent Common Shares purchasable
pursuant to the Assumed Stock Options shall be subject to such adjustments as
may be necessary for the foregoing conversion to satisfy the requirements of
Sections 409A, 422 and 424 of the Code and Treasury regulations thereunder.
For purposes of this Agreement, the "Conversion Number" shall be equal to the
fraction (x) having a numerator equal to the per share Merger Consideration
(valuing the stock portion of the per share Merger Consideration at the
Measurement Price thereof (as defined below)), and (y) having a denominator
equal to the average of the closing sale prices of the Parent Common Shares
(in U.S. dollars) as quoted by the NYSE for each of the five
consecutive trading days immediately preceding the Effective Time (as
reported by Bloomberg LP for each such trading day, or, if not reported by
Bloomberg LP, any other authoritative source reasonably selected by Parent
(the "Measurement Price"). Except as specifically provided herein, following
the Effective Time, each Assumed Stock Option shall continue to be governed
by the same terms and conditions as set forth in the Company Stock Plan and
any agreements thereunder as were applicable immediately prior to the
Effective Time, provided, however, that each Assumed Stock Option shall be
amended or modified to provide that following termination of employment (or
termination of the consulting or other contractual relationship pursuant to
which the holder of an Assumed Stock Option was granted such Assumed Stock
Option), such Assumed Stock Option shall be exercisable until the earlier of
(i) the 180th day from the date of such termination and (ii) the date of the
expiration of the original option term, and such Assumed Stock Option shall
thereafter expire and be cancelled and shall no longer entitle the holder or
any former holder thereof to any rights whatsoever. Upon the exercise of any
Assumed Stock Option, the Parent Common Shares shall be registered and freely
tradable under applicable Canadian and United States securities Laws (subject
to any restrictions imposed by applicable Law on control persons or
affiliates). In addition to the foregoing, Parent shall assume the Company
Stock Plan, and the number and kind of shares available for issuance under
the Company Stock Plan shall be converted into Parent Common Shares in
accordance with the provisions of the Company Stock Plan. Promptly following
the date of this Agreement, the Company shall deliver written notice to each
holder of a Company Stock Option informing such holder of the effect of the
Merger on the Company Stock Options.

 

 

(b) Company Warrants. Effective as of the Effective Time, each
then outstanding warrant to purchase shares of Company Common Stock (each a
"Company Warrant"), shall be assumed, subject to approval by the TSX and
NYSE, by Parent and, in accordance with the terms thereof, shall thereafter
be exercisable to purchase a number of Parent Common Shares (each, an
"Assumed Warrant") equal to (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to such Company Warrant immediately prior to the Effective Time
multiplied by (ii) the Conversion Number (rounded down to the nearest whole
share); and the per share exercise price for Parent Common Shares issuable
upon the exercise of such Assumed Warrant shall be equal to (x) the exercise
price per share of Company Common Stock at which such Company Warrant was
exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by (y) the
Conversion Number (rounded up to the nearest whole cent). The
Assumed Warrants shall be subject to the same terms and conditions (including
expiration date) as were applicable to the corresponding Company Warrants
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 

 

(c) Company Restricted Stock. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, all
then outstanding shares of Company Restricted Stock shall become fully
vested, subject to applicable income and employment withholding Taxes.


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

\- 5 -  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2.3 Additional Actions.

 

 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, the Compensation Committee of the Board of
Directors of the Company shall make such adjustments and determinations and
shall adopt any resolutions and take any corporate actions with respect to
the Company Stock Options and Company Restricted Stock as are required to
implement the provisions of this Article 2. The Company shall take all
actions necessary to ensure that after the Effective Time, neither Parent nor
the Surviving Company will be required to deliver shares of Company Common
Stock or other capital stock of the Company to any Person pursuant to or in
settlement of Company Stock Options or any other stock-based award.

 

 

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall (i) use its commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain any necessary consents from holders of Company
Stock Options and Company Restricted Stock and (ii) make any amendments to
the terms of the Company's stock option or compensation plans or arrangements
and any indenture or other instrument that are necessary to give effect to
the transactions contemplated by Article 2.

 

 

(c) Parent shall take such actions as are necessary for the assumption of the
Company Stock Options pursuant to Section 2.2, including the reservation,
issuance and listing of Parent Common Shares, as is necessary to implement
the provisions of Section 2.2. Parent shall prepare and file with the SEC a
registration statement on an appropriate form, or a post-effective amendment
to a registration statement previously filed under the Securities Act of
1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), with respect to Parent Common
Shares subject to the Company Stock Options and, where applicable, shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to have such registration statement
declared effective as soon as practicable following the Effective Time and to
maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement covering
such Company Stock Options (and to maintain the current status of the
prospectus contained therein) for so long as such Company Stock Options
remain outstanding.

 

 

2.4 No Appraisal Rights. Holders of shares of Company Common Stock will
not have dissenters' or appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL with
respect to the Merger.

 

 

2.5 Parent Common Shares. At and after the Effective Time, each of the
Parent Common Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall remain issued and outstanding and shall not be affected
by the Merger.

 

 

2.6 MergerCo Securities

 

 

(a) Each issued and outstanding share of common stock of MergerCo shall be
converted into one share of common stock of the Surviving Company.

 

 

(b) The Surviving Company shall issue to Parent common stock of the Surviving
Company in consideration for (i) the issuance by Parent of the Merger
Consideration, and (ii) the payment by Parent of cash in lieu of issuing
fractional Parent Common Shares in connection with the Merger (the "Cash
Payment"). The common stock of the Surviving Company issued pursuant to this
Section 2.6(b) shall be fully paid and non-assessable shares of common stock
of the Surviving Company with a fair market value at the Effective Time equal
to the aggregate of the fair market value of the Merger Consideration issued,
and the Cash Payment paid, by Parent at Closing.


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

\- 6 -  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2.7 Certain Adjustments

 

 

The number of Parent Common Shares issuable in connection with the Merger
shall be adjusted, at any time and from time to time, prior to the Effective
Time to reflect any stock dividend, stock split, consolidation,
amalgamation, reorganization of Parent that affects all holdings of Parent
Common Shares in the same manner, on a per share basis.

 

 

ARTICLE 3

 

EXCHANGE OF SECURITIES

 

 

3.1 Parent to Make Merger Consideration Available. As promptly as practicable
following the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be
deposited, with a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to each of the
Company and Parent (the "Exchange Agent"), for the benefit of the holders of
Certificates, for exchange in accordance with this Article 3, (i)
certificates representing the number of Parent Common Shares sufficient to
deliver the aggregate Merger Consideration, and (ii) cash in lieu of any
fractional shares (such cash and certificates for Parent Common
Shares, collectively being referred to as the "Exchange Fund"), to be issued
pursuant to Section 2.1 and paid pursuant to Section 3.2(d) in exchange for
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock.

 

 

3.2 Exchange of Shares. (a) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time,
the Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder of record of one or more
Certificates a letter of transmittal in customary form as prepared by Parent
and reasonably acceptable to the Company (which shall specify, among other
things, that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
the Certificates shall pass, only upon actual receipt of the Certificates by
the Exchange Agent) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration and any cash in
lieu of fractional shares into which the shares of Company Common Stock
represented by such Certificate or Certificates shall have been converted
pursuant to this Agreement. Upon proper surrender to the Exchange Agent of
a Certificate or Certificates for exchange and cancellation, together with
such properly completed letter of transmittal, duly executed, and any other
documents and instruments reasonably required by Parent and/or the Exchange
Agent, the holder of such Certificate or Certificates shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor, as applicable, (i) a certificate representing
the number of whole Parent Common Shares to which such holder of Company
Common Stock shall have become entitled pursuant to the provisions of Article
2, and (ii) a check representing the amount of any cash in lieu of fractional
shares which such holder has the right to receive in respect of the
Certificate or Certificates surrendered pursuant to the provisions of this
Article 3, and the Certificate or Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith
be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any cash in lieu of
fractional shares. Until so surrendered, each Certificate shall represent
after the Effective Time for all purposes only the right to receive the
Merger Consideration, together with any cash in lieu of fractional shares.


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

\- 7 -  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) If any certificate representing Parent Common Shares is to be issued in,
or any cash is paid to, a name other than that in which the Certificate or
Certificates surrendered in exchange therefor is or are registered, it shall
be a condition to the issuance or payment thereof that the Certificate or
Certificates so surrendered shall be properly endorsed (or accompanied by an
appropriate instrument of transfer) and otherwise in proper form for
transfer, and that the person requesting such exchange shall pay to the
Exchange Agent in advance any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of
the payment or issuance in any name other than that of the registered holder
of the Certificate or Certificates surrendered, or required for any other
reason, or shall establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that
such Tax has been paid or is not payable.

 

 

(c) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Company of the shares of Company Common Stock that were
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time other than to
settle transfers of Company Common Stock that occurred prior to the
Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates (properly
endorsed or accompanied by an appropriate instrument of transfer)
representing such shares are presented for transfer to the Exchange Agent,
they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration as
provided in this Article 3.

 

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no
certificates or scrip representing fractional Parent Common Shares shall be
issued upon the surrender of Certificates for exchange, no dividend or
distribution with respect to Parent Common Shares shall be payable on or with
respect to any fractional share, and such fractional share interests shall
not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a stockholder
of Parent. In lieu of the issuance of any such fractional share, Parent shall
pay to each former stockholder of the Company who otherwise would be entitled
to receive such fractional share an amount in cash (rounded to the nearest
cent) determined by multiplying (i) the average, rounded to the nearest one
ten thousandth, of the closing sale prices of Parent Common Shares on the
NYSE as reported by Bloomberg for the five full NYSE trading days immediately
preceding (but not including) the Effective Date by (ii) the fraction of a
share (rounded to the nearest thousandth when expressed in decimal form) of
Parent Common Shares to which such holder would otherwise be entitled to
receive pursuant to Section 2.1.

 

 

(e) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the holders
of Certificates of the Company as of the first anniversary of the Effective
Time shall be paid to Parent. Any former stockholders of the Company who have
not theretofore complied with this Article 3 shall thereafter look only
to Parent (subject to the terms of this Agreement, abandoned property,
escheat and other similar Laws) for payment of the Merger Consideration and
cash in lieu of any fractional shares in respect of each share of Company
Common Stock, as the case may be, such stockholder holds as determined
pursuant to this Agreement, in each case, without any interest thereon. Any
amounts remaining unclaimed immediately prior to such time when such amounts
would otherwise escheat or become the property of any Governmental Entity,
shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of
Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously
entitled thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, the Company,
the Surviving Company or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any holder of
a Certificate for any Merger Consideration delivered in respect of such
Certificate to a public official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat
or other similar Law.


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

\- 8 -  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(f)   In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if reasonably
required by Parent, the posting by such person of a bond in such amount as
Parent may determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim
that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange
Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate
the Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant
to this Agreement.

 

 

3.3  Withholding Rights. The Exchange Agent (or, subsequent to the
first anniversary of the Effective Time, Parent) shall be entitled to deduct
and withhold, from the Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional
Parent Common Shares and any other amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement to any holder of Company Common Stock (including Company Restricted
Stock) or Company Stock Options, such amounts as the Exchange Agent or
Parent, as the case may be, determines in good faith that it is required to
deduct and withhold under the Code, or any provision of state, local or non-
United States Tax law, with respect to the making of such payment. To the
extent the amounts are so withheld by the Exchange Agent or Parent, as the
case may be, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder in respect of whom such deduction
and withholding was made by the Exchange Agent or Parent, as the case may be.

Subsidiary to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any of its securities
or with respect to the voting or disposition of any outstanding securities of
any of its Subsidiaries, other than the Company Stock Options. All of the
issued and outstanding shares of capital stock or other equity ownership
interests of each Subsidiary of the Company are owned by the Company,
directly or indirectly, free and clear of any liens, claims, mortgages, deeds
of trust, pledges, assignments, security interests, equities, charges or
third party encumbrances or interests of any kind, whether contingent or
absolute, and any agreement, right, option or privilege capable of becoming
any of the foregoing ("Liens"). There are no outstanding bonds, debentures or
other evidences of indebtedness of the Company or any in its Subsidiaries

(b) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company nor
the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby, nor
the performance of its obligations thereunder, nor compliance by the Company
with any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement will (i) violate,
conflict with, or result (with or without notice or the passage of time) in a

Party Consents disclosed in Section 4.3(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter,
any consent, approval or notice under, or constitute a default (or an event

creation of any Lien upon, any of the properties or assets of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, or cause any indebtedness to come due before its
stated maturity or cause any credit commitment to cease to be available or

accelerations or creations of Liens which, or any consents (expressly
excluding the Key Third-Party Consents and Requisite Approvals), approvals or
notices which if not given or received, would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have any Material Adverse Effect). The
authorization of this Agreement, the execution and delivery by the Company of
this Agreement and the performance by it of its obligations under this
Agreement, and the consummation by the Company of the Merger, will not (x)
give rise to any rights of first refusal or, except as disclosed in Section

provisions or any restrictions or limitation under any such note, bond,
mortgage, indenture, contract, license, franchise or Permit, or result in the
imposition of any encumbrance, charge or Lien upon any of the Company' assets
or the assets of any of its Subsidiaries; or (y) result in the imposition of
any Liens upon any assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. The Key

Letter are the only consents, approvals and notices required from any third
party under any Contracts of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in order

foreign taxing authorities. The unpaid Taxes of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, being current Taxes not yet due and payable, (i) did not, as of
the most recent Company 10-Q, exceed the reserve for Tax Liability (rather
than any reserve for deferred Taxes established to reflect timing differences

included therein (rather than in any notes thereto) and (ii) as of the
Closing Date will not exceed that reserve as adjusted for the passage of time
through the Closing Date in accordance with the past custom and practice of
the Company and its Subsidiaries in filing their Tax Returns. The Company and

Subsidiaries due with respect to completed and settled examinations or any
concluded litigation have been fully paid. There are no disputes, audits,
examinations or proceedings pending, or claims asserted, for Taxes upon the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries. There are no liens for any material
amount of Taxes (other than statutory liens for Taxes not yet due and
payable) upon any of the assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.
Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or is bound by
any Tax sharing, allocation or indemnification agreement or arrangement
(other than such an agreement or arrangement exclusively between or among the
Company and its Subsidiaries). Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries (A) has been a member of an affiliated group filing a
consolidated federal income Tax Return (other than a group the common parent
of which was the Company) or (B) has any liability for the Taxes of any
person (other than the Company or any of its Subsidiaries) under Treasury
Regulation Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of state, local or
foreign Law), or as a transferee or successor, by contract or otherwise.
Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has been, within the past two
years or otherwise as part of a "plan (or series of related transactions)"
within the meaning of Section 355(e) of the Code of which the Merger is also
a part, a "distributing corporation" or a "controlled corporation" (within
the meaning of Section 355(a)(1)(A) of the Code) in a distribution of stock
intended to qualify for tax-free treatment under Section 355 of the Code.
Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has requested or is the

respect to any Taxes, nor is any such request outstanding. Neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has been a party to any "reportable
transaction" within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section

(d) Each Company Benefit Plan intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the
Code is qualified and has received a determination letter from the IRS upon
which it may rely regarding its qualified status under the Code for all
statutory and regulatory changes with respect to plan qualification
requirements for which the IRS will issue such a letter and nothing has
occurred, whether by action or by failure to act, that caused or could cause
the loss of such qualification or the imposition of any penalty or Tax
liability. All payments required by each Company Benefit Plan, any collective
bargaining agreement or other agreement, or by Law (including, without
limitation, all contributions, insurance premiums or intercompany charges)
with respect to all prior periods have been made or provided for by the

such claims), any trustee or fiduciaries thereof, or any of the assets of any
trust of any of the Company Benefit Plans. Each Company Benefit Plan complies
in form and has been maintained and operated in all material respects in
accordance with its terms and applicable Law, including, without limitation,
ERISA and the Code. No non-exempt "prohibited transaction," within the
meaning of Section 4975 of the Code and Section 406 of ERISA, has occurred or
is reasonably expected to occur with respect to the Company Benefit Plans.
No Company Benefit Plan is under, and neither the Company nor its
Subsidiaries has received any notice of, an audit or investigation by the
IRS, Department of Labor or any other Governmental Entity, and no such
completed audit, if any, has resulted in the imposition of any Tax or
penalty.

(f) No Company Benefit Plan that is a group health plan is wholly or
partially self-insured. No Company Benefit Plan provides post-retirement
health and welfare benefits to any current or former employee of the Company
or its Subsidiaries, except as required under Section 4980B of the Code, Part
6 of Title I of ERISA or any other applicable Law.

 

 

(g) The consummation of the Merger alone, or in combination with any other
event (where such event would not alone have an effect described in this
sentence), will not give rise to any liability under any Company Benefit
Plan, including, without limitation, liability for severance pay,
unemployment compensation, termination pay or withdrawal liability, or
accelerate the time of payment or vesting or increase the amount of
compensation or benefits due to any employee, officer, director, stockholder
or other service provider of the Company or its Subsidiaries (whether
current, former or retired) or their beneficiaries. No amount that could be
received (whether in cash or property or the vesting of property), as a
result of the consummation of the Merger, by any employee, officer, director,
stockholder or other service provider of the Company or its Subsidiaries
under any Company Benefit Plan or otherwise would not be deductible by reason
of Section 280G of the Code or would be subject to an excise tax under
Section 4999 of the Code. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has
any indemnity obligation on or after the Effective Time for any Taxes imposed
under Section 4999 or 409A of the Code. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries is a party to any agreement, contract, arrangement or plan that
has resulted or could result, separately or in the aggregate, in the payment
of any amount that will not be fully deductible as a result of the
limitations under Section 162(m) of the Code.

 

 

(h) None of the Company, its Subsidiaries or any employee, officer, director,
stockholder or other service provider of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries has made any promises or commitments, whether legally binding or
not, to create any additional Company Benefit Plan, agreement or arrangement,
or to modify or change in any material way any existing Company Benefit Plan.

 

 

(i) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has unfunded liabilities
pursuant to any Company Benefit Plan that is not intended to be qualified
under Section 401(a) of the Code and is an "employee pension benefit plan"
within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA, a nonqualified deferred
compensation plan or an excess benefit plan. Each Company Benefit Plan that
is a "nonqualified deferred compensation plan" (as defined under Section
409A(d)(1) of the Code) has been operated and administered in compliance
with, and is in documentary compliance with, Section 409A of the Code and the
treasury regulations and other official guidance promulgated thereunder.

 

 

(j) Any individual who performs services for the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries and who is not treated as an employee for federal income Tax
purposes by the Company or its Subsidiaries is not an employee under
applicable Law or for any purpose including, without limitation, for Tax
withholding purposes or Company Benefit Plan purposes. The Company and its
Subsidiaries have no liability by reason of an individual who performs or
performed services for the Company or its Subsidiaries in any capacity being
improperly excluded from participating in a Company Benefit Plan. Each
employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries has been properly classified as
"exempt" or "non-exempt" under applicable Law.

issuance under such Company Stock Plan, and (y) all holders of outstanding
Company Stock Options and other equity awards, indicating with respect to
each Company Stock Option or other award the Company Stock Plan under which

thereto), as applicable.

any time during the past four years and, to the knowledge of the Company, no
facts exist that could reasonably be expected to give rise to such claims or

thereto and therefrom) are not under the exclusive ownership and direct
control of it or its Subsidiaries or accountants except as would not,

information, and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves

internal controls over financial reporting. These disclosures were made in
writing by management to the Company's auditors and audit committee and a

executive officer and chief financial officer will not be able to give the
certifications and attestations required pursuant to the rules and
regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act,
without qualification, when next due.

Parent Common Shares or MergerCo Common Stock or any other equity securities
of Parent or MergerCo or any securities representing the right to purchase or
otherwise receive any Parent Common Shares or MergerCo Common Stock or the
shares or stock of any of Parent's Subsidiaries. Subject to the Parent Credit

(c) Subject to the Parent Credit Agreement, neither the execution and
delivery of this Agreement by Parent or MergerCo, nor the consummation by
Parent or MergerCo of the transactions contemplated hereby, nor the
performance of its obligations thereunder, nor compliance by Parent or
MergerCo with any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement, will (i)
violate, conflict with, or result (with or without notice or the passage of
time) in a violation or breach of any provision of, or require any consent,
approval or notice under, or constitute a default (or an event which, with
notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a default) or result in a
right of termination or acceleration under, or result in the creation of any
Lien upon, any of the properties or assets of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries, or cause any indebtedness to come due before its stated
maturity or cause any credit commitment to cease to be available or cause any

regard of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (except, in the case of each of
clauses (i) and (ii) above, for such violations, conflicts, breaches,
defaults, terminations, accelerations or creations of Liens which, or any
consents, approvals or notices which if not given or received, would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have any Material
Adverse Effect). Subject to the Parent Credit Agreement, the authorization of
this Agreement, the execution and delivery by Parent of this Agreement and
the performance by it of its obligations under this Agreement, and the
consummation by Parent of the Merger, will not (x) give rise to any rights of
first refusal or trigger any change in control provisions or any
restrictions or limitation under any such note, bond, mortgage, indenture,
contract, license, franchise or Permit, or result in the imposition of any
encumbrance, charge or Lien upon any of Parent' assets or the assets of any
of its Subsidiaries; or (y) result in the imposition of any Liens upon any
assets of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries. Since the date of its adoption,
no event has occurred, or to the knowledge of Parent, is threatened, which
has or will cause the issuance of securities under the Parent's stockholder
rights plan.

 

 

5.4   Consents and Approvals. Except for (i) the filing with, and the
declaration of effectiveness by, the SEC of the Form F-4, (ii) the filing of

Delaware pursuant to the DGCL, (iii) any notices or filings under the HSR

or the performance of any of its obligations hereunder and (B) the
consummation by Parent or MergerCo of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, except those the failure of which to be

5.5   Reports. Parent has filed all forms, documents, reports, schedules and
other documents or information required to be filed by it with (i) applicable
securities regulatory authorities in the Canadian Jurisdictions under
Applicable Canadian Securities Laws (the "Parent Reports") or (ii) the
SEC under the requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act,
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the applicable rules and regulations thereunder,
in each case, since January 1, 2008. As of their respective dates, or,
if amended or superseded by a subsequent filing, as of the date of the last
such amendment or superseded filing prior to the date hereof, Parent Reports
complied in all material respects, and each of Parent Reports filed
subsequent to the date of this Agreement will comply, in all material
respects with the requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act and Applicable Canadian Securities Laws, as the case may
be. As of the time of filing with the SEC or the Applicable Canadian
Securities Commissions, as applicable, none of Parent Reports so filed or
that will be filed subsequent to the date of this Agreement contained or will
contain, as the case may be, any untrue statement of a material fact or
omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading, except to the extent that the
information in such Parent Report has been amended or superseded by a later
Parent Report filed prior to the date hereof. Parent has not filed any
confidential material change report with securities regulatory authorities in
the applicable Canadian Jurisdictions that, at the date hereof, remains
confidential.

 

 

5.6   Reporting Status and Securities Laws Matters. (a) Parent is a
"reporting issuer" and not on the list of reporting issuers in default under
Applicable Canadian Securities Laws in the Province of Ontario. Parent Common
Shares are registered under Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act and Parent
is required to file reports with the SEC under Section 13(a) of the Exchange
Act.; (b) Parent is a "foreign private issuer" as defined in Rule 3b-4 under
the Exchange Act and there are no facts or circumstances that would preclude
Parent from being a "foreign private issuer". Parent is not, and after given
effect to the Merger will not be, an investment company registered or
required to be registered under the U.S. Investment Company Act of 1940,
as amended. No delisting, suspension of trading in or cease trading
or cease-and-desist order with respect to any securities of Parent and, to
the knowledge of Parent, no inquiry or investigation in writing (formal or
informal) by the SEC or of any securities regulatory authorities in the
Canadian Jurisdictions, is in effect or ongoing or, to the knowledge of
Parent, expected to be implemented or undertaken; and (c) None of the
Subsidiaries of Parent (i) is a "reporting issuer" under Applicable Canadian
Securities Laws in any Canadian Jurisdiction, (ii) has any class of
securities registered under the Exchange Act and none of the Subsidiaries of
Parent is required to file reports with the SEC, or (iii) is a reporting
issuer in any other jurisdiction or required to file reports with any
securities regulatory authority in any jurisdiction.

5.7   Financial Statements. Parent has previously made available to
the Company copies of (i) the consolidated balance sheet of Parent and
its Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2008 and 2009, and the related
consolidated statements of income, changes in stockholders' equity and cash
flows for the years then ended as reported in Parent's Annual Report on Form
40-F/A for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2009, (the "Parent 2009 40-F/A"
or the "Parent Financial Information") filed with the SEC under the Exchange
Act, accompanied by the audit report of KPMG LLP, independent public
accountants with respect to Parent for the years ended December 31, 2008 and
2009. The Parent Financial Information fairly presents in all material
respects the consolidated financial position of Parent and its Subsidiaries
as of the date thereof, and the other financial statements referred to in
this Section 5.6 (including the related notes, where applicable) fairly
present in all material respects the results of the consolidated operations,
cash flows and changes in stockholders' equity and consolidated financial
position of Parent and its Subsidiaries for the respective fiscal periods or
as of the respective dates therein set forth, subject to normal year-end
audit adjustments in amounts consistent with past experience in the case of
unaudited statements. The Parent Financial Information has been prepared in
conformity with Canadian GAAP applied on a consistent basis throughout the
periods involved and has been reconciled to U.S. GAAP in accordance with and
to the full extent required by applicable U.S. Securities Laws. Except as
would not, individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably expected to result
in a Material Adverse Effect, all rentals, royalties, overriding royalty
interests, production payments, net profits, interest burdens, payments and
obligations due and payable, or performable, as the case may be, on or prior
to the date hereof under, with respect to, or on account of, any direct or
indirect assets of Parent, its Subsidiaries and its material joint ventures,
have been: (i) duly paid; (ii) duly performed; or (iii) duly reserved or
provided for prior for the date hereof.

 

 

5.8   Absence of Certain Changes or Events. Except as disclosed in the Data
Room Material or as publicly disclosed in the Parent Reports filed since
December 31, 2009 but prior to the date of this Agreement, since December 31,
2009, Parent and its Subsidiaries have conducted their respective businesses
only in the ordinary course consistent with past practice and there has been
no material change (actual, contemplated or threatened) in the condition
(financial or otherwise), earnings, value, operations, properties or business
results of operations of Parent and its Subsidiaries, and the debt, business,
and property of Parent and its Subsidiaries conform in all respects to the
description thereof contained in the Parent Reports, and without limiting the
foregoing, there has not been: 

 

 

(a) any material change in accounting methods, principles or practices by
Parent affecting its assets, liabilities or business, other than changes
after the date hereof to the extent required by a change in U.S. GAAP,
Canadian GAAP or regulatory accounting principles;

or entry into any closing agreement with respect to an amount of Taxes,
settlement or compromise of any income Tax liability by Parent or its
Subsidiaries, surrender of any right to claim a refund of Taxes, consent to
any extension or waiver of the limitation period applicable to any Tax claim
or assessment, or any similar action with respect to the filing of any Tax
Return or payment of any Tax;


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

\- 33 -  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(c) any action or occurrence, or written (or to the knowledge of Parent
other) notice that any customer, supplier, distributor or sales
representative intends to cancel, terminate or otherwise modify or not renew
its relationship with Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, and, to the
knowledge of Parent, no such action has been threatened, which, in either
case, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have
a Material Adverse Effect;

 

 

(d) any Material Adverse Effect with respect to Parent; or

 

 

(e) any agreement or commitment (contingent or otherwise) to do any of
the foregoing.

 

 

5.9   Legal Proceedings.

 

 

(a) Except as disclosed in the Parent Reports filed since December 31, 2009,
there are no (i) Actions pending (or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened
in writing) against or affecting Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, or any of
their respective properties, at law or in equity, except those that,
individually or in the aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, or (ii) Orders against Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries, except those that, individually or in the aggregate,
have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect. As of the date hereof, there is no Action pending (or, to the
knowledge of Parent, threatened) against Parent that in any manner challenges
or seeks to prevent, enjoin, alter or delay the Merger.

 

 

(b) Except as disclosed in the Parent Reports since December 31, 2009,
neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is subject to any cease-and-desist
or other Order or enforcement action issued by, or is a party to any written
agreement, consent agreement or memorandum of understanding with, or is party
to any commitment letter or similar undertaking to, or is subject to any
Order or directive by, or has been, a recipient of any supervisory letter
from, or has been ordered to pay any civil money penalty by, or has adopted
any policies, procedures or board resolutions at the request or suggestion of
any Governmental Entity, in each case that currently restricts in any respect
the conduct of its business or that in any manner relates to its management
or its business (each, a "Parent Regulatory Agreement"), nor has Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries been advised by any Governmental Entity that it is
considering issuing, initiating, ordering or requesting any such Parent
Regulatory Agreement.

 

 

5.10 Books and Records. The financial books, records and accounts of
Parent and its Subsidiaries: (i) have been maintained in accordance with
Canadian GAAP, (ii) are stated in reasonable detail and accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of Parent and its
Subsidiaries, and (iii) accurately and fairly reflect the basis for the
Parent Financial Statements. The corporate records and minute books for each
of the Parent and its Subsidiaries contain, in all material respects,
complete and accurate minutes of all meetings of the directors
and stockholders of Parent and each of its Subsidiaries held since
their incorporation or amalgamation, as the case may be.


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

\- 34 -  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5.11 Taxes and Tax Returns. Except where the failure to file Tax Returns or
to pay or withhold Taxes would not have a Material Adverse Effect on the
Parent, each of the Parent and its Subsidiaries has duly and timely filed
(taking into account all applicable extensions) all Tax Returns required to
be filed by it (all such Tax Returns being accurate and complete in all
material respects), has timely paid or withheld all Taxes shown thereon as
arising and has duly and timely paid or withheld all Taxes that are due and
payable or claimed to be due from it by federal, state, foreign or local
taxing authorities. The unpaid Taxes of the Parent and its Subsidiaries (i)
did not, as of December 31, 2009, exceed the reserve for Tax Liability
(rather than any reserve for deferred Taxes established to reflect timing
differences between book and Tax income) set forth on the face of the balance
sheet included in the Parent Financial Information (rather than in any notes
thereto) and (ii) as of the Closing Date will not exceed that reserve as
adjusted for the passage of time through the Effective Time in accordance
with the past custom and practice of the Parent and its Subsidiaries in
filing their Tax Returns. Except where the failure to pay or withhold Taxes
would not have a Material Adverse Effect on the Parent, the Parent and each
of its Subsidiaries have withheld and paid all Taxes required to have been
withheld and paid in connection with any amounts paid or owing to
any employee, independent contractor, creditor, stockholder or other
third party. The federal income Tax Returns of the Parent and
its Subsidiaries have been examined by the Canada Revenue Agency or Mexican
tax authorities, as applicable, for all years to and including December 31,
2008. All assessments for Taxes of the Parent or any of its Subsidiaries due
with respect to completed and settled examinations or any concluded
litigation have been fully paid. There are no disputes, audits, examinations
or proceedings pending, or claims asserted, for Taxes upon the Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries other than a review of Gammon Lake de Mexico S.A. de C.V.
being undertaking by Mexican tax authorities. There are no liens for
any material amount of Taxes (other than statutory liens for Taxes not yet
due and payable) upon any of the assets of the Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries.

 

 

5.12 Labor and Employment. Except as described in Parent Reports filed
since December 31, 2009 or in the Data Room Materials, there are no labor
unions, works councils or other organizations representing, purporting to
represent or attempting to represent any employee of Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries. Except as described in Parent Reports filed since December
31, 2009 or in the Data Room Materials, no strike, slowdown, picketing, work
stoppage, concerted refusal to work overtime or other similar labor activity
has occurred, been threatened or, to the knowledge of Parent, is anticipated
with respect to any employee of the Parent or any of its Subsidiaries. Other
than in respect of the El Cubo Mine, there are no labor disputes currently
subject to any grievance procedure, arbitration or litigation and there is no
representation petition pending, threatened or, to the knowledge of Parent,
anticipated with respect to any employee of the Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries, which, if determined adversely to Parent or its
Subsidiaries, would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.
Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in any unfair labor
practices within the meaning of applicable Law. Parent and its Subsidiaries
are in compliance in all material respects with all applicable Laws relating
to employment and employment practices, workers' compensation, terms and
conditions of employment, worker safety, wages and hours, civil rights,
discrimination, and immigration. There have been no claims of harassment,
discrimination, retaliatory act or similar actions against any employee,
officer or director of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries at any time during
the past four years and, to the knowledge of Parent, no facts exist that
could reasonably be expected to give rise to such claims or actions. To
Parent's knowledge, no employees of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries are in
any material respect in violation of any term of any employment contract,
non-disclosure agreement, non-competition agreement, or any restrictive
covenant to a former employer relating to the right of any such employee to
be employed by the Parent or any of its Subsidiaries because of the nature of
the business conducted or presently proposed to be conducted by Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries or to the use of trade secrets or proprietary information
of others.

5.13 Compliance with Law; Permits. Except as disclosed in Parent Reports
filed since December 31, 2009 or in the Data Room Materials, Parent and each
of its Subsidiaries have complied with and are not, in any material respect,
in default under or in violation of any applicable Law. Except as disclosed
in the Data Room Materials, the Parent and each of its Subsidiaries has
obtained and is in compliance with all material Permits required by
applicable Laws, necessary for Parent and its Subsidiaries to own, lease and
operate their properties and assets or to carry on their businesses as they
are now being conducted (the "Parent Permits"), except where the failure to
do so would not have a Material Adverse Effect. All Parent Permits are in
full force and effect. Except as disclosed in the Data Room Materials, none
of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries has knowledge of any facts, events or
circumstances that would reasonably be expected to result in a failure to
obtain or be in compliance with such Permits as are necessary to conduct its
business as it is proposed to be conducted.

 

 

5.14 Material Contracts. Except as specifically disclosed in the
Parent Reports or in the Data Room Materials, neither the Parent nor any of
its Subsidiaries is party to any Material Contract. Each Material Contract is
valid and binding on Parent (or, to the extent a Subsidiary of Parent is a
party, such Subsidiary) and, to the knowledge of Parent, any other party
thereto and is in full force and effect, except to the extent that the
failure to be in full force and effect, and enforceable individually or in
the aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have, a
Material Adverse Effect. None of Parent, its Subsidiaries nor, to the
knowledge of Parent, any of the other parties thereto, is in default or
breach of, nor has Parent or its Subsidiaries received any notice of default
or breach of, or termination under, any Material Contract and, to the
knowledge of Parent, there exists no state of facts which after notice or
lapse of time or both that would constitute a default or breach of such
Material Contract, except in the case of those violations that would not have
had or would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect. Prior to the date hereof, Parent has made available to Parent true
and complete copies of all Material Contracts.

 

 

5.15 No Undisclosed Liabilities. Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries
has incurred any liability of any nature whatsoever (whether absolute,
accrued, contingent or otherwise and whether due or to become due), except

judgment, decree, order or citation related to or arising out of applicable
Environmental Law and has not been named or listed as a
potentially responsible party by any Governmental Entity in a matter arising
under any Environmental Laws; and

5.17 Property, Title and Mining Rights.

 

 

(a) Parent and each of its Subsidiaries has good and sufficient title to its
real and immoveable property interests, surface rights, concessions, leases,
licenses, easements, rights of way and permits permitting the use of land or
premises by Parent and its Subsidiaries, necessary to permit the operation of
its current business as it is now being conducted (which, for greater
certainty, includes the exploration for, development of and all production of
mineral products from mineral deposits). Except as disclosed in the Data Room
Materials, none of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries has knowledge of any
facts, events or circumstances that would reasonably be expected to result in
(A) a failure of title in respect of any real and immoveable property or (B)
a failure to hold such leases, licenses, easements, rights of way or permits
that, in either case, are necessary to permit the operation of its business
as it is proposed to be conducted, unless, in each case, such failure has not
had and would not be reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

 

 

(b) No Person other than Parent and its Subsidiaries has any interest in the
property or any of the mineral rights of Parent or its Subsidiaries or the
production or profits therefrom or any royalty in respect thereof or any
right to acquire any such interest.

 

 

(c) There are no back-in rights, earn-in rights, rights of first refusal or
similar provisions or rights which would affect Parent's or any of its
Subsidiary's interest in the property or any of the mineral rights of Parent
or its Subsidiaries.


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

\- 37 -  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(d) There are no material restrictions on the ability of Parent and its
Subsidiaries to use, transfer or exploit the property or any of the mineral
rights of Parent or its Subsidiaries, except pursuant to the applicable Law.

 

 

(e) Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any notice,
whether written or oral, from any Governmental Entity of any revocation or
intention to revoke any interest of Parent or a Subsidiary in any of their
respective properties or mineral rights.

 

 

(f) All mines located in or on the lands of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries, or lands pooled or unitized therewith, which have been
abandoned by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, have been abandoned in
accordance with good mining practices and in compliance with all applicable
Laws, and all future abandonment, remediation and reclamation obligations
known to Parent as of the date hereof have been accurately set forth in
Parent Documents without omission of information necessary to make the
disclosure not misleading.

 

 

5.18 Mineral Reserves and Resources. The estimated proven and probable
mineral reserves and estimated indicated, measured and inferred mineral
resources disclosed in the Parent Reports have been prepared and disclosed in
accordance with National Instrument 43- 101 - "Standards of Disclosure for
Mineral Projects" of the Canadian Securities Administrators. Parent has no
reason to believe that the information provided by Parent to the qualified
persons in connection with the preparation of such estimates was not complete
and accurate in all material respects at the time such information was
furnished. Except as a result of minerals extracted from the properties,
there has been no material reduction in the aggregate amount of estimated
mineral reserves or estimated mineral resources of Parent and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, from the amounts disclosed in the Parent
Reports.

 

 

5.19 Intellectual Property. Except as would not have or would not reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, either Parent or a Parent
Subsidiary owns, or is licensed or otherwise possesses adequate rights to
use, all Intellectual Property material to their respective businesses as
currently conducted ("Parent IP") free and clear of any Liens (other than,
for the avoidance of doubt, obligations to pay royalties in the case of
licensed Intellectual Property), and all such rights shall survive unchanged
the consummation of the transactions contemplated in this Agreement. There
are no pending or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened claims by
any person alleging infringement, misappropriation or other violation by
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries of any other Person's Intellectual
Property. To the knowledge of Parent, the conduct of the business of Parent
and its Subsidiaries and Parent IP does not misappropriate, infringe or
otherwise violate any Intellectual Property of any other Person. Neither
Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has made any claim for any
misappropriation, infringement or other violation by others of its rights in,
to or in connection with the Intellectual Property of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries. To the knowledge of Parent, no person is misappropriating,
infringing or otherwise violating any Intellectual Property of Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries.

 

 

5.20 Restrictions on Business Activities. There is no arbitral award,
judgment, injunction, order or decree binding upon Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries that has or could reasonably be expected to have the effect of
prohibiting, restricting, or impairing any business practice of any of them,
any acquisition or disposition of property by any of them, or the conduct of
the business by any of them as currently conducted.


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

\- 38 -  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5.21 Expropriation. No part of the property or assets of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries has been taken, condemned or expropriated by any Governmental
Entity nor has any written notice or proceeding in respect thereof been given
or commenced nor does Parent or any of its Subsidiaries know of any intent or
proposal to give such notice or commence any such proceedings.

 

 

5.22 Insurance. As of the date hereof, Parent and its Subsidiaries have such
policies of insurance as are included in Section 5.22 of the Parent
Disclosure Letter. All insurance maintained by Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries is in full force and effect and in good standing and neither
Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is in default, whether as to payment of
premium or otherwise, under the terms of any such insurance nor has Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries failed to give any notice or present any material
claim under any such insurance in a due and timely fashion or received notice
of any intent of an insurer to either claim any default on the part of Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries or not to renew any policy of insurance on its
expiry or to increase any deductible or cost in any material respect.

 

 

5.23 Related Party Transactions. Except as contemplated hereby or as
disclosed in the Parent Reports, there are no Contracts or other transactions
currently in place between Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one
hand, and: (i) to the knowledge of Parent, any officer or director of Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries; (ii) any holder of record or, to the knowledge of
Parent, beneficial owner of 5% or more of the Parent Common Shares; and (iii)
to the knowledge of Parent, any affiliate or associate of any such, officer,
director, holder of record or beneficial owner, on the other hand.

 

 

5.24 Parent Information. The information relating to Parent and
its Subsidiaries that is provided by Parent and MergerCo for inclusion in the
Proxy Statement, or the information relating to Parent and its Subsidiaries
that is provided by Parent or MergerCo or its representatives for inclusion
in any other document filed with any other Governmental Entity in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, will not, at any time,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material
fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
in which they are made, not misleading. All documents that Parent is required
to file with the SEC pursuant to its obligations under this Agreement
(including the Form F-4 (except for such portions thereof that relate only to
Company or its Subsidiaries) will comply in all material respects with the
provisions of the Securities Act and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder, and Applicable Canadian Securities Laws.

 

 

5.25 Ownership of Company Securities. Neither Parent nor any of its
Subsidiaries beneficially owns any shares of Company Common Stock or any
options, warrants or other rights to acquire equity securities of the
Company.

 

 

5.26 Data Room Information. All Parent Data Room Materials are listed in
the index posted in the Parent Data Site and the Parent Data Room Materials
were accurate in all material respects as at their respective date as stated
therein, or, if any Parent Data Room Materials are undated, as of the date of
their delivery to the Parent Data Site for purposes of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Additionally, all information provided to the
Company in relation to the Company's due diligence requests, including
information not provided in the Parent Data Room Materials, is accurate in
all material respects as at its respective date as stated therein. To the
extent that there has been a material change to any of the Parent Data Room
Materials or any other information provided to Parent since the date posted
to the Parent Data Site or provided to Parent, as the case may be, such
information is accurate in all material respects or is no longer relevant or
material to Parent or additional information has been provided in the Parent
Data Site or to the Company which supersedes or replaces such information.

(a) During the period from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time,
except as expressly contemplated or permitted by this Agreement, the Company
shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, use commercially
reasonable efforts to maintain and preserve intact its business organization,
employees and business relationships and retain the services of its key

reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

 

 

(b) The directors of the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
cause the Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective officers and
consultants to take such steps, as may be necessary to amend each Change of
Control Agreement with any Person that provides for a Change of Control
Payment, so as to provide that any Change of Control Payment paid to any
Person shall be payable in Parent Common Shares, or in cash at the sole
election of Parent; provided, however, that such Change of Control
Agreements, as so amended, shall provide that Parent shall pay the Change of
Control Payments in cash if the TSX does not approve the payment of such
Change of Control Payments in Parent Common Shares. The number of Parent
Common Shares to be paid to any such Person in satisfaction of any Change of
Control Payment shall be determined by dividing the cash value of the Change
of Control Payment payable to such Person by the volume weighted average
price of the Parent Common Shares on the NYSE for the five trading days
immediately preceding the Closing Date (or at such other price as is required
by the TSX). Such Parent Common Shares shall be registered and freely
tradable under applicable Canadian and United States securities Laws;
provided, however, that such Parent Common Shares shall be subject to any
restrictions under Applicable Canadian Securities Laws relating to
distributions by control persons, and any restrictions under the
Securities Act applicable to sales by affiliates of an issuer.
Notwithstanding this Section 6.1(b) the Company shall not, and shall cause
its Subsidiaries not to: (i) enter into any Change of Control Agreement that
is not in existence on the date of this Agreement and disclosed on Schedule
4.18, (ii) amend or otherwise modify any Change of Control Agreement except
as expressly required by the provisions of this Agreement, or (iii) amend or
otherwise modify any other agreement in any manner that would cause such
agreement to entitle a Person to a Change of Control Payment. In connection
with the sale of any Parent Common Shares sold by any Person who has received
such Parent Common Shares, Parent agrees to re-imburse such Person for up to
1% of any reasonable broker's commissions and fees related to the sale of
such Parent Common Shares through the facilities of any stock exchange on
which the Parent Common Shares are traded or quoted for trading.

sole discretion, on terms and conditions reasonably acceptable to Parent,
pursuant to which all of the ownership interests or assets of Caborca shall
be transferred to such Subsidiary(ies) of Parent as Parent shall determine in
its sole discretion, with such transfer to be closed concurrently with the

least ten business days prior to the Closing Date the Company shall inform
Parent whether it has concluded that it cannot provide the FIRPTA Certificate
and shall provide a reasonably detailed analysis of the reasons why the
Company cannot deliver the FIRPTA Certificate. The failure of the Company to
deliver the FIRPTA Certificate shall not affect the obligation of Parent and
MergerCo to effect the Merger, but instead shall permit Parent and/or
MergerCo to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration such amounts as
may be required to be withheld by applicable Tax law as contemplated by
Section 2.1(b) and Section 3.3.

under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after such filing, and
the Company shall thereafter mail or deliver the Proxy Statement to Company
stockholders. Parent shall also use its commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain all necessary state securities law or "blue sky" permits and approvals
required to carry out the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
the Company shall furnish all information concerning the Company and the
holders of Company Common Stock and Company Stock Options as may be
reasonably requested in connection with any such action. Each of Parent and
the Company shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable after receipt
thereof, provide the other party copies of any written comments and advise
the other party of any oral comments, with respect to the Proxy Statement
and/or the Form F-4 received from the SEC. Each party shall also advise the
other party, as promptly as reasonably practicable after receipt of notice
thereof, of the time when the Form F-4 has become effective, the issuance of
any stop order, or the suspensions of the qualification of the Parent Common
Shares issuable in connection with the Merger for offering or sale in
any jurisdiction. The parties shall cooperate and provide the other with a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any amendment or supplement
to the Proxy Statement, Parent Proxy Statement and the Form F-4 prior to
filing such with the SEC and will provide each other with a copy of all such
filings with the SEC to the extent not otherwise publicly available. If
at any time prior to the Effective Time, Parent or the Company has knowledge
of any information relating to Parent or the Company, or any of their
respective officers, directors or other affiliates, which should be set forth
in an amendment or supplement to the Form F-4, Parent Proxy Statement or the
Proxy Statement so that any such document would not include any misstatement
of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make
the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading, the party which discovers such information shall
promptly notify the other party and, to the extent required by applicable
Laws, an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information
shall be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent required under
applicable Law, disseminated to the stockholders of the Company.

(b) The parties shall cooperate with each other and use their respective
commercially reasonable efforts to promptly prepare and file all necessary
documentation (including notification and report forms required under the HSR
Act and any applicable Laws in other jurisdictions governing antitrust,
competition or merger control matters), to effect all applications, notices,
petitions and filings, to obtain as promptly as practicable all permits,
consents, approvals, clearances and authorizations of all third parties and
Governmental Entities that are necessary or advisable to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Merger), to use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the expiration or termination of any
applicable waiting periods, or receipt of required authorizations, as
applicable, under the HSR Act, and any applicable Laws in other jurisdictions
governing antitrust or merger control matters, to supply as promptly as
practicable any additional information and documentary material that may be
requested pursuant to the HSR Act, or any applicable Laws in foreign
jurisdictions governing antitrust, competition or merger control matters and
to comply with the terms and conditions of all such permits, consents,
approvals, clearances and authorizations of all such Governmental Entities.
The Company and Parent shall have the right to review in advance, and, to the
extent practicable, each will consult the other on, in each case subject to
applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information, all the information
relating to the Company or Parent, as the case may be, and any of their
respective Subsidiaries, which appear in any filing made with, or written
materials submitted to, any third party or any Governmental Entity in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In
exercising the foregoing right, each of the parties shall act reasonably and
as promptly as practicable. The parties shall consult with each other with
respect to the obtaining of all permits, consents, approvals, clearances and
authorizations of all third parties and Governmental Entities necessary or
advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
each party will keep the other apprised of the status of matters relating to
completion of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
promptly furnishing the other with copies of notices or other communications
received by the Company or Parent, as the case may be, or any of their
respective Subsidiaries, from any third party and/or any Governmental Entity
with respect to such transactions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in
this Agreement shall require Parent or the Company to take any action, or
commit to take any action, or agree to any condition or restriction, in
connection with obtaining the foregoing permits, consents, approvals,
clearances and authorizations of third parties or Governmental Entities, that
would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect (measured on a
scale relative to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole) on
Parent, the Company or the Surviving Company (a "Materially
Burdensome Condition"). In addition, the Company and Parent agree
to cooperate and use their commercially reasonable efforts to prepare and
file such petitions and filings, and to obtain such permits, consents,
approvals, clearances and authorizations of third parties and Governmental
Entities, that may be necessary or advisable to effect any mergers and/or
consolidations of Subsidiaries of the Company and Parent following
consummation of the Merger.

 

 

(c) Subject to the provisos contained in Section 7.1(b), if any
administrative or judicial action or proceeding, including any proceeding by
a private party, is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) challenging
any transaction contemplated by this Agreement, each of the Company and
Parent shall cooperate in all respects with the other and shall use their
respective commercially reasonable efforts to contest and resist any such
action or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any
decree, judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary
or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement,
nothing in this Section 7.1 shall limit a party's right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(b) or 9.1(c) so long as such party has,
prior to such termination, complied with its obligations under this Section
7.1.


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

\- 48 -  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(d) Each of Parent and the Company shall, upon request, furnish to the other
all information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers
and stockholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or
advisable in connection with the Proxy Statement, Parent Proxy Statement, the
Form F-4 or any other statement, filing, notice or application made by or on
behalf of Parent, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries to any
Governmental Entity, the NYSE or the TSX in connection with the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

 

(e) Each of Parent, MergerCo and the Company shall promptly advise the other
upon receiving any communication from any Governmental Entity the consent or
approval of which is required for consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, or from the NYSE or TSX, that causes such
party to believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that any Requisite
Approval will not be obtained or that the receipt of any such approval may be
materially delayed, and, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, shall
promptly provide the other party with a copy of such communication.

 

 

7.2  Access to Information. (a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to
applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information, each of the
Company and Parent shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, afford
to the officers, employees, accountants, counsel and other representatives of
the other, reasonable access, during normal business hours during the period
prior to the Effective Time, to all its properties, books, contracts,
commitments and records, and, during such period, the parties shall, and
shall cause its Subsidiaries to, make available to the other party all other
information concerning its business, properties and personnel as the other
may reasonably request. Each of the Company and Parent shall, and shall cause
each of their respective Subsidiaries to, provide to Parent a copy of each
report, schedule, registration statement and other document filed by it
during such period pursuant to the requirements of applicable
securities laws. Neither the Company nor Parent nor any of their
respective Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or to disclose
information where such access or disclosure would jeopardize the attorney-
client privilege of such party or its Subsidiaries or contravene any Law,
Order, fiduciary duty or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of
this Agreement. The parties shall make appropriate substitute
disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which the restrictions of the
preceding sentence apply.

 

 

(b) All information and materials provided pursuant to this Agreement shall
be subject to the provisions of the Letter of Intent.

 

 

(c) No investigation by any of the parties or their respective
representatives shall affect the representations and warranties of the other
set forth in this Agreement.

7.3  Company Stockholder Approval. The Company shall, as soon as
reasonably practicable, and in any event prior to the date which is three
months from the date hereof, call a meeting of its stockholders to be held
for the purpose of obtaining the requisite stockholder approval required in
connection with this Agreement and the Merger (the "Company Stockholder
Meeting"), and the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause
such meeting to be held on or before the date which is four months from the
date hereof, and such meeting shall in any event occur no later than the date
which is seven months from the date hereof; provided, however, that the
Company shall not be responsible for any delay or failure of the foregoing
events to occur on or before the specified dates if the reason for such delay
or failure is that, due to no fault on the part of the Company, the Company's
auditors or other Company advisors, either the Form F-4 to be prepared and
filed with the SEC by Parent or, if necessary, the Proxy Statement to be
Prepared by the Company remains under review, and subject to further comment,
by the SEC and the SEC shall not have declared the Form F-4 effective or, if
necessary, cleared the Proxy Statement, and in such event, the Company
Stockholder Meeting shall occur no later than 30 days after the later of: (i)
the date that the Form F-4 is declared effective and (ii) if necessary, the
date that the Proxy Statement is cleared by the SEC, as applicable. Subject
to Section 7.11(c), the Board of Directors of the Company (i) has resolved to
and shall recommend to the Company's stockholders that such stockholders vote
in favor of the approval and adoption of this Agreement, the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby (the "Company Recommendation") and
the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain such approval
and adoption, and (ii) shall, if a Takeover Proposal shall have been made to
the holders of Company Common Stock or any Person shall have publicly
announced an intention to make a Takeover Proposal, publicly reaffirm the
Company Recommendation by press release within 2 Business Days of any written
request by Parent (or in the event that the Company Stockholder Meeting is
scheduled to occur within such 2-Business Day period, prior to the time or at
such meeting). Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, including Section
7.11(d), this Agreement and the Merger shall be submitted to the stockholders
of the Company at the Company Stockholder Meeting for the purpose of
approving the Agreement and the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Without the prior written consent of Parent,
no other business shall be conducted at the Company Stockholder Meeting other
than obtaining the requisite approval of the Company's stockholders for the
Merger.

 

 

7.4   Parent Stockholder Approval. If required by Law, the Parent shall, as
soon as reasonably practicable, and in any event prior to the date which is
three months from the date hereof, call a meeting of its stockholders to be
held for the purpose of obtaining the requisite stockholder approval required
in connection with this Agreement and the Merger (the "Parent Stockholder
Meeting"), and the Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause
such meeting to be held on or before the date which is four months from the
date hereof, and such meeting shall in any event occur no later than the date
which is seven months from the date hereof; provided, however, that the
Parent shall not be responsible for any delay or failure of the foregoing
events to occur on or before the specified dates if the reason for such delay
or failure is that, due to no fault on the part of the Parent, the Form F-4
to be prepared and filed with the SEC by Parent remains under review, and
subject to further comment, by the SEC and the SEC shall not have declared
the Form F-4 effective, and in such event, the Parent Stockholder Meeting
shall occur no later than 30 days after the date that the Form F-4 is
declared effective. The board of directors of the Parent has resolved to and
shall recommend to the Parent's stockholders that such stockholders vote in
favor of the issuance of the Merger Consideration as contemplated hereby and
the Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain such approval
at the Parent Stockholder Meeting. Without the prior written consent of
Company, no other business shall be conducted at the Parent Stockholder
Meeting other than obtaining the requisite approval of the Parent's
stockholders for the issuance of the Merger Consideration and the
ratification of the Parent's stockholder rights plan.


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

\- 50 -  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7.5   Legal Conditions to Merger. Each of Parent and the Company shall, and
shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use its commercially reasonable efforts (i)
to take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary, proper or advisable to
comply promptly with all legal requirements that may be imposed on such party
or its Subsidiaries with respect to the Merger and, subject to the conditions
set forth in Article 8, to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and (ii) to obtain (and to cooperate with the other party to
obtain) any material consent, authorization, order or approval of, or any
exemption by, any Governmental Entity and any other third party that is
required to be obtained by the Company or Parent or any of their respective
Subsidiaries in connection with the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 

 

7.6   NYSE and TSX Listings. Parent shall promptly apply for and cause the
Parent Common Shares (including Parent Common Shares issuable upon
exercise of Assumed Options) to be issued pursuant to the Merger to be
approved for listing on the NYSE and TSX, subject to official notice of
issuance and, in the case of the TSX, satisfaction of customary listing
conditions, prior to the Effective Time.

 

 

7.7   Employee Matters. From and after the Effective Time, the employees
of the Company and its Subsidiaries who are employed by the Company
immediately prior to the Effective Time and who remain employed with the
Surviving Company or Parent thereafter (the "Assumed Employees") will be
offered participation and coverage under the employee benefit plans of Parent
and its Subsidiaries that are generally made available to the employees of
Parent and its Subsidiaries; provided, that continued participation and
coverage following the Effective Time under the Company Benefit Plans as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be deemed to satisfy the
obligations under this sentence, it being understood that the Assumed
Employees may commence participating in the comparable benefit plans of
Parent on different dates following the Effective Time with respect to
different comparable benefit plans of Parent. Nothing in this Section 7.7
shall preclude Parent or its Subsidiaries at any time following the Effective
Time from terminating the employment of any Assumed Employee for any reasons
(or no reason). Without limiting the generality of Section 10.11,
this Section 7.7 shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of
each party to this Agreement, and nothing in this Section 7.7, express or
implied, is intended to confer upon any other Person, including without
limitation, any current or former director, officer or employee of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, any rights or remedies of any nature
whatsoever under or by reason of this 7.7.

 

 

7.8   Indemnification; Directors' and Officers' Insurance

 

 

(a) As of the Effective Time, the indemnification and exculpation provisions
contained in the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving
Company shall be at least as favorable to individuals who immediately prior
to the Effective Time were directors, officers, agents or employees of the
Company or its Subsidiaries or otherwise entitled to indemnification under
the Company Bylaws or Company Certificate of Incorporation or such similar
organizational documents of any Company Subsidiary (an "Indemnified Party")
as those contained as of the date hereof in the Company Bylaws and Company
Certificate of Incorporation or such similar organizational documents of any
Company Subsidiary, and shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified
for a period of six years after the Effective Time in any manner that would
adversely affect the rights thereunder of any Indemnified Party; provided,
however, that nothing contained herein shall limit Parent's ability to merge
the Surviving Company into Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or any other
person or otherwise eliminate the Company's or the Surviving Company's
corporate existence so long as such rights are preserved.


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

\- 51 -  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) The Company shall purchase, prior to the Effective Time, a six-year
prepaid "tail policy" on terms and conditions (in both amount and scope)
providing substantially equivalent benefits as the current policies of
directors' and officers' liability insurance maintained by the Company with
respect to acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time that were
committed by such officers, directors and other individuals named as insureds
under the director and officer insurance policy of the Company in effect on
the date of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall
not expend more than 200% per year of coverage of the amount currently
expended by the Company per year of coverage as of the date of this Agreement
(the "Maximum Amount") to maintain or procure insurance coverage pursuant
hereto. If the Company is unable to obtain or the Surviving Company is unable
to maintain the insurance called for by this Section 7.8, the Company shall
obtain, or the Surviving Company shall maintain, as the case may be, as much
comparable insurance as is reasonably available to the Company or the
Surviving Company for substantially similar policies for the Maximum Amount.
The Indemnified Parties may be required to make reasonable application and
provide reasonable and customary representations and warranties to the
Company's insurance carrier for the purpose of obtaining such insurance.

 

 

(c) The provisions of this Section 7.8 shall survive the Effective Time and
are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each
Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives. The obligations
of the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries under this Section 7.8 shall
not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect the
rights of any Indemnified Party (or, if deceased, his or her heirs or
beneficiaries) to whom this Section 7.8 applies without the consent of such
affected person.

 

 

7.9   Additional Agreements. In case at any time after the Effective Time
any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of
this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Company with full title to all
properties, assets, rights, approvals, immunities and franchises of either
party to the Merger, the proper officers and directors of each party and
their respective Subsidiaries shall take all such necessary action as may be
reasonably requested by, and at the sole expense of, Parent.

 

 

7.10 Advice of Changes. Each of Parent, MergerCo and the Company
shall promptly advise the other of any fact, change, effect, event,
occurrence, development or state of circumstances (i) having or would
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on it or (ii) that
it believes would or would be reasonably likely to cause or constitute a
material breach of any of its representations, warranties or covenants
contained in this Agreement; provided, however, that no such notification
shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the
parties (or remedies with respect thereto) or the conditions to the
obligations of the parties under this Agreement; provided, further, that a
failure to comply with this Section 7.10 shall not constitute the failure of
any condition set forth in Article 8 to be satisfied unless the Material
Adverse Effect or material breach, in each case, that has occurred or that is
reasonably likely to occur, would independently result in the failure of a
condition set forth in Article 8 to be satisfied.

7.11 No Solicitation

 

 

(a) The Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and their
respective Representatives not to, directly or indirectly through another
Person or otherwise: (i) solicit, initiate, approve, endorse, recommend or
encourage, or take any other action designed to, or which could reasonably be
expected to, result in or facilitate any inquiry or the making or
announcement of any proposal or offer that constitutes, or that would
reasonably be expected to lead to, a Takeover Proposal or the making or
consummation thereof (including by way of furnishing information or entering
into any form of agreement, arrangement or understanding), (ii) enter into,
continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations
regarding, or provide to any Person any information, or otherwise cooperate
in any way with, any Takeover Proposal, or (iii) approve or recommend, or
propose to approve or recommend, or consummate, execute or enter into any
letter of intent, memorandum of understanding or agreement in principle
(whether or not binding), or any merger agreement, acquisition agreement,
exchange agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership
agreement or other Contract, constituting or related to, or that is intended
to or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Takeover Proposal (other than
confidentiality agreements contemplated by this Section 7.11), (iv) waive,
terminate, modify or fail to enforce any provision of any confidentiality or
standstill obligation of any Person other than Parent, or (v) propose
publicly or resolve to agree to do any of the foregoing. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, at any time prior to receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval,
in response to an unsolicited bona fide written Takeover Proposal (which was
not obtained as a result of breach of this Section 7.11, if, and only if, the
Board of Directors of the Company reasonably determines in good faith (after
consultation with outside counsel and Cormark or a financial advisor of
nationally recognized reputation in Canada or the United States) (1) that
such Takeover Proposal would, if consummated in accordance with its terms,
constitute, or is reasonably likely to lead to, a Superior Proposal, and (2)
that the failure to take such action would cause it to violate its fiduciary
duties, then the Company may, provided that the Company has strictly complied
with this Section 7.11, (A) provide information with respect to the Company
and its Subsidiaries to the Person making such Takeover Proposal (and its
Representatives) and (B) participate in discussions or negotiations with the
Person making such Takeover Proposal (and its Representatives) regarding such
Takeover Proposal; provided that (x) before providing any such information or
participating in any such discussions or negotiations, the Company first
enters into a confidentiality agreement with the Person proposing such
Takeover Proposal on terms substantially similar to, and no less favorable to
the Company than, those contained in the confidentiality agreement between
the Parent and the Company dated February 27, 2009, (or, if there is already
a confidentiality agreement in place between the Company and such Person,
such confidentiality agreement is amended to satisfy the requirements of
clauses (x) and (y) of this sentence), (y) such confidentiality agreement
does not restrict or impede upon the ability of the Company to satisfy its
obligations under this Agreement, and (z) all information provided to such
Person either has previously been provided to Parent or is provided to Parent
prior to or concurrent with the time it is provided to such Person.


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

\- 53 -  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and
their Representatives to, immediately (i) cease and cause to be terminated
all existing discussions or negotiations with any Person with respect to
any potential or actual Takeover Proposal and (ii) terminate all physical
and electronic dataroom access previously granted to any such Person or
its Representatives. The Company shall immediately request the return or
destruction of all information provided to any third parties who have entered
into a confidentiality agreement with the Company relating to a potential or
actual Takeover Proposal and shall use its best efforts to ensure that such
requests are honored.

 

 

(c) Subject only to Section 7.11(e), neither the Board of Directors of the
Company nor any committee thereof shall:

 

 

       

 

    |  

(i)

    |  

(w) withhold,  withdraw (or not continue to make), amend, modify or qualify
(or resolve  or propose publicly to do any of the foregoing) the Company 
Recommendation, or cause or permit the Company Board Recommendation to be 
less than unanimous, or (x) if a Takeover Proposal shall have been  made to
the holders of Company Common Stock or any Person shall have  publicly
announced an intention to make a Takeover Proposal, fail to  publicly
recommend against such Takeover Proposal (provided it is not a  Superior
Proposal) and to publicly reaffirm the Company Recommendation by  press
release within 2 Business Days of the Takeover Proposal having been  made or
publicly announced, as applicable (or in the event that the  Company
Stockholder Meeting is scheduled to occur within such 2-Business  Day period,
prior to the time of such meeting), or (y) approve, adopt  or recommend, or
propose publicly to approve, adopt or recommend to the  stockholders of the
Company, any Takeover Proposal, or (z) take any  other action or make any
public statement in connection with the Company  Recommendation, the Company
Stockholder Approval or the Company  Stockholder Meeting that is in any
manner adverse to the Company  Recommendation (any action described in this
clause (i) being referred to  as a "Company Adverse  Recommendation Change")
(it being understood and agreed that a  "stop, look and listen" communication
by the Board of Directors to the  stockholders of the Company pursuant to
Rule 14d−9(f) of the Exchange Act,  on no more than one (1) occasion with
respect to any publicly announced  Takeover Proposal (unless such publicly
announced Takeover Proposal shall  have been materially modified by way of a
public announcement in good  faith), shall not constitute a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change),  or

case whether  written or oral (with the sole exception of a confidentiality
agreement  referred to in Section 7.11(a)) or any tender offer constituting
or  related to, or that is intended to or could reasonably be expected to

(d) The Company shall immediately notify Parent, at first orally and then
promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) in writing, of (i) any Takeover
Proposal or inquiry or request that the Company reasonably believes could be
expected to relate or lead to a Takeover Proposal, in each case received
after the date hereof, or any amendments to the foregoing, or (ii) any
request for non-public information relating to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries in connection with any Takeover Proposal or for access to the
properties, books or records of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by any
Person, in each case, of which any of its or its Subsidiaries' officers,
directors, employees, Representatives or agents are or become aware. Such
notice shall include the identity of the Person making the Takeover Proposal,
inquiry or request, a description of the material terms and conditions of any
such Takeover Proposal, inquiry or request or amendment and shall include a
copy of any written material received from or on behalf for such Person. The
Company shall keep the Parent fully informed at all times of any change to
the material terms of any such Takeover Proposal (as amended, if applicable),
inquiry or request.

 

 

(e) Subject to Section 7.11(f), the Company covenants that it will not
accept, approve or recommend, or enter into any Contract, commitment,
arrangement, understanding, in each case whether written or oral in respect
of a Takeover Proposal (with the sole exception of a confidentiality
agreement referred to in Section 7.11(a)), terminate this Agreement, or make
a Company Adverse Recommendation Change unless:

the  Takeover Proposal constitutes a Superior  Proposal;

(ii)

    |  

the  Company has strictly complied with its obligations under this Section
7.11  and has provided the Parent with a copy of the Superior Proposal
(together  with copies of all other documentation relating to and detailing
the  Superior Proposal, including a copy of any confidentiality or
standstill  agreement between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and the
Person  making the Superior Proposal, or any of its affiliates, if not
previously  delivered, and written notice from the Board of Directors of the
Company  regarding the value in financial terms that the Board of Directors
of the  Company in consultation with its financial advisors determined should
be  ascribed to any non-cash consideration offered under the said Superior 
Proposal);

elapsed starting at 12:01 a.m. New York time on  the Business Day following
the date on which the Parent received the last  to be delivered of written
notice from the Board of Directors of the  Company that the Board of
Directors of the Company determined, subject  only to compliance with
Sections 7.11(d) and (e), to accept, approve,  recommend or enter into a
binding agreement to proceed with the Superior  Proposal and the
documentation referred to in Section 7.11(e)(ii) and  ending at 11:59 p.m.

(f) During the Negotiation Period, Parent may make, at its option and without
derogating from its rights pursuant to any other provision or this Agreement,
a counter-proposal. During the Negotiation Period the Company shall, and
shall instruct its financial and legal advisors to, negotiate with Parent
in good faith to attempt to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions
of this Agreement as will enable the Company to proceed with this Agreement.
If the Board of Directors of the Company (after consultation with its
independent financial advisor and independent outside legal counsel)
reasonably determines in good faith that such counterproposal by Parent is
such that the Takeover Proposal previously constituting a Superior Proposal
ceases to be a Superior Proposal, then the Board of Directors of the Company
shall forthwith cease all discussions or negotiations with respect to such
Takeover Proposal except to communicate with the Person making such Takeover
Proposal that the Takeover Proposal has been matched pursuant to a prior
agreement or a proposal has been made to the Company which causes the
Takeover Proposal to no longer be a Superior Proposal and the Board of
Directors of the Company shall recommend Parent's counter-proposal to its
stockholders. For greater certainty, the Board of Directors will advise the
Parent and otherwise negotiate with the Parent in such manner as will afford
the Parent reasonable opportunity to revise any counter-proposal by the

therein, Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A under the Exchange Act; provided,
however, that (i) compliance with such rules shall in no way limit or modify
the effect that any such action pursuant to such rules has under this
Agreement (including, if applicable, the right of Parent to terminate this

(collectively, the "Pre-Merger Reorganization"), and (ii) cooperate with

the Termination Fee by Parent when such Termination Fee shall become due and

Company, there may not be, without further approval of such stockholders, any

such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written

aforesaid courts. Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, and

such question. Where a separate vote by class is required, the
affirmative vote of the majority of shares of such class present in person or
represented by proxy at the meeting shall be the act of such class, unless
the question is one upon which by express provisions of an applicable law or

A duly executed proxy shall be irrevocable if it states that it is
irrevocable and if, and only as long as, it is coupled with an interest
sufficient in law to support an irrevocable power. A proxy may be made
irrevocable regardless of whether the interest with which it is coupled is an
interest in the stock itself or an interest in the corporation generally.

any action required to be taken at any annual or special meeting of
stockholders of the corporation, or any action which may be taken at any

meeting, without prior notice and without a vote, if a consent(s) in writing,
setting forth the action so taken and bearing the dates of signature of the
stockholders who signed the consent(s), shall be signed by the holders of
outstanding shares of stock having not less than a majority of the shares
entitled to vote, or, if greater, not less than the minimum number of votes
that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at
which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted and shall be
delivered to the corporation by delivery to its registered office in the
state of Delaware, or the corporation's principal place of business, or an

proceedings of meetings of the stockholders are recorded. Delivery made to
the corporation's registered office shall be by hand or by certified or
registered mail, return receipt requested, provided, however, that no
consent(s) delivered by certified or registered mail shall be deemed
delivered until such consent(s) are actually received at the registered
office. All consents properly delivered in accordance with this section shall
be deemed to be recorded when so delivered. No written consent shall be
effective to take the corporate action referred to therein unless, within
sixty days of the earliest dated consent delivered to the corporation as
required by this section, written consents signed by the holders of a
sufficient number of shares to take such corporate action are so recorded.
Prompt notice of the taking of the corporate action without a meeting by less
than unanimous written consent shall be given to those stockholders who have
not consented in writing. Any action taken pursuant to such written
consent(s) of the stockholders shall have the same force and effect as if
taken by the stockholders at a meeting thereof.

CERTIFICATES OF STOCK

Form

    
---|--- 
   

 

 

Every holder of stock in the corporation shall be entitled to have a
certificate, signed by, or in the name of the corporation by (i) the chairman
or vice chairman of the board, or the president or a vice-president and (ii)
by the treasurer or an assistant treasurer, or the secretary or an assistant
secretary of the corporation, certifying the number of shares owned by such
holder in the corporation. If such a certificate is countersigned (1) by a
transfer agent or an assistant transfer agent other than the corporation or
its employee or (2) by a registrar, other than the corporation or its
employee, the signature of any such chairman of the board, president, vice-
president, secretary, or assistant secretary may be facsimiles. In case any
officer(s) who have signed, or whose facsimile signature(s) have been used
on, any such certificate(s) shall cease to be such officer(s) of the
corporation whether because of death, resignation or otherwise before such
certificate(s) have been delivered by the corporation, such certificate(s)
may nevertheless be issued and delivered as though the person or persons who
signed such certificate(s) or whose facsimile signature(s) have been used
thereon had not ceased to be such officer(s) of the corporation. All
certificates for shares shall be consecutively numbered or otherwise
identified. The name of the person to whom the shares represented thereby are
issued, with the number of shares and date of issue, shall be entered on the
books of the corporation. Shares of stock of the corporation shall only
be transferred on the books of the corporation by the holder of record
thereof or by such holder's attorney duly authorized in writing, upon
surrender to the corporation of the certificate(s) for such shares endorsed
by the appropriate person(s), with such evidence of the authenticity of such
endorsement, transfer, authorization, and other matters as the corporation
may reasonably require, and accompanied by all necessary stock transfer
stamps. In that event, it shall be the duty of the corporation to issue a new
certificate to the person entitled thereto, cancel the old certificate(s),
and record the transaction on its books. The board of directors may appoint a
bank or trust company organized under the laws of the United States or any
state thereof to act as its transfer agent or registrar, or both in
connection with the transfer of any class or series of securities of the
corporation.

The board of directors may direct a new certificate(s) to be issued in place
of any certificate(s) previously issued by the corporation alleged to have
been lost, stolen, or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact
by the person claiming the certificate of stock to be lost, stolen,
or destroyed. When authorizing such issue of a new certificate(s), the board
of directors may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to
the issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen, or
destroyed certificate(s), or his or her legal representative, to give the
corporation a bond sufficient to indemnify the corporation against any claim
that may be made against the corporation on account of the loss, theft or
destruction of any such certificate or the issuance of such new certificate.

of directors. If no record date has been fixed by the board of directors,
the record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate
action in writing without a meeting, when no prior action by the board of
directors is required by statute, shall be the first date on which a
signed written consent setting forth the action taken or proposed to be taken
is delivered to the corporation by delivery to its registered office in the
State of Delaware, its principal place of business, or an officer or agent of
the corporation having custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings
of stockholders are recorded. Delivery made to the corporation's registered
office shall be by hand or by certified or registered mail, return receipt
requested. If no record date has been fixed by the board of directors and

writing without a meeting shall be at the close of business on the day
on which the board of directors adopts the resolution taking such
prior action.

lawful action, the board of directors may fix a record date, which record
date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record
date is adopted, and which record date shall be not more than sixty days
prior to such action. If no record date is fixed, the record date for
determining stockholders for any such purpose shall be at the close of

of default in the payment of any installment or call when such payment
is due, the corporation may proceed to collect the amount due in the same
manner as any debt due the corporation.

provide broader indemnification rights than said law permitted the

however, that if the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware
requires, the payment of such expenses incurred by a director or officer in
his or her capacity as a director or officer (and not in any other capacity
in which service was or is rendered by such person while a director or
officer, including, without limitation, service to an employee benefit plan)
in advance of the final disposition of a proceeding, shall be made only upon
delivery to the corporation of an undertaking by or on behalf of such
director or officer to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately

is entitled to indemnification. Upon written request by a claimant for
indemnification pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 16.3, a
determination, if required by applicable law, with respect to the claimant's
entitlement thereto shall be made as follows: (a) if requested by the
claimant or if there are no Disinterested Directors (as hereinafter defined),
by Independent Counsel (as hereinafter defined), or (b) by a majority vote of
the Disinterested Directors, even though less than a quorum, or by a majority
vote of a committee of Disinterested Directors designated by a majority vote
of Disinterested Directors, even though less than a quorum. If it is so
determined that the claimant is entitled to indemnification, payment to the
claimant shall be made within 10 days after such determination.
