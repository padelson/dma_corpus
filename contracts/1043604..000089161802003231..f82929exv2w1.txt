Stockholder Agreement  Exhibit C Form of Non-Competition
Agreement  Exhibit D Form of Certificate of Merger  Exhibit E Form of
Affiliate Agreement      -v-    THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER
(the "Agreement") is made and entered into as of May 17, 2002 by and among
Juniper Networks, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Parent"), Homer Acquisition
Corporation, a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent
("Sub"), Unisphere Networks, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"),
and Siemens Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("Siemens").   RECITALS  
A. The Boards of Directors of each of Parent, Sub, the Company, and Siemens
have determined that it is in the best interests of their
respective stockholders, and the Board of Directors of Sub and the Company
have determined that it is advisable, to effect a statutory merger of Sub and
the Company pursuant to this Agreement (the "Merger") and, in furtherance
thereof, have approved the Merger upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth herein.   B. Concurrently with the execution and
delivery of this Agreement, as a material inducement to Parent and Sub to
enter into this Agreement: (i) Siemens and certain stockholders of the
Company are entering into Voting Agreements, in substantially the form
attached hereto as Exhibit A (the "Voting Agreements"), with Parent; (ii)
Siemens is entering into the Stockholder Agreement, in substantially the form
attached hereto as Exhibit B (the "Stockholder Agreement"), with Parent; and
(iii) each of the Key Employees (as defined herein) is entering into a Non-
Competition Agreement, in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit C
(the "Non-Competition Agreement"), with Parent.   C. The Company has entered
into an Asset Purchase Agreement with Castle Networks, Inc., dated as of
April 29, 2002 (the "Asset Purchase Agreement") and a Stock Purchase
Agreement with Siemens Information and Communication Networks, Inc. ("Siemens
ICN"), dated as of April 30, 2002 (the "Stock Purchase Agreement" and,
together with the Asset Purchase Agreement, the "Voice Transfer Agreements"),
pursuant to which on the date hereof the Company transferred its business of
designing, manufacturing, marketing, and selling packet voice network
equipment for the telecommunications industry (the "Voice Business") to an
affiliate of Siemens (such transfer and the transactions contemplated by
the Voice Transfer Agreements, as such agreements exist on the date hereof
(or as such agreements may be amended with the consent of Parent), being
hereinafter referred to as the "Voice Transaction").   NOW, THEREFORE, in
consideration of the foregoing and the mutual representations and warranties,
covenants and agreements herein contained, the Company, Siemens, Parent and
Sub hereby agree as follows:   ARTICLE I   THE MERGER   1.1 The Merger.
At the Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.2 hereof) and subject to and
upon the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the applicable provisions
of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware ("Delaware Law"), Sub
shall be merged with and into the Company. As a result of the Merger, the
separate corporate existence of Sub shall cease and the      Company
shall continue as the surviving corporation of the Merger (the "Surviving
Corporation") and as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent.   1.2 Effective
Time. Unless this Agreement is earlier terminated pursuant to Section 10.1
hereof, the closing of the Merger (the "Closing") will take place as promptly
as practicable after satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in
Article VII hereof (other than those conditions which, by their terms, are to
be satisfied or waived at Closing), at the offices of Shearman and Sterling,
599 Lexington Avenue, New York, New York, unless another time and/or place is
mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties hereto. The date upon which
the Closing actually occurs shall be referred to herein as the
"Closing Date." On the Closing Date, the parties hereto shall cause the
Merger to be consummated by filing a Certificate of Merger in substantially
the form attached hereto as Exhibit D (the "Certificate of Merger"), with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, in accordance with the
applicable provisions of Delaware Law (the date and time of such filing, or
such other mutually agreed time as may be specified in the Certificate of
Merger, shall be referred to herein as the "Effective Time").   1.3 Effect
of the Merger. At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger shall be as
provided in the applicable provisions of Delaware Law. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time,
except as otherwise agreed to pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, all
the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and
Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities,
obligations, restrictions, disabilities and duties of the Company and Sub
shall become the debts, liabilities, obligations, restrictions, disabilities
and duties of the Surviving Corporation.   1.4 Certificate of Incorporation
and Bylaws.   (a) Subject to Section 6.28, unless otherwise determined
by Parent prior to the Effective Time, at the Effective Time the certificate
of incorporation of Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time, shall be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation
until thereafter amended in accordance with Delaware Law and as provided in
such certificate of incorporation; provided, however, that at the Effective
Time, Article I of the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation shall be amended and restated in its entirety to read as follows:
"The name of the corporation is Unisphere Networks, Inc."   (b) Unless
otherwise determined by Parent prior to the Effective Time, at the Effective
Time, the bylaws of Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time, shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter
amended in accordance with Delaware Law and as provided in the certificate of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation and such bylaws.   1.5 Directors
and Officers.   (a) Directors. Unless otherwise determined by Parent prior
to the Effective Time, the directors of Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the initial directors of the Surviving Corporation,
each to hold the office of a director of the Surviving Corporation in
accordance with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation until their respective     -2-   successors are duly
elected or appointed and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation
or removal.   (b) Officers. Unless otherwise determined by Parent prior to
the Effective Time, the officers of Sub immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold
office in accordance with the provisions of the bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation.   1.6 Effect of Merger on the Capital Stock of the
Constituent Corporations.   (a) Effect on Company Common Stock. At the
Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of
Parent, Sub, the Company or holders of any of the capital stock of the
Company, each outstanding share of Company Common Stock, shall, upon the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, be canceled
and extinguished and be converted automatically into the right to receive (x)
such number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the Stock Exchange
Ratio and (y) an amount of cash equal to the Cash Exchange Ratio. The
aggregate number of shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued to each
Stockholder and the aggregate amount of cash to be paid to each Stockholder
under this Section 1.6(a) shall be calculated by aggregating all shares of
Company Common Stock held by such Stockholder, so that (i) the aggregate
number of shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued to such Stockholder
shall be equal to the number of shares of Company Common Stock held by such
Stockholder multiplied by the Stock Exchange Ratio (the
"Stock Consideration"), with fractional shares treated in the manner set
forth in Section 1.8(f) hereof; and (ii) the aggregate amount of cash to be
paid to such Stockholder shall be equal to the aggregate number of shares of
Company Common Stock held by such Stockholder, multiplied by the Cash
Exchange Ratio (the "Cash Consideration," and together with the Stock
Consideration, the "Merger Consideration"), rounded to the nearest whole
cent, with $0.005 rounded up.   (b) Payment of Cash Consideration. At the
Closing, Parent shall deliver to Siemens, the aggregate amount of Cash
Consideration payable to Siemens under Section 1.6(a) hereto, by wire
transfer in immediately available funds to the bank account designated by
Siemens at least two (2) business days prior to the Closing Date.   (c)
Assumption of Company Options; Treatment of Company Warrants.   (i) As soon
as practicable following the Closing but effective as of the Effective Time,
each Company Option (as defined herein) shall be assumed by Parent as a
Parent Option (as defined herein). Each Company Option so assumed by Parent
pursuant to this Section 1.6(c) shall continue to have, and be subject to,
the same terms and conditions (including vesting terms) set forth in the
Company\'s Second Amended and Restated 1999 Stock Incentive Plan (the
"Plan"), and the option agreements relating thereto, as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time, except that (i) such assumed Company Option will
be exercisable for that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock equal
to the product of the number of shares of Company Common Stock that were
issuable upon exercise of such Company Option (whether or not
then exercisable or vested) immediately prior to the Effective Time
multiplied by the Option Exchange Ratio, rounded     -3-   down to the
nearest whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock, and (ii) the per share
exercise price for the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise
of such assumed Company Option shall be equal to the quotient obtained by
dividing the option exercise price of the Company Option immediately prior
to the Closing Date by the Option Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest
whole cent; provided, however, that in the case of any Company Option to
which Section 421 of the Code applies by reason of its qualification under
Section 422 of the Code, the option exercise price, the number of shares
purchasable pursuant to such option and the terms and conditions of exercise
of such option shall be determined in order to comply with Section 424 of the
Code; provided, further, that in the case of any Company Option held by an
Employee who is not employed by the Company or a Company Subsidiary
immediately prior to the Effective Time, only vested Company Options (as
determined at the Effective Time after giving effect to any acceleration
resulting from the transaction) shall be assumed by Parent pursuant to this
Section 1.6(c).   (ii) At the Effective Time, each outstanding
Company Warrant, if any, shall not be assumed by Parent and shall either be
exercised or terminated.   (iii) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall take all action necessary to effect the transactions anticipated by
this Section 1.6(c) under all Company Option agreements and Company Warrant
agreements, if any, and any other plan or arrangement of the Company.   (d)
Withholding Taxes. The requisite number of shares of Parent Common Stock
issuable pursuant to Section 1.6(a) hereof shall be subject to, and reduced
by, the amount of any state, federal and foreign withholding taxes incurred
(and not previously paid by or on behalf of such Stockholder or the Company)
in connection with the acquisition of Company Capital Stock upon the exercise
of Company Options, upon the lapsing of repurchase rights in respect
of shares of Company Common Stock, or upon payment of a bonus in the form
of Company Common Stock, if any, to such Stockholder.   (e) Capital Stock
of Sub. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action
on the part of Parent, Sub, the Company or holders of any of the capital
stock of Sub, each share of Common Stock of Sub issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and exchanged
for one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of Common Stock of
the Surviving Corporation. Each stock certificate of Sub evidencing ownership
of any such shares shall continue to evidence ownership of such shares of
capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.   (f) Shares Subject to Vesting.
If any shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time are unvested or are subject to a repurchase
option, risk of forfeiture or other condition under any applicable stock
restriction agreement or other agreement with the Company, then the Stock
Consideration and Cash Consideration issued in exchange for such shares of
Company Restricted Stock (as defined herein) shall also be unvested and
subject to the same repurchase option, risk of forfeiture or other condition
(including any requirement that any unvested shares be held in escrow). The
certificate representing such shares of Parent Common Stock may accordingly
be marked with appropriate legends in the discretion of    
-4-   Parent. Such repurchase option, risk of forfeiture or other condition
shall be applied pro rata to both the Stock Consideration (with the shares of
Parent Common Stock valued at the Trading Price) and the Cash Consideration,
and the Cash Consideration payable upon conversion of each share of Company
Restricted Stock shall be subject to the same vesting schedule as the related
Parent Common Stock issued upon conversion of the corresponding share of
Company Restricted Stock and shall be paid at the same time as such Parent
Common Stock vests. The Company shall take all actions that may be necessary
to ensure that, from and after the Effective Time, Parent is entitled to
exercise any repurchase option or other right set forth in any applicable
stock restriction agreement or other agreement and retain any Cash
Consideration payable with respect to shares of Company Restricted Stock.  
1.7 Dissenting Shares.   (a) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this
Agreement to the contrary, any shares of Company Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time held by a holder who has demanded and
perfected the right for appraisal of those shares in accordance with the
provisions of Section 262 of the Delaware Law and as of the Effective Time
has not withdrawn or lost such right to such appraisal ("Dissenting Shares")
shall not be converted into or represent a right to receive the Merger
Consideration set forth in Section 1.6 hereof, but the holder shall only be
entitled to such rights as are provided by Delaware Law.   (b)
Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 1.7(a) hereof, if any holder of
Dissenting Shares shall effectively withdraw or lose (through failure to
perfect or otherwise) such holder\'s appraisal rights under Delaware Law,
then, as of the later of the Effective Time and the occurrence of such event,
such holder\'s shares shall automatically be converted into and
represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration set forth in
Section 1.6 hereof, without interest thereon, upon surrender of the
certificate or certificates representing such shares.   (c) The Company
shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any written demand for appraisal
received by the Company pursuant to the applicable provisions of Delaware
Law, and (ii) the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to such demands. The Company shall not, except with
the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with
respect to any such demands or offer to settle or settle any
such demands.   1.8 Surrender of Certificates.   (a) Exchange Agent.
Wells Fargo Bank N.A. or such other bank or trust company designated by
Parent and reasonably satisfactory to the Company and Siemens shall serve as
the exchange agent (the "Exchange Agent") for the Merger. As of the Effective
Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with the Exchange
Agent for exchange in accordance with this Article I the Total Cash
Consideration (less the aggregate amount of Cash Consideration paid by Parent
directly to Siemens at Closing under Section 1.6(b) hereto) and the Total
Stock Consideration issuable pursuant to Section 1.6 hereof in exchange for
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (the "Exchange Fund"). Parent
agrees to make available to the Exchange Agent, from time to time as needed,
cash sufficient to pay any cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant
to Section 1.8(f)     -5-   hereof and any dividends and other
distributions pursuant to Section 1.8(c) hereof. The Exchange Agent shall,
pursuant to irrevocable instructions, deliver the Merger Consideration
contemplated to be paid for shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to this
Agreement out of the Exchange Fund. Except as contemplated by Sections 1.8(c)
and 1.8(f) hereof, the Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other
purpose.   (b) Exchange Procedures. Promptly after the Effective
Time, Parent shall instruct the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of
record of a certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (the
"Company Stock Certificates") (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Company Stock Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the
Company Stock Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be in customary
form) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Company
Stock Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration payable in
respect of the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Company
Stock Certificates. Upon surrender of a Company Stock Certificate for
cancellation to the Exchange Agent together with such letter of transmittal,
duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions
thereto, the holder of such Company Stock Certificate shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor, the Merger Consideration payable in respect of
the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Company
Stock Certificate and any cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to
Section 1.8(f) hereof and any dividends or other distributions to which such
holder is entitled pursuant to Section 1.8(c) hereof, and the Company Stock
Certificate so surrendered shall be canceled. Until so surrendered, each
Company Stock Certificate outstanding after the Effective Time shall be
deemed from and for all corporate purposes, to evidence the right to receive
upon such surrender the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the shares
of Company Common Stock represented by such Company Stock Certificate and any
cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 1.8(f) hereof and any
dividends on other distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to
Section 1.8(c) hereof.   (c) Distributions With Respect to Unexchanged
Shares. No dividends or other distributions declared or made after the
Effective Time with respect to Parent Common Stock, with a record date after
the Effective Time, shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Company
Stock Certificate until the holder of such Company Stock Certificate shall
surrender such Company Stock Certificate. Subject to the effect of escheat,
tax or other applicable law, following surrender of any such Company Stock
Certificate, there shall be paid to such holder of the certificates
representing whole shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange therefor,
without interest, (i) promptly, the amount of any cash due pursuant to
Section 1.6 hereof and the amount of dividends or other distributions with a
record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such
whole shares of Parent Common Stock and (ii) at the appropriate payment date,
the amount of dividends or other distributions, with a record date at or
after the Effective Time but prior to such surrender and a payment
date subsequent to such surrender, payable with respect to such whole shares
of Parent Common Stock at the time of such surrender, the amount of dividends
or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time
theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common
Stock.     -6-    (d) Transfers of Ownership. If any certificate for
shares of Parent Common Stock is to be issued in a name other than that in
which the certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it will
be a condition of the issuance and/or delivery thereof that the certificate
so surrendered will be properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for
transfer and that the person requesting such exchange will have paid to
Parent or any agent designated by it any transfer or other taxes required by
reason of the issuance of a certificate for shares of Parent Common Stock in
any name other than that of the registered holder of the certificate
surrendered, or established to the satisfaction of Parent or any agent
designated by it that such tax has been paid or is not payable.   (e) No
Liability. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 1.8,
neither the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Corporation, nor any party hereto
shall be liable to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any such
shares of Parent Common Stock (or dividends or distributions with respect
thereto) or cash from the Exchange Fund properly delivered to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar law.   (f) No Fractional Shares. No certificates
representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon
the surrender for exchange of Company Stock Certificates. Each holder of
shares of Company Common Stock who would otherwise have been entitled to
receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (after taking into
account all Certificates delivered by such holder) shall receive, in lieu
thereof, cash (without interest) in an amount equal to such fractional part
of a share of Parent Common Stock multiplied by the Trading Price.   1.9 No
Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock. The Merger Consideration
paid in respect of the surrender for exchange of Company Stock Certificates
in accordance with the terms hereof (including any cash in lieu of fractional
shares pursuant to Section 1.8(f) hereof and any dividends or distributions
paid pursuant to Section 1.8(c) hereof) shall be deemed to be
full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Common
Stock. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall
be closed and thereafter, there shall be no further registration of transfers
on the records of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Common Stock
which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. On or after
the Effective Time, any Company Stock Certificates presented to the Exchange
Agent, Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall be converted into the Merger
Consideration payable in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock
represented by such Company Stock Certificates and any cash in lieu of
fractional shares pursuant to Section 1.8(f) hereof and any dividends or
other distributions to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to
Section 1.8(c).   1.10 Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. If any
Company Stock Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the
Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder
thereof the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the shares of Company
Common Stock represented by such Company Stock Certificates and any cash in
lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 1.8(f) hereof and any dividends

The Company is duly qualified or licensed to do business and in good standing
as a foreign corporation in each jurisdiction in which it conducts business,

same total capitalization as on the date hereof, the capitalization of the
Company as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (assuming the

where the failure to be so qualified or licensed would not have, individually
or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect. For purposes of this
Agreement, "Parent Material Adverse Effect" shall mean any circumstance,
change in or effect that is or is reasonably likely to be materially adverse
to the assets, financial condition, business or results of operations of
Parent and its subsidiaries (taken as a whole), other than any circumstance,
change in or effect on Parent and its subsidiaries arising out of (i)

this Agreement and any Related Agreements to which it is a party and to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. The execution
and delivery of this Agreement and any Related Agreements to which it is a
party and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the
part of Parent and Sub and no further action is required on the part
of Parent or Sub to authorize the Agreement and any Related Agreements to
which it is a party and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. The
Board of Directors of each of Parent and Sub, by resolutions adopted by
unanimous vote, has approved, and the Board of Directors of Sub has declared
advisable, this Agreement and the Merger. This Agreement and each of the
Related Agreements to which Parent and Sub are parties have been duly
executed and delivered by Parent and Sub and assuming the due authorization,

the valid and binding obligations of Parent and Sub, enforceable (in the case
of this Agreement, the Voting Agreements, the Stockholder Agreement, the
Distribution Agreement and the Affiliate Agreements only) against each of
Parent and Sub in accordance with their terms, except as such enforceability
may be subject to the laws of general application relating to bankruptcy,
insolvency, and the relief of debtors and rules of law governing specific
performance, injunctive relief, or other equitable remedies.   4.3 No
Conflict. Assuming that all the consents, waivers, approvals, authorizations
and other actions described in Section 4.4(a) and (b) have been obtained and
all filings and notifications listed in Section 4.4 have been made and any
waiting periods thereunder have terminated or expired, the execution
and delivery by Parent and Sub of this Agreement and any Related Agreement to
which Parent and Sub are parties do not, and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby will not, result in a Conflict

Parent or Sub, (b) any mortgage, indenture, lease, contract or other
agreement, instrument or commitment, permit, concession, franchise or license
to which Parent, Sub or any of its properties or assets is subject, or (c)

materially delay consummation of the Merger or would not otherwise prevent or
materially delay Parent from performing its obligations under this
Agreement.   4.4 Consents. No consent, waiver, approval, order or
authorization of, or registration, declaration or filing with, any
Governmental Entity or third party, is required by or with respect to Parent
or Sub in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and

Parent, Sub, Company, Company Subsidiaries and such customers.    
-43-    (c) Parent, Sub, Company and Company Subsidiaries hereby

and Sub contained in this Agreement, or in any certificate or other
instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement, shall survive until the
Survival Date.   8.2 Indemnification.   (a) Siemens agrees to indemnify
and hold Parent and its officers, directors, and affiliates, including the
Surviving Corporation, (the "Parent Indemnified Parties"), harmless against
all claims, losses, liabilities, damages, deficiencies, costs and expenses,
including reasonable attorneys\' fees and expenses of investigation and
defense (hereinafter individually a "Loss" and collectively "Losses")
incurred or sustained by the Parent Indemnified Parties, or any of them,
directly or indirectly, as a result of (i) any breach or inaccuracy of a
representation or warranty of the Company and/or Siemens contained in this
Agreement or in any certificate or other instrument delivered pursuant to
this Agreement, (ii) any failure by the Company and/or Siemens to perform or
comply with any covenant applicable to any of them contained in
this Agreement; or (iii) any Benefit Liabilities. Subject to Section 8.2(f)
hereof, Siemens shall not have any right of contribution from the Company
hereunder with respect to any Loss claimed by a Parent Indemnified
Party.     -51-    (b) Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in
the Voice Transaction Agreements, Siemens hereby agrees from and after the
Closing, to indemnify and hold the Parent Indemnified Parties harmless for
any and all Losses incurred or sustained by the Parent Indemnified Parties,
or any of them, directly or indirectly as a result of the Voice Business, the
Voice Transfer Agreements, the Voice Transaction, or the employment or
service of any individual whose employment or service related primarily to
the Voice Business, including without limitation compensation or benefits
owed to any such individual (collectively, the "Voice Losses").   (c)
Parent agrees to indemnify and hold Siemens and its officers, directors, and
affiliates (other than the Surviving Corporation, the Company, the Company
Subsidiaries and Parent) (the "Siemens Indemnified Parties"), harmless
against all Losses incurred or sustained by them, or any of them, directly or
indirectly, as a result of (i) any breach or inaccuracy of a representation
or warranty of the Parent and/or Sub contained in this Agreement or in any
certificate or other instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement, (ii)
failure by Parent or the Surviving Corporation to perform any of
its obligations under this Agreement required to be performed after the
Closing, (iii) any Exchange Repricing Losses, (iv) any of the Company\'s
Third Party Expenses, (v) any Company Benefit Plan or (vi) Parent\'s
employment of the Employees on or after the Closing Date (except with respect
to clauses (v) and (vi), inasmuch as such Losses arise as a result of claims
for benefits under any Benefit Plan, result from a breach of representations
and warranties in Article III hereof or result from the plan referred to in
Section 6.14(a)hereof).   (d) Notwithstanding any other provision to the
contrary, no party liable for indemnification (an "Indemnifying Party")
pursuant to Section 8.2(a)(i) or Section 8.2(c)(i) shall be required to
indemnify and hold the party seeking such indemnification (the "Indemnified
Party") harmless for any and all Losses unless and until the aggregate amount
of Losses recoverable under such section or sections exceeds $3,500,000 (the
"Deductible"), in which case the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to
recover all Losses in excess of the Deductible.   (e) For the purposes of
determining the amount of a Loss recoverable pursuant to Section 8.2(a)(i)
hereof (but not for the purpose of determining the existence of a breach or
inaccuracy pursuant to such Section 8.2(a)(i)), all references to materiality
and Company Material Adverse Effect in such representation or warranty shall
be disregarded. For the purposes of determining the amount of a Loss
recoverable pursuant to Section 8.2(c) hereof (but not for the purpose of
determining the existence of a breach or inaccuracy pursuant to such Section
8.2(c)), all references to materiality and Parent Material Adverse Effect in
such representation or warranty shall be disregarded.   (f) In the case of a
specific Loss giving rise to indemnification hereunder (other than any Loss
which is itself a Tax or a Loss in respect of a Tax which is otherwise
subject to Article IX), if an Indemnified Party (i) shall receive any amount
of money (A) received by an insured from an insurance carrier, (B) paid by an
insurance carrier on behalf of an insured, in either case net of any
applicable deductible, retention or cost of reserve paid or held by or for
the benefit of such insured (the "Insurance Proceeds") in relation to such
Loss or (C) received any indemnity, contribution or other similar payment
from any third party with respect to such Loss, or (ii) shall actually
realize any Tax savings that would not have been so realized but for such
Loss ("Tax Savings Actually     -52-   Realized"), then (x) at any time
subsequent to the actual receipt from the party liable for such
indemnification (an "Indemnifying Party") of a payment in full of
indemnification of such Loss hereunder, such Indemnified Party
shall reimburse the Indemnifying Party for any such indemnification payment
made up to the amount of such Insurance Proceeds or other amounts actually
received or Tax Savings Actually Realized or (y) at any time prior to the
receipt of any indemnification payment in respect of such Loss hereunder, the
indemnification to be paid shall be paid net of the amount of any such
Insurance Proceeds or other amounts actually received or Tax Savings Actually
Realized. The Indemnified Parties shall use reasonable efforts to seek and
recover any Insurance Proceeds, Tax Savings Actually Realized and any
indemnity, contribution or similar payments available to each of them with
respect to any Loss for which such Indemnified Party seeks indemnification
pursuant to this Article VIII. Notwithstanding anything in this section,
nothing herein shall permit an Indemnifying Party to delay or refrain from
making any payment to any Indemnified Party because of the availability or
alleged availability of any insurance policy or Insurance Proceeds or Tax
savings.   (g) To the extent that any Parent Indemnified Party would
be entitled to indemnity for any individual Loss under more than one of
Sections 8.2(a) or (b) hereof, such Parent Indemnified Party shall be
entitled in its sole discretion to choose one of such sections under which to
recover for indemnity, which choice shall be binding on all Parent
Indemnified Parties and no Parent Indemnified Party may recover for
indemnification for such Loss under any other such Section; provided,
however, that no Parent Indemnified Party shall be permitted to make claims
indemnity under more than one of Sections 8.2(a) or (b) hereof unless such
claims are made to the Indemnifying Party at the same time; provided,
however, that no claim for any Loss under Section 8.2 (a)(ii) or (iii) or
8.2(b) shall be considered for the purposes of determining whether the
Deductible has been exceeded.   8.3 Claims for Indemnification.   (a) Any
Indemnified Party seeking indemnification pursuant to Article VIII shall give
prompt notice in writing to the Indemnifying Party of any matter which any
such Indemnified Party has determined has given rise to a right of
indemnification under this Agreement, stating the amount of the Loss, if
known, and method of computation thereof (the "Claim Notice");
provided, however, that the failure to provide such notice shall not release
the Indemnifying Party from any of its obligations hereunder, except to the
extent such Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced by such failure.
Except as set forth below, upon notice duly given by a Parent Indemnified
Party to an Indemnifying Party of a Claim Notice, such Indemnifying Party
shall pay the Parent Indemnified Party as promptly as practicable: (i) an
amount in cash equal to the Cash Portion (as defined herein) of such Losses
and (ii) a number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the Stock Portion
(as defined herein) of such Losses (with such shares valued at the
Indemnification Price (as defined herein)). Except as set forth below, upon
notice duly given by a Siemens Indemnified Party to an Indemnifying Party of
a Claim Notice, such Indemnifying Party shall pay the Siemens Indemnified
Party as promptly as practicable an amount in cash equal to such Losses. If
the Indemnifying Party does not dispute its obligation to indemnify the
Indemnified Party against any Losses set forth in the Claim Notice, within 30
days after receipt of such notice, such Indemnifying Party shall be
deemed     -53-   to have irrevocably acknowledged that the Indemnified
Party is entitled to the full amount of the Losses set forth in such notice.
For purposes of this Agreement, "Cash Portion" shall mean the percentage
(rounded up to the nearest whole number) that the Cash Consideration
represents of the Total Consideration (with the Stock Consideration valued at
the Trading Price) as of the Closing Date, and "Stock Portion" shall mean the
percentage (rounded down to the nearest whole number) that the Stock
Consideration (as valued at the Trading Price) represents of the Total
Consideration as of the Closing Date. For purposes of this Agreement,
"Indemnification Price" shall mean the average closing sale price of one
share of Parent Common Stock as reported on Nasdaq for the ten
(10) consecutive trading days ending three (3) trading days immediately
preceding the date it is determined that such claim for indemnification is
owed by the Indemnifying Party.   (b) Resolution of Conflicts;
Arbitration.   (i) If, within 30 days after notice duly given to
the Indemnifying Party of such a Claim Notice, such Indemnifying Party
disputes its obligations to indemnify the Indemnified Party against any
Losses set forth in such notice and such Indemnifying Party notifies the
Indemnified Party in writing of such dispute, the Indemnified Party and the
Indemnifying Party hereby agree to negotiate in good faith in an attempt to
resolve such dispute.   (ii) If such dispute is not resolved within 30
days after notice duly given to the Indemnified Party of such dispute,
the Indemnified Party may demand arbitration of such dispute unless the
amount of the Loss relates to a Third Party Claim, in which event arbitration
shall not be commenced until such amount is ascertained or both parties agree
to arbitration, and in either such event the matter shall be settled by
arbitration conducted by one arbitrator mutually agreeable to Indemnified
Party and the Indemnifying Party. In the event that, within 30 days after
submission of any dispute to arbitration, Indemnified Party and the
Indemnifying Party cannot mutually agree on one arbitrator, then, within 15
days after the end of such 30 day period, the Indemnified Party and the
Indemnifying Party shall each select one arbitrator. The two arbitrators so
selected shall select a third arbitrator. If the Indemnifying Party fails to
select an arbitrator during this 15 day period, then the parties hereto agree
that the arbitration will be conducted by one arbitrator selected by the
Indemnified Party.   (iii) Any such arbitration shall be held in New
York, New York, under the rules then in effect of the American
Arbitration Association. The arbitrator(s) shall determine how all expenses
relating to the arbitration shall be paid, including without limitation, the
respective expenses of each party, the fees of each arbitrator and the
administrative fee of the American Arbitration Association. The arbitrator or
arbitrators, as the case may be, shall set a limited time period and
establish procedures designed to reduce the cost and time for discovery while
allowing the parties an opportunity, adequate in the sole judgment of the
arbitrator or majority of the three arbitrators, as the case may be, to
discover relevant information from the opposing parties about the subject
matter of the dispute. The arbitrator, or a majority of the three
arbitrators, as the case may be, shall rule upon motions to compel or limit
discovery and shall have the authority to impose sanctions, including
attorneys\' fees and costs, to the same extent as a competent court of law or
equity, should the arbitrators or a majority of the three arbitrators, as the
case may be, determine that discovery was sought without
substantial justification or that discovery was refused or objected
to     -54-   without substantial justification. The decision of the
arbitrator or a majority of the three arbitrators, as the case may be, as to
the validity and amount of any claim in such dispute shall be final, binding,
and conclusive upon the parties hereto. Such decision shall be written and
shall be supported by written findings of fact and conclusions which shall
set forth the award, judgment, decree or order awarded by the arbitrator(s).
Within thirty (30) days of a decision of the arbitrator(s) requiring payment
by one party to another, such party shall make the payment to such other
party.   (iv) Judgment upon any award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be
entered in any court having jurisdiction.   (c) Notices and Defense of
Actions.   (i) The obligations and Liabilities of the Indemnifying Party
under this Article VIII with respect to Losses arising from claims of
any third party which are subject to the indemnification provided for in
this Article VIII ("Third Party Claims") shall be governed by and contingent
upon the additional terms and conditions set forth in this Article VIII. If
an Indemnified Party shall receive notice of any Third Party Claim in
writing, the Indemnified Party shall give the Indemnifying Party prompt
notice of such Third Party Claim in writing; provided, however, that the
failure to provide such notice shall not release the Indemnifying Party from
any of its obligations hereunder, except to the extent such Indemnifying
Party is materially prejudiced by such failure.   (ii) The Indemnifying
Party shall have the right to assume and control the defense of such Third
Party Claim at its expense and through counsel of its choice if (i) it gives
notice of its intention to do so to the Indemnified Party within 30 days of
the duly given notice from the Indemnified Party and (ii) it acknowledges in
writing that such Third Party Claim is a claim subject to indemnification
hereunder. In the event the Indemnifying Party exercises the right to
undertake any such defense against any such Third Party Claim as provided
above, the Indemnified Party may participate in such defense, but the
expenses of the Indemnified Party shall be paid by the Indemnified Party. The
Indemnified Party shall cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in such defense
and make available to the Indemnifying Party all witnesses, pertinent
records, materials and information in the Indemnified Party\'s possession or
under the Indemnified Party\'s control relating thereto as is reasonably
required by the Indemnifying Party, and the Indemnifying Party shall
reimburse the Indemnified Party for all its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses
in connection therewith. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in the foregoing, if the Indemnifying Party exercises the right to undertake
such defense against any such Third Party Claim and the Indemnifying Party
and the Indemnified Party have adverse or potentially adverse interests
in the Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party may participate in such
defense and employ separate counsel, at the Indemnifying Party\'s expense,
but the Indemnifying Party shall control such defense. No such Third Party
Claim may be settled by the Indemnifying Party without the written consent of
the Indemnified Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
unless such settlement involves only the payment of money (which payment
obligation is borne exclusively by the Indemnifying Party), involves a full
and unconditional release of the Indemnified Party and does not contain any
prohibitions, limitations or restrictions on the conduct of the Indemnified
Party\'s business.     -55-    (iii) If the Indemnifying Party shall
fail to undertake any such defense, the Indemnified Party shall have the
right to assume and control the defense thereof, at the Indemnifying Party\'s
expense, and through counsel of the Indemnified Party\'s choice. In the event
the Indemnified Party is conducting the defense against any such Third Party
Claim, the Indemnifying Party (i) may participate in such defense, but the
expenses of the Indemnifying Party shall be paid by the Indemnifying Party
and (ii) shall cooperate with the Indemnified Party in such defense and make
available to the Indemnified Party at the Indemnifying Party\'s expense, all
such witnesses, records, materials and information in the Indemnifying
Party\'s possession or under the Indemnifying Party\'s control relating
thereto as is reasonably required by the Indemnified Party. If the
Indemnified Party assumes the defense against any such Third Party Claim,
such Indemnified Party agrees to keep the Indemnifying Party informed as to
the status of such Third Party Claim. If the Indemnified Party assumes
the defense against any such Third Party Claim and proposes to settle such
claim or proceeding prior to a final judgment thereon or to forego any appeal
with respect thereto, then the Indemnified Party shall give the Indemnifying
Party prompt written notice thereof and shall not settle any such Third Party
claim without the written consent of the Indemnifying Party (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld).   8.4 Maximum Payments.   (a) The
maximum amount a Parent Indemnified Party may recover from Siemens for Losses
pursuant to Section 8.2(a) hereof shall be limited to an amount equal to
twenty-five percent (25%) of the Total Consideration (with the Stock
Consideration valued at the Trading Price).   (b) The maximum amount a
Siemens Indemnified Party may recover from Parent for Losses pursuant to
Section 8.2(c) hereof shall be limited to an amount equal to twenty-five
percent (25%) of the Total Consideration (with the Stock Consideration valued
at the Trading Price).   ARTICLE IX   TAX MATTERS   9.1 Indemnity.  
(a) Siemens Corporation agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Parent and its
officers, directors, and affiliates, including the Surviving Corporation (the
"Parent Indemnified Parties") against the following Income Taxes and, except
as otherwise provided in Section 9.4, against any loss, damage, liability or
expense, including reasonable fees for attorneys and other outside
consultants, incurred in contesting or otherwise in connection with any such
Income Taxes: (i) Taxes imposed on the Company or any Company Subsidiary with
respect to taxable periods ending on or before the Closing Date
(including but not limited to the Taxes attributable to the Voice
Transaction); (ii) with respect to taxable periods beginning on or before the
Closing Date and ending after the Closing Date, Taxes imposed on the Company
or any Company Subsidiary which are allocable, pursuant to Section 9.1(b), to
the portion of such period ending on the Closing Date; and (iii) Taxes
imposed on any member of any affiliated group with which any of the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries file or have filed a Return on a consolidated or
combined basis for a taxable     -56-   period ending on or before the
Closing Date. Parent shall be responsible for Taxes and associated expenses
not allocated to Siemens pursuant to the first sentence hereof.   (b) In
the case of Taxes that are payable with respect to a taxable period that
begins before the Closing Date and ends after the Closing Date, the portion
of any such Tax that is allocable to the portion of the period ending on the
Closing Date shall be:   (i) in the case of Taxes that are either (x) based
upon or related to income or receipts, or (y) imposed in connection with any
sale or other transfer or assignment of property (real or personal, tangible
or intangible) deemed equal to the amount which would be payable if the
taxable year ended with the Closing Date; and   (ii) in the case of Taxes
imposed on a periodic basis with respect to the assets of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary, or otherwise measured by the level of any item, deemed to
be the amount of such Taxes for the entire period (or, in the case of such
Taxes determined on an arrears basis, the amount of such Taxes for the
immediately preceding period), multiplied by a fraction the numerator of
which is the number of calendar days in the period ending on the Closing Date
and the denominator of which is the number of calendar days in the entire
period.   9.2 Returns and Payments.   (a) From the date of this Agreement
through and after the Closing Date, Siemens shall prepare and file or
otherwise furnish in proper form to the appropriate Governmental Entity (or
cause to be prepared and filed or so furnished) in a timely manner all Tax
returns, reports and forms ("Returns") relating to the Company and its
Company Subsidiaries that are due on or before or relate to any taxable
period ending on or before the Closing Date (and Parent shall do the same
with respect to any taxable period ending after the Closing Date). Returns of
the Company and its Company Subsidiaries not yet filed for any taxable period
that begins before the Closing Date shall be prepared in a manner consistent
with past practices employed with respect to the Company and its Company
Subsidiaries. With respect to any Return required to be filed by Parent or
Siemens with respect to the Company and its Company Subsidiaries and as
to which an amount of Tax is allocable to the other party under Section
9.1(b), the filing party shall provide the other party and its authorized
representatives with a copy of such completed Return and a statement
certifying the amount of Tax shown on such Return that is allocable to such
other party pursuant to Section 9.1(b), together with appropriate supporting
information and schedules at least 10 business days prior to the due date
(including any extension thereof) for the filing of such Return, and such
other party and its authorized representatives shall have the right to review
and comment on such Return and statement prior to the filing of such
Return.   (b) Siemens shall pay or cause to be paid when due and
payable all Taxes with respect to the Company and each Company Subsidiary
which are the responsibility of Siemens under this Article IX and Parent
shall so pay or cause to be paid Taxes for any taxable period after the
Closing Date which are the responsibility of Parent under this Agreement
(subject to its right of     -57-   indemnification from Siemens for
Taxes attributable to the portion of any Tax period that includes the Closing
Date pursuant to Section 9.1(a) and Section 9.1(b).   9.3 Refunds. Any Tax
refund (including any interest with respect thereto) relating to the Company
or any Company Subsidiary for any taxable period ending on or before the
Closing Date shall be the property of Siemens, and if received by Parent, the
Company or any Company Subsidiary, shall be paid over promptly to Siemens.
Parent shall not, and shall not cause or permit any of the Company or its
Company Subsidiaries to, carryback any net operating loss, capital loss, Tax
credit or other similar Tax attribute attributable to Parent or any of the
Company or its Company Subsidiaries from a taxable period ending after the
Closing Date into a taxable period ending on or prior to the Closing Date of
Siemens or the Company and its Company Subsidiaries, without Siemens\' prior
written consent, which consent may be withheld in Siemens\' sole and absolute
discretion. In the absence of Siemens\' prior written consent, Siemens shall
not be required to pay to Parent or any Company or its Company Subsidiary any
refund or credit of Taxes that results from the carryback to any
taxable period ending on or prior to the Closing Date of any net operating
loss, capital loss, Tax credit or other similar Tax attribute attributable to
Parent or any of the Company or its Company Subsidiaries from a taxable
period ending after the Closing Date.   9.4 Contests.   (a) After the
Closing, Parent will promptly notify within 10 days Siemens in writing of any
written notice of a proposed assessment or claim in an audit or
administrative or judicial proceeding of Parent or of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary which, if determined adversely to the taxpayer, would be
grounds for indemnification under this Article IX; provided, however, that
a failure to give such notice will not affect Parent\'s right to
indemnification under this Article IX except to the extent that such that
failure effectively precluded Siemens from avoiding all or a portion of the
Tax liability in question.   (b) In the case of an audit or administrative
or judicial proceeding that relates to periods ending on or before the
Closing Date, provided that Siemens acknowledges in writing its liability
under this Agreement to hold Parent, the Company and its Company Subsidiaries
harmless against the full amount of any adjustment which may be made as a
result of such audit or proceeding that relates to periods ending on or
before the Closing Date (or, in the case of any taxable year that includes
the Closing Date, against an adjustment allocable under Section 9.1(b) to the
portion of such year ending on or before the Closing Date), Siemens shall
have the right at its expense to participate in and control the conduct of
such audit or proceeding but only to the extent that such audit or proceeding
relates solely to a potential adjustment for which Siemens could be held
liable hereunder; Parent also may participate in any such audit or proceeding
and, if Siemens does not assume the defense of any such audit or proceeding,
Parent may defend the same in such manner as it may deem appropriate,
including, but not limited to, settling such audit or proceeding after giving
ten business days\' prior written notice to Siemens setting forth the terms
and conditions of settlement.     -58-    (c) With respect to issues
relating to a potential adjustment for which both Siemens and Parent or the
Company or any Company Subsidiary could be liable, each party may participate
in the audit or proceeding.   (d) Neither Parent nor Siemens shall enter
into any compromise or agree to settle any claim pursuant to any Tax audit or
proceeding which would adversely affect the other party for such year or a
subsequent year without the written consent of the other party, which consent
may not be unreasonably withheld. Parent and Siemens agree to cooperate, and
Parent agrees to cause the Company and its Company Subsidiaries to cooperate,
in the defense against or compromise of any claim in any audit or
proceeding.   9.5 Cooperation and Exchange of Information. Siemens and
Parent will provide each other with such cooperation and information as
either of them reasonably may request of the other (and Parent shall cause
the Company and its Company Subsidiaries to provide such cooperation and
information) in filing any Tax return, report or form, amended Tax return or
claim for refund, determining any liability for Taxes or a right to a refund
of Taxes or participating in or conducting any audit or other proceeding in
respect of Taxes relating to the Company and its Company Subsidiaries. Such
cooperation and information shall include providing copies of relevant Tax
returns or portions thereof, together with accompanying schedules and related
work papers and documents relating to rulings or other determinations by
taxing authorities. Siemens shall make its employees available, and Parent
shall make its employees available (and shall cause the employees of the
Company and its Company Subsidiaries to be available) on a mutually
convenient basis to provide explanations of any documents or information
provided hereunder. Parent will retain and will cause the Company and its
Company Subsidiaries to retain all Tax returns, schedules and work papers and
all material records or other documents in its possession relating to Tax
matters of the Company and its Company Subsidiaries for the taxable
period first ending after the Closing Date and for all prior taxable periods
until the later of (i) the expiration of the statute of limitations of the
taxable periods to which such Tax returns and other documents relate, without
regard to extensions, or (ii) seven years following the due date (without
extension) for such Tax returns. After such time, before Parent shall dispose
of any such documents, Parent shall, by 90 days\' prior written notice to
Siemens, give Siemens the opportunity (at Siemens\' expense) to remove and
retain all or any part of such documents as Siemens may select. Any
information obtained under this Section 9.5 shall be kept confidential,
except as may be otherwise necessary in connection with the filing of returns
or claims for refund or in conducting an audit or other proceeding.   9.6
Conveyance Taxes. Siemens and Parent shall each pay one half of any real
property transfer or gains, sales, use, transfer, value added,
stock transfer, and stamp taxes, any transfer, recording, registration, and
other fees, and any similar Taxes which become payable in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and shall file such
applications and documents as shall permit any such Tax to be assessed and
paid on or prior to the Closing Date in accordance with any available per
sale filing procedure. Parent shall execute and deliver all instruments and
certificates necessary to enable Siemens to comply with the
foregoing.     -59-    9.7 Miscellaneous.   (a) Siemens and Parent
agree to treat all payments made by either of them to or for the benefit of
the other (including any payments to the Company or any Company Subsidiary)
under this Article IX, under other indemnity provisions of this Agreement
(including, without limitation, Article VIII) and for any misrepresentations
or breaches of warranties or covenants as adjustments to the purchase price
or as capital contributions for Tax purposes and that such treatment shall
govern for purposes hereof except to the extent that the Laws of a particular
jurisdiction provide otherwise, in which case such payments shall be made in
an amount sufficient to indemnify the relevant party on an after-
Tax basis.   (b) Any indemnifiable amount otherwise payable by Siemens
shall be reduced by any Tax benefit actually realized by Parent, the Company
or any of its Company Subsidiaries in a taxable period or portion thereof
ending after the Closing Date (a "Post-Closing Date Tax Benefit") as a result
of either an adjustment to Taxes for which Siemens is responsible under
Article IX (such as a timing adjustment resulting in a Tax deduction for the
Company or any Company Subsidiary for a period after the Closing Date) or a
Tax deduction resulting from an indemnifiable payment. If a payment is made
by Siemens in accordance with its indemnification obligation, and if in a
subsequent taxable year a Post-Closing Date Tax Benefit that was not
previously taken into account pursuant to the preceding sentence to reduce an
amount otherwise payable by Siemens is actually realized by Parent, the
Company or any Company Subsidiary, Parent shall pay to Siemens at the time of
such realization the amount of such Post-Closing Date Tax Benefit to the
extent that the Post-Closing Date Tax Benefit would have resulted in a
reduction in the amount paid by Siemens if the Post-Closing Date Tax Benefit
had been obtained in the year of such payment. A Post-Closing Date Tax
Benefit will be considered to be realized for purposes of this Section 9.7(b)
at the time that it is reflected on a Tax return of Parent, the Company or
any Company Subsidiary.   (c) Any tax sharing agreement or arrangement
between Siemens and any of the Company or Company Subsidiaries shall be
terminated in its entirety immediately prior to the Closing and neither
Company nor any Company Subsidiary will have any liability or obligation
under such agreement or arrangement after the Closing.   (d)
Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, the
obligations of Siemens to indemnify and hold harmless Parent, the Company and
its Company Subsidiaries pursuant to this Article IX shall terminate at the
close of business on the day following the expiration of the
applicable statute of limitations with respect to the Tax liabilities in
question (giving effect to any waiver, mitigation or extension thereof).  
(e) From and after the Closing Date, Siemens shall not without the prior
written consent of Parent (which may, in its sole and absolute discretion,
withhold such consent) make, or cause or permit to be made, any material Tax
election that would affect any of the Company or any
Company Subsidiaries.   (f) To the extent any provision of Article VIII is
inconsistent with the provisions of this Article IX, the provisions of this
Article IX shall govern.     -60-   For purposes of this Article IX,
"Parent" and "Siemens," respectively, shall include each member of the
affiliated group of corporations of which it is or becomes a member (other
than the Company and its Company Subsidiaries, except to the extent expressly
referenced).   ARTICLE X   TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER   10.1
Termination. Except as provided in Section 10.2 hereof, this Agreement may be
terminated and the Merger abandoned at any time prior to the Closing:   (a)

event of the use of a Registration Statement for the Stock Consideration,
December 31, 2002); provided, however, that the right to terminate this
Agreement under this Section 10.1(b) shall not be available to any party
whose action or failure to act has been a principal cause of or resulted in
the failure of the Merger to occur on or before such date and such action or
failure to act constitutes breach of this Agreement;   (c) by Parent or
Siemens if: (i) there shall be a final non-appealable order of a federal or
state court in effect preventing consummation of the Merger, or (ii) there
shall be any statute, rule, regulation or order enacted, promulgated or
issued or deemed applicable to the Closing by any Governmental Entity that
would make consummation of the Merger illegal;   (d) by Parent if there
shall be any action taken, or any statute, rule, regulation or order enacted,
promulgated or issued or deemed applicable to the Merger by any Governmental
Entity, which would: (i) prohibit Parent\'s ownership or operation of any
portion of the business of the Company or (ii) compel Parent or the Company
to dispose of or hold separate all or any portion of the business or assets
of the Company or Parent as a result of the Merger;   (e) by Parent if
there has been a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement of the Company or Siemens contained in this Agreement such that the
conditions set forth in Section 7.2(a) hereof would not be satisfied and such
breach has not been cured within twenty (20) calendar days after written
notice thereof to the Company and Siemens; provided, however, that no cure
period shall be required for a breach which by its nature cannot
be cured;   (f) by Siemens if there has been a breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement
such that the conditions set forth in Section 7.3(a) hereof would not be
satisfied and such breach has not been cured within twenty (20) calendar days
after written notice thereof to Parent; provided, however, that no cure
period shall be required for a breach which by its nature cannot be cured;
or   (g) by Parent if there has been a breach of the provisions of Section
6.32 hereof and such breach has not been cured within one (1) business day
after written notice thereof to Siemens.     -61-    10.2 Effect of
Termination. In the event of termination of this Agreement as provided in
Section 10.1 hereof, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and there
shall be no liability or obligation on the part of Parent, the Company or
Siemens, or their respective officers, directors or stockholders, if
applicable; provided, however, that each party hereto shall remain liable
for any willful breaches of this Agreement prior to its termination; and
provided further, however, that, the provisions of Sections 6.5, 6.6 and 6.7
hereof, Article XI hereof and this Section 10.2 shall remain in full force
and effect and survive any termination of this Agreement pursuant to the
terms of this Article X.   10.3 Amendment. This Agreement may be amended by
the parties hereto at any time by execution of an instrument in writing
signed by or on behalf of the parties hereto.   10.4 Extension; Waiver. At
any time prior to the Closing, Parent, on the one hand, and the Company and
Siemens, on the other hand, may, to the extent legally allowed, (i) extend
the time for the performance of any of the obligations of the other party
hereto, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties
made to such party contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant
hereto, and (iii) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions
for the benefit of such party contained herein. Any agreement on the part of
a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set
forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party.   ARTICLE
