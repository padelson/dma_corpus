 **AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER**

 



 

This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of March 25, 2019 (this "
_Agreement_ "), is by and among Cousins Properties Incorporated, a Georgia
corporation (" _Parent_ "), Murphy Subsidiary Holdings Corporation, a Maryland
corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "), and TIER
REIT, Inc., a Maryland corporation (the " _Company_ "). Parent, Merger Sub and
the Company are each sometimes referred to herein as a " _Party_ " and
collectively as the " _Parties_ ".

 



 

WHEREAS, the Parties wish to effect a business combination through the merger
of the Company with and into Merger Sub, with Merger Sub being the surviving
corporation of the Merger, and in which each outstanding share of Company
Common Stock, other than Excluded Shares, shall be converted into the right to
receive a number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the Exchange Ratio
(the " _Merger Consideration_ "), as more fully described in this Agreement
and on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement;

 



 

WHEREAS, each of the respective boards of directors of Parent, Merger Sub and
the Company has unanimously approved the execution, delivery and performance
of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the
Merger, and declared them to be advisable and in the best interests of Parent,
Merger Sub and the Company, respectively, and their respective stockholders,
on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement;

 



 

WHEREAS, Parent, in its capacity as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub, has
taken all actions required for the execution of this Agreement by Merger Sub
and to approve the consummation by Merger Sub of the Merger;

 



 

WHEREAS, promptly following the Effective Time, Parent intends to cause the
contribution, conveyance or transfer of the Company Operating Partnership (or
its assets and liabilities) to the Parent Operating Partnership, in a form to
be determined by Parent, in exchange for the issuance of additional interests
in the Parent Operating Partnership, or such other similar transaction as
determined by Parent;

 



 

WHEREAS, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, (a) it is intended that the
Merger will qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a)
of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), and (b)
this Agreement is intended to be and hereby is adopted as a "plan of
reorganization" within the meaning of Sections 354, 361 and 368 of the Code.

 



 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth in this
Agreement, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
adequacy of which is hereby acknowledged, and intending to be legally bound,
the Parties hereby agree as follows:

     

 

 



 

ARTICLE I 
MERGER

 



 

Section 1.1 _Merger_.

 



 

(a) _Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to satisfaction or permitted waiver
of the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the
Maryland General Corporation Law (the " _MGCL_ "), at the Effective Time, the
Company shall be merged with and into Merger Sub (the " _Merger_ "). As a
result of the Merger, the separate existence of the Company shall cease, and
Merger Sub shall continue as the surviving corporation of the Merger (the "
_Surviving Corporation_ ") and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. The Merger
will have the effects provided in this Agreement and as specified in the MGCL.

 



 

(b) _Effective Time_. The Parties shall cause the Merger to be consummated by
filing as soon as practicable on the Closing Date articles of merger for the
Merger (the " _Articles of Merger_ ") with the State Department of Assessment
and Taxation of the State of Maryland (the " _SDAT_ "), in such form as
required by, and executed in accordance with the relevant provisions of, the
MGCL. The Merger shall become effective at the time when the Articles of
Merger have been accepted for record by the SDAT, with such date and time
specified in the Articles of Merger, or on such other date and time as shall
be agreed by the Parties and specified in the Articles of Merger (the date and
time the Merger becomes effective, the " _Effective Time_ ").

 



 

Section 1.2 _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") will take
place at the offices of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen and Katz, 51 West 52nd Street,
New York, New York 10019, at 8:30 a.m., New York time, on the second Business
Day after the satisfaction or permitted waiver of the last of the conditions
set forth in _Article VI_ (other than the conditions that by their nature are
to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or permitted
waiver of those conditions at the Closing), unless another date, time or place
is agreed to in writing by the Parties (the date on which the Closing occurs,
the " _Closing Date_ ").

 



 

Section 1.3 _Articles and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation_. The articles
of incorporation of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be the articles of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation. The
bylaws of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

Section 1.4 _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation_. From and
after the Effective Time, the directors and officers of Merger Sub immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors and officers of the
Surviving Corporation.

 



 

Section 1.5 _Tax Consequences_. It is intended that, for U.S. federal income
tax purposes, the Merger will qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning
of Section 368(a) of the Code, and that this Agreement is intended to be, and
is hereby adopted as, a "plan of reorganization" for purposes of Sections 354,
361 and 368 of the Code.

 



     

 

 



 

ARTICLE II 
TREATMENT OF SECURITIES

 



 

Section 2.1 _Treatment of Securities_.

 



 

(a) _Treatment of Company Common Stock_. At the Effective Time, as a result of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the Parties or any holder of
any shares of capital stock of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company, each share
of common stock, par value $0.0001, of the Company (the " _Company Common
Stock_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time,
other than shares of Company Common Stock owned directly by the Company,
Parent or Merger Sub (such excluded shares, the " _Excluded Shares_ " and all
other outstanding shares, the " _Eligible Shares_ "), shall be automatically
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration (and cash in lieu
of fractional shares, if any, pursuant to _Section 2.2(e))_.

 



 

(b) _Effect of Conversion on Company Common Stock_. In addition to the effects
described in _Section 2.1(a)_ above, as a result of the Merger and without
any action on the part of the Parties or any holder of any shares of capital
stock of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company, as of the Effective Time, all of
the Eligible Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall be automatically
cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each evidence of shares in
book-entry form previously evidencing any of the Eligible Shares immediately
prior to the Effective Time (the " _Company Book-Entry Shares_ ") and each
certificate previously representing any Eligible Shares immediately prior to
the Effective Time (the " _Company Certificates_ ") shall thereafter represent
only the right to receive the Merger Consideration and the right, if any, to
receive pursuant to _Section 2.2(e)_ cash in lieu of fractional shares into
which such Eligible Shares have been converted pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_
and any dividends or other distributions pursuant to _Section 2.2(c)_ or
_Section 5.10(c)_.

 



 

(c) _Cancellation of Excluded Shares_. At the Effective Time, as a result of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the Parties or any holder of
any shares of capital stock of Parent or the Company, each Excluded Share
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to
be outstanding, be cancelled without payment of any consideration therefor and
shall cease to exist.

 



 

(d) _Treatment of Merger Sub Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, each share
of capital stock of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall remain outstanding as a share of capital stock of the
Surviving Corporation and shall not be affected by the Merger.

 



 

(e) _Parent Capital Stock_. For the avoidance of doubt, at the Effective Time,
each share of capital stock of Parent issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall remain outstanding as a share of capital stock of
Parent and shall not be affected by the Merger.

 



 

Section 2.2 _Exchange of Certificates_.

 



 

(a) _Exchange Agent_. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit
or shall cause to be deposited with a nationally recognized financial
institution or trust company

 



     

 

 



 

selected by Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Company to serve as the
exchange agent (the " _Exchange Agent_ "), for the benefit of the holders of
Eligible Shares, (i) an aggregate number of shares of Parent Common Stock to
be issued in uncertificated or book-entry form comprising the number of shares
of Parent Common Stock required to be issued pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_,
and (ii) an aggregate amount of cash comprising approximately the amount
required to be delivered pursuant to _Section 2.2(e)_. In addition, Parent
shall deposit or cause to be deposited with the Exchange Agent, as necessary
from time to time after the Effective Time, any dividends or other
distributions, if any, to which the holders of Eligible Shares may be entitled
pursuant to _Section 2.2(c)_ with both a record and payment date after the
Effective Time and prior to the surrender of such Eligible Shares or pursuant
to _Section 5.10(c)_. Such shares of Parent Common Stock, cash in lieu of any
fractional shares payable pursuant to _Section 2.2(e)_ and the amount of any
dividends or other distributions deposited with the Exchange Agent pursuant to
this _Section 2.2(a)_ are referred to collectively in this Agreement as the "
_Exchange Fund_." The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any purpose other
than for the purpose provided for in this Agreement.

 



 

(b) _Exchange Procedures_.

 



 

(i) Promptly after the Effective Time (and in any event within five Business
Days thereafter), Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall cause the
Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of Eligible Shares notice
advising such holders of the effectiveness of the Merger, including (A)
appropriate transmittal materials specifying that delivery shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title to the Company Certificates or the Company Book-
Entry Shares shall pass, only upon delivery of the Company Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu of the Company Certificates, as provided in
_Section 2.6_) or transfer of the Company Book-Entry Shares to the Exchange
Agent (including customary provisions with respect to delivery of an "agents
message" with respect to the Company Book-Entry Shares) (the " _Letter of
Transmittal_ "), and (B) instructions for surrendering the Company
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the Company Certificates, as
provided in _Section 2.6_) or transferring the Company Book-Entry Shares to
the Exchange Agent in exchange for the Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of
fractional shares, if any, and any dividends or distributions, in each case,
to which such holders are entitled pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.
With respect to holders of the Company Book-Entry Shares, the Parties shall
cooperate to establish procedures with the Exchange Agent to allow the
Exchange Agent to promptly transmit, following the Effective Time, to such
holders or their nominees, upon surrender of Eligible Shares, the Merger
Consideration, cash in lieu of fractional shares, if any, and any dividends or
distributions, in each case, to which such holders are entitled pursuant to
the terms of this Agreement.

 



 

(ii) Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of Eligible Shares that are
represented by the Company Certificates, by physical surrender of such Company
Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu of a Company Certificate, as
provided in _Section 2.6_) or that are Company Book-Entry Shares, by book-
receipt of an "agents message" by the Exchange Agent in connection with the
transfer of Company Book-Entry Shares, in accordance with the terms of the
Letter of Transmittal and accompanying instructions or, with respect to
Company Book-Entry Shares, in

 



     

 

 



 

accordance with customary procedures and such other procedures as agreed by
Parent and the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Company Certificate or
Company Book-Entry Share shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (A)
that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock that such holder is
entitled to receive pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_ and (B) an amount (if any)
in immediately available funds (or, if no wire transfer instructions are
provided, a check, and in each case, after giving effect to any required Tax
withholdings as provided in _Section 2.2(h)_) of (1) any cash in lieu of
fractional shares payable pursuant to _Section 2.2(e)_ _ plus_ (2) any
unpaid non-stock dividends and any other dividends or other distributions that
such holder has the right to receive pursuant to _Section 2.2(c)_ or _Section
5.10(c)_.

 



 

(iii) No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due
surrender of Eligible Shares, and any Company Certificate or ledger entry
relating to Company Book-Entry Shares formerly representing shares of Company
Common Stock that have been so surrendered shall be cancelled by the Exchange
Agent.

 



 

(iv) In the event of a transfer of ownership of certificated Eligible Shares
that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, the proper
number of shares of Parent Common Stock, together with an amount (if any) in
immediately available funds (or, if no wire transfer instructions are
provided, a check, and in each case, after giving effect to any required Tax
withholdings as provided in _Section 2.2(h)_) of cash to be paid upon due
surrender of the Company Certificate and any dividends or distributions in
respect thereof, may be issued or paid to such a transferee if the Company
Certificate formerly representing such Eligible Shares is presented to the
Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect
such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer or similar
Taxes have been paid or are not applicable, in each case, in form and
substance, reasonably satisfactory to the Exchange Agent and Parent. Payment
of the Merger Consideration with respect to Company Book-Entry Shares shall
only be made to the Person in whose name such Company Book-Entry Shares are
registered in the stock transfer books of the Company. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this _Section 2.2(b)_, each Company Certificate and Company
Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time at or after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance
with this _Article II_, including any amount payable in lieu of fractional
shares in accordance with _Section 2.2(e)_, and any dividends or other
distributions in accordance with _Section 2.2(c)_ or _Section 5.10(c)_, in
each case without interest.

 



 

(c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. All shares of Parent
Common Stock to be issued in connection with the Merger shall be deemed issued
and outstanding as of the Effective Time and whenever a dividend or other
distribution is declared by Parent in respect of Parent Common Stock, the
record date for which is after the Effective Time, that declaration shall
include dividends or other distributions in respect of all shares issuable
pursuant to this Agreement. No dividends or other distributions in respect of
Parent Common Stock shall be paid to any holder of any unsurrendered Eligible
Share until the Company Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu of the
Company Certificate as provided in _Section 2.6_) or the Company Book-Entry
Share is surrendered for exchange in accordance with this _Article II_.
Subject to applicable Laws, following such surrender, there shall be issued or
paid to the holder

 



     

 

 



 

of record of the whole shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange for
Eligible Shares in accordance with this _Article II_, without interest, (i)
at the time of such surrender, the dividends or other distributions with a
record date after the Effective Time theretofore payable with respect to such
whole shares of Parent Common Stock and not paid and (ii) at the appropriate
payment date, the dividends or other distributions payable with respect to
such whole shares of Parent Common Stock with a record date after the
Effective Time but with a payment date subsequent to surrender.

 



 

(d) _Transfers_. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no
transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of the shares of Company
Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.
From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Company Certificates or
Company Book-Entry Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares of Company Common
Stock, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement or by applicable Law.
If, after the Effective Time, Company Certificates or Company Book-Entry
Shares are presented to the Parent for any reason, they shall be cancelled and
exchanged as provided in this Agreement.

 



 

(e) _No Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, no fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall
be issued upon the conversion of Eligible Shares pursuant to this Agreement.
Any holder of Eligible Shares otherwise entitled to receive a fractional share
of Parent Common Stock but for this _Section 2.2(e)_ shall be entitled to
receive, upon surrender of the applicable Eligible Shares, a cash payment,
without interest, in lieu of any fractional share, equal to the product
obtained by multiplying (i) the fractional share interest to which such holder
(after taking into account all shares of Company Common Stock held at the
Effective Time by such holder) would otherwise be entitled by (ii) the closing
price on the New York Stock Exchange (the " _NYSE_ "), as reported on the
consolidated tape at the close of the NYSE regular session of trading, for a
share of Parent Common Stock on the last trading day immediately preceding the
Closing Date (appropriately adjusted for the consummation of the Parent
Reverse Stock Split or otherwise as contemplated by _Section 2.5_, if
applicable). No holder of Eligible Shares shall be entitled by virtue of the
right to receive cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock
described in this _Section 2.2(e)_ to any dividends, voting rights or any
other rights in respect of any fractional share of Parent Common Stock. The
payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock is not a
separately bargained-for consideration and solely represents a mechanical
rounding-off of the fractions in the exchange.

 



 

(f) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to holders of Eligible Shares for nine months after the
Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation, upon demand,
and any former stockholders of the Company who have not theretofore complied
with this _Article II_ shall thereafter look only to Parent and the Surviving
Corporation for delivery of any shares of Parent Common Stock and any payment
of cash and any dividends and other distributions in respect thereof payable
or issuable pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_, _Section 2.2(c)_, _Section
2.2(e)_ and _Section 5.10(c)_, in each case, without any interest thereon.

 



 

(g) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, none of Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the Exchange Agent or any
other Person shall be

 



     

 

 



 

liable to any former holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any amount
properly delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Laws. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of Eligible Shares immediately prior to
the time at which the Exchange Fund would otherwise escheat to, or become
property of, any Governmental Entity, shall, to the extent permitted by Law,
become the property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of any
Person previously entitled thereto.

 



 

(h) _Withholding_. Each of Parent, the Company, Merger Sub, the Exchange Agent
and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from
the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as
it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such
payment under the Code or any other applicable Tax Law. To the extent that
amounts are so deducted or withheld by Parent, the Company, Merger Sub, the
Exchange Agent or the Surviving Corporation and paid over to the applicable
Governmental Entity in accordance with applicable Law, such withheld amounts
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

 



 

Section 2.3 _Further Assurances_. If, at any time before or after the
Effective Time, Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall consider or be
advised that any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances or any other
acts or things are necessary, desirable or proper (a) to vest, perfect or
confirm, of record or otherwise, in the Surviving Corporation its right, title
or interest in, to or under any of the rights, privileges, powers, franchises,
properties or assets of the Company, or (b) otherwise to carry out the
purposes of this Agreement, each of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and its
proper officers and directors or their designees shall be authorized to
execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of any Party, all such deeds,
bills of sale, assignments and assurances and to do, in the name and on behalf

Section 3.2 _Representations and Warranties of Parent and Merger Sub_. Except
(x) as set forth in the applicable section or subsection of the disclosure
letter delivered to the Company by Parent and Merger Sub immediately prior to
the execution of this Agreement (the " _Parent Disclosure Letter_ ") (it being
understood that any matter disclosed pursuant to any section or subsection of
the Parent Disclosure Letter shall be deemed to be disclosed for all purposes
of this _Article III_ as long as the relevance of such disclosure to the
other Sections or sub-Sections of this _Article III_ is reasonably apparent
on the face of such disclosure); _provided_ , that (x) nothing in the Parent
Disclosure Letter is intended to broaden the scope of any representation or
warranty of Parent made herein and (y) no reference to or disclosure of any
item or other matter in the Parent Disclosure Letter shall be construed as an
admission or indication that (1) such item or other matter is material or
constitutes a Parent Material Adverse Effect, (2) such item or other matter is
required to be referred to or disclosed in the Parent Disclosure Letter or (3)
any breach or violation of applicable Laws or any contract, agreement,
arrangement or understanding to which Parent or any Subsidiaries of Parent is
a party exists or has actually occurred, or (y) as disclosed in the Parent SEC
Documents filed with the SEC since December 31, 2017 and publicly available
prior to the date hereof (other than disclosures in any "risk factors" or
"forward looking statements" sections of such reports or any other disclosures
in such reports to the extent they are non-specific, predictive, forward-
looking or primarily cautionary in nature), Parent and Merger Sub hereby
represent and warrant to the Company as follows:

 



 

(a) _Organization, Standing and Power_. Parent is duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Georgia and has
requisite corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate its
properties and assets and to carry on its business as presently conducted.
Merger Sub is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the
laws of the State of Maryland and has requisite corporate power and authority
to own, lease and operate its properties and assets and to carry on its
business as presently conducted. Each other Subsidiary of Parent is duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
jurisdiction of its organization and has requisite corporate, partnership or
limited liability company (as the case may be) power and authority to own,
lease and operate its properties and assets and to carry on its business as
presently conducted, except

 



     

 

 



 

where the failure to be so organized, validly existing or in good standing, or
to have such power or authority, has not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse
Effect. Parent and each of its Subsidiaries is duly qualified as a foreign
corporation or other entity to do business and is in good standing in each
jurisdiction where the ownership, leasing or operation of its properties or
assets or the nature of its activities makes such qualification necessary,
except for such failures to be so qualified as has not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent
Material Adverse Effect. Parent has previously made available to the Company
true and complete copies of the Organizational Documents, as applicable, of
Parent, Merger Sub and Cousins Properties LP, a Delaware limited partnership
(the " _Parent Operating Partnership_ "), in each case as in effect as of the
date hereof. Parents, Merger Subs and the Parent Operating Partnerships
Organizational Documents are in full force and effect, and Parent, the Merger
Sub and the Parent Operating Partnership are not in violation of any of their
respective Organizational Documents.

exercise of Parent Stock Options outstanding as of the Parent Capitalization
Date and the exchange of limited partnership

 



     

 

 



 

units of the Parent Operating Partnership outstanding as of the Parent
Capitalization Date and (B) there are no outstanding subscriptions, options,
warrants, puts, calls, exchangeable or convertible securities or other similar
rights, agreements or commitments relating to the issuance of capital stock or
other equity interests to which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is a party
or otherwise bound obligating Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to: (1) issue,
transfer or sell any shares of capital stock or other equity interests of
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or securities convertible into or
exchangeable for such shares or equity interests (in each case other than to

limited purpose entity or Person, on the other hand, or any "off balance sheet
arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K of the SEC), where

material transaction involving, or material liabilities of, Parent or any
Subsidiary of Parent or any of their financial statements.

material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or (ii) the Joint

comply as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the
Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations of the SEC
promulgated thereunder, except that no representation or warranty is made by

asserting a failure, or possible failure, to comply with any such Law, the
subject of which written

copies of any written comments and advise the other Party of any oral comments
with respect to the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Form S-4 received
from the SEC. Each Party shall use its reasonable best efforts to take any
action required to be taken under any applicable state securities laws in
connection with the Merger, and each Party shall furnish all information
concerning it, its Affiliates and the holders of its capital stock as may be
reasonably requested in connection with any such action. Each Party will
advise the other Party, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of the time
when the Form S-4 has become effective, the issuance of any stop order, the
suspension of the qualification of the Parent Common Stock issuable in
connection with the Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or any
request by the SEC for amendment of the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus or
the Form S-4. If, at any time prior to the Effective Time, any information
relating to either of the Parties, or their respective Affiliates, officers or
directors, should be discovered by either Party, and such information should
be set forth in an amendment or supplement to any of the Form S-4 or the Joint
Proxy Statement/Prospectus so that such documents would not include any
misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading, the Party that discovers such information shall
promptly notify the other Party and, to the extent

 



     

 

 



 

required by law, rules or regulations, an appropriate amendment or supplement
describing such information shall be promptly filed with the SEC and
disseminated to the stockholders of Parent and the Company.

 



 

(b) The Company shall duly take all lawful action to call, give notice of,
convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders as promptly as practicable
following the date upon which the Form S-4 becomes effective (the " _Company
Stockholders Meeting_ ") for the purpose of obtaining the Company Required
Vote. Unless a Change in Recommendation has occurred in accordance with
_Section 5.4_, the Company and the Board of Directors of the Company shall
use their reasonable best efforts to obtain from the stockholders of the
Company the Company Required Vote. Unless a Change in Recommendation has
occurred in accordance with _Section 5.4_, the Company and its Board of
Directors will recommend to its stockholders approval of the Merger and the
Company shall cause the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus and the Form S-4 to
include such recommendation. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this
_Section 5.1_ _(b)_ , if, on the date for which the Company Stockholders
Meeting is scheduled, the Company has not received proxies representing a
sufficient number of shares of Company Common Stock to obtain the Company
Required Vote, whether or not a quorum is present, the Company shall have the
right to (and at the request of Parent shall) make one or more successive
postponements or adjournments of the Company Stockholders Meeting; _provided_
that the Company Stockholders Meeting is not postponed or adjourned to a date
that is more than 30 days after the date for which the Company Stockholders
Meeting was originally scheduled (excluding any adjournments or postponements
required by applicable Law). Nothing contained in this Agreement (absent
termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms) shall be deemed to
relieve the Company of its obligation to submit the Merger to its stockholders
for a vote on the approval thereof. The Company agrees that, unless this
Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with _Section 7.1_, its
obligations to hold the Company Stockholders Meeting pursuant to this _Section
5.1_ shall not be affected by the commencement, public proposal, public
disclosure or communication to the Company or its Board of Directors of any
Acquisition Proposal, by any Change in Recommendation or by any development,
fact, circumstance or change that would give rise to a right to make a Change
in Recommendation.

 



 

(c) Parent shall duly take all lawful action to call, give notice of, convene
and hold a meeting of its stockholders as promptly as practicable following
the date upon which the Form S-4 becomes effective (the " _Parent Stockholders
Meeting_ ") for the purpose of obtaining the Parent Required Vote and, if
elected by Parent, for the purpose of obtaining stockholder approval of the
Parent Reverse Stock Split and the Parent Authorized Capital Amendment. Parent
and the Board of Directors of Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain from the stockholders of Parent the Parent Required Vote. Parent and
its Board of Directors will recommend to its stockholders approval of the
Parent Stock Issuance and Parent shall cause the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus and the Form S-4 to include such recommendation
(together, the " _Parent Recommendation Actions_ "). Notwithstanding the
foregoing provisions of this _Section 5.1_ _(c)_ , if, on a date for which
the Parent Stockholders Meeting is scheduled, Parent has not received proxies
representing a sufficient number of shares of Parent Common Stock to obtain
the Parent Required Vote, whether or not a quorum is present, Parent shall
have the right to (and at the request of the Company shall) make one or more
successive postponements or adjournments of the Parent Stockholders Meeting;
_provided_ that the Parent Stockholders Meeting is not postponed or adjourned
to a date that is more than 30 days after the date for which

 



     

 

 



 

the Parent Stockholders Meeting was originally scheduled (excluding any
adjournments or postponements required by applicable Law). Nothing contained
in this Agreement (absent termination of this Agreement in accordance with its
terms) shall be deemed to relieve Parent of its obligation to submit the
Parent Stock Issuance to its stockholders for a vote on the approval thereof.
Parent agrees that, unless this Agreement shall have been terminated in
accordance with _Section 7.1_, its obligations to hold the Parent
Stockholders Meeting and to take the Parent Recommendation Actions pursuant to
this _Section 5.1_ shall not be affected by the commencement, public
proposal, public disclosure or communication to Parent or its Board of
Directors of any Acquisition Proposal.

 



 

(d) Each of Parent and the Company shall cooperate and use their reasonable
best efforts to cause the Parent Stockholders Meeting and the Company
Stockholders Meeting to be held on the same date and as soon as reasonably
practicable after the date of this Agreement.

 



 

Section 5.2 _Access to Information_. Upon reasonable notice, and at the
reasonable request of Parent, the Company shall (and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to) afford to the Representatives of Parent, reasonable access,
during normal business hours during the period prior to the Effective Time, to
all the Company Properties (other than for purposes of invasive testing),
books, contracts, records and the Companys Representatives; _provided_ that
all such access shall be coordinated through the Company or its
Representatives in accordance with such procedures as they may reasonably
establish. Upon reasonable notice, and at the reasonable request of the
Company, Parent shall (and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to) afford to
the Representatives of the Company, reasonable access, during normal business
hours during the period prior to the Effective Time, to all Parent Properties
(other than for purposes of invasive testing), books, contracts, records and
Parents Representatives; _provided_ that all such access shall be coordinated
through Parent or its Representatives in accordance with such procedures as
they may reasonably establish. Neither the Company nor Parent, nor any of
their respective Subsidiaries, shall be required to provide access to or to
disclose information where such access or disclosure would violate or
prejudice the rights of its customers, jeopardize the attorney-client
privilege of the institution in possession or control of such information or
contravene any Law or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of this
Agreement. The Parties will make appropriate substitute disclosure
arrangements under circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding
sentence apply. No such investigation by any Party shall affect the
representations and warranties of any other Party. The terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement shall apply to any information and access provided
pursuant to this _Section 5.2_.

 



 

Section 5.3 _Efforts; Notice of Certain Events_.

 



 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of Parent and
the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken,
all actions and to do promptly, or cause to be done promptly, and to assist
and cooperate with each other in doing, all things necessary, proper or
advisable under applicable Law to consummate and make effective the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including preparing and
filing as promptly as practicable all documentation to effect all necessary
filings, notices, petitions, statements, registrations, submissions of
information, applications and other documents necessary to consummate the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In
furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each of Parent and the
Company shall

 



     

 

 



 

(i) use its reasonable best efforts to cooperate with the other Party in
determining which filings are required to be made prior to the Closing with,
and which consents, clearances, approvals, permits or authorizations are
required to be obtained prior to the Closing from, any Governmental Entity or
any other Person in connection with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement and the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and in timely making all such filings, (ii)
promptly furnish the other Party, subject in appropriate cases to appropriate
confidentiality agreements to limit disclosure to outside lawyers and
consultants, with such information and reasonable assistance as such other
Party may reasonably request in connection with their preparation of necessary
filings, registrations and submissions of information to any Governmental
Entity, (iii) supply as promptly as reasonably practicable any additional
information and documentary material that may be requested pursuant to any
applicable Laws by any Governmental Entity, and (iv) take or cause to be taken
all other actions necessary, proper or advisable to obtain applicable
clearances, consents, authorizations, approvals or waivers and cause the
expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods with respect to
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement under any
applicable Laws as promptly as practicable.

 



 

(b) Each of the Parties shall, in connection with the efforts referenced in
_Section 5.3(a)_, (i) use its reasonable best efforts to cooperate in all
respects with each other in connection with any investigation or other
inquiry, including any proceeding initiated by a private party; (ii) promptly
notify the other Party of any communication concerning this Agreement or any
of the transactions contemplated hereby to that Party from or with any
Governmental Entity, or from any other Person alleging that the consent of
such person (or another Person) is or may be required in connection with the
Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and consider
in good faith the views of the other Party and keep the other Party reasonably
informed of the status of matters related to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including furnishing the other Party with any written notices
or other communications received by such Party from, or given by such Party
to, any Governmental Entity and of any communication received or given in
connection with any proceeding by a private party, in each case regarding any
of the transactions contemplated hereby, except that any materials concerning
one Partys valuation of the other Party may be redacted; and (iii) permit the
other Party to review in draft any proposed substantive or other non-
ministerial communication to be submitted by it to any Governmental Entity
with reasonable time and opportunity to comment, and consult with each other
in advance of any in-person or substantive or other non-ministerial telephonic
meeting or conference with any Governmental Entity or, in connection with any
proceeding by a private party, with any other Person, and, to the extent
permitted by the applicable Governmental Entity or Person, not agree to
participate in any meeting or substantive or other non-ministerial discussion
with any Governmental Entity relating to any filings or investigations
concerning this Agreement and or any of the transactions contemplated hereby
unless it consults with the other Party and its Representatives in advance and
invites the other Partys Representatives to attend in accordance with
applicable Laws. In furtherance of the foregoing, prior to being exchanged
with the other Party, any materials may be redacted (i) to remove references
concerning the valuation of Parent, the Company or the Surviving Corporation;
(ii) as necessary to comply with contractual arrangements entered into prior
to the date of this Agreement or applicable Laws; and (iii) as necessary to
address reasonable attorney-client or other privilege or confidentiality
concerns.

 



     

 

 



 

(c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each of Parent and
the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to resolve objections, if
any, as may be asserted with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement under any Laws, including defending any lawsuits or other legal
proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement or
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (including seeking to
have any stay, temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction entered
by any court or other Governmental Entity vacated or reversed).

 



 

(d) Parent and the Company shall reasonably cooperate with each other and use
their respective reasonable best efforts to take such actions as the other may
reasonably request to obtain any consents from any third parties (excluding
any Governmental Entity) as may be reasonably required to consummate the
Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_
that Parent and the Company shall not be required to, and shall not without
the other Partys written approval (not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), incur any material expenses or liabilities in order
to obtain such consents.

 



 

(e) Each of the Company, the Board of Directors of the Company, Parent and the
Board of Directors of Parent shall, if any state takeover statute or similar
statute becomes applicable to this Agreement, the Merger, or any other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, use all reasonable best efforts
to ensure that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated hereby and otherwise to minimize the effect of such statute or
regulation on this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby.

 



 

Section 5.4 _Non-Solicitation; Change in Recommendation_.

 



 

(a) The Company agrees that neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any of
the Affiliates, directors, officers and employees of it or its Subsidiaries
shall, and that it shall cause its and its Subsidiaries other Representatives
not to, directly or indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit, propose, knowingly
encourage or knowingly facilitate any inquiry or the making of any proposal or
offer that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, an
Acquisition Proposal, or any other effort or attempt to make or implement an
Acquisition Proposal, (ii) engage in, continue or otherwise participate in any
discussions with or negotiations relating to any Acquisition Proposal or any
inquiry, proposal or offer that would reasonably be expected to lead to an
Acquisition Proposal (other than to state that the terms of this Agreement
prohibit such discussions), (iii) provide any nonpublic information to any
Person in connection with any Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry, proposal or
offer that would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal,
(iv) approve or execute or enter into any letter of intent, agreement in
principle, merger agreement, business combination agreement, sale or purchase
agreement or share exchange agreement, option agreement or any other similar
agreement related to any Acquisition Proposal (an " _Acquisition Agreement_ ")
or (v) propose or agree to do any of the foregoing. Any violation of the
restrictions contained in this _Section 5._4 by any of the Companys
Representatives shall be deemed to be a breach of this _Section 5.4_ by the
Company. The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that
its Representatives are aware of the provisions of this _Section 5.4_.

 



      

 

 



 

(b) (i) Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to the Company Stockholders
Meeting, in response to an unsolicited, _bona fide_ written Acquisition
Proposal (that did not result from the Companys breach of this _Section
5.4_) made after the date of this Agreement, subject to compliance with the
other terms of this _Section 5.4_ and the Company first entering into a
confidentiality agreement with the Person who has made such Acquisition
Proposal having confidentiality and use provisions that are no less favorable
to the Company than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement (it being
understood that such confidentiality agreement need not prohibit the making or
amending of an Acquisition Proposal), the Company shall be permitted to (A)
engage in discussions and negotiations with the Person who has made such
Acquisition Proposal and (B) provide any nonpublic information or data in
response to a request therefor to the Person who has made such Acquisition
Proposal; _provided_ that prior to taking any action described in clause (A)
or (B) above, the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith
after consultation with outside legal counsel that (I) based on the
information then available and after consultation with its financial advisor,
such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal or is reasonably
likely to result in a Superior Proposal, and (II) the failure to take such
action would be inconsistent with the duties of members of the Board of
Directors of the Company under applicable Law. The Company shall provide
Parent with a copy of any nonpublic information provided to any Person
pursuant to the prior sentence prior to or simultaneously with furnishing such
information to such Person, unless such information has been previously made
available to Parent. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall
enter into any agreement with any Person subsequent to the date of this
Agreement that prohibits such Person from providing information to Parent in
accordance with this _Section 5.4_.

 



 

(ii) The Company shall notify Parent promptly (but in no event later than 24
hours) after receipt of any Acquisition Proposal, or any request for nonpublic
information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by any Person
that informs the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that it is considering
making, or has made, an Acquisition Proposal (or any Person in circumstances
that would be reasonably expected to be in connection with the consideration
of or the making of an Acquisition Proposal), or any inquiry from any Person
seeking to have discussions or negotiations with the Company relating to a
possible Acquisition Proposal. Such notice shall be made orally and promptly
confirmed in writing, and shall indicate the identity of the person making the
Acquisition Proposal, inquiry or request and the material terms and conditions
of any inquiries, proposals or offers (including a copy thereof if in writing
and any related documentation or correspondence, including proposed
agreements). The Company shall also promptly, and in any event within 24
hours, notify Parent, orally and in writing, if it enters into discussions or
negotiations concerning any Acquisition Proposal or provides nonpublic
information to any Person in accordance with this _Section 5.4_ _(b)_ and
keep Parent reasonably informed of the status and terms of any such
discussions or negotiations on a reasonably current basis, including by
providing a copy of all material documentation or material correspondence
relating thereto, including proposed agreements and any material change in its
intentions as previously notified.

 



 

(iii) Except as provided in _Section 5.4_ _(b)(iv)_ or _Section 5.4(b)(v)_,
neither the Board of Directors of the Company, nor any committee thereof,
shall (A) withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify in any manner adverse to
Parent, or propose publicly or resolve to withhold, withdraw, qualify or
modify in any manner adverse to

Merger, (B) fail to include the recommendation of the Board of Directors of
the Company that the stockholders of the Company approve the Merger in the
Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus, (C) make or publicly propose to make any
recommendation in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer commenced

"stop, look and listen" communication or (D) fail to reaffirm the
recommendation of the Board of Directors of the Company in favor of the Merger
within five Business Days of Parents written request that the Company do so
(provided that Parent shall be entitled to make such a written request for
reaffirmation only once with respect to each Acquisition Proposal and once for
each material amendment to each such Acquisition Proposal) (any of the
foregoing (A), (B), (C) or (D), a " _Change in Recommendation_ ").

 



 

(iv) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary (but subject
to this _Section 5.4(b)(iv)_), prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting,
with respect to an Acquisition Proposal, the Board of Directors of the Company
may make a Change in Recommendation, or the Board of Directors of the Company
may authorize the Company to terminate this Agreement to enter into an
Acquisition Agreement, in each case, if and only if (A) an unsolicited _bona
fide_ written Acquisition Proposal (that did not result from a breach of this
_Section 5.4_) is made to the Company by a third party, and such Acquisition
Proposal is not withdrawn, (B) the Board of Directors of the Company
determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel
and financial advisors) that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior
Proposal, (C) the Board of Directors of the Company has determined in good
faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel) that failure to do
so would be inconsistent with the duties of the members of the Board of
Directors of the Company under applicable Law, (D) four Business Days shall
have elapsed since the time the Company has given written notice to Parent
advising Parent that the Company intends to take such action and specifying in
reasonable detail the reasons therefor, including the terms and conditions of
any such Superior Proposal that is the basis of the proposed action (a "
_Notice of Recommendation Change_ ") (it being understood that any amendment
to any material term of such Superior Proposal (including any change in the
form or amount of consideration) shall require a new Notice of Recommendation
Change but with a new notice period equal to the longer of two Business Days
and the remainder of the initial four-Business Day period, (E) during such
four-Business Day period, the Company has considered and, at the reasonable
request of Parent, engaged in good faith discussions with Parent regarding,
any adjustment or modification of the terms of this Agreement proposed by
Parent, and (F) the Board of Directors of the Company, following such four-
Business Day period, again determines in good faith (after consultation with
outside legal counsel and financial advisors, and taking into account any
adjustment or modification of the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent)
that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and failure to
do so would be inconsistent with the duties of the members of the Board of
Directors of the Company under applicable Law; _pro_ _vided_ , that in the
case of termination of this Agreement by the Company to enter into an
Acquisition Agreement pursuant to this _Section 5.4(b)(iv)_, (x) the Company
must pay or cause to be paid to Parent the Company Termination Fee pursuant

 



     

 

 



 

to _Section 7.2(b)_ and (y) neither the Company nor any Subsidiary or
Representative of the Company shall enter into any Acquisition Agreement
unless this Agreement has been or is prior to or substantially concurrently
terminated in accordance with its terms.

 



 

(v) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.4_ shall prohibit the Board of
Directors of the Company from: (A) taking and disclosing to the stockholders
of the Company a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item
1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act, or (B) making
any "stop, look and listen" communication to the stockholders of the Company
pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act; _provided_ that
the foregoing clause (A) or (B) shall not permit the Board of Directors of the
Company to make any Change in Recommendation except as permitted by _Section
5.4(b)(iv)_.

 



 

(c) The Company agrees that (i) it will and will cause its Subsidiaries, and
its and their Representatives to, cease immediately and terminate any and all
existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any third parties
conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) it will
not release any third party from, or waive any provisions of, any
confidentiality or standstill agreement to which it or any of its Subsidiaries
is a party with respect to any Acquisition Proposal except to the extent a
failure to do so would be inconsistent with the directors respective duties
under applicable Law, (iii) promptly after the date hereof, it will request
that each Person that has previously executed a confidentiality agreement
relating to an Acquisition Proposal or a potential Acquisition Proposal
destroy or return all non-public information provided under such
confidentiality agreement and (iv) it will promptly terminate the access of
any third party to electronic datasite or data room established in connection
with any such confidentiality agreement.

 



 

(d) The Company shall not submit to the vote of its stockholders any
Acquisition Proposal other than the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby prior to the termination of this Agreement in accordance
with its terms.

the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in connection with the Merger
to be approved for listing on the NYSE, subject to official notice of
issuance.

 



 

Section 5.6 _Employee Matters_.

 



 

(a) For a period of one (1) year following the Effective Time (the "
_Continuation Period_ "), Parent shall provide, or shall cause to be provided,
to each employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries who continues to be
employed by Parent or its Subsidiaries following the Effective Time (the "
_Continuing Employees_ "), for so long as such Continuing Employee is employed
following the Effective Time, (i) an annual base salary or wage rate that is
no less favorable to such Continuing Employee than the annual base salary or
wage rate provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the
Effective Time; (ii) an annual cash bonus opportunity that is no less than the
annual cash bonus opportunity that was provided to such Continuing Employee
immediately prior to the Effective Time; and (iii) employee benefits that are
no less favorable in the aggregate than those provided to similarly situated
employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries; _provided_ that, for purposes of
this clause (iii), the

 



     

 

 



 

employee benefits generally provided to Company Employees as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be deemed to be no less favorable in the
aggregate to those provided to similarly situated employees of Parent and its
Subsidiaries, it being understood that the Continuing Employees may commence
participation in the "employee benefit plans," as defined in Section 3(3) of
ERISA (whether or not subject to ERISA), maintained by Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _New Plans_ ") at such times as are
determined by Parent. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Agreement
shall require Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to employ any Person.

 



 

(b) For purposes of any New Plans providing benefits to any Continuing
Employees after the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause its
applicable Subsidiary to: (i) waive all pre-existing conditions, exclusions
and waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements
applicable to the Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents under any
New Plans in which such employees may be eligible to participate after the
Effective Time, except, with respect to pre-existing conditions or exclusions,
to the extent such pre-existing conditions or exclusions would apply under the
analogous Company Benefit Plan; (ii) use commercially reasonable efforts to
provide each Continuing Employee and his or her eligible dependents under any
New Plan with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid during the
portion of the plan year of the corresponding Company Benefit Plan ending on
the date such Continuing Employees participation in the New Plan begins (to
the same extent that such credit was given under the analogous Company Benefit
Plan prior to the date that the Continuing Employee first participates in the
New Plan) in satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket
requirements under the New Plan; and (iii) recognize all service of the
Continuing Employees with the Company and its Subsidiaries (and any
predecessors or Affiliates thereof), for all purposes in any New Plan in which
such employees may be eligible to participate after the Effective Time to the
same extent such service was taken into account under the analogous Company
Benefit Plan prior to the date that the Continuing Employee first participates
in the New Plan; _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing clause (iii)
shall not apply (A) to the extent it would result in duplication of benefits,
or (B) for any purpose with respect to any defined benefit pension plan,
postretirement welfare plan or any New Plan under which similarly situated
employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries do not receive credit for prior
service or that is grandfathered or frozen, either with respect to level of
benefits or participation.

 



 

(c) If requested by Parent not less than ten (10) Business Days before the
Closing Date, the Company shall adopt board resolutions and take such
corporate action as is necessary to terminate the Company Benefit Plans that
are Tax-qualified defined contribution plans with a cash or deferred
arrangement under Section 401(k) of the Code (collectively, the " _Company
Qualified DC Plan_ "), effective as of the day prior to the Closing Date but
contingent on the occurrence of the Closing. The form and substance of such
resolutions and any other actions taken in connection with the foregoing
termination shall be subject to the review and approval of Parent. Upon the
distribution of the assets in the accounts under the Company Qualified DC Plan
to the participants, Parent shall permit such participants who are then
actively employed by Parent or its Subsidiaries to make rollover contributions
of "eligible rollover distributions" (within the meaning of Section 401(a)(31)
of the Code), in the form of cash, from the Company Qualified DC Plan to the
applicable Tax-qualified defined contribution plans of Parent or its
Subsidiaries.

 



     

 

 



 

(d) Neither Parent, the Company nor any of their respective Subsidiaries
shall, and each of Parent and the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to
cause its and its respective Subsidiaries Representatives not to, prior to
the Effective Time:

 



 

(i) in the case of Parent (and its Subsidiaries or Representatives acting on
their behalf), directly or indirectly solicit for employment or employ or
cause to leave the employ of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
Affiliates any individual designated in writing by the Company to Parent on
Section 5.6(d)(i) of the Company Disclosure Letter; or

 



 

(ii) in the case of the Company (and its Subsidiaries or Representatives
acting on their behalf), directly or indirectly solicit for employment or
employ or cause to leave the employ of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or
Affiliates any individual designated in writing by Parent to the Company on
_Section 5.6(d)(ii)_ of the Parent Disclosure Letter.

 



 

(e) The provisions of this _Section 5.6_ are solely for the benefit of the
Parties. No current or former director, officer, employee or other service
provider or any other person shall be a third-party beneficiary of this
Agreement, and nothing herein shall be construed as an amendment to any Parent
Benefit Plan, Company Benefit Plan or other compensation or benefit plan or
arrangement for any purpose. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing
in this _Section 5.6_, nothing contained in this Agreement shall otherwise
obligate Parent, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates to (i)
maintain any particular Benefit Plan or (ii) retain the employment or services
of any current or former director, employee or other service provider.

 



 

Section 5.7 _Fees and Expenses_. Whether or not the Merger is consummated, all
costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby shall be paid by the Party
incurring such expense, except as otherwise provided in _Section 7.2_ and
except that expenses incurred in connection with filing, printing and mailing
the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus and the Form S-4 (other than legal fees)
shall be shared equally by the Company and Parent.

 



 

Section 5.8 _Governance_. Parent shall take such actions as are necessary to
cause the Company Designees to become members of the Board of Directors of
Parent immediately after the Effective Time.

 



 

Section 5.9 _Indemnification and D andO Insurance_.

 



 

(a) For six years from and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to, indemnify and hold harmless all past and
present directors and officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries
(collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") against any costs or expenses
(including advancing attorneys fees and expenses in advance of the final
disposition of any actual or threatened claim, suit, proceeding or
investigation to each Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law; _provided_ such Indemnified Party agrees in advance to return
any such funds to which a court of competent jurisdiction has determined in a
final, nonappealable judgment such Indemnified Party is not ultimately
entitled), judgments, fines, penalties, losses, claims, damages, liabilities
and amounts paid in settlement in

 



     

 

 



 

connection with any actual or threatened claim, action, investigation, suit or
proceeding in respect of acts or omissions occurring or alleged to have
occurred at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior
to, at or after the Effective Time (including acts or omissions occurring in
connection with the approval of this Agreement and the consummation of the
Merger), in connection with such Indemnified Parties serving or having served
as a director, officer, employee, agent or other fiduciary of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or of any other Person if such service was at the
request or for the benefit of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, in each
case to the fullest extent permitted by Law and to the same extent that the
Company or its Subsidiaries would have been permitted to do so pursuant to the
Organizational Documents of the Company or its Subsidiaries, as applicable.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any Indemnified Party
notifies Parent or the Surviving Corporation on or prior to the sixth
anniversary of the Effective Time of a matter in respect of which such Person
may seek indemnification or advancement pursuant to this _Section 5.9_, the
provisions of this _Section 5.9_ shall continue in effect with respect to
such matter until the final disposition of all claims, actions,
investigations, suits and proceedings relating thereto.

 



 

(b) For six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, maintain in effect the provisions in (i) the
Organizational Documents of the Company and any Subsidiary of the Company and
(ii) except to the extent such agreement provides for an earlier termination,
any other agreements (other than insurance contracts) of the Company and its
Subsidiaries with any Indemnified Party, in each case, regarding elimination
of liability, indemnification of officers, directors, agents and employees and
advancement of expenses that are in existence on the date of this Agreement,
to the extent such agreements have been made available to Parent prior to the
date of this Agreement, and no such provision shall be amended, modified or
repealed in any manner that would materially and adversely affect the rights
or protections thereunder of any such Indemnified Party in respect of acts or
omissions occurring or alleged to have occurred at or prior to the Effective
Time (including acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of
this Agreement and the consummation of the Merger).

 



 

(c) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, obtain as of
the Effective Time a six-year prepaid "tail" policy or policies for the
extension of the directors and officers liability coverage of the Companys
existing directors and officers liability insurance policies and fiduciary
liability insurance policies, in each case for a claims reporting or discovery
period of six years from and after the Effective Time, on terms and conditions
providing coverage retentions, limits and other material terms substantially
equivalent to the current policies of directors and officers liability
insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by the Company with
respect to matters arising on or before the Effective Time, including acts or
omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement and the
consummation of the Merger; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, as applicable, shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain the most favorable pricing and most comprehensive coverage
reasonably available for such "tail" policy and Parent or Surviving
Corporation, as applicable, shall not be required to commit or spend on such
"tail" policy more than 300% of the last aggregate annual premium paid by the
Company prior to the date of this Agreement for the Companys current policies
of directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability
insurance (the " _Base Amount_ "), and if the cost of such "tail" policy would
otherwise exceed the Base Amount, Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as
applicable, shall be permitted to purchase

 



     

 

 



 

as much coverage as reasonably practicable for the Base Amount. In lieu of
Parents or the Surviving Corporations purchase of the "tail" policy as
contemplated in the immediately foregoing sentence, the Company may purchase,
prior to the Effective Time, a prepaid "tail" policy or policies for the
extension of the directors and officers liability coverage of the Companys
existing directors and officers liability insurance policies and fiduciary
liability insurance policies, in each case for a claims reporting or discovery
period of six years from and after the Effective Time, on terms and conditions
providing coverage retentions, limits and other material terms substantially
equivalent to the current policies of directors and officers liability
insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by the Company with
respect to matters arising on or before the Effective Time (including acts,
errors or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this
Agreement and the consummation of the Merger), and in which event Parent and
the Surviving Corporation shall cease to have any obligations under the first
sentence of this Section 5.9(c); _provided_ , _however_ , that the aggregate
premium for such policy shall not exceed the Base Amount. After the Effective
Time, Parent shall cause such "tail" policy to be maintained in full force and
effect, for its full term, and cause all obligations thereunder to be honored
by the Surviving Corporation and, subject to Parents compliance with its
obligations under this _Section 5.9(c)_, no Party shall have any other
obligation to purchase or pay for any insurance hereunder.

 



 

(d) If Parent (or the Surviving Corporation) or any of its successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be
the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent (or the
Surviving Corporation) shall assume the obligations set forth in this _Section
5.9_.

 



 

(e) The provisions of this _Section 5.9_ (i) are intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, and (ii) are
in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to
indemnification or contribution that any such person may have by contract or
otherwise.

 



 

Section 5.10 _Dividends_.

 



 

(a) It is agreed that (A) the Parties shall take such actions as are necessary
to ensure that the timing of any regular quarterly dividend paid by either the
Company or Parent prior to the Closing will be coordinated so that, if either
the holders of Company Common Stock or the holders of Parent Common Stock
receive a distribution for a particular quarter prior to the Closing Date,
then the holders of Parent Common Stock and the holders of Company Common
Stock, respectively, shall also receive a distribution for such quarter prior
to the Closing Date and (B) the Parties will coordinate such that any such
quarterly distribution by the Company and Parent shall have the same record
date and the same payment date, which shall be consistent with Parents
historical record dates and payment dates unless otherwise agreed between the
Parties, in order to ensure that the stockholders of the Company and the
stockholders of Parent receive the same number of such dividends prior to the
Effective Time (provided that the amount of any such quarterly dividend
declared by the Company must be consistent with _Section 4.1(b)(iv)_ and the
amount of any such quarterly dividend declared by Parent must be consistent
with _Section 4.2(b)(iv)_).

 



     

 

 



 

(b) If the Company (in consultation with Parent) determines that it is
necessary to declare a Special Company Distribution in accordance with
_Section 4.1(b)(iv)_ or if Parent (in consultation with the Company)
determines that it is necessary to declare a Special Parent Distribution in
accordance with _Section 4.2(b)(iv)_, such Party shall notify the other Party
in writing at least 10 Business Days prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting
and the Parent Stockholders Meeting, and such other Party shall be entitled to
declare a dividend per share payable (i) in the case of the Company, to
holders of shares of Company Common Stock, in an amount per share equal to the
product of (A) the Special Parent Distribution declared by Parent with respect
to each share of Parent Common Stock and (B) the Exchange Ratio and (ii) in
the case of Parent, to holders of shares of Parent Common Stock, in an amount
per share equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the Special Company
Distribution declared by the Company with respect to each share of Company
Common Stock by (y) the Exchange Ratio. The record date and payment date for
any dividend payable pursuant to this _Section 5.10(b)_ shall be the close of
business on the last Business Day prior to the Closing Date.

 



 

(c) In the event that a dividend or distribution with respect to the shares of
Company Common Stock permitted under the terms of this Agreement has (i) a
record date prior to the Effective Time and (ii) has not been paid as of the
Effective Time, the holders of shares of Company Common Stock shall be
entitled to receive such dividend or distribution pursuant to and in
accordance with _Section 2.2_.

 



 

Section 5.11 _Public Announcements_. Except (a) for communications consistent
with the final form of joint press release announcing the Merger and the
investor presentation given to investors on the date of announcement of the
Merger, (b) as may be required by applicable Law or by obligations pursuant to
any listing agreement with or rules of the NYSE or (c) pursuant to the
Companys or Parents rights pursuant to _Section 5.4_, the Company and
Parent shall consult with each other, and provide meaningful opportunity for
review and give due consideration to reasonable comment by the other Party,
prior to issuing any press releases or other public communications with
respect to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 



 

Section 5.12 _Tax Matters_.

 



 

(a) The Company and Parent agree to use their respective reasonable best
efforts to cause the Merger to qualify as a "reorganization" within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. Subject to the receipt of the opinions
described in _Section 6.2(c)_ and _6.3(c)_ , the parties shall treat the
Merger as a tax-free "reorganization" under Section 368(a) of the Code and no
party shall take any position for tax purposes inconsistent therewith, except
to the extent otherwise required pursuant to a "determination" within the
meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code.

 



 

(b) Parent shall, with the Companys good faith cooperation and assistance,
prepare, execute and file, or cause to be prepared, executed and filed, all
returns, questionnaires, applications or other documents regarding any real
property transfer, sales, use, transfer, value added, stock transfer,
recording, registration stamp or similar Taxes that become payable in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (collectively,
" _Transfer_

 



     

 

 



 

 _Taxes_ ") and Parent and the Company shall cooperate to use commercially
reasonable efforts to minimize the amount of Transfer Taxes to the extent
permitted by applicable Law.

 



 

(c) The Company and Parent shall cooperate and consult in good faith with each
other with respect to maintenance of the REIT status of the Company and Parent
(and any of their Subsidiaries that is a REIT) for the Companys and Parents
2019 taxable year (and that of any of their Subsidiaries that is a REIT).

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, upon Parents written
request, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause (x) any
Subsidiary that is treated as a QRS of (1) the Company or (2) any Subsidiary
of the Company that is a REIT (a " _Subsidiary REIT_ ") and (y) any Subsidiary
set forth in Section 5.12(d) of the Company Disclosure Letter (each such
Subsidiary identified in such written request, a " _Converted Entity_ ") to
(i) convert into a limited liability company (or other entity that is
disregarded as an entity separate from the Company or such Subsidiary REIT, as
applicable, for U.S. federal income tax purposes) (a " _Disregarded Entity_
"), (ii) merge with and into a Disregarded Entity, and/or (iii) make an
election under Treasury Regulations Section 301.7701-3(c) to be disregarded as
an entity separate from its owner for U.S. federal income tax purposes, as
applicable, in each case, such that, prior to and at the Effective Time, for
U.S. federal income tax purposes, such Converted Entity is a Disregarded
Entity (and would be a Disregarded Entity without regard to its status as a
QRS). Within ten (10) days of receiving any such written request, the Company
shall notify Parent in writing of any Subsidiary identified in such request
with respect to which a conversion, merger, and/or election, as applicable,
cannot occur prior to the Effective Time.

 



 

Section 5.13 _Financing Cooperation_.

 



 

(a) The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and shall cause
its and their Representatives to, provide all cooperation reasonably requested
by Parent in connection with financing arrangements (including, without
limitation, assumptions, guarantees, amendments, supplements, modifications,
refinancings, replacements, repayments, terminations or prepayments of
existing financing arrangements) as Parent may reasonably determine necessary
or advisable in connection with the completion of the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated hereby. Such cooperation shall include (i)
participating in a reasonable number of meetings, presentations and due
diligence sessions in connection with such financing arrangements, (ii)
providing reasonable and timely assistance with the preparation of materials
for presentations, offering memoranda, prospectuses and similar documents
required in connection with such financing arrangements, (iii) as promptly as
reasonably practical, and in any event at least 10 days prior to the Closing
Date, furnishing Parent and any of its financing sources with (A) unaudited
condensed consolidated balance sheets and related condensed consolidated
statements of operations, comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash
flows (in each case, subject to normal year-end adjustments and absence of
footnotes) for the Company for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2019 and
each subsequent fiscal quarter ended on a date that is not a fiscal year end
and that is at least 40 days before the Closing Date and (B) in the event that
the Closing Date occurs on a date that is more than 60 days following December
31, 2019, audited consolidated balance sheets and related audited consolidated
statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), changes in equity and
cash flows for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, in each case prepared
in accordance with GAAP and (iv) to the extent

 



     

 

 



 

requested in writing at least ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing,
delivering at least three Business Days prior to the Closing all documentation
and other information with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries that
are required by regulatory authorities under applicable "know-your-customer"
rules and regulations, including the USA PATRIOT Act. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective
Representatives shall not be required to enter into any letter, certificate,
document, agreement or instrument (other than customary authorization and
representation letters) that will be effective prior to the Closing and
nothing in this _Section 5.13_ shall require (x) such cooperation to the
extent it would disrupt unreasonably the business or operations of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries or require any of them to take any actions that
would reasonably be expected to violate applicable Law, contract or
Organizational Documents, (y) the Board of Directors of the Company or the
Board of Directors or similar governing body of any Subsidiary of the Company
to adopt resolutions approving any letter, certificate, document, agreement or
instrument (other than customary authorization and representation letters to
the extent necessary) that will be effective prior to the Closing or (z) the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to incur any liability (including due to
any act or omission by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective Representatives) prior to the Closing for which it has not received
prior reimbursement or is not otherwise indemnified by or on behalf of Parent.
It is understood and agreed that a failure to consummate a financing of the
type described in the first sentence of this _Section 5.13(a)_ shall not, in
and of itself, constitute a failure by the Company to satisfy its obligations
under this _Section 5.13(a)_.

 



 

(b) The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use commercially
reasonable efforts to, as soon as reasonably practicable after (and not prior
to) the receipt of a written request from Parent to do so, on the terms and
conditions specified by Parent and in compliance with all applicable terms and
conditions of the applicable Company Debt Agreement, seek an amendment or
amendments to any of the Company Debt Agreements or pursue any approach chosen
by Parent to the assumption, defeasance, satisfaction and discharge,
constructive satisfaction and discharge, refinancing, repayment, repurchase,
redemption, termination, amendment, guarantee, purchase, unwinding or other
treatment of, the Company Debt Agreements and the indebtedness incurred
pursuant thereto, in each case, subject to the occurrence of the Closing (any
such transaction, a " _Debt Transaction_ "). The Company shall not be
required to take any action in respect of any Debt Transaction until Parent
shall have provided the Company with drafts of any necessary documentation
required in connection with such Debt Transaction in a form reasonably
satisfactory to the Company (collectively, the " _Debt Transaction Documents_
") at least three (3) Business Days prior to the date of such requested
action. The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries to use commercially reasonable efforts to, cause its
and their respective Representatives to provide cooperation and assistance
reasonably requested by Parent in connection with the Debt Transactions
(including taking all corporate action reasonably necessary to authorize the
execution and delivery of any Debt Transaction Documents to be entered into
prior to Closing and delivering all officers certificates and legal opinions
required to be delivered in connection therewith (such corporate action,
execution and delivery not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned)); _provided_ , that the effectiveness of any such Debt
Transaction Documents or, in the case of a notice of prepayment or redemption,
such prepayment or redemption, shall be expressly conditioned on the Closing.
It is understood and

 



      

 

 



 

agreed that a failure to effectuate any Debt Transaction shall not constitute
a failure by the Company to satisfy its obligations under this _Section
5.13(b)_.

 



 

(c) The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, after (and not
prior to) the receipt of a written request from Parent to do so, deliver all
notices and take all other actions to facilitate the termination at the
Effective Time of all commitments in respect of each of the Company Credit
Facility and any other indebtedness of the Company or its Subsidiaries to be
paid off, discharged and terminated on the Closing Date as specifically
requested by Parent in writing, the repayment in full on the Closing Date of
all obligations in respect of the indebtedness thereunder, and the release on
the Closing Date of any Liens securing such indebtedness and guarantees in
connection therewith. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing,
the Company and its Subsidiaries shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
deliver to Parent (i) at least 10 Business Days prior to the Closing Date (or
such short period as agreed by Parent), a draft payoff letter with respect to
each of the Company Credit Facility and (to the extent requested by the Parent
to the Company in writing) any other indebtedness (including mortgages) of the
Company or its Subsidiaries to be paid off, discharged and terminated on the
Closing Date and (ii) at least one Business Day prior to the Closing Date, an
executed payoff letter with respect to each of the Company Credit Facility
(the " _Payoff Letters_ ") and such other indebtedness (including mortgages)
of the Company or its Subsidiaries to be paid off, discharged and terminated
on the Closing Date, in each case in form and substance customary for
transactions of this type, from the Persons (or the applicable agent on behalf
of the Persons) to whom such indebtedness is owed, which Payoff Letters
together with any related release documentation shall, among other things, (x)
include the payoff amount (including customary per diem) and (y) provide that
Liens (and guarantees), if any, granted in connection with the Company Credit
Facility or any such other indebtedness of the Company to be paid off,
discharged and terminated on the Closing Date relating to the assets, rights
and properties of the Company and its Subsidiaries securing or relating to
such indebtedness, shall, upon the payment of the amount set forth in the
applicable Payoff Letter at or prior to the Effective Time, be released and
terminated.

 



 

Section 5.14 _Transaction Litigation_. The Company shall promptly notify
Parent in writing of any litigation related to this Agreement, the Merger or
the other transactions contemplated hereby that is brought or, to the
knowledge of the Company, threatened in writing, against the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, directors, officers or employees (" _Company Transaction
Litigation_ "), and shall give Parent the opportunity to participate in the
defense or settlement of any Company Transaction Litigation. The Company shall
not settle, agree to any undertakings or approve or otherwise agree to any
waiver that may be sought in connection with such Company Transaction
Litigation without the prior written consent of Parent (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), subject to _Section
5.14_ of the Company Disclosure Letter.

 



 

Section 5.15 _Director Resignations_. The Company shall cause to be delivered
to Parent resignations executed by each director of the Company in office as
of immediately prior to the Effective Time and effective upon the Effective
Time.

 



 

Section 5.16 _Delisting_. Each of the Parties agrees to cooperate with the
other Party in taking, or causing to be taken, all actions necessary to delist
the Company Common Stock from

 



     

 

 



 

the NYSE and terminate its registration under the Exchange Act; _provided_
that such delisting and termination shall not be effective until after the
Effective Time.

 



 

Section 5.17 _Rule 16b-3 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Parties
shall, as applicable, take all such steps as may be reasonably necessary or
advisable, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, to cause any
dispositions of Company equity securities (including derivative securities)
and acquisitions of Parent equity securities pursuant to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who is a director or officer
of the Company subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the
Exchange Act with respect to the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 



 

Section 5.18 _Treatment of Operating Partnership_. Prior to the Effective
Time, the Company shall, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries to,
cooperate with reasonable requests by Parent in connection with the
contemplated post-closing transactions involving the Company Operating
Partnership; _provided_ , however, that, notwithstanding the foregoing, this
shall not obligate the Company and Company Subsidiaries to enter into any
contracts or obligations binding on them that would become effective prior to
the Effective Time or to incur any out-of-pocket costs or expenses (unless
such costs or expenses will be promptly reimbursed by Parent) in connection
with its cooperation with Parents requests.

 



 

Section 5.19 _Certain Loan Matters_. The Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause, on or prior to the Effective Time, either (i) the repayment
and termination in full of the indebtedness listed on _Section 5.19_ of the
Company Disclosure Letter (the " _Applicable Loans_ ") (and, to the extent
that the borrower of any such Applicable Loan is not the Company or one of its
wholly-owned Subsidiaries, the repayment and termination will be funded on a
pro rata basis by the Company or its applicable subsidiaries, on the one hand,
and the other equity holders of the borrower, on the other) or (ii) so long as
the property securing an Applicable Loan is not sold prior to the Effective
Time, the amendment of such Applicable Loan to expressly permit the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated hereby (or the obtaining of a consent or
waiver with the same effect), which amendment, consent or waiver shall be in
form and substance reasonably satisfactory to each of Parent and the Company.
In connection with the foregoing clause (i), the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to provide to Parent customary evidence of the
effectiveness of such repayment and termination, and corresponding customary
termination and release documents (including a customary payoff letter from
the lenders and customary lien release documents). The Company shall keep
Parent reasonably informed on the treatment of the Applicable Loans and shall
provide Parent with such related information and documents as Parent shall
reasonably request from time-to-time.

expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse
Effect.

 



 

(b) _Performance of Company Obligations_. The Company shall have performed in
all material respects the obligations required to be performed by it under
this Agreement at or prior to the Closing.

its special counsel, Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen and Katz (or another nationally
recognized law firm reasonably satisfactory to Parent), dated as of the
Closing Date and in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent, to
the effect that, on the basis of facts, representations and assumptions set
forth or referred to in such opinion, the Merger will qualify as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, which
opinion will be subject to customary exceptions, assumptions and
qualifications (it being agreed and understood that any exceptions,
assumptions and qualifications set forth in the draft opinion delivered to
Goodwin Procter LLP on or prior to the date hereof shall be deemed to be
customary for this purpose). In rendering such opinion, Wachtell, Lipton,
Rosen and Katz (or, if applicable, another nationally recognized law firm
reasonably satisfactory to Parent) may rely upon the Parent Tax Representation
Letter and the Company Tax Representation Letter.

 



 

(d) _REIT Opinion_. Parent shall have received a tax opinion of Companys REIT
Counsel, dated as of the Closing Date and addressed to the Company, in form
and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent, to the effect that, at all
times since its taxable year ended December 31, 2010 and through the taxable
year that ends with the Effective Time, the Company has been organized and
operated in conformity with the requirements for qualification and taxation as
a REIT under the Code, which opinion will be subject to customary exceptions,
assumptions and qualifications (it being agreed and understood that any
exceptions, assumptions and qualifications set forth in the draft opinion
delivered to Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen and Katz on or prior to the date hereof
shall be deemed to be customary for this purpose). In rendering such opinion,
Companys REIT Counsel may rely upon customary representations contained in an
officers certificate executed by the Company and provided pursuant to
_Section 4.1(d)_.

 



     

 

 



 

(e) _Closing Certificate_. Parent shall have received a certificate signed on
behalf of the Company by the Chief Executive Officer or the Chief Financial

satisfied.

(b) by either Parent or the Company, if any Governmental Entity of competent
jurisdiction shall have issued an order, decree or ruling in each case
permanently enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the Merger,
and such order, decree or ruling has become final and nonappealable;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement under this
_Section 7.1_ _(b)_ shall not be available to any Party whose failure to
comply with any provision of this Agreement has been the principal cause of or
resulted in such order, decree or ruling;

 



 

(c) by either Parent or the Company, if the Merger shall not have been
consummated by 5:00 p.m., New York time, on October 31, 2019 (the " _Outside

the Company of its obligations pursuant to _Section 5.4_;

 



 

(e) by the Company, if Parent shall have breached or failed to perform any of
its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement, or if any representation or warranty of Parent shall have become
untrue, which breach or failure to perform or to be true (i) would result in
the failure of any of the conditions set forth in _Section 6.2(a)_ or

agreements set forth in this Agreement such that the conditions set forth in
_Section 6.3(a)_ or _Section 6.3(b)_ cannot be satisfied;

 



 

(f) by Parent, if the Company shall have breached or failed to perform any of
its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement (other than with respect to a Willful Breach of _Section 5.4_, as
to which _Section 7.1(d)_ will apply), or if any

 



     

 

 



 

representation or warranty of the Company shall have become untrue, which

any of the conditions set forth in _Section 6.3(a)_ or _Section 6.3(b)_ to
be satisfied and (ii) cannot be cured by the Outside Date or, if curable prior

(g) by either Parent or the Company, if the Company Required Vote shall not

understood that the Company shall enter into a definitive Acquisition
Agreement with respect to the Superior Proposal substantially concurrently
with the termination of this Agreement); _provided_ , that the Company
Termination Fee shall be paid pursuant to _Section 7.2(b)_ prior to or
concurrently with the termination of this Agreement by the Company pursuant to
this _Section 7.1(i)_;

 



 

Section 7.2 _Effect of Termination_.

 



 

(a) In the event of termination of this Agreement by either the Company or
Parent as provided in _Section 7.1_, written notice thereof shall forthwith
be given to the other Party specifying the provision hereof pursuant to which
such termination is made, and this Agreement shall forthwith become null and
void and there shall be no liability or obligation on the part of the Company
or Parent or their respective directors or Representatives, except as provided
under _Section 7.2(f)_ and except with respect to _Section 5.7_, _Section
5.11_, this _Section 7.2_ and _Article VIII_ and except for the
Confidentiality Agreement, each of which shall survive such termination and
except that no Party shall be relieved or released from any liabilities or
damages arising out of its fraud or Willful Breach of this Agreement.

 



 

(b) _Company Termination Fee_.

 



 

(i) If Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(d)(i)_, then
the Company shall pay to Parent the Company Termination Fee within two
Business Days after the date of such termination.

 



 

(ii) In the event that (A) an Acquisition Proposal with respect to the Company
shall have been communicated to the Board of Directors of the Company or any
Person or group of Persons shall have publicly made an Acquisition Proposal
with respect to the Company (and, in the case of termination pursuant to
_Section 7.1(g)_, such

 



     

 

 



 

Acquisition Proposal shall not have been publicly withdrawn at least five
Business Days prior to the date of the Company Stockholders Meeting), (B)
thereafter this Agreement is terminated (1) by Parent pursuant to Section
7.1(d)(ii), (2) by Parent or the Company pursuant to _Section 7.1(c)_ (if the
Company Required Vote has not theretofore been obtained) or _Section 7.1(g)_
or (3) by Parent pursuant to _Section 7.1(f)_ and (C) before the date that is
12 months after the date of such termination, the Company consummates a
transaction of a type set forth in the definition of "Acquisition Proposal" or
enters into an Acquisition Agreement, then the Company shall, on the earlier
of the date such Acquisition Proposal is consummated or any such Acquisition
Agreement is entered into, pay to Parent the Company Termination Fee (
_provided_ that, for purposes of clause (C) above, each reference to "15%" in
the definitions of "Acquisition Proposal" and "Acquisition Agreement" shall be
deemed to be a reference to "50%").

 



 

(iii) If the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(i)_,
then the Company shall prior to or substantially concurrently with such
termination pay to Parent the Company Termination Fee.

 



 

(c) Any amount that becomes payable pursuant to _Section 7.2(b)_ shall be
paid by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated
by Parent. In no event shall this _Section 7.2_ require the Company to pay
the Company Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

 



 

(d) If Parent decides to apply for a ruling from the IRS with respect to the
tax consequences of the receipt of the Company Termination Fee, the Company
shall cooperate with Parent and use commercially reasonable efforts to provide
assistance (if any) requested by Parent with respect thereto.

 



 

(e) The payment of the Company Termination Fee shall be compensation and
liquidated damages for the loss suffered by Parent as a result of the failure
of the Merger to be consummated and to avoid the difficulty of determining
damages under the circumstances and neither Party shall have any other
liability to the other after the payment of the Company Termination Fee,
except in the case of fraud or a Willful Breach. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement, if the Company Termination Fee shall become
due and payable in connection with this _Section 7.2_, from and after such
termination and payment of the Company Termination Fee pursuant to this
_Section 7.2_, the Company shall have no further liability of any kind for
any reason in connection with this Agreement, the transactions contemplated
hereby or the termination of this Agreement, other than as provided in this
_Section 7.2_ and except in the case of fraud or a Willful Breach. Each of
the Parties acknowledges that the Company Termination Fee is not intended to
be a penalty, but rather represents liquidated damages in a reasonable amount
that will compensate Parent in the circumstances in which such Company
Termination Fee is due and payable and which do not involve fraud or Willful
Breach, for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone
while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the
expectation of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with
precision. Each of the Parties acknowledges that the agreements contained in
this _Section 7.2_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and that, without these agreements, the Company, Parent and
Merger Sub would not enter into this

 



     

 

 



 

Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company fails to pay all amounts due to Parent
under this _Section 7.2_ on the dates specified, then the Company shall pay
all costs and expenses (including legal fees and expenses) incurred by Parent
in connection with any action or proceeding (including the filing of any
lawsuit) taken by it to collect such unpaid amounts, together with interest on
such unpaid amounts at the prime lending rate prevailing at such time, as
published in _The Wall Street Journal_ , from the date such amounts were
required to be paid until the date actually received by Parent.

 



 

(f) The " _Company Termination Fee_ " shall be an amount equal to the lesser
of (i) $45,450,000 (the " _Company Base Amount_ ") and (ii) the maximum
amount, if any, that can be paid to Parent without causing it to fail to meet
the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code (the " _REIT
Requirements_ ") for such year determined as if the payment of such amount did
not constitute Qualifying Income, as determined by independent accountants to
Parent (taking into account any known or anticipated income of Parent which is
not Qualifying Income and any appropriate "cushion" as determined by such
accountants). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event Parent receives Tax
Guidance providing that Parents receipt of the Company Base Amount would
either constitute Qualifying Income or would be excluded from gross income
within the meaning of the REIT Requirements, the Company Termination Fee shall
be an amount equal to the Company Base Amount and the Company shall, upon
receiving notice that Parent has received the Tax Guidance, pay to Parent the
unpaid Company Base Amount within five Business Days. In the event that Parent
is not able to receive the full Company Base Amount due to the above
limitations, the Company shall place the unpaid amount in escrow by wire
transfer within three days of termination and shall not release any portion
thereof to Parent unless and until Parent receives Tax Guidance providing that
Parents receipt of the unpaid Companys Base Amount would either constitute
Qualifying Income or would be excluded from gross income within the meaning of
the REIT Requirements, in which event the Company shall pay to Parent the
unpaid Company Base Amount within five Business Days after the Company has
been notified thereof. The obligation of the Company to pay any unpaid portion
of the Company Termination Fee shall terminate on the December 31 following
the date which is five years from the date of this Agreement. Amounts
remaining in escrow after the obligation of the Company to pay the Company
Termination Fee terminates shall be released to the Company. " _Qualifying
Income_ " shall mean income described in Sections 856(c)(2)(A)(H) and
856(c)(3)(A)(I) of the Code. " _Tax Guidance_ " shall mean a reasoned opinion
from counsel or other tax advisor or a ruling from the IRS.

Section 8.8 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement which is

in _Section 8.3_ or in such other manner as may be permitted by Law shall be
valid and sufficient service thereof. The consent to jurisdiction set forth in

process in the State of Maryland and shall have no effect for any purpose
except as provided in this _Section 8.10_. The Parties agree that a final
judgment in any such suit, action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be
enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner
provided by Law.

this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement in any court

 



     

 

 



 

identified in the Section above, this being in addition to any other remedy to
which they are entitled at law or in equity. Each of the Parties agrees that
it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and
other equitable relief on the basis that any other Party has an adequate
remedy at law or that any award of specific performance is not an appropriate
remedy for any reason at law or in equity. The Parties further agree that no
Party to this Agreement shall be required to obtain, secure, furnish or post
any bond, security or similar instrument in connection with or as a condition
to obtaining any remedy referred to in this _Section 8.11_ and each Party

to require the obtaining, securing, furnishing or posting of any such bond,
security or similar instrument.
