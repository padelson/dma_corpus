Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that the agreements contained in

any indemnification or payment to which this Article Nine purports to entitle
such person, and any Covered Person who has no separate contact of any kind with
the corporation shall be entitled to receive all indemnification, payments and
other benefits which the provisions in this Article Nine other than this
