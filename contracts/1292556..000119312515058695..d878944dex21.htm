Section 1.01. _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the applicable provisions of
the Delaware General Corporation Law (the " _DGCL_ "), at the Effective Time,
Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company and become an indirect

the Closing), or on such other date and at such other time and place as the

to herein as the " _Closing Date_ ". In no event will the consummation of the
Merger occur unless the Carve-Out Transaction has been consummated, and in no

Merger is consummated immediately thereafter.

 

(b) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, as soon as
practicable on the Closing Date, the parties shall cause the Merger to be
consummated by filing with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware a
certificate of merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ "), executed in
accordance with, and containing such information as is required by,
the applicable provisions of the DGCL. The Merger shall become effective at
such time as the Certificate of Merger is filed with the Secretary of State of
the State of Delaware, or at such later time as Parent and the Company shall
agree and specify in the Certificate of Merger. The time the Merger becomes
effective is referred to herein as the " _Effective Time_."

 

Section 1.03. _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set
forth in this Agreement and in the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without

Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities, obligations and duties of
the Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities, obligations
and duties of the Surviving Corporation, all as provided for herein and in the
applicable provisions of the DGCL.

the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter
amended in accordance with applicable Law.

 

(b) Subject to Section 6.04, at the Effective Time, the Company Bylaws shall
be amended and restated to be identical to the bylaws of Merger Sub in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, and as so amended and restated shall
be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in
accordance with applicable Law.

 

Section 1.05. _Directors and Officers_. Except as otherwise determined by
Parent prior to the Effective Time, the directors and officers of Merger Sub
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall from and after the Effective
Time be the directors and officers, respectively, of the Surviving

in accordance with _Section 2.01(a)(ii)_) shall be converted into the right
to receive $60.50 in cash without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ ");

(ii) each share of Company Common Stock that immediately prior to the
Effective Time is owned by Parent, Merger Sub, the Company (as treasury stock
or otherwise) or any of their respective Subsidiaries shall be canceled
without any consideration being exchanged therefor; and

 

(iii) each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub
that immediately prior to the Effective Time is issued and outstanding shall
be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable
share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving
Corporation.

 

(b) All of the shares of Company Common Stock converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to this  _Article II_ shall no
longer be outstanding, and shall

 



3  automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, as of the Effective
Time, and each certificate (each, a " _Certificate_ ") or book-entry share
(each, a " _Book-Entry Share_ ") previously representing any such shares of
Company Common Stock shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the
Merger Consideration into which the shares of Company Common
Stock represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall have been
converted pursuant to this _Section 2.01_, without interest.

 

(c) If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock shall have been
increased, decreased, changed into or exchanged for a different number or
kind of shares or securities as a result of a reorganization,
recapitalization, reclassification, stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock
split, subdivision, combination, exchange, readjustment or other similar
change in capitalization, the Merger Consideration shall be appropriately and
proportionately adjusted, without duplication, to reflect such reorganization,
recapitalization, reclassification, stock dividend, stock split, reverse
stock split, subdivision, combination, exchange, readjustment or other similar
change in capitalization; _provided_ that such adjustments will have no net
economic impact on the aggregate Merger Consideration; _provided_ , 
_further_ , that nothing in this _Section 2.01(c)_ shall be construed as
permitting the Company to take any action otherwise prohibited by this
Agreement.

 

Section 2.02. _Exchange of Certificates_.

 

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall select a bank or
trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as paying agent
(the " _Paying Agent_ ") and shall enter into an agreement relating to the
Paying Agents responsibilities under this Agreement. At or prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall deposit or cause to be deposited with the Paying
Agent, in trust for the benefit of the holders of Company Common Stock for
exchange in accordance with this _Article II_ through the Paying Agent,
immediately available funds sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger
Consideration (such aggregate Merger Consideration, being hereinafter
referred to as the " _Payment Fund_ ").

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. As promptly as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time, and in any event within five business days thereafter, Parent
shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of shares of
Company Common Stock whose shares of Company Common Stock were converted into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section
2.01(a)(i)_: (i) a letter of transmittal in customary form (which shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying
Agent and which shall have such other provisions as Parent and the Company may
agree) and (ii) instructions for use in surrendering the Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for cash.
Upon surrender of a Book-Entry Share or a Certificate for cancelation to the
Paying Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed
and validly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be required
by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Book-Entry Share or Certificate shall
be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the amount of Merger Consideration
that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to the provisions of this
_Article II_ with respect to the shares of Company Common Stock previously
represented by such Book-Entry Share or Certificate, and the Book-Entry Share
or Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a

 



4  transfer of ownership of shares of Company Common Stock that is not
registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment of the Merger
Consideration may be made to a person other than the person in whose name the
Certificate so surrendered is registered if, upon presentation to the Paying
Agent, such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper
form for transfer. In such case, the amount of any stock transfer or other
similar Taxes (whether imposed on the registered holder(s), or such other
person, or otherwise) payable on account of such issuance or transfer to such
other person shall be deducted from the amount otherwise payable pursuant to
the immediately preceding sentence, unless evidence satisfactory to the
Paying Agent of the payment of such Taxes, or exemption therefrom, is
submitted. Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 2.02(b)_, each
Book-Entry Share and Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration
upon such surrender. No interest will be paid or will accrue for the benefit
of holders of shares of Company Common Stock on the Merger Consideration
payable to holders of Company Common Stock pursuant to this _Article II_.

(c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. The Merger
Consideration paid upon the surrender for exchange of Book-Entry Shares or
Certificates in accordance with the terms of this _Article II_ shall be
deemed to have been issued (and paid) in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock previously represented by
such Book-Entry Shares or Certificates, and at the close of business on the
day on which the Effective Time occurs, the stock transfer books of the
Company shall be closed and there shall be no further registration of
transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the
shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time. Subject to the last sentence of _Section 2.02(d)_, if,
at any time after the Effective Time, Book-Entry Shares or Certificates are
presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent for any reason,
they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this _Article II_,
subject to applicable Law in the case of Dissenting Shares.

(d)  _Termination of Payment Fund_. Any portion of the Payment Fund
(including any interest and other amounts received with respect thereto) that
remains undistributed to the holders of Company Common Stock on the date that
is twelve months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving
Corporation upon demand. Any holders of Book-Entry Shares or Certificates who
has not theretofore complied with this _Article II_ shall thereafter look
only to Parent and the Surviving Corporation (subject to applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Laws) as general creditors thereof with respect
to the payment of its claim for Merger Consideration, without interest. None
of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of any portion of the Payment
Fund or the Merger Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to
any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, any portion of the cash to be paid
in accordance with this _Article II_ remaining undistributed to holders, as
of immediately prior to the Effective Time, of shares of Company Common Stock
five years after the Effective Time (or, if earlier, immediately prior to such
time when such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any
Governmental Authority) shall become, to the extent permitted by applicable
Law, the property of the Surviving Corporation free and clear of any claim or
interest of any person previously entitled thereto.

 



5 (e) _Investment of Payment Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest any cash
included in the Payment Fund, as directed by Parent, on a daily basis;
_provided_ that (i) any investment of such cash will be limited to (A) direct
short-term obligations of, or short-term obligations fully guaranteed as to
principal and interest by, the United States of America, (B) commercial paper
obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or
Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively, or (C) certificates of deposit,
bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial banks with
assets exceeding $100 billion (based on the most recent financial statements
of such bank that are then publicly available), (ii) no such investment, gains
or losses thereon shall affect the amounts payable to the holders of shares
of Company Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement and (iii) following any
losses in the Payment Fund, Parent shall promptly provide or cause to be
provided additional funds to the Paying Agent to the extent such losses
result in the amount of cash in the Payment Fund being less than the amounts
that remain payable to the holders of shares of Company Common Stock under
this _Article II_. Any interest and other income resulting from such
investments shall promptly be paid to the Surviving Corporation. The Payment
Fund shall not be used for any other purpose, except as provided in this
Agreement.

 

(f) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact, in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent, by the person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if requested by Parent, the
posting by such person of a bond in such reasonable amount as Parent may
request as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent with respect to such Certificate,
Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to issue in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement.

(g) _Withholding_. Each of the Paying Agent, Parent, the Company and the
Surviving Corporation, without duplication, shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement
to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock or Company Incentive Awards
such amounts as it may be required to deduct and withhold with respect to the
making of such payment under any provision of federal, state, local or foreign
Law relating to Taxes. Any amounts so withheld shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of shares of the
Company Common Stock or Company Incentive Awards in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made.

 

Section 2.03. _Dissenters  Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, any shares of Company Common Stock that are issued
and outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are
held by a stockholder who has not voted in favor of, or consented to, the
adoption of this Agreement and has properly exercised such
stockholders appraisal rights in respect of such shares (any such shares
being referred to herein as " _Dissenting Shares_ " and the holder thereof a "
_Dissenting Stockholder_ ") under Section 262 of the DGCL shall not
be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided
in _Section 2.01_ and instead shall be converted into the right to receive
such consideration as may be determined to be due with respect to such
Dissenting Shares pursuant to the procedures set forth in, and subject to the
requirements of, Section 262 of the DGCL. If any Dissenting Stockholder
withdraws its demand for appraisal or fails to timely perfect or otherwise
loses its right of appraisal, in any case

 



6  pursuant to the DGCL, each of such Dissenting Stockholders shares of
Company Common Stock shall thereupon be treated as though such shares of
Company Common Stock had been converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.01(a)(i)_. The Company shall (a) give
Parent prompt notice of any demand for appraisal or payment for shares of
Company Common Stock received by the Company, any withdrawal of any such
demand received by the Company and any other instruments served pursuant to
Section 262 of the DGCL and (b) give Parent the opportunity to participate in
and direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such demands.
The Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, make any
payment with respect to, or settle, offer to settle or otherwise negotiate,
any such demands.

 

Section 2.04. _Stock Options and Other Stock-Based Awards_.

 

(a) The APA Closing and the transfer to the Carve-Out Buyer of the employment
of employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as contemplated by the
APA shall not, in and of themselves, affect options to purchase shares of
Company Common Stock granted under any Company Benefit Plan to any such
employees whose employment with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
is transferred to the Carve-Out Buyer as contemplated by the APA
(collectively, the " _APA Options_ " and the " _APA Employees_ ,"
respectively). As of the Effective Time, each option to purchase shares of
Company Common Stock granted to employees or directors of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries under any Company Benefit Plan, including the APA Options
(collectively, the " _Company Options_ "), that is outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time, shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of the holder thereof, immediately accelerate and vest and
be canceled and converted into the right to receive from the Surviving
Corporation, in consideration of the cancelation of such Company Option and
in settlement therefore, a payment in cash of an amount equal to the product
of (i) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such
canceled Company Option and (ii) the excess, if any, of (A) the Merger
Consideration over (B) the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock
subject to such canceled Company Option, without interest (such amounts
payable hereunder, the " _Option Payments_ ");  _provided_ that (x) any such
Company Option with respect to which the exercise price per share subject
thereto is equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration shall be canceled
in exchange for no consideration and (y) the Option Payments may be reduced
by the amount of any required Tax withholdings as provided in _Section
2.02(g)_. From and after the Effective Time, no Company Option shall be
exercisable, and each Company Option shall only entitle the holder thereof to
the payment provided for in this _Section 2.04(a)_.

(b) The APA Closing and the transfer to the Carve-Out Buyer of the employment
of APA Employees shall not, in and of themselves, affect restricted shares of
Company Common Stock granted under any Company Benefit Plan to any APA
Employees (collectively, the " _APA Restricted Shares_ "). As of
the Effective Time, each restricted share of Company Common Stock granted to
any employee or director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under a
Company Benefit Plan, including the APA Restricted Shares (collectively, the "
_Company Restricted Shares_ ), that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time, shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of the holder thereof, immediately accelerate and vest and be canceled
and converted into the right to receive, in consideration for the cancelation
of such Company

 



7  Restricted Share, a payment in cash of an amount equal to the Merger
Consideration, without interest, treating such Company Restricted Share in the
same manner as all other shares of Company Common Stock are treated pursuant
to _Section 2.01_ for such purposes (such amounts payable hereunder, the "
_Restricted Share Payments_ "); _provided_ that the Restricted Share Payments
may be reduced by the amount of any required Tax withholdings as provided in
_Section 2.02(g)_.

Section 2.05. _Further Assurances_. Subject to Section 5.03, if at any time
before or after the Effective Time, Parent, the Company or the Surviving
Corporation reasonably believes or is advised that any further instruments,
deeds, assignments or assurances are reasonably necessary or desirable to
consummate the Merger or the Carve-Out Transaction or to carry out the
purposes and intent of this Agreement or the APA at or after the Effective
Time, then Parent, Merger Sub, the Company and the Surviving Corporation and
their respective officers and directors shall execute and deliver all such
proper instruments, deeds, assignments or assurances and do all other things
reasonably necessary or desirable to consummate the Merger and the
transactions contemplated by the APA and to carry out the purposes and intent
of this Agreement and the APA.

requirement that this Agreement be adopted by the holders of a majority of
the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock entitled to vote thereon (the

concession, qualification, registration, certification or similar
authorization (" _Permits_ ") affecting, or relating in any way to, the
assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries or the Energy Storage Business or
(C) result in the creation or imposition of any Encumbrance, other than
Permitted Encumbrances, on any asset of the Company or any of its

Material Adverse Effect or prevent or materially impair the ability of the
Company to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.

(c) The Company Board, at a meeting duly called and held, duly

such agreement to the extent required to permit the submission of a Competing
Proposal to the Company Board on a confidential basis if the Company Board
shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside
legal counsel and independent financial advisor, that the failure to take such
action would be inconsistent with the Company Boards fiduciary duties under
applicable Law; _provided_ , _further_ , 

 



38  that any such amendment be conditioned upon the applicable counterparty
agreeing that the Company shall not be prohibited from providing any
information to Parent (including information regarding any such Competing
Proposal) in accordance with, and otherwise complying with, this _Section
5.03_) or (B) any confidentiality provision in any agreement to which the
Company or any of its controlled Affiliates is a party or (ii) approve any
transaction under, or any person becoming an "interested stockholder" under,
Section 203 of the DGCL. Except to the extent otherwise permitted by the
proviso in the preceding sentence, the Company shall, and shall cause its
controlled Affiliates to, enforce the confidentiality and standstill
provisions of all agreements to which it or its controlled Affiliates are a
party. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall reimburse or
agree to reimburse the expenses of any third party in connection with any
Competing Proposal or any inquiry, proposal or offer which could reasonably be
expected to lead to a Competing Proposal.

 

(c) Notwithstanding the restrictions set forth in _Section 5.03(a)_, if at
any time following the date hereof and prior to obtaining the Stockholder
Approval, (i) the Company receives a bona fide, unsolicited written Competing
Proposal that the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation
with its outside legal counsel and independent financial
advisor, constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, a Superior
Proposal, (ii) such Competing Proposal did not result from a material breach
of this _Section 5.03_, (iii) the Company Board determines in good faith,
after consultation with its outside legal counsel and independent financial
advisor, that the failure to take the actions described in clauses (A) and (B)
below would be inconsistent with the Company Boards fiduciary duties
under applicable Law and (iv) before taking the actions described in clause
(A) below, the Company receives from the person making such Competing Proposal
an executed confidentiality agreement on terms at least as favorable to the
Company as those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement ( _provided_ that
such confidentiality agreement shall not be required to restrict the
submission of a Competing Proposal to the Company Board on a confidential
basis), the Company may (A) furnish nonpublic information to the person
making such Competing Proposal, if, to the extent not previously furnished,
the Company contemporaneously furnishes such information to Parent and (B)
participate in discussions or negotiations with such person (and its
Representatives) making such Competing Proposal with respect to such Competing
Proposal. The Company shall promptly notify Parent (within no more than 48
hours) of the communication or receipt of any Competing Proposal, indicating,
in connection with such notice, the identity of the person making such
Competing Proposal or request and the material terms and conditions thereof.
The Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed on a current basis (within
no more than 48 hours) as to the status of (including any material
developments, discussions or negotiations regarding) any such Competing
Proposal (including whether such Competing Proposal has been withdrawn or
rejected and any material change to the terms thereof). The Company agrees
that it and its controlled Affiliates will not enter into any agreement with
any person which prohibits the Company from providing any information to
Parent in accordance with, or otherwise complying with, this  _Section
5.03_.

(d) From and after the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time or, if
earlier, the date on which this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section
8.01_, except to the extent permitted by _Section 5.03(e)_, neither the
Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) change, withdraw, withhold,
qualify or modify, or publicly propose to change, withdraw, withhold, qualify
or modify, in any manner, the Board Recommendation (a " _Change of_

 



39   _Recommendation_ "), (ii) approve or recommend or resolve to or propose
publicly to approve or recommend, any Competing Proposal or (iii) authorize,
cause or permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to execute or enter
into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in
principle, acquisition or other agreement or understanding relating to, or
that is intended or would reasonably be expected to lead to, any Competing
Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement permitted by _Section
5.03(c)_) or resolve, propose publicly or agree to do any of the foregoing.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if (i) there
shall occur any material event that (A) is not related to a Competing
Proposal, and (B) was not known to or reasonably foreseeable by the Company
Board as of the date of this Agreement but became known to the Company Board
prior to the Stockholder Approval (any such material event, an " _Intervening
Event_ ") and (ii) the Company Board shall have determined in good faith,
after consultation with its outside legal counsel and independent financial
advisor, that the failure to effect a Change of Recommendation would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, then prior to the
receipt of the Stockholder Approval the Company Board may, subject to
compliance with this _Section 5.03(e)_, effect a Change of Recommendation; 
_provided_ , _however_ , that prior to so effecting a Change of
Recommendation, (x) the Company shall have provided to Parent at least five
business days prior written notice of its intention to take such action, which
notice shall include, in reasonable detail, the reasons therefor and a
summary of all material facts and circumstances related to the applicable
Intervening Event, (y) the Company shall have negotiated, and directed its
Representatives to negotiate, in good faith with Parent and its
Representatives during such notice period (to the extent Parent desires to
negotiate) with respect to any revisions to the terms of this Agreement
proposed by Parent such that the failure of the Company Board to effect
such Change of Recommendation, in the Boards good faith determination, would
no longer be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law and
(z) upon the end of such notice period, the Company Board shall have
considered in good faith all revisions to the terms of this Agreement
proposed in writing by Parent and shall have determined, after consultation
with its outside legal counsel and independent financial advisor, that the
failure to effect such Change in Recommendation would nevertheless continue
to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

(f) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if the
Company Board shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with its
outside legal counsel and independent financial advisor, that a bona fide,
unsolicited written Competing Proposal made after the date hereof that did
not result from a breach of the Companys obligations under this _Section
5.03_ constitutes a Superior Proposal and that the failure of the Company
Board to approve, recommend or enter into a definitive agreement relating to
such Superior Proposal would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law, then at any time prior to the receipt of the Stockholder
Approval the Company Board may, subject to compliance with this  _Section
5.03(f)_, cause the Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section
8.01(g)_ in order to concurrently enter into a definitive agreement that
constitutes a Superior Proposal upon (and subject to) paying the Termination
Fee in accordance with _Section 8.02_; _provided_ , _however_ , that prior to
so terminating the Agreement, (i) the Company shall have provided to Parent at
least five business days prior written notice of its intention to take such
action (a " _Notice of Superior Proposal_ "), which notice shall include, in
reasonable detail,

 



40  the reasons therefor and any information and materials required to be
delivered under _Section 5.03(c)_ that have not yet been provided to Parent,
(ii) the Company shall have negotiated, and directed its Representatives to
negotiate, in good faith with Parent and its Representatives during such
notice period (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) with respect to any
revisions to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent such that such
Superior Proposal would no longer constitute a Superior Proposal and (iii)
upon the end of such notice period, the Company Board shall have considered in
good faith all revisions to the terms of this Agreement proposed in writing
by Parent, and shall have determined, after consultation with its outside
legal counsel and independent financial advisor, that the Superior Proposal
would nevertheless continue to constitute a Superior Proposal if the proposed
revisions were to be given effect and that the failure of the Company Board
to approve, recommend or enter into a definitive agreement with respect to
such Superior Proposal would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law. Any change to the financial terms (including the form, amount
and timing of payment of consideration) or any other material terms of a
Superior Proposal shall require the Company to deliver to Parent a new Notice
of Superior Proposal and a new five business day notice period shall commence
thereafter.

(g) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company Board from
(i) taking and disclosing to the Companys stockholders a position
contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act,
or (ii) making any disclosure to its stockholders if the Company Board shall
have determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal
counsel, that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with any applicable
Law; _provided_ , that the Company Board may not effect a Change of
Recommendation, unless permitted to do so by  _Section 5.03(e)_ , _provided_
, _further_ , that any disclosure (other than a "stop-look-and-listen"
communication to its stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under
the Exchange Act) made pursuant to Rule 14d-9 or 14e-2(a) shall be deemed to
be a Change of Recommendation, unless the Company Board expressly reaffirms in
such disclosure the Board Recommendation. The Company shall not submit to the
vote of its stockholders any Competing Proposal or Superior Proposal prior to
the termination of this Agreement.

(h) The Company shall ensure that its Representatives are aware of the
provisions of this _Section 5.03_. Any material violation of the
restrictions contained in this _Section 5.03_ by any of its Representatives
shall be deemed to be a material breach of this _Section 5.03_ by the
Company.

 

(i) For purposes of this Agreement:

 

(i) " _Competing Proposal_ " means any inquiry, offer or proposal (from any
person or group of persons other than Parent or its Subsidiaries) relating
to, or that may lead to, in a single transaction or a series of related
transactions, (A) a merger, consolidation, share exchange, business
combination, reorganization, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution,
joint venture or similar transaction involving the Company or any of its
material Subsidiaries, (B) any acquisition of 15% or more of the outstanding
Company Common Stock or securities of the Company representing more than 15%
of the voting power of the Company, (C) any acquisition (including the
acquisition of stock in any Subsidiary of the Company) of the Company,
including pursuant to a joint venture, representing 15% or more of the
consolidated assets, revenues or net income of the Company, (D) any tender
offer or

 



41  exchange offer that if consummated would result in any person beneficially
owning 15% or more of the outstanding Company Common Stock or securities of
the Company representing more than 15% of the voting power of the Company or
(E) any combination of the foregoing types of transactions if the sum of the
percentage of consolidated assets, consolidated revenues or earnings and
Company Common Stock (or voting power of securities of the Company other than
the Company Common Stock) involved is 15% or more.

(ii) " _Superior Proposal_ " means a bona fide, unsolicited written Competing
Proposal (A) that if consummated would result in a person other than Parent or
its Subsidiaries (or in the case of a direct merger between such person and
the Company, the stockholders of such person) acquiring, directly or
indirectly, (1) all or substantially all of the outstanding Company Common
Stock or (2) all or substantially all of the assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and (B) that the Company Board determines in
good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and independent
financial advisor, taking into account all the terms of the Competing Proposal
(including the legal, financial and regulatory aspects of such proposal,
the identity of the person making such proposal and the conditions for
completion of such proposal) is more favorable, from a financial point of
view, to the Companys stockholders than the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (taking into account any revised proposal to amend the terms of
this Agreement).

mailed to the stockholders of the Company until the Company Stockholders
Meeting, not to contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading. If

 



42  at any time prior to the Effective Time any information relating to the
Company or Parent, or any of their respective Affiliates, directors or
officers, is discovered by the Company or Parent which should be set forth in
an amendment or supplement to either the Proxy Statement, so that such
document would not include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make
the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading, the party that discovers such information shall promptly
notify the other parties hereto and the Company shall promptly file an
appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information with the SEC
and, to the extent required by Law, disseminate such amendment or supplement
to the stockholders of the Company.

 

(c) The Company shall, as soon as reasonably practicable following the date
the Proxy Statement is permitted by applicable Law to be mailed to the
Companys stockholders, take all actions necessary to duly call, give notice
of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders for the purpose of seeking
the Stockholder Approval (the " _Stockholders Meeting_ "), in accordance with
applicable Laws, the Company Certificate and the Company Bylaws; _provided_
that the Company may postpone or adjourn the Stockholders Meeting only (A)
with the written consent of Parent or (B) to allow time for the filing and
dissemination of any supplemental or amended disclosure document that the
Company Board has determined in good faith (after consultation with its
outside legal counsel) is required to be filed and disseminated under
applicable Laws. In connection with the Stockholders Meeting, the Company
shall (i) unless there has been a Change of Recommendation in accordance with
_Section 5.03(e)_, use reasonable best efforts to obtain the Stockholder
Approval (including by soliciting proxies in favor of the adoption of this
Agreement and ensuring that all proxies so solicited are solicited in
compliance with all applicable Laws and the rules of the New York Stock
Exchange) and (ii) otherwise comply with all legal requirements applicable to
such meeting. The Company shall include in the Proxy Statement the Board
Recommendation, unless there has been a Change of Recommendation in accordance
with _Section 5.03(e)_. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
the Company shall submit the Merger and this Agreement for the approval of its
stockholders at the Stockholder Meeting whether or not a Change of
Recommendation shall have occurred or a Competing Proposal shall have been
publicly announced or otherwise made known to the Company, the Company Board,
its Representatives or its stockholders and there shall be no vote of the
Companys stockholders in respect of any Competing Proposal prior to the
Stockholders Meeting. Without the prior written consent of Parent, the
adoption of this Agreement shall be the only matter (other than matters of
procedure and matters required by applicable Law to be voted on by the
Companys stockholders in connection with the adoption of this Agreement)
that the Company shall propose to be acted on by the stockholders of the
Company at the Stockholders Meeting, _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company
may, in its sole discretion, combine the Stockholders Meeting with its Annual
Meeting of Stockholders and include the applicable matters thereto among the
matters to be voted on by the Companys stockholders at the Stockholders
Meeting if either (x) the Company is so required by applicable Law or (y) the
combination of the Stockholders Meeting with the Companys Annual Meeting of
Stockholders would not reasonably be expected to delay the Stockholders
Meeting; _provided_ , _further_ , that nothing in this  _Section 6.01(c)_
shall prohibit the Company from holding its Annual Meeting of Stockholders
separate from the Stockholders Meeting.

 



43 Section 6.02. _Access to Information; Confidentiality_. Subject to the
Confidentiality Agreements and applicable Laws, the Company shall to the
extent within its control afford to Parent and its Representatives reasonable
access during normal business hours during the period from the date hereof
until the Effective Time or, if earlier, the date on which this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to _Section 8.01_, to all of its and its Subsidiaries
properties, books, contracts, commitments, personnel and records and, during
such period, the Company shall furnish to Parent promptly all other
information concerning its business, properties and personnel as Parent may
reasonably request, in each case, to the extent reasonably available and
related to the Energy Storage Business, the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Parent shall hold, and shall cause its
Representatives to hold, all information received from the Company, directly
or indirectly, in confidence in accordance with the Parent Confidentiality
Agreement, with the terms of the Parent Confidentiality Agreement continuing
in effect following execution of this Agreement. The foregoing shall not
require the Company to provide any such access or information to the extent
that doing so would reasonably be expected to (w) result in a waiver of an
attorney-client privilege or loss of attorney work product, (x) violate any
Law, (y) violate any contract currently applicable to it or its
Subsidiaries or (z) result in the disclosure of commercially sensitive
information; _provided_ that the Company shall provide notice to Parent of the
fact that it is withholding such access or information and thereafter
reasonably cooperate with Parent and use reasonable best efforts to cause
such information or access to be provided in a manner that would not
reasonably be expected to result in any such waiver or loss of privilege
(including by entering into a common interest or joint defense agreement),
violation or disclosure of commercially sensitive information (including by
entering in to a "clean team" or similar agreement). No access or information
provided pursuant to this _Section 6.02_ will operate as a waiver or
otherwise affect any of the representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements of the parties contained in this Agreement.

 

Section 6.03. _Reasonable Best Efforts; Antitrust Filings; Other Actions_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the Company
and Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken,
all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with
each other in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate
and make effective, on or prior to the Termination Date, the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Without limiting the
foregoing, each of the Company and Parent shall (i) use reasonable best
efforts to cause the conditions set forth _Section 7.01_ and _Section 7.02_
(in the case of the Company) and _Section 7.03_ (in the case of Parent) to
be satisfied prior to the Termination Date, (ii) prepare and file as promptly
as reasonably practicable the submissions under all Antitrust Laws required to
consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby and, if
requested, to promptly amend or furnish additional information thereunder,
(iii) use reasonable best efforts to obtain all necessary actions or
nonactions, waivers, clearances, consents, permits and approvals from
Governmental Authorities and make all necessary registrations, notifications
and filings and take all steps as may be necessary to obtain an approval or
waiver from, or to avoid an action or proceeding by, any Governmental
Authority prior to the Termination Date, (iv) use reasonable best efforts to
obtain all necessary consents or waivers from non-Governmental Authority third
parties ( _provided_ that in no event shall the Company be obligated to pay
or to commit to pay to any person whose consent or waiver is being sought any
cash or other consideration, make any accommodation or commitment or incur any
liability or other obligation to such person in 

 



44  connection with such consent or waiver), and (v) as promptly as reasonably
practicable following the receipt thereof, respond to (or properly reduce the
scope of) any formal or informal request for additional information or
documentary material received by the Company, Parent, or any of their
respective Affiliates from any Governmental Authority. The Company and Parent
shall, subject to applicable Law, use reasonable best efforts to (i)
cooperate and coordinate with the other in the taking of the actions
contemplated by the immediately preceding sentence and (ii) supply the other
with any information that may be reasonably required in order to effectuate
the taking of such actions. Each party hereto shall as promptly as reasonably
practicable inform the other party or parties hereto, as the case may be, of
any communication to or from any Governmental Authority regarding the Merger
and any other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. If the Company or
Parent receives a request for additional information or documentary material
from any Governmental Authority with respect to the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, then it shall use reasonable
best efforts to make, or cause to be made, as promptly as reasonably
practicable and after consultation with the other party, an appropriate
response in compliance with such request, and, if permitted by applicable Law
and by any applicable Governmental Authority, provide the other partys
counsel with advance notice and the opportunity to attend and participate in
any meeting with any Governmental Authority in respect of any filing
made thereto in connection with the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. To the extent reasonably practicable and
subject to the provisions of _Section 6.02_, legal counsel for Parent and for
the Company shall have the right to review in advance, and will consult with
the other on and consider in good faith the views of the other in connection
with, all of the information relating to Parent or the Company, as the case
may be, and any of their respective Subsidiaries and Representatives, that
appears in any filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any third
party or Governmental Authority in connection with the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement ( _provided_ that these materials
may be redacted to the extent necessary to address reasonable attorney-client
or other privilege, or other confidentiality concerns; _provided_ , _further_
, that the parties shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the information
so redacted to be provided in a manner that would not reasonably be expected
to result in any waiver or loss of such privilege, including by entering into
a common interest or joint defense agreement). In exercising the foregoing
rights, each of Parent and the Company shall act reasonably and as promptly as
reasonably practicable. Information disclosed pursuant to this _Section 6.03_
shall be subject to the Confidentiality Agreement, and the parties hereto
shall comply with, and shall cause their respective Representatives to comply
with, all of their respective obligations thereunder. Neither Parent nor the
Company shall commit to or agree (or permit their respective Subsidiaries to
commit to or agree) with any Governmental Authority to stay, toll or extend
any applicable waiting period under any applicable Antitrust Laws, without the
prior written consent of the other (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld or delayed).

 

(b) Each of the Company and Parent agrees to cooperate with the other and use
reasonable best efforts to resolve such objections, if any, as may be
asserted under any Antitrust Law by the United States Federal Trade
Commission, the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice
or any other Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction with respect to
the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the
APA, to permit the Merger, the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated by the APA to be consummated in
the most expeditious manner practicable and in any event prior to the
Termination Date. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in

 



45  this Agreement, nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to require Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries to, and the Company shall not, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries not to, in connection with the resolution of any such
objections, agree to any sale, divestiture, license or other disposition of
shares of capital stock or of any business, assets or property, or the
imposition of any limitation on the ability of any of them to conduct
their respective businesses or to own or exercise control of such stock,
businesses, assets and properties other than the sale, divestiture or
disposition of a wet process manufacturing facility or wet process
manufacturing assets and equipment (including the transfer or royalty-free
license of any Intellectual Property reasonably necessary to operate such
facility, assets or equipment), in each case, used by Parent or the Company or
any of their respective Subsidiaries in the production of lithium battery
separator material, that collectively have an annual production capacity of no
more than 40 million square meters.

(c) The parties shall work cooperatively together on all communications and
strategy relating to the Antitrust Laws and litigation matters ( _provided_
that each party acts in good faith and the Company is not constrained from
complying with applicable Law), subject to consultations with and the
inclusion of the other party at meetings with Governmental Authorities
involving substantive issues under the Antitrust Laws, unless the inclusion of
one party is reasonably determined by the other party after good faith
consultation by both parties to be strategically detrimental to the ultimate
goal of obtaining clearance of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or the APA.

 

Section 6.04. _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_.

 

(a) Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to exculpation and
indemnification for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time
(including any matters arising in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement), now existing in favor of the current or
former directors, officers or employees, as the case may be, of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries (the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") as provided in the
Company Certificate, the Company Bylaws (or equivalent organizational
documents of any of the Companys Subsidiaries) or in any agreement set forth
on _Section 6.04(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule and a copy of which
have been made available to Parent (an " _Indemnity Agreement_ "), each as in
effect on the date of this Agreement, shall survive the Merger and shall
continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms. For a period
of not less than six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to indemnify, defend and hold harmless, and advance
expenses to the Indemnified Parties with respect to all acts or omissions by
them in their capacities as such at any time prior to the Effective Time, to
the fullest extent provided by: (i) the Company Certificate, the Company
Bylaws (or equivalent organizational documents of the Companys Subsidiaries)
as in effect on the date of this Agreement; and (ii) any Indemnity Agreement
between any such Indemnified Party, on the one hand, and the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries, on the other hand, as in effect on the date of this
Agreement.

(b) Without limiting the provisions of _Section 6.04(a)_, from and after the
Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to (and shall
guarantee the obligations of the Surviving Corporation under this _Section
6.04(b)_), in the same manner as provided by the

 



46  Company immediately prior to the date hereof: (i) indemnify, defend and hold
harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, each Indemnified
Party from and against any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys
fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, penalties, liabilities and
amounts paid in settlement (including, in each case, any interest or
assessments thereon) in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding
or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, to
the extent such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation arises out of
or pertains to: (A) any action or omission or alleged action or omission in
such Indemnified Partys capacity as a director, officer or employee of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time; or (B) the
Merger, this Agreement, the APA and any transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby; and (ii) pay (within 30 days following any request for advancement)
the expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees) of any Indemnified Party
incurred in connection with any such claim, action, suit, proceeding
or investigation upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such
Indemnified Party to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined
that such Indemnified Party is not entitled to be indemnified, in each case,
to the extent that such persons are indemnified or have the right to
advancement of expenses as of the date of this Agreement by the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries pursuant to the Company Certificate, the Company Bylaws,
the equivalent organizational documents of any of the Companys Subsidiaries
or any Indemnity Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnified
Parties as a group may retain only one law firm to represent them with respect
to each such matter unless there is, under applicable standards of
professional conduct, a conflict on any significant issue between the
positions of any two or more Indemnified Parties.

(c) Parent will provide, or cause the Surviving Corporation to provide, for a
period of not less than six years after the Effective Time, the Indemnified
Parties who are insured under the Companys directors and officers insurance
and indemnification policy with an insurance and indemnification policy that
provides coverage for events occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (the
" _D andO Insurance_") that is no less favorable than the existing policy of
the Company; _provided_ that Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not
be required to pay an annual premium for the DandO Insurance in excess of 300%
of the annual premium paid as of the date hereof by the Company for such
insurance;  _provided_ , _further_ , that if the annual premiums of such
insurance coverage at any time exceed such amount, Parent or the Surviving
Corporation shall obtain a policy which, in its good faith determination,
provides the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding such
amount. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the
Company may and at Parents request shall purchase a "tail" directors and
officers insurance and indemnification policy; _provided_ that payment for
each year of insurance coverage provided by such "tail" directors and
officers insurance policy shall not exceed 300% of the annual premium paid as
of the date hereof by the Company. Any such "tail" directors and others
insurance policy will satisfy Parents obligations under this _Section
6.04(c)_ to provide DandO Insurance.

 

(d) The Indemnified Parties to whom this _Section 6.04_ applies shall be third
party beneficiaries of this _Section 6.04_. The provisions of this _Section
6.04_ are intended to be for the benefit of each Indemnified Party and his or
her successors, heirs and representatives.

 

(e) This _Section 6.04_ shall survive the consummation of the Merger and
shall be binding, jointly and severally, on all successors and assigns of
Parent, the Surviving Corporation

 



47  and its Subsidiaries, and shall be enforceable by the Indemnified Parties
and their successors, heirs or representatives. In the event that Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns
consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or transfers or conveys all or a majority of its properties and assets to any
person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that
such other person or the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving
Corporation, as the case may be, shall succeed to its obligations set forth in
this  _Section 6.04_.

Section 6.05. _Fees and Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement,
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be
paid by the party incurring such fees or expenses, whether or not the Merger
is consummated.

 

Section 6.06. _Public Announcements_. The parties agree that the initial press
releases to be issued with respect to the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall be in the form heretofore agreed to by
the parties. Parent and the Company shall (a) consult with each other before
issuing or making, (b) give each other the opportunity to review and comment
upon, (c) consider in good faith the views of each other with respect to and
(d) not issue or make without the prior written consent of the other (which
consent shall not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), any
press release or other public statement with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger; _provided_ that either
Parent or the Company may, without the prior written consent of the
other (but after prior consultation, to the extent practicable in the
circumstances) issue a press release or make any other public statement to the
extent required by applicable Law, court process or by obligations pursuant to
any listing agreement with any national securities exchange.

Section 6.07. _Stock Exchange Delisting; Deregistration_. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions, and do or cause to be done all things,
necessary, proper or advisable on its part under applicable Laws and rules and
policies of the New York Stock Exchange to cause the delisting of the Company
and of the shares of Company Common Stock from the New York Stock Exchange as
promptly as practicable after the Effective Time and the deregistration of the
shares of Company Common Stock under the Exchange Act as promptly as
practicable after such delisting.

Section 6.08. _Stockholder Litigation_. The Company shall promptly notify
Parent of any stockholder litigation against it and/or its directors relating
to this Agreement, the APA, the Merger and/or the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or the APA and shall keep Parent reasonably informed regarding
any such stockholder litigation. Without limiting _Section 5.01(m)_, the
Company shall give Parent the opportunity to participate in the defense or
settlement of any such stockholder litigation and shall give due consideration
to the other partys advice with respect to such stockholder litigation.

Section 6.09. _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) For the one-year period following the Effective Time, Parent shall, or
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, (i) provide each Company Covered
Employee employed by the

 



48  Company or one of its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time who continues as
an employee of the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries with at
least the same level of hourly salary or base wages as provided to such
Company Covered Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii)
provide each Company Covered Employee employed by the Company or one of its
Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time who continues as an employee of the
Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries with employee benefits
(including severance) and annual target bonus and target long-term incentive
award opportunities that in the aggregate are substantially comparable in
the aggregate to the employee benefits (including severance but excluding any
change in control benefits) and annual target bonus and target long-term
incentive award (understanding that such long-term incentive awards may be
designated as cash rather than equity) opportunities provided to such Company
Covered Employee under the Company Benefit Plans as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained
in this Agreement shall (A) prevent the amendment or termination of any
Company Benefit Plan in accordance with its terms, or interfere with the right
or obligation of Parent or the Surviving Corporation to make such changes as
are necessary to conform with applicable Law or (B) limit the right of Parent
or the Surviving Corporation to terminate the employment of any employee at
any time. For the two-year period following the Effective Time, Parent shall
provide, or shall cause to be provided, to each Company Covered Employee
employed by the Company or one of its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time
who continues as an employee of the Surviving Corporation or any of its
Subsidiaries who suffers a termination of employment under the
circumstances described on _Section 6.09(a)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, severance benefits in accordance with _Section 6.09(a)_ of the
Company Disclosure Schedule (taking into account such Company Covered
Employees service as required pursuant to _Section 6.09(b)_). Parent and
Merger Sub acknowledge that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
will not impair obligations under any collective bargaining agreement to which
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party.

(b) To the extent that a Company Covered Employee commences to participate in
an employee benefit plan maintained by Parent or the Surviving Corporation,
Parent shall cause such employee benefit plan to (i) recognize the service of
such Company Covered Employee with the Company or its Subsidiaries for
purposes of eligibility and vesting and benefits (but not for purposes of
benefit accruals under any defined benefit plan) under such employee benefit
plan to the same extent such service was recognized immediately prior to the
Effective Time under a comparable Company Benefit Plan in which such Company
Covered Employee was a participant immediately prior to the Effective Time or,
if there is no such comparable benefit plan, to the same extent such service
was recognized under the defined contribution plan maintained under Section
401(k) of the Code by the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time;
_provided_ that (A) recognition of such service shall not be required to the
extent that the service of employees other than Company Covered Employees is
not so recognized under such employee benefit plans and (B) such recognition
of service shall not operate to duplicate any benefits payable to the Company
Covered Employee with respect to the same period of service and (ii) with
respect to any health, dental or vision plan of Parent or the Surviving
Corporation in which any Company Covered Employee commences to participate, in
the plan year that includes the year in which such Company Covered Employee
commences to participate, (A) cause any pre-existing condition limitations
under such Parent or Surviving Corporation plan to be waived with respect to
such Company Covered Employee to the extent such limitation would have been
waived or satisfied under the Company Benefit Plan in which such Company
Covered Employee

 



49  participated immediately prior to such commencement of participation and (B)
recognize any medical or other health deductible and out-of-pocket expenses
incurred by such Company Covered Employee in the year that includes the year
in which such Company Covered Employee commences to participate for purposes
of any applicable deductible and annual out-of-pocket expense requirements
under any such health, dental or vision plan of Parent or the Surviving
Corporation.

(c) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to, honor, in accordance with the terms thereof as
in effect as of the date hereof, each employment agreement and change in
control agreement to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party.

 

(d) To the extent any bonus amounts under annual bonus, sales and other cash
incentive plans of the Company and its Subsidiaries (" _Bonus Amounts_ ")
with respect to a fiscal year completed prior to the Closing remain unpaid as
of the Closing Date, Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall cause all such
Bonus Amounts to be calculated and paid in the ordinary course of business to
the eligible Company Covered Employees.

(e) Parent will, following the Effective Time, cause the
Surviving Corporation to cooperate with the Carve-Out Buyer to effectuate a
transfer to a tax-qualified defined contribution plan designated by the Carve-
Out Buyer of outstanding participant loan balances credited to the accounts of
employees whose employment will transfer to the Carve-Out Buyer or its
Affiliates in connection with the transactions contemplated by the APA in the
Surviving Corporations tax-qualified defined contribution plan, subject to
such representations and covenants as the Surviving Corporation and the
Carve-Out Buyer reasonably request, it being understood that this _Section
6.09(e)_ shall not require the Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Carve-
Out Buyer to incur any material expense or actual or potential liability in
connection with such transfer.

(f) For the avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, with respect to any employee of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries who is not a Company Covered Employee, this _Section 6.09_ shall
not impose any restriction or obligation on Parent, the Surviving Corporation
or any of their respective Subsidiaries.

(g) This _Section 6.09_ shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit
of the parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this _Section 6.09_,
express or implied, is intended to confer upon any other person any rights or
remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this _Section 6.09_.

 

Section 6.10. _Notification of Certain Matters_.

 

(a) Subject to applicable Law, the Company shall give prompt notice to Parent
of (i) the occurrence or nonoccurrence of any change, effect, event, change
in circumstance, occurrence or the discovery of any fact, that would
reasonably be expected to cause any of the conditions to Closing set forth in
_Section 7.01_ or _Section 7.02_ not to be satisfied, (ii) any notice or
other communication received by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries from
any third party alleging that the consent of such third party is or may be
required in connection with the Merger 

 



50  or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (iii) any notice
or other communication received by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries from
any customer, supplier, vendor, licensor, licensee or other business partner
to the effect that such customer, supplier, vendor, licensor, licensee or
other business partner is terminating or otherwise materially adversely
modifying its relationship with Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a
result of any of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (iv) any notice or other communication from any Governmental
Authority received by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection
with the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (and
a copy of any such notice or communication shall promptly be furnished to
Parent) and (v) any suits, actions, proceedings or investigations commenced or
threatened that relate to the consummation of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, of which the Company
has knowledge.

 

(b) Subject to applicable Law, Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company
of (i) the occurrence or nonoccurrence of any change, effect, event, change
in circumstance, occurrence or the discovery of any fact, that would
reasonably be expected to cause any of the conditions to Closing set forth in
_Section 7.01_ or _Section 7.03_ not to be satisfied, (ii) any notice or
other communication from any Governmental Authority received by Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries in connection with the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (and a copy of any such notice
or communication shall promptly be furnished to the Company) and (iii) any
suits, actions, proceedings or investigations commenced or threatened that
relate to the consummation of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby, including the Merger, of which Parent or Merger Sub has knowledge.

(c) The delivery of any notice pursuant to this _Section 6.10_ shall not
limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder.

Section 6.11. _State Takeover Statutes_. The Company and its Subsidiaries
shall not take any action that would cause the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement to be subject to requirements imposed by any anti-takeover or
similar Law. If any "fair price", "moratorium", "control share acquisition",
"supermajority", "affiliate transactions" or "business combination statute or
regulation" or other similar anti-takeover Law (including Section 203 of the
DGCL) may become, or may purport to be, applicable to the Merger or any other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the APA, each of the Company
and Parent shall grant such approvals and take such actions as are reasonably
necessary so that the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby may be
consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and
otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of such Law on the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.

Section 6.12. _Financing_.

 

(a) Parent shall, at the Companys request, keep the Company reasonably
informed as to the status of the Parent Financing or any alternative
financing contemplated by Parent to be obtained in connection with the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



51 (b) To assist Parent in the arrangement of the Parent Financing, prior to the
Closing, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to provide, to the
extent within its control, to Parent and Merger Sub, at Parents sole expense,
customary cooperation reasonably requested by Parent or Merger Sub that is
necessary or advisable in connection with the arrangement and consummation of
the Parent Financing, including using its reasonable best efforts to:

(i) participate in a reasonable number of meetings, due diligence sessions,
drafting sessions and sessions between senior management and the sources of
the Parent Financing;

 

(ii) provide reasonable and customary assistance with the preparation of
documents customarily required in connection with bank debt, equity or
equity-linked financings and, to the extent customary and required pursuant to
such financing, provide documentation and other information for a financing of
this type, in each case, to the extent reasonably available, relating to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries (but subject to _Section 6.12(c)_ and
_Section 6.12(d)_), including any documentation or other information
reasonably required by bank regulatory authorities under applicable "know your
customer" and anti-money laundering rules and regulations, including the
U.S.A. Patriot Act of 2001; and

(iii) using reasonable best efforts to assist Parent in obtaining surveys,
legal opinions from local outside counsel (and not internal counsel or New

cooperation or other action to the extent it would materially interfere with
the business or operations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii)
nothing in this _Section 6.12_ shall require the Company or any of its

the board of directors (or other governing body) of any of the Companys

related thereto (or any alternative financing) at or prior to the
Effective Time or (iv) neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall
be required to execute prior to the Closing any definitive financing documents
or other agreements and documents in connection with any financing.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section 6.12(a)_
or _Section 6.12(b)_, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall
be required to pay any commitment or other similar fee or make any other
payment (other than for minimal reasonable out-of-pocket costs that are

as it applies to the Companys obligations under this _Section 6.12_ , shall
be deemed satisfied unless the Company has materially breached its obligations
under this _Section 6.12_ and such breach has materially contributed to the
Parent Financing not being obtained.

business days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to Parent

letters to be executed by third-party lenders or an agent, if applicable, on
their behalf, with respect to (i) all Indebtedness of the Company and

avoidance of doubt, all obligations under and in respect of any swap, hedging
or similar agreement entered into by the Company in connection with such
Indebtedness) and (ii) any other Indebtedness for borrowed money specified by
Parent to the Company no later than twelve (12) business days prior to the
Closing Date. Such payoff letters shall (x) provide for the cash
collateralization of any letters of credit issued for the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries (including any letters of credit issued under the Company
Credit Agreement), to the extent that Parent shall not have entered into an
alternative arrangement with the issuing bank, (y) correctly specify the
amounts, including any applicable premiums, fees and expenses, necessary to

if applicable, provide for the cash collateralization of any letters of
credit in accordance with instructions provided in such payoff letters and,
unless otherwise requested by Parent and permitted by the terms governing such
Indebtedness, permanently terminate the facilities providing for such
Indebtedness and all related agreements (except to the extent necessary to
survive with respect to cash collateralized letters of credit, if any, and
certain customary obligations that survive the termination thereof).

case, to the extent necessary to satisfy the applicable condition set forth in
_Sections 7.01_ or _7.02_ ), by the Company within 30 days following receipt

incapable of being cured, or is not cured (in each case, to the extent
necessary to satisfy the applicable condition set forth in _Sections 7.01_ or

(a) In the event that:

(i) this Agreement is terminated (A) by Parent pursuant to _Section 8.01(f)_
or (B) by Parent or the Company pursuant to _Section 8.01(e)_ (but, in the

(iii) (A) after the date hereof and prior to the termination of
this Agreement, a Competing Proposal shall have been made public or
communicated to the Company Board (or any person shall have publicly
announced, communicated or made known to the Company an

 



57  intention, whether or not conditional, to make a Competing Proposal), (B)
this Agreement is terminated (1) by either Parent or the Company pursuant to
_Section 8.01(b)(i)_ (unless the Stockholder Approval shall have been
obtained prior to any such termination pursuant to _Section 8.01(b)(i)_),
_Section 8.01(b)(iii)_ or _Section 8.01(e)_ (but, in the case of termination
pursuant to  _Section 8.01(e)_, only if the APA was terminated (x) by the
Company or the Carve-Out Buyer pursuant to _Section 9.01(b)(i)_ of the APA
(unless the Stockholder Approval shall have been obtained prior to any such
termination pursuant to _Section 9.01(b)(i)_ of the APA) or Section
9.01(b)(iii) of the APA or (y) by the Carve-Out Buyer pursuant to _Section
9.01(c)_ of the APA) or (2) by Parent pursuant to _Section 8.01(c)_ and (C)
within twelve months after the date of such termination, the Company shall
have entered into a definitive agreement to consummate, shall have
consummated, or the Company Board shall have recommended to the Companys
stockholders, any transaction of the type referred to in the definition of
Competing Proposal (whether or not involving the Competing Proposal referred
to in clause (A) above), then the Company shall pay to Parent the Termination
Fee. If the Termination Fee becomes payable pursuant _Section 8.02(a)(i)_,
then the Company shall pay to Parent the Termination Fee as promptly as
practicable (and, in any event, within two business days) following such
termination. If the Termination Fee becomes payable pursuant _Section
8.02(a)(ii)_, then the Company shall pay to Parent the Termination Fee
concurrently with such termination. If the Termination Fee becomes payable
pursuant to _Section 8.02(a)(iii)_, then the Company shall pay to Parent the
Termination Fee on the date of consummation of the applicable Competing
Proposal. The " _Termination Fee_ " shall mean a cash amount equal to $39
million.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, payment of the
Termination Fee shall constitute liquidated damages, and from and after such
termination as described in _Section 8.02(a)_ , the Company shall have no
further liability of any kind for any reason in connection with this Agreement
or the termination hereof other than as provided under _Sections 8.02(a)_ and
_8.02(c)_ ; _provided_ that nothing herein shall relieve the Company from any
liability for any intentional and material breach hereof prior to such
termination (it being understood that, without limiting the foregoing, in the
case of any intentional and material breach hereof, any prior payment of the
Termination Fee pursuant to this _Section 8.02_ shall be taken into account
when determining any remedies). Except in the case of any intentional and
material breach of this Agreement, under no circumstances will Parent be
entitled to monetary damages for any loss or other liability of any kind
suffered as a result of any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant
or agreement hereunder or the failure of the transactions contemplated hereby
to be consummated in excess of the Termination Fee together with any amounts
due pursuant to _Section 8.02(c)_. In no event shall Parent be entitled to be
paid the Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

__(c) The Company acknowledges and agrees that the agreements contained in
this _Section 8.02_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and that, without these agreements, Parent and Merger Sub would
not have entered into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company fails to pay
in a timely manner any amount due pursuant to _Section 8.02_ and, in order
to obtain such payment, Parent commences a suit that results in a judgment
against the Company, the Company shall pay to Parent its reasonable costs and
expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) incurred in
connection with such suit and the collection of such overdue amount, together
with interest on the amount of the judgment, from and including the date such
payment was required to be made until but excluding the date of payment at
the prime rate set forth in the _Wall Street Journal_ in effect on the date
such payment was required to be made plus 2%. __

 



58 Section 8.03. _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this
Agreement by either the Company or Parent as provided in _Section 8.01_,
this Agreement shall forthwith become void and have no effect, without any
liability or obligation on the part of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company,
other than the provisions of  _Section 6.05_, _Section 6.12(d)_, _Section
8.02_, this _Section 8.03_, _Article IX_, which provisions shall survive
such termination; _provided_ that nothing herein (including the payment
of any amounts under _Section 8.02_) shall relieve any party from any
liability for any intentional and material breach hereof prior to such
termination. For purposes of this Agreement, " _intentional and material
breach_ " means a material breach that is a consequence of an act undertaken
by the breaching party with the knowledge (actual or constructive) that the
taking of such act would, or would be reasonably expected to, cause a breach
of this Agreement (it being understood that the failure of any party to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement when known to be or
should be known to be required under the terms of this Agreement, as
applicable, shall constitute an intentional and material breach), and the
aggrieved party will be entitled to all rights and remedies available at Law
or in equity, including in the case of a breach by Parent or Merger Sub,
liability to the Company for damages, determined taking into account all
relevant factors including the lost stockholder premium, if any, suffered by
the Companys stockholders, which shall be deemed damages to the Company, and
any benefit to Parent or its stockholders arising from such breach, _provided_
that, in the event that the Company pursues any proceeding against Parent or
Merger Sub that alleges the failure of Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and seeks monetary damages in
connection with such alleged failure, Parent may at any time from the
commencement of any such proceeding until, if a court of competent
jurisdiction enters a final judgment ordering Parent or Merger Sub to pay any
such damages, the later of (a) the fifth business day after the entry of such
final judgment and (b) if Parent shall have filed a notice appealing such
final judgment within five business days after its issuance, the fifth
business day after such final judgment shall have become final
and nonappealable (such later date, the " _Closing Notice Deadline_ "),
notify the Company in writing that it will consummate the Closing within five
business days following such notice, in which case the parties shall
consummate the Closing on or prior to such fifth business day. The Company
shall not be permitted or entitled to enforce any such judgment (i) until the
later of (A) the day following the Closing Notice Deadline and (B) if Parent
provides notice on or prior to the Closing Notice Deadline that it will
consummate the Closing, the end of the fifth business day following such
notice or (ii) if the Closing shall have occurred.

 

Section 8.04. _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto
at any time before or after receipt of the Stockholder Approval; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that after such approval has been obtained, there shall be made no
amendment that by Law requires further approval by the stockholders of the
Company or Parent without such further approval having been obtained. This
Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on
behalf of each of the parties hereto.

 

Section 8.05. _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time,
the parties may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the
obligations or other acts of the other parties, (b) waive any inaccuracies in
the representations and warranties contained herein or in

 



59  any document delivered pursuant hereto or (c) subject to the proviso to the
first sentence of _Section 8.04_, waive compliance with any of the agreements
or conditions contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a party to any
such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of such party. The failure of any party to this
Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall
not constitute a waiver of such rights.

of, and be enforceable by, the parties and their respective successors and
assigns.

 

Section 9.07. _Enforcement of the Agreement; Consent to Jurisdiction_. The
parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of
the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached, and that monetary damages, even if
available, would not be an adequate remedy therefor. It is accordingly agreed
that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this

 



61  Agreement, without proof of actual damages (and each party hereby agrees not
to assert that a remedy of specific performance is unenforceable, invalid,
contrary to the Laws of any jurisdiction or inequitable, and waives any
requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with such
remedy), in the chancery courts of the State of Delaware or in any federal
court located in the State of Delaware, this being in addition to any other
remedy to which they are entitled at Law or in equity. In addition, each of
