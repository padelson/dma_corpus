(a) Reserved.



(b) On the Closing Date (as defined in _Section 3.1_ below), Buyer shall
deposit or cause to be deposited into an interest bearing escrow account, an
amount equal to Sixteen Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($16,500,000)
(the "Escrow Amount"), with a mutually acceptable escrow agent (the "Escrow
Agent") under the terms and provisions of an escrow agreement in substantially
the form of _Exhibit C_ hereto (the "Escrow Agreement"), which such
Escrow Amount shall be held in escrow by the Escrow Agent until determination
and payment of the Escrow Amount as set forth in the Escrow Agreement. Such
Escrow Amount shall be used: (i) to help satisfy any indemnification claims
made by Buyer under this Agreement; and (ii) to help satisfy the Sellers
obligations pursuant to _Sections 2.10, 2.11, 2.12, 2.13 and 2.14_ , all
amounts due to Buyer, if any, and amounts owed to the Independent Auditor (as such term is defined in _Section 2.3_) by Selling Persons pursuant to the
Aggregate Net Working Capital (as such term is defined in _Section 2.3_
below) adjustment, and (iii) for such other items mutually agreed to by the
parties. Any interest or other earnings on the Escrow Amount shall be paid by
the Escrow Agent on a pro-rata basis to the party or parties to this
Agreement in accordance with the proportionate share of the Escrow Amount
delivered to such party or parties. In the event that, before the end of the
fourteenth (14th) month following the Closing, Buyer has not submitted claims
for indemnification under _Section 7.10(c)_ of this Agreement with
an aggregate value in excess of One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000), Five
Million Dollars ($5,000,000) of the Escrow Amount, together with the interest
accrued thereon, shall be released to Selling Persons in accordance with the
terms of the Escrow Agreement as soon as practicable and divided among the
Selling Persons in accordance with the Pro Rata Share. The parties further
agree that in the event that the entire One Million Five Hundred Thousand
Dollars ($1,500,000) portion of the Escrow Amount that has been designated by
the parties to help satisfy any amounts due to Buyer or the Independent
Auditor by Selling Persons pursuant to the Aggregate Net Working Capital
adjustment ("Aggregate Net Working Capital Designated Amount") is not
required to be used to pay Buyer amounts due to Buyer under _Section 2.3_ or
not required to be used to pay amounts due to the Independent Auditor by
Selling Persons under _Section 2.3_, then within ten (10) days following the
final determination of the Aggregate Net Working Capital (as set forth in
_Section 2.3_ below), the unused portion of Aggregate Net Working Capital
Designated Amount, together with the interest accrued thereon, shall be
released to Selling Persons in accordance with the terms of the Escrow
Agreement and divided among the Selling Persons in accordance with the Pro
Rata Share. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, (i) the Selling Persons shall be deemed jointly and severally
liable with respect to claims made under this Agreement only to the extent of
the funds then held by the Escrow Agent pursuant to the Escrow Agreement; and
(ii) Buyer shall obtain payment of any claim hereunder from the funds held by
the Escrow Agent and, to the extent such funds are insufficient or
unavailable, from the Selling Persons severally in accordance with their
respective Pro Rata Share.



2.3 _Purchase Price Working Capital Adjustment_.



(a) The Purchase Price set forth in _Section 2.2_ above is based on the
requirement that the Aggregate Net Working Capital of the Keys Group (as such
term is defined on _Exhibit D_ hereto) as of the Closing Date shall not be
less than Thirteen Million Three Hundred Twenty-Five Thousand Dollars
($13,325,000) (the "Target Amount").



(b) Within one hundred twenty (120) days following the Closing, Buyer and the
Sellers Representative (as defined in _Section 9.12_) shall mutually agree
upon a final determination of the Aggregate Net Working Capital of the Keys
Group as of the Closing Date and such determination shall be binding upon all
the parties. Such determination shall be made in a manner that is consistent
with: (i) the accounting principles and illustrative calculation set forth on
_Exhibit E_ hereto; (ii) the historical practices of each member of the Keys
Group, consistently applied; and (iii) Financial Statements. For purposes of
determining the Aggregate Net Working Capital of the Keys Group as of the
Closing, after the Closing, Buyer shall cause the Keys Group, at the sole
cost and expense of the Selling Persons (i) to permit agents of Sellers
Representative, during normal business hours, to have reasonable access to,
and to examine and make copies of, all books and records of the Keys Group
which are in the possession of Buyer or its affiliates (including the members
of the Keys Group); and (ii) to make available for consultation the financial
personnel and agents of the Keys Group, including, without limitation, its
accountants. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event Buyer and the
Sellers Representative are unable to agree on the Aggregate Net Working
Capital of the Keys Group as of the Closing Date within such one hundred
twenty (120) day period, Buyer and Sellers Representative shall mutually
engage the Philadelphia office of Deloitte and Touche LLP or such other
independent accounting firm agreed upon by Buyer and Sellers Representative (the "Independent Auditor") who using: (i)
the accounting principles and illustrative calculation set forth on _Exhibit
E_ hereto; (ii) the historical practices of each member of the Keys Group,
consistently applied by each such member; and (iii) the Financial Statements,
shall make a final determination of the Aggregate Net Working Capital of the
Keys Group as of the Closing Date. The written report (the "Report") of the
Independent Auditor shall be binding upon the parties and the fees and
expenses of the Independent Auditor shall be borne fifty percent (50%) by
Buyer and fifty percent (50%) by Selling Persons; provided, that Selling
Persons shall cause the Escrow Agent to pay their portion of such fees and
expenses, if any, out of the Aggregate Net Working Capital Designated Amount,
but only to the extent funds to be paid to Buyer pursuant to _Section 2.3(c)_
are less than the Aggregate Net Working Capital Designated Amount.
Notwithstanding any statement contained in this Agreement to the contrary, if
the Report is not, for whatever reason, finalized and delivered to Sellers
Representative and Buyer within one hundred eighty (180) days of the Closing,
then the dispute of the parties regarding the Aggregate Net Working Capital
of the Keys Group as of the Closing Date may be submitted for resolution by
Sellers Representative or Buyer to binding arbitration in accordance with
_Section 9.16_.



(c) Within five (5) days following the final determination of the Aggregate
Net Working Capital of the Keys Group as of the Closing Date in the manner set
forth in _Section 2.3(b) _above, to the extent required, a final adjustment
to the Purchase Price will be made by Buyer or Selling Persons. In the event
that the Aggregate Net Working Capital of the Keys Group as of the Closing
Date is less than the Target Amount, the Purchase Price shall be reduced
dollar for dollar by the amount that the Aggregate Net Working Capital of the
Keys Group as of the Closing Date is less than the Target Amount, Selling
Persons shall cause the Escrow Agent to pay such difference to Buyer out of
the Escrow Amount within the five (5) day period set forth above. In the event
that the Aggregate Net Working Capital of the Keys Group as of the Closing
Date is greater than the Target Amount, the Purchase Price shall be increased
dollar for dollar by the amount that the Aggregate Net Working Capital of the
Keys Group as of the Closing Date exceeds the Target Amount and Buyer shall
pay such difference to the account or accounts designated by the Sellers
Representative within the five (5) day period set forth above and such amounts
shall be divided among the Selling Persons by the Sellers Representative in
accordance with their respective Pro Rata Share.



(d) The provisions of this _Section 2.3_ shall be the sole and exclusive
remedy for any disputes or disagreements concerning the determination of the
Aggregate Net Working Capital of the Keys Group. Buyer shall not be entitled
to seek indemnification with respect to a breach of any representation or
warranty made by Management Sellers or Sellers that is based on the Aggregate
Net Working Capital of the Keys Group.



2.4 Reserved.



2.5 _Severance Payments_. Selling Persons agree that they are responsible for
paying, or for causing the Keys Group to pay prior to the Closing, all of the
severance payments due to employees of the Keys Group as a direct result of
the consummation of the transactions set forth in this Agreement, including,
without limitation, the $3,904,778 to be divided among the persons set forth
on _Schedule 2.5_ hereto as determined by the Keys Group prior to Closing
("Severance Payments"). Management Sellers (as defined in _Section 4.1_)
represent and warrant that, other than those set forth on  _Schedule 2.5_
hereto, there are no payments arising solely in connection with the
consummation of the transactions set forth in this Agreement that have been
promised by the Keys Group or are due to any employee by the Keys Group. In
the event that any portion of the Severance Payments have not been paid as of
the Closing ("Unpaid Severance"), at Closing, Selling Persons shall cause the
Unpaid Severance amounts to be paid out of the Purchase Price proceeds. On the
Closing Date, Sellers Representative shall deliver releases (the "Severance
Releases") to Buyer, in a form reasonably satisfactory to Buyer, executed by
each of the persons listed on _Schedule 2.5_ hereto. 2.6 _Option Holders_ Set forth on _Schedule 2.6_ hereto is a list of all
persons (the "Option Holders") who hold options and/or warrants to acquire
shares of Keys ownership interests. Immediately prior to the Closing, all of
the Keys outstanding options and/or warrants held by the Option Holders will
become immediately exercisable and fully vested in accordance with their
terms and each Option Holder will exercise such Option Holders options and/or
warrants and will satisfy the applicable exercise price and applicable
withholding Taxes through the cashless exercise arrangement described below.
To facilitate the cashless exercise arrangement, Keys shall, immediately prior
to the exercise of the options and/or warrants, establish a per share fair
value of Keys common ownership interest (the "Per Share Value"), taking into
consideration the Purchase Price (and any adjustments required by this
Agreement which are known prior to Closing) and the number of shares of Keys
common Ownership Interests then outstanding and shares of Keys
common Ownership Interests issuable upon the exercise of outstanding options
and/or warrants. Upon exercise of the options and/or warrants, each Option
Holder will receive a number of whole and fractional shares of Keys common
Ownership Interests equal to (i) the aggregate spread value (i.e., the excess
of the Per Share Value over the exercise price) of such Option Holders
options and/or warrants divided by the Per Share Value (ii) _less_ the amount
of applicable withholding Taxes.



2.7 _Cash Retention and Adjustment_. Other than (i) routine petty cash
amounts held by a member of the Keys Group in connection with a Facility in
the aggregate amount of $80,000 ("Petty Cash") and (ii) the net cash proceeds
to be received by Keys (the "Magnolia Cash") in connection with the sale of
real property by Keystone NPS, LLC located on Magnolia Avenue, Riverside,
California (assuming such sale is consummated prior to the Closing), which
amount the Management Sellers anticipate to be $886,000, Selling Persons
shall be entitled to retain any cash on the balance sheet of Keys as of the
Effective Date (as hereinafter defined) ("Book Cash"). It is contemplated that
Book Cash as of the Effective Date will equal the sum of the Petty Cash plus
the Magnolia Cash, and that Keys will retain sufficient cash in its bank
accounts to satisfy all checks which are outstanding as of the Effective Date.
In the event that the Book Cash as of the Effective Date is greater than the
sum of the Petty Cash plus the Magnolia Cash (after giving effect to any
distributions of cash to the Selling Persons in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement), the Purchase Price shall be
increased by the amount of such excess and Buyer shall, within five (5) days
after determination of such excess, pay such excess to the account(s)
designated by the Sellers Representative, which shall distribute such amounts
to the Selling Persons, according to their Pro Rata Share. In the event that
the Book Cash as of the Effective Date is less than the sum of the Petty Cash
plus the Magnolia Cash (after giving effect to any such distributions), the
Purchase Price shall be decreased by the amount of such deficiency
and Selling Persons (acting through the Sellers Representative) shall cause
such amount to be paid to Buyer from the funds held by the Escrow Agent. The
determination of Book Cash as of the Effective Date shall be made in
accordance with (i) the procedures set forth on _Schedule 2.7_ hereto; (ii)
GAAP; and (iii) Financial Statements. Nothing contained herein shall permit
either the Selling Persons or Buyer to have any rights with respect cash
amounts as listed in the "cash" section of the consolidated balance sheet in
either the Resident Recreational Account or the Cash on Hand-Patient Trt
Account.



2.8 _Satisfaction of Indebtedness_. On the Closing Date, Selling Persons shall
use a portion of the Purchase Price to pay, discharge and satisfy in full
those obligations set forth on _Schedule 2.8_ hereto (collectively the
"Indebtedness Amount").



2.9 _Options and Severance Payments Tax Benefit_. Selling Persons, Sellers
Representative and Buyer acknowledge that the Keys Group will be generally
entitled to claim a deduction for Tax purposes for the taxable period ending on or including the Closing Date for
the amount of the Severance Payments paid to employees of the Keys Group and
the value of the Keys common Ownership Interests received by the Option
Holders on the cashless exercise arrangement as described in _Section 2.5_
and _Section 2.6_. The calculation of such tax deduction (the "Tax
Deduction") is set forth in a letter delivered to Buyer as of the date hereof
(the "Letter"). When Buyer or the Keys Group files a Tax Return that utilizes
the option and severance Tax benefit, Buyer shall pay the utilized amount,
not to exceed in the aggregate the amount set forth in the Letter, to the
account or accounts designated by the Sellers Representative within five (5)
days of the filing of such Tax Return and such amounts shall be divided among
the Selling Persons by the Sellers Representative in accordance with their
respective Pro Rata Share. If, after paying the amount set forth in the Letter
to Selling Persons, Buyer is required to pay all or a portion of the
Tax Deduction to the applicable Authority, Selling Persons shall reimburse
Buyer for such amount, together with interest and penalties, and pay in
accordance with the respective Pro Rata Share.



2.10 _Professional Liability and Workers Compensation Accrual_. 



(a) The parties agree and acknowledge that the consolidated balance sheet of
the Keys Group dated as of May 31, 2005 included accruals for current and long
term professional liability matters in the amount of $1,452,423 (the "Initial
Professional Liability Accrual") and for current and long term workers
compensation matters in the amount of $3,919,833 (the "Initial WC Accrual"
and, together with the Initial Professional Liability Accrual, the "Initial
Accruals"). During the five year period following the Closing, Buyer shall
have the right to make a one-time election to invoke the provisions of
_Section 2.10(b)_ and _2.10(c)_. Buyer shall exercise such right by written
notice to Sellers Representative.



(b) Following the election of Buyer as set forth above, the Nashville
office of Ernst and Young (in coordination with such other offices of Ernst and
Young as may be reasonably necessary), or such other accounting or actuarial
firm acceptable to Buyer and Sellers Representative (the "Actuary"), shall
determine the amounts that would have been proper for Keys Group to accrue as
of May 31, 2005 for professional liability (the "Professional Liability Look
Back Amount") and workers compensation (the "WC Lookback Amount" and,
together with the Professional Liability Lookback Amount, the "Lookback
Amounts") if the actuarial analysis that was used in developing the Initial
Accruals was able to include the experience of Keys Group between May 31,
2005 and the date on which Buyer exercises its rights under _Section 2.10(a)_
(the "Lookback Date"). Such determination shall be made in accordance with (1)
the terms and conditions of this Agreement; (2) the actuarial methods and
assumptions used in developing the Initial Accruals, including without
limitation those attached hereto as Exhibit 2.10, together with those used
historically by Keys Group with respect to such matters; and (3) other
actuarial practices and assumptions of the American Society of Actuaries.
Buyer and Sellers Representative shall instruct the Actuary to use its
reasonable best efforts to provide Buyer and Sellers Representative with
a written report setting forth the Lookback Amounts within sixty (60) days
after the Lookback Date. The fees and expenses of the Actuary shall be borne
fifty percent (50%) by Buyer and fifty percent (50%) by Selling Persons.
Selling Persons may cause Escrow Agent to pay their portion of such fees and
expenses out of the funds then held by the Escrow Agent, if any; provided that
in the event the funds then held by the Escrow Agent are insufficient to pay
such expenses in full, the Selling Persons shall be obligated to pay such
deficiency in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Share.



(c) Within five (5) days following the final determination of the Lookback
Amounts in the manner set forth in _Section 2.10(b)_, an adjustment to the
Purchase Price will be made by Buyer or Selling Persons. In the event that the
Lookback Amounts are less than the Initial Accruals, the Purchase Price shall
be increased by 50% of the amount by which the Lookback Amounts are less than
the Initial Accruals and Buyer shall pay such 50% to the account or accounts designated by
the Sellers Representative within the five (5) day period set forth above
and such amounts shall be divided among the Selling Persons in accordance with
their respective Pro Rata Share. In the event that the Lookback Amounts are
more than the Initial Accruals, the Purchase Price shall be reduced by 50% of
the amount by which the Lookback Amounts are greater than the Initial Accruals
and Selling Persons (acting through the Sellers Representative) shall cause
the Escrow Agent to pay such 50% to Buyer out of the Escrow Amount within the
five (5) day period set forth above; provided that in the event the funds then
held by the Escrow Agent are insufficient to pay such difference to Buyer,
Selling Persons shall be obligated to pay Buyer such deficiency in accordance
with their respective Pro Rata Share. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no
event shall Selling Persons be obligated to pay, or to require the Escrow
Agent to pay, Buyer more than 100% of the Initial Accruals.



(d) The provisions of this _Section 2.10_ shall be the sole and exclusive
remedy for any disputes or disagreements concerning the accruals of Keys Group
with respect to professional liability and workers compensation matters. Buyer
shall not be entitled to seek indemnification with respect to a breach of
any representation or warranty made by Management Sellers or Sellers with
respect to the accruals for professional liability and workers compensation
matters, including without limitation those set forth in _Section 4.1(g)_.



2.11 _Taxes_.



(a) The parties agree and acknowledge that the consolidated balance sheet
of the Keys Group dated as of June 30, 2005 included a current liability for
accruals with respect to federal and state income Taxes of the Keys Group that
is presented as Income Taxes Payable and Other Short Term Liabilities in the
amount of $4,370,608 (the "June Tax Accruals") (such June Tax Accruals _less_
the amount determined to be applicable to deferred federal and state income
Taxes in accordance with Section 2.11(b) (the "June Deferred Income
Tax Accrual") and _less_ the Contingency Reserve (as defined hereafter in
_Section 2.11(c)_) collectively, the "June Income Tax Accrual"). In the event
that, between the Closing and the five year period following the Closing
("Tax Date"), Buyer or the Keys Group has liability for any federal or state
income Taxes with respect to the Keys Group for any period ending on or before
September 30, 2005 (a "Pre-Closing Period") (excluding the amount of the
Options and Severance Payments Tax benefit as determined in Section 2.9) in
excess of the June Income Tax Accrual, the Purchase Price shall be decreased
by such amount and Selling Persons (acting through the
Sellers Representative) shall cause the Escrow Agent to pay such amounts to
Buyer out of the Escrow Amount within thirty (30) days after receipt of the
applicable invoice(s) from Buyer; provided that in the event the funds then
held by the Escrow Agent are insufficient to pay Buyer in full, the Selling
Persons shall be obligated to pay Buyer such deficiency in accordance with
their respective Pro Rata Share. In the event that, between the Closing and
the Tax Date, the Buyers or Keys Groups liability for any federal or state
income Taxes with respect to the Keys Group for any Pre-Closing Period
(excluding the amount of the Options and Severance Payments Tax benefit as
determined in Section 2.9) is less than the June Income Tax Accrual, the
Purchase Price shall be increased by such amount and Buyer shall pay such
difference to the account or accounts designated by the Sellers
Representative within five (5) days following the Tax Date, which amounts the
Sellers Representative shall distribute among the Selling Persons in
accordance with their respective Pro Rata Share. For purposes of this _Section
2.11(a)_, income Taxes with respect to any taxable period beginning prior
to September 30, 2005 but ending after September 30, 2005 shall be allocated
to the Pre-Closing Period using an interim closing of the books method and
such income Taxes shall be deemed to be income Taxes of a Pre-Closing Period.
The provisions of this _Section 2.11(a)_ shall be the sole and exclusive
remedy for any disputes or disagreements concerning the accruals of Keys Group
with respect to federal and state income Taxes. Buyer shall not be entitled to
seek indemnification with respect to a breach of any representation or
warranty made by Management Sellers or Sellers with respect to the accruals
for Taxes, including without limitation those set forth in _Section 4.1(e)
and (g)_. (b) The parties further agree and acknowledge that Buyer and the Sellers
Representative shall determine the portion of the June Tax Accruals that
should have been characterized as the June Deferred Income Tax Accrual as of
June 30, 2005. Such determination shall be based upon the completion of a tax
provision performed within sixty (60) days of the completion of any Tax
Return that includes the June 30, 2005 tax period date in a manner that is
consistent with the historical practices of each member of the Keys Group,
consistently applied.



(c) The parties further agree and acknowledge that Keys included a
current liability for federal and state income Tax contingencies (the
"Contingency Reserve") in its June Tax Accruals in the amount of $2,086,504.
In the event that, between the Closing and the Tax Date, Buyer or the Keys
Group pays any federal or state income Taxes with respect to the Keys Group
for the Pre-Closing Period in excess of the Contingency Reserve as a result of
an applicable Authority making adjustments to federal or state income Tax
Returns of the Keys Group with respect to a Pre-Closing Period, the Purchase
Price shall be decreased by such amount and Selling Persons (acting through
the Sellers Representative) shall cause the Escrow Agent to pay such amounts
to Buyer out of the Escrow Amount within thirty (30) days after receipt of
the applicable invoice(s) from Buyer; provided that in the event the funds
then held by the Escrow Agent are insufficient to pay Buyer in full, the
Selling Persons shall be obligated to pay Buyer such deficiency in accordance
with their respective Pro Rata Share.



2.12  _Construction Projects_. The parties acknowledge that various
construction and/or renovation projects of the Keys Group will not be
completed prior to Closing. With respect to those construction and/or
renovation projects described on  _Schedule 2.12_ (each, a "Project" and
collectively, the "Projects"), Buyer shall cause Keys to send Sellers
Representative a monthly invoice of the construction and/or renovation costs
paid by any member of the Keys Group between the Closing and the twelve month
period following Closing pursuant to the applicable Contract (without giving
effect to any change orders issued in connection therewith following Closing
or amendments to such Contracts entered following the Closing). In the event
that the amount(s) reflected on any such invoice, in the aggregate, exceeds
(i) the sums paid by the applicable member of the Keys Group prior to Closing
with respect to such Project _plus_  (ii) the applicable accrual made with
respect to that Project as set forth in _Schedule 2.12_ (the "Project
Accruals"), the Purchase Price shall be reduced by such amount(s) and Selling
Persons (acting through the Sellers Representative) shall cause the Escrow
Agent to pay such amounts to Buyer out of the Escrow Amount within thirty (30)
days after receipt of the applicable invoice(s). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in no event shall Selling Persons be obligated to pay, or to
require the Escrow Agent to pay, Buyer more than the difference between the
sums paid by the applicable member of the Keys Group prior to Closing with
respect to such Project _plus_ the applicable Project Accruals and (ii) the
specified amount, if any, required to be paid by the Keys Group pursuant to
the applicable Contract as set forth on _Schedule 2.12_. Buyer shall not be
entitled to seek indemnification with respect to a breach of
any representation or warranty made by Management Sellers or Sellers with
respect to the accruals for the Projects, including without limitation those
set forth in _Section 4.1(g)_.



2.13 _Guaranty_. In the event that, as of the Closing, the amount outstanding
pursuant to the Foundations line of credit from First Tennessee exceeds One
Million One Hundred Thousand Dollars, the Purchase Price shall be decreased by
such excess and Selling Persons (acting through the Sellers Representative)
shall cause the Escrow Agent to pay such excess to Buyer out of the Escrow
Amount within five (5) days after the Closing. The provisions of this _Section
2.13_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedy for any disputes or disagreements
concerning the accruals of the Keys Group with  respect to the Foundations line of credit. Buyer shall not be entitled to
seek indemnification with respect to a breach of any representation or
warranty made by Management Sellers or Sellers with respect to the accruals
for the Foundations line of credit, including without limitation those set
forth in _Section 4.1(g)_.



2.14 _Notes_. Following the Closing, the Buyer shall provide Sellers
Representative with written notice (the "Promissory Notice") of the failure of
the applicable member of the Keys Group to receive amounts due pursuant to the
promissory notes set forth on _Schedule 2.14_ (the "Notes") after the
Closing. The Promissory Notice shall include an offer to convey the Notes,
together with any security therefor, to Selling Persons in exchange for cash
in an amount equal to the discounted cash flows that would otherwise be due
under the applicable Note (using the interest rate and remaining term set
forth in the applicable Note) (the "Note Price"). Sellers Representative
shall send Buyer written notice of the acceptance of the offer within
fifteen (15) days after the receipt of the Promissory Notice. As soon as
reasonably practical after such acceptance, (A) Sellers Representative and
Buyer shall execute and deliver such documents and instruments of conveyance

_REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES_



4.1  _Representations and Warranties of Management Sellers_. The Sellers
listed on _Schedule 4.1_ (the "Management Sellers") jointly and severally
represent and warrant to Buyer (subject to the limitations and exceptions
disclosed in the correspondingly numbered Schedules to this Agreement) as of
the date hereof and as of the Closing (except to the extent such
representations and warranties specifically speak only as of one of those
dates or as of another date, in which case as of such date) as follows:



(a) _Organization_. Each member of the Keys Group is a limited liability
company or corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing
under the laws of its state of organization or incorporation and has the
requisite limited liability company or corporate power and authority to own
its properties and carry on its business as it is now being conducted. Each
member of the Keys Group is qualified to do business in all jurisdictions in
which property owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of the
business conducted by it makes such qualification necessary and where the
failure to so qualify would have a material adverse effect on it. _Schedule
4.1(a)_ sets forth a true and complete list of: (i) all jurisdictions where
each member of the Keys Group is incorporated or organized; (ii) all
jurisdictions where each member of the Keys Group is qualified or licensed to
do business as a foreign corporation or limited liability company; (iii) all
of the officers and directors of each member of the Keys Group; and (iv) all
powers of attorney granted by any member of the Keys Group to any third party
that are currently in effect. Attached to _Schedule 4.1(a)_ are copies of each

herein and therein. The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
Transaction Documents by each such party, and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, have been duly authorized by all
necessary action on the part of each Selling Person. This Agreement and the
Transaction Documents have been duly executed and delivered by each Selling
Person that is a party thereto and, assuming due execution and delivery by
Buyer, this Agreement and each of the Transaction Documents to which
each Selling Person is a party constitutes a valid and binding obligation of
each such Selling Person, enforceable against each such party in accordance
with their respective terms, and subject, as to enforceability, to: (i)
bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, moratorium, reorganization and
other similar laws affecting creditors rights generally; and (ii) general
principles of equity, including principles of commercial reasonableness, good
faith and fair dealing (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a
proceeding at law or equity). Neither the execution and delivery of this
Agreement or the Transaction Documents by each Selling Person nor the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby constitutes a
violation of any provision of the certificate of incorporation or certificate
of organization, or bylaws or operating agreement of any Selling Person or any
member of the Keys Group or violates, or except as set forth on
_Schedule 4.1(b)_ , is in conflict with, or constitutes a default under any
agreement or commitment which is set forth on _Schedule 4.1(b)_ , or to which
any Selling Person is a party or by which any Selling Person is bound, or
violates any statute or law or any judgment, decree, order, regulation or
rule of any court or governmental authority, which violation would result in a
material adverse effect on the Keys Group.

Ownership Interests in Keys is 45,000,000, of which 10,000,000 are designated

date hereof, all of the outstanding Ownership Interests are owned of record
and beneficially by Sellers in the respective amounts set forth on _Schedule

since issuance, have not been transferred except in accordance with) in
all material respects in compliance with all applicable federal and state
securities laws and with all of the agreements and instruments relating to the
Ownership Interests. Except as set forth on _Schedule 4.1(c)_ , no Seller nor
any member of the Keys Group is a party to any voting trust, proxy, or other
agreements imposing obligations with respect to the voting of or restrictions
on transfer of the Ownership Interests. Other than as set forth on _Schedule
4.1(c)_ , there does not exist, with respect to any member of the Keys Group,
any outstanding right or security granted or issued by Keys Group to any
person or entity (including, any warrant, option, convertible debt obligation,

liability company status of each member of the Keys Group will be timely filed

otherwise due as of the date hereof or prior to the Closing Date in connection
with the properties, business, income, expenses, net worth and corporate or
limited liability status of each member of the Keys Group have been paid or

such government or any federal, state, municipal or local court (collectively,
the "Authorities"). 



(f) _Books and Records_. The books and records of the Keys Group with respect

accordance with GAAP except (i) liabilities or obligations reflected or
reserved against in the Financial Statements and (ii) liabilities incurred in

and to do or cause to be done all things necessary, proper or advisable under
applicable laws to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. Upon the reasonable request of another party, each party
agrees to take any and all reasonable actions, including, without limitation,
the execution of certificates or instruments, necessary or appropriate to give

announcement or make any other disclosure relating to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement without the written prior approval
of the other parties except to the extent such disclosure is required by
applicable law, as determined in good faith by the party required to make
such disclosure; provided, however, in the event that Buyer determines in good
faith that it must disclose this Agreement in order to comply with its
obligations under the Exchange Act and/or any rule or regulation promulgated
thereunder, Buyer will first deliver a copy of such disclosure to Sellers
Representative and provided that the Sellers Representative provide comments
to such disclosure to Buyer in a timely manner, Buyer shall consider in good
faith such comments. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, the parties hereto are specifically permitted to disclose the
existence of this Agreement and the terms contained herein, to the extent
required, to such Authorities, including without limitation the Department of
Justice ("DOJ") and the Federal Trade Commission ("FTC") and such third-
parties as may be necessary in order to comply with the provisions set forth

behalf of the other parties or otherwise purport to bind the other parties in
any manner.



7.5  _Confidentiality_.



(a) As used in this Agreement, the following terms shall have the following
meanings:



(i) "Trade Secrets" of a party means information of such party, including,
but not limited to, technical or non-technical data, a formula, a pattern, a
compilation, a program, a device, a method, a technique, a drawing, a
process, financial data, financial plans, product plans, or a list of actual
or potential customers or suppliers, which: (A) derives economic value, actual
or potential, from not being generally known to, and not being readily ascertainable by proper
means by, other persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or
use; and (B) is the subject of efforts that are reasonable under the
circumstances to maintain its secrecy;



(ii) "Confidential Information" of a party means all proprietary and
confidential business information and data of such party that does not
constitute a Trade Secret and that is not generally known by or readily
ascertainable by or available to, on a legal or authorized basis, the general
public. "Confidential Information" as used herein does not include any
information: (A) which is already known to the receiving party (other than
information that was obtained subject to restriction under a prior
confidentiality agreement); or (B) which before being divulged by the
disclosing party (1) has become generally known to the public through no
wrongful act of the receiving party or its representatives, (2) has been
received by the receiving party from a third party without (to the receiving
partys knowledge) restriction on disclosure and without (to the receiving
partys knowledge) a breach by the third party of an obligation of
confidentiality, or (3) is independently developed by the receiving party
without use of the Confidential Information received from a disclosing party;
and



(iii) "Evaluation Materials" means all documents, materials, data and
information (whether oral, written or otherwise) relating to this Agreement
that are given or disclosed by the parties to each other in the course of
pursuing this Agreement, including without limitation those that contain
Confidential Information or Trade Secrets.



(b) Each party agrees that it, its affiliates and their respective directors,
managers, members, partners, officers, employees, representatives, agents and
advisors will use the Evaluation Material and any Confidential Information or
Trade Secrets of another party solely for the purpose of evaluating and
implementing this Agreement and operating the Keys Group after Closing. In any
such use, the receiving party may disclose the Evaluation Materials or any
Confidential Information or Trade Secrets of another party only to such
directors, managers, members, partners, officers, employees, agents,
representatives and advisors who are involved in the receiving partys
evaluation and implementation of this Agreement, and then only on a need to
know basis.



(c) Each party agrees that it will not (and each party shall take full
responsibility for ensuring that all of its affiliates and all of their
respective officers, managers, members, partners, directors, employees,
agents, representatives and advisors do not) in any way disclose,
communicate, transfer or use (other than as allowed by _Section 7.5(b)_) the
Evaluation Material or any Confidential Information or Trade Secrets of
another party, without the prior written consent in each instance of such
other party. With respect to Trade Secrets, the covenants in the preceding
sentence shall apply for as long as the underlying information or data remains
a Trade Secret; with respect to Confidential Information and Evaluation
Information, these covenants shall apply for three (3) years after the date
of this Agreement. All Evaluation Material (including tangible copies and
computerized or electronic versions thereof), except for that portion which
consists of analyses, compilations, comparisons, studies or other documents
prepared by the receiving party, shall remain the property of the disclosing
party. The parties agree to cooperate with each others reasonable
confidentiality procedures as long as any covenant in this Section remains in
force.



(d) After the Closing, all Confidential Information, Trade Secrets and
Evaluation Materials disclosed by Selling Persons and members of the Keys
Group to Buyer hereunder, including, without limitation, all of the same as to
the conduct, ownership or operation of each member of the Keys Group shall
automatically become indirectly the property of Buyer and shall thereafter be
Confidential Information, Trade Secrets and Evaluation Material of Buyer (and
shall be treated at all times thereafter as if Buyer were the disclosing
party thereof rather than the receiving party thereof). (e) Each party agrees that it will promptly return to the disclosing party all
Evaluation Material received from such disclosing party, together with all
Confidential Information and Trade Secrets of such disclosing party, within
five (5) days following the written request of such disclosing party after any
termination of this Agreement under _Section 8.1_. The return of the
Evaluation Material, Confidential Information and Trade Secrets shall be
accomplished by personal delivery or forwarded by reputable couriers properly
addressed to the parties as set forth in  _Section 9.9_. As an alternative,
the receiving party may destroy all such Evaluation Material, Confidential
Information and Trade Secrets, and certify to such disclosing party that such
destruction has been carried out. That portion of the Evaluation Material
which consists of analyses, comparisons, studies or other documents prepared
for confidential use by the receiving party shall be held by the receiving
party and kept confidential as provided above, or shall be destroyed and such
destruction certified to the disclosing party.



(f) Each party agrees that if it becomes subject to a subpoena or other legal
requirement to disclose any of the Confidential Information or Trade Secrets
of another party or any Evaluation Material, it will provide the other parties
with prompt notice so that the other parties may seek a protective order or
other appropriate remedy, as appropriate. If such protective order or other
appropriate remedy is denied or otherwise not obtained, the party required to
furnish the information shall furnish only that portion of the Confidential
Information, Trade Secrets and/or Evaluation Material which is, in the
reasonable opinion of its counsel, legally compelled, and will cooperate with
the other parties and their counsel to enable the other parties to attempt to
obtain a protective order or other reliable assurance that confidential
treatment will be accorded the Confidential Information, Trade Secrets and/or
Evaluation Material to be disclosed. Nothing herein shall prevent any
party from utilizing or disclosing Confidential Information or Trade Secrets
in connection with enforcing its rights or fulfilling its obligations under
this Agreement.



7.6 _Relief_. The parties acknowledge that their failure to comply with the
provisions of _Section 7.5_ will give rise to damages, which may be
impossible to measure accurately, and that injuries sustained from any such
breach will be incalculable and irremediable; provided, however, that each
Selling Person shall only be liable for damages resulting from its, his or
her own failure to comply with _Section 7.5_. Management Sellers shall advise
each of the Selling Persons of their respective confidentiality requirements
hereunder and the liabilities for any breach thereof. Therefore, it is agreed
that any party shall be entitled to, in addition to all other remedies at law,
equitable relief, including without limitation an injunction or order of
specific performance, in any court of competent jurisdiction, in the event of
any breach by any party of _Section 7.5_. Should litigation be necessary to
enforce any provision hereof, the prevailing party shall be entitled to
recover all costs, including reasonable attorneys fees, incurred prior to
suit or after suit, and in all court proceedings, including appellate courts.



7.7  _Maintenance and Furnishing of Information_.



(a) Selling Persons and Buyer agree that, for such period as may be required
by applicable law, he, she, it or they shall not destroy, discard or otherwise
render unavailable any books, records, documents, data or other information
relating principally to the conduct of the business of each member of the
Keys Group or the ownership or operation of the assets and properties of the
Keys Group prior to the Closing Date (the "Information"), without first
offering the other parties in writing the opportunity to obtain possession
thereof at such other partys sole expense; provided that Information shall
not include information created or received by Selling Persons in their
capacity as owners of Ownership Interests, and/or options or warrants to
purchase Ownership Interests. (b) Selling Persons and Buyer agree to maintain easy and ready access and to
make available to the other parties, at reasonable times after reasonable
request therefore and at the requesting partys sole expense, any Information
for the purpose of: (i) preparing for, prosecuting or defending any suit,
action, litigation or administration, arbitration or other proceeding or
investigation (other than one by or against the non-requesting party) by or
against the requesting party; (ii) preparing and filing any Tax Return or
election relating to the Facilities or preparing for or defending any
examination of Tax or Tax Return by any Authority; or (iii) any other
legitimate purpose. The party requesting such information shall reimburse the
party providing such Information for reasonable out-of-pocket costs and
expenses incurred by the party providing such Information.



(c) The access to files, books and records contemplated by this _Section
7.7_ shall be during normal business hours and upon not less than two (2)
business days prior written request, shall be subject to such reasonable
limitations as the party having custody or control thereof may impose to
preserve the confidentiality of information contained therein or to delete
competitively sensitive information, shall not extend to any material subject
to a claim of privilege unless expressly waived by the party entitled to
claim the same, and shall be subject to the confidentiality requirements of
_Section 7.5_.



(d) Buyer shall cause Keys Group to provide Sellers Representative, its
employees, agents and accountants with such assistance as may be
reasonably requested in the connection with their preparation of the
financial statements of the Keys Group for the period ending immediately prior
to the Closing. Such assistance shall include (i) permitting agents of
Sellers Representative, during normal business hours, to have reasonable
access to, and to examine and make copies of, all books and records of the
Keys Group which are in the possession of Buyer or its affiliates (including
the members of the Keys Group); and (ii) making available for consultation
the financial personnel and agents of the Keys Group, including without
limitation accountants.



7.8 _Post Closing Insurance_. In order to provide certain insurance coverage
with respect to claims made after the Closing Date that arise out of
the operation of Keys, its subsidiaries and affiliates prior to the Closing
Date, Buyer agrees to cause Keys, its subsidiaries and affiliates for a period
of five years following the Closing to keep in effect the professional
liability insurance coverage listed on _Schedule 7.8_ hereto or to provide
Selling Persons with the benefit of replacement insurance coverage (whether
through self insurance or otherwise) that is substantially similar in scope
and with the same deductible as that maintained by the Keys Group as of the
date of this Agreement.



7.9 _HSR Notification_. On or before August 19, 2005, Selling Persons and
Buyer each filed a Pre-Merger Notification and Report Form with the DOJ and
the FTC as required by the HSR Act. Selling Persons and Buyer shall
cooperate with each other in connection with all follow-up requests for
additional information, including sharing information concerning sales and
ownership and such other information as may be needed to complete such
notification. The notifications submitted by or on behalf of Selling Persons
and Buyer requested the early termination of the waiting period specified in
the HSR Act. The filing fee required under the regulations promulgated
pursuant to the HSR Act shall be borne by Buyer; provided that the Selling
Persons shall cause Keys Group to reimburse Buyer for one half of the amount
of such filing fee in the event that the Closing does not occur. In the event
either Selling Persons or Buyer shall receive a request for additional
information or documentary material from the DOJ or the FTC, Buyer shall be
primarily responsible for promptly responding to and complying with such
request; provided, however, that Selling Persons shall promptly notify Buyer
of any request they may receive and shall provide Buyer with all information
and documentary materials as are necessary to respond to the request. 7.10 _Nature and Survival of Representations and Warranties; Indemnification_.



(a) _Events of Default_. A breach in any respect of any representation or
warranty by a party, or a breach as a result of the failure of any of such
party to perform any of its respective agreements, covenants and obligations
under this Agreement, shall be considered a default hereunder giving rise to

(c) _Indemnification to Buyer_.



(i) The Selling Persons shall jointly and severally to the extent of the funds
(if any) held by the Escrow Agent, and thereafter, severally, but not
jointly, in accordance with and only to the extent of their Pro Rata Share,
indemnify and hold Buyer, (and from and after the Closing, each member of the
Keys Group) and their respective affiliates, agents and representatives
(each, an "Indemnified Party"), harmless from and against any and all claims,
losses, expenses, damages or liabilities (collectively, the "Indemnified
Losses") arising out of or relating to any of the following: (A) a breach of
the representations and warranties of Management Sellers set forth in this
Agreement or in any other document, Schedule, instrument or certificate
furnished to Buyer by or on behalf of Selling Persons and/or any member of
the Keys Group in connection herewith; (B) any breach, violation or
nonperformance of a covenant, agreement or obligation to be performed
hereunder on the part of Selling Persons; (C) those matters set forth on
_Schedule 7.10(c)_ ; or (D) any actions, judgments, costs and expenses
(including reasonable attorneys fees and all other expenses incurred in
investigating, preparing or defending any litigation or proceedings, commenced
or threatened) incident to this  _Section 7.10(c)_ or the enforcement of
this _Section 7.10(c)_ in the event such costs are incurred in connection
with a claim that is subject to indemnification hereunder.



(ii) All claims for indemnification under _Section 7.10(c)_ shall be paid
first out of the Escrow Amount until exhausted and thereafter shall be paid
severally by Selling Persons in accordance with their respective Pro Rata
Share until paid in full. (d) _Indemnification to Selling Person_. Buyer shall indemnify and hold
Selling Persons and their affiliates, agents and representatives (each, an
"Indemnified Party"), harmless from and against any and all Indemnified Losses
arising out of or relating to any of the following: (i) a breach of the
representations and warranties of Buyer set forth in this Agreement or in any
other document, Schedule, instrument or certificate furnished to Selling
Persons by or on behalf of Buyer in connection herewith; (ii) any breach,
violation or nonperformance of a covenant, agreement or obligation to be
performed hereunder on the part of Buyer; or (iii) any actions, judgments,
costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and all other
expenses incurred in investigating, preparing or defending any litigation or
proceedings, commenced or threatened) incident to this _Section 7.10(d)_ or
the enforcement of this _Section 7.10(d)_ in the event such costs are
incurred in connection with a claim that is subject to
indemnification hereunder.



(e) Other than set forth in this  _Section 7.10(e)_, no claim for
indemnification under this Agreement shall be made by Buyer until the
aggregate of all claims made by Buyer equals or exceeds Five Hundred Thousand
Dollars ($500,000), at which point claims may be made for losses, damages and
liabilities suffered by Buyer in excess of such amount. Other than set forth
in this _Section 7.10(e)_, no claim for indemnification under this Agreement
shall be made by Selling Persons until the aggregate of all claims made by
Selling Persons equal or exceed Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000), at
which point claims may be made for losses, damages and liabilities suffered by
Selling Persons in excess of such amount. The foregoing limitations shall
not be applicable to any claims relating to or arising out of matters set
forth in _Section 7.10(c)(i)(B) (C) or (D)_ (relating to _Section
7.10(c)(i)(B) or (C)_) or in _Section 7.10(d)(ii) or (iii)_ (relating to
_Section 7.10(d)(ii)_).



(f) In no event shall the aggregate amount of the liability of Selling Persons
(taken together) or the liability of Buyer (in each case including all costs
and expenses set forth in _Sections 7.10(c) and 7.10(d)_ above) exceed
Forty Million Dollars ($40,000,000). The foregoing cap on liability shall not
be applicable to the following: (i) the Severance Payments; (ii) the
obligations of Selling Persons pursuant to _Sections 2.10, 2.11, 2.12, 2.13,
and 2.14_ ; or (iii) any matter set forth on _Schedule 7.10(c)_.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the aggregate amount of the
liability of Selling Persons (taken together), including all costs and
expenses set forth in _Sections 7.10(c) and 7.10(d)_ above, exceed Seventy
Million Dollars ($70,000,000).



(g) The indemnification obligations of the parties set forth in _Sections
7.10(c)_ and _7.10(d)_ above shall not include any losses, damages or
liabilities to the extent that such losses, damages or liabilities are paid to
the indemnified party under insurance coverage policies held by or for the
benefit of the indemnified party. To the extent that the indemnified party has
such insurance coverage in place, the indemnified party shall use reasonable
efforts to collect on such coverage; provided, however, nothing contained in
this _Section 7.10(g)_ shall limit either Buyers or Selling Persons right
to proceed concurrently or otherwise against the other. In the event that
either Selling Persons or Buyer, as the case may be, receive payment for an
indemnification claim from the other and also receives payment from any
insurance carrier with respect to the facts or circumstances giving rise to
the indemnification claim, such party shall promptly pay over to the other
all recoveries received under such insurance policy (after deducting such
partys expenses in pursuing such claim) up to the amount paid on account of
such claim by the other party. In the event, however, that any insurance
recovery is paid over to the other party pursuant to this _Section 7.10(g)_,
and such recovery is subsequently required to be returned to the insurance
carrier, the party who received the payment pursuant to this  _Section
7.10(g)_ from the other party, shall promptly return the amount of such
payment in immediately available funds.



(h) Except to the extent Buyer is liable to a third party, including, without
limitation any Authority, for punitive, special, indirect, consequential
or individual damages, including loss of profits, neither Buyer nor Selling
Persons be liable to the other for any punitive, special indirect,
consequential, or incidental damages, including loss of profits. (i) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, from and after the
Closing, the exclusive remedy of each party in connection with this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be as provided in this _Section
7.10_.



(j) Any indemnification payment made under this Agreement shall be
characterized for Tax purposes (and only for Tax purposes) as an adjustment to
the Purchase Price.



(k) In calculating amounts payable to an Indemnified Party, the amount of the
Indemnified Losses shall be computed net of any Tax benefit realized by the
Indemnified Party with respect to such Indemnified Losses.



(l) Following indemnification as provided for hereunder, the indemnifying
party shall be subrogated to all rights of the Indemnified Party with respect
to all persons or entities relating to the matter for which indemnification
has been made.



(m) No party shall be entitled to recover Indemnified Losses to the extent
that the amount of Indemnified Losses has been increased or extended by
the willful misconduct, violation of law or bad faith of such party.



(n) In the event that any claims are made with respect to the matters set
forth on _Schedule 7.10(n)_ , the Selling Persons shall vigorously oppose such
claims and shall keep Buyer fully informed with respect thereto. The
Selling Persons shall severally, but not jointly, in accordance with and only
to the extent of their Pro Rata Share, indemnify and hold Buyer, (and from and
after the Closing, each member of the Keys Group) and their respective
affiliates, agents and representatives harmless from and against any and all
Indemnified Losses arising out of or relating to the matters set forth on
_Schedule 7.10(n)_. The limitations contained in _Sections 7.10(e) and
7.10(f)_ shall not apply with respect to the obligations of the Selling
Persons pursuant to this _Section 7.10(n)_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, the Selling Persons shall not be entitled to
utilize any portion of the funds then held by the Escrow Agent in order to
satisfy their respective obligations set forth in this _Section 7.10(n)_,
provided, however that Buyer, at its election, may make a claim under the
Escrow Agreement and be paid out of the Escrow Amount for amounts due on
account of the Selling Persons obligations herein.



7.11  _Procedure for Indemnification  Non-Third Party Claims_. Whenever any
claim shall arise for indemnification hereunder and such claim does not
involve a demand, claim, action or proceeding made or brought by a third
party, including without limitation an Authority, the Indemnified Party shall
notify the indemnifying party promptly after such Indemnified Party has actual
knowledge of the facts constituting the basis for such claim. The notice to
the indemnifying party shall specify, if known, the amount or an estimate of
the amount of the Indemnified Losses arising therefrom.



7.12 _Procedure for Indemnification  Third Party Claims_.



(a) Promptly after receipt by an Indemnified Party of notice of the
commencement of any demand, claim, action or proceeding made or brought by a
third party, including without limitation an Authority (a "Proceeding"), such
Indemnified Party will, if a claim is to be made against an indemnifying party
pursuant to this _Article VII_ , give written notice (the "Claims Notice") to
the indemnifying party of the commencement of the Proceeding, but the failure
to notify the indemnifying party will not relieve the indemnifying party of any liability that it may
have to the Indemnified Party, except to the extent that the indemnifying
party demonstrates that the defense of such action is prejudiced by the
indemnified partys failure to give such notice. The Claims Notice shall
describe the Proceeding in reasonable detail and shall specify, if known, the
amount or an estimate of the amount of the Indemnified Losses arising
therefrom.



(b) If any Proceeding referred to in _Section 7.12(a)_ is brought against an
Indemnified Party and such Indemnified Party gives notice to the indemnifying
party of the commencement of such Proceeding, the indemnifying party will be
entitled to participate in such Proceeding and, to the extent that it wishes
(unless (i) the indemnifying party is also a party to such Proceeding and the
Indemnified Party determines in good faith that joint representation would be
inappropriate, or (ii) the indemnifying party fails to provide reasonable
assurances to the Indemnified Party of its financial capacity to defend such
Proceeding and provide indemnification with respect to such Proceeding), to
assume the defense of such Proceeding with counsel satisfactory to the
Indemnified Party and, after notice from the indemnifying party to the
Indemnified Party of its election to assume the defense of such Proceeding,
the indemnifying party will not, as long as it diligently conducts such
defense, be liable to the Indemnified Party under this _Article VII_ for any
fees of other counsel or any other expenses with respect to the defense of
such Proceeding, in each case subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Party
in connection with the defense of such Proceeding, other than reasonable costs
of investigation. If the indemnifying party assumes the defense of a
proceeding, (y) it will be conclusively established for purposes of this
Agreement that the claims made in the Proceeding are within the scope of and
subject to indemnification in accordance with this Article VII and (z) no
compromise or settlement of such claims may be effected by the indemnifying
party without the Indemnified Partys consent unless (I) there is no finding
or admission of any violation of legal requirements or any violation of the
rights of any person and no effect on any other claims that may be made
against the Indemnified Party; and (II) the sole relief provided is monetary
damages that are to be paid in full by the indemnifying party; and (III) the
Indemnified Party will have no liability with respect to any compromise or
settlement of such claims effected without its consent. If notice is given to
an indemnifying party of the commencement of any Proceeding and the
indemnifying party does not, within ten days after the Indemnified Partys
notice is given, give notice to the indemnified party of its election to
assume the defense of such Proceeding, the indemnifying party will be bound by
any determination made in such Proceeding or any compromise or settlement
effected by the Indemnified Party.



(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an Indemnified Party determines in
good faith that there is a reasonable probability that a Proceeding may
adversely affect it or its affiliates other than as a result of monetary
damages for which it would be entitled to indemnification under this
Agreement, the Indemnified Party may, by notice to the indemnifying party,
assume the exclusive right to defend, compromise or settle such Proceeding,
but the indemnifying party will not be bound by any determination of a
Proceeding so defended or any compromise or settlement effected without its
consent (which may not be unreasonably withheld.) If the indemnifying party
does not assume the defense of any claim or litigation, any Indemnified Party
may defend against such claim or litigation in such manner as it may
deem appropriate, including, but not limited to, settling such claim or
litigation, after giving notice of the same to the indemnifying party, on such
terms as the Indemnified Party may deem appropriate. The indemnifying party
will promptly reimburse the Indemnified Party in accordance with the
provisions hereof.



7.13 _Non-Competition_.



(a) As an inducement for Buyer to enter into this Agreement and to consummate
the transactions set forth herein, each of Lindley, Smith and Cawood hereby
agree, consent to and    acknowledge, that for a period of three (3) years from the Closing Date, in
every state where any member of the Keys Group was doing business immediately
prior to the Closing, neither Lindley, Smith, Cawood nor any of their
respective affiliates shall directly or indirectly own, build, invest in,
participate in the development of, finance, control or have any other
management or consulting role in any entity, facility or operation, whose
services or activities compete in any way, in whole or in part, with the
services or activities of any member of the Keys Group as of the Closing Date.



(b) As an inducement for Buyer to enter into this Agreement and to
consummate the transactions set forth herein, Management Sellers hereby
agree, consent to and acknowledge, as applicable, that for a period of three
(3) years from the Closing Date neither the Management Sellers nor any of
their affiliates shall solicit for employment any employee of the Facilities
or interfere with, disrupt or attempt to disrupt the relationship between
Buyer and its lessors, lessees, contractors, licensors, licensees, customers,
or suppliers pertaining to the operations of any member of the Keys Group or
the Facilities; provided that such limitations regarding solicitation shall
not apply to any person who (i) responds to an advertisement which is placed
in general circulation by or on behalf of Management Sellers and which is not
targeted at a person to whom the preceding otherwise would apply or (ii)
contacts Management Sellers on her or his own initiative without any direct
solicitation by Management Sellers.



(c) Lindley, Smith, Cawood and the Management Sellers each agree
and acknowledge their failure to comply with the provisions of this _Section
7.13_ will give rise to damages which may be impossible to measure accurately
and that injuries sustained from such breach may be incalculable and
irremediable. Therefore, it is agreed that Buyer shall be entitled, in
addition to all other remedies at law to equitable relief, including without
limitation an injunction or order of specific performance in any court of
competent jurisdiction, in the event of any breach of this _Section 7.13_.
Should litigation be necessary to enforce any provision in this _Section
7.13_, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover all costs, including
reasonable attorneys fees, incurred prior to suit or after suit, in all
court proceedings, including appellate courts.



ARTICLE 8



_TERMINATION_



8.1 _Termination_. This Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby
may be terminated at any time prior to the Closing, as follows:



(a) by Buyer, if Buyer is prepared to close and all conditions of Selling
Persons obligations to close pursuant to _Section 6.2_ have been satisfied
and Selling Persons fail to close in accordance with Article 3;



(b) by Sellers Representative, if Sellers are prepared to close and all
conditions to Buyers obligations to close pursuant to _Section 6.l_ have
been satisfied and Buyer fails to close in accordance with Article 3;



(c) by Buyer, if Selling Persons fail to cure any material breach of this
Agreement within thirty (30) days after receiving written notice thereof from
Buyer;



(d) by Sellers Representative, if Buyer fails to cure any material breach of
this Agreement within thirty (30) days after receiving written notice thereof
from Sellers Representative; or (e) this Agreement may be terminated by Buyer or Sellers Representative in
the event that the Closing does not occur on or before October 31, 2005
(unless such date has been extended by mutual agreement of the parties); or



(f) in accordance with the provisions of _Section 9.19_ hereof.



8.2 _Effect of Termination_. Each partys right of termination pursuant to
_Section 8.1_ is in addition to any other rights it may have under this
Agreement or otherwise, and the exercise of a right of termination will not be
an election of remedies. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section
8.1_, all further obligations of the parties under this Agreement will
terminate except as otherwise set forth in this Section. In the event this
Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 8.1_, the provisions of _Section
7.2_, _Section 7.3_,  _Section 7.5_, _Section 7.6 and Section 7.10_ shall
survive any such termination along with any other provisions of this
Agreement, which expressly or by implication survive such termination. If this
Agreement is terminated by a party because of the breach of the Agreement by
the other party or because one or more of the conditions to the terminating
partys obligations under this Agreement is not satisfied as a result of the
other partys failure to comply with its obligations under this Agreement,
the terminating partys right to pursue all legal remedies will survive such
termination unimpaired.



ARTICLE 9



_MISCELLANEOUS_



9.1 _Assignment_. Other than an assignment by Buyer to a subsidiary or an
affiliate of Buyer, no party may assign this Agreement, in whole or in part,
without the prior written consent of the other parties. At or prior to
Closing, Buyer shall have the right to designate one or more subsidiaries or
affiliates of Buyer to take title to all or a portion of the Ownership
Interests. No such designation shall have the effect of relieving Buyer of its
obligations under this Agreement, and Buyer hereby guarantees the performance
under this Agreement of any of its subsidiaries or affiliates who assume this
Agreement or all or a portion of Buyers obligations under this Agreement
pursuant to this  _Section 9.l_. Any attempted assignment not in accordance
herewith shall be null and void and of no force or effect.



9.2 _Waiver, Amendment_. No waiver, termination or discharge of this
Agreement, or any of the terms or provisions hereof, shall be binding upon
any party unless confirmed in writing. No waiver by any party of any term or
provision of this Agreement or of any default hereunder shall affect such
partys rights thereafter to enforce such term or provision or to exercise any
right or remedy in the event of any other default, whether or not similar.
This Agreement may not be modified or amended except by a writing executed by
the parties.

shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties and their
respective successors and permitted assigns. Notwithstanding anything

expressed or implied, is intended to confer on any person or entity other than
the parties hereto or their respective successors and permitted assigns any
rights, remedies, obligations or liabilities under or by reason of this
Agreement.



9.7  _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware without regard to the
principles of conflicts of laws.

other than as specifically set forth herein, specifically supersedes any other
agreement or understanding among the parties related to the subject matter
hereof.



9.11  _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement shall be held void,
voidable, invalid or inoperative, no other provision of this Agreement shall
be affected as a result thereof, and, accordingly, the remaining provisions of
this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect as though such void,
voidable, invalid or inoperative provision had not been contained herein.



9.12 _Sellers  Representative_. Each Selling Person hereby irrevocably
appoints Harbinger Private Equity Fund I, L.L.C. (the
"Sellers Representative") as the agent of such Selling Person for all
purposes relating to or in connection with any transaction contemplated by or
relating to this Agreement and to be carried out prior to, at or after the
Closing including, but not limited to: (i) approving any immaterial
modifications or amendments to this Agreement; (ii) making decisions with
respect to the determination of the Aggregate Net Working Capital of the Keys
Group; (iii) the appointment of the Escrow Agent and execution and delivery
of the Escrow Agreement; (iv) entering into any settlement or submitting the
dispute to the Independent Auditor; (v) taking any action that may be
necessary or desirable, as determined by the Sellers Representative, in its
reasonable discretion, in connection with    the termination of this Agreement; (vi) executing and delivering, on behalf
of the Selling Persons any and all notices, documents or certificates to be
executed by the Selling Persons in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby; (vii) granting any consent or approval on
behalf of the Selling Persons under this Agreement; (viii)
negotiating, compromising and resolving disputes with the Buyer that arise
under this Agreement including disputes regarding indemnification claims by
any party; (ix) exercising or refraining from exercising any remedy available
to Selling Persons; (x) waiving any and all conditions in _Section 6.2_;
(xi) retaining such counsel, accountants and other professional advisors as
the Sellers Representative reasonably deems necessary or appropriate to
perform its duties hereunder; (xii) giving such instructions and doing such
other things and refraining from doing such other things as Sellers
Representative in its sole discretion deems necessary or appropriate to carry
out the provisions of the Transaction Documents to which it is a party; and
(xiii) to pay the fees, costs and expenses reasonably incurred by the Sellers
Representative in the performance of its duties hereunder from the Sellers
Representative Reserve. In the event that the Sellers Representative Reserve
is insufficient to pay such fees, costs and expenses, each Selling Person
agrees to promptly pay its Pro Rata Share of such amounts in the manner
specified in a written notice from Sellers Representative. Each Selling
Person hereby irrevocably appoints the Sellers Representative as such Selling
Persons true and lawful attorney-in-fact and agent, with full powers of
substitution and resubstitution, in such Selling Persons name, place and
stead, in any and all capacities (other than as agent for service of process),
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, granting
unto said attorney-in-fact and agent, full power and authority to do and
perform each and every act and thing requisite and necessary to be done in
connection with the sale of such Selling Persons Ownership Interest as fully
to all intents and purposes as such Selling Person might or could do
in person; such appointment as attorney-in-fact is coupled with an interest.
Each Selling Person hereby authorizes the Buyer and its affiliates to rely
upon the agency created hereby and releases Buyer and its affiliates from any
and all liability to such Selling Person of whatever nature arising out of or
relating to such agency, to the same extent as though any act committed or
omitted by the Sellers Representative pursuant to such agency had been
committed or omitted by such Selling Person. On thirty (30) days prior
written notice to the Selling Persons and to Buyer, the Sellers
Representative may resign its appointment. Prior to the effective date of such
resignation, those Selling Persons holding more than 50% of the Pro Rata
Share shall designate in writing a replacement Sellers Representative who
shall possess the same rights and obligations as the then existing Sellers
Representative. Immediately upon designation of a replacement
Sellers Representative, Selling Persons shall cause written notice of such
designation of the replacement Sellers Representative to be delivered to
Buyer, along with all contact and notice information for such replacement
Sellers Representative. 



9.13 _Indemnification of Sellers  Representative_. Selling Persons hereby
agree to indemnify and to save and hold harmless the Sellers Representative
severally, not jointly, in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Share
from any liability loss, cost, damage or expense, including attorneys fees
(reasonably incurred or suffered as a result of the performance of its duties
under this Agreement) incurred by the Sellers Representative based upon or
arising out of any act, whether of omission or commission, of the
Sellers Representative pursuant to the authority herein granted, other than
acts, whether of omission or commission, of the Sellers Representative that
constitute gross negligence or willful misconduct in the exercise by the
Sellers Representative of the authority herein granted.



9.14  _Reserved_.



9.15 _Knowledge_. "Knowledge of Management Sellers" (and any similar
expression) means, as to a particular matter, the actual knowledge of any
person specified on _Schedule 9.15(a)_ hereto. Knowledge with respect to Buyer
means, as to a particular matter, the actual knowledge of any person
specified on _Schedule 9.15(b)_ hereto. 9.16 _Dispute Resolution_.



(a) _Agreement to Arbitrate_. The parties plan to work together to implement
this Agreement. However, the parties understand that issues and conflicts may
arise. The parties acknowledge their desire to reach a working solution by
using good faith attempts to resolve such issues and conflicts. If such good
faith attempts are unsuccessful, the parties agree that, except as otherwise
provided in this Agreement, either Buyer or Sellers Representative may demand
arbitration of any claim, controversy, issue or dispute (hereafter "Dispute")
arising out of or relating to this Agreement, unless the amount of the damage
or loss is at issue in pending litigation with a third party, in which event
arbitration shall not be commenced until such amount is ascertained or both
parties agree to arbitration.



(b) _Location of Arbitration; Rules_. Arbitration shall be conducted
in Wilmington, Delaware under the Commercial Arbitration Rules then in effect
of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), and administered by the AAA.



(c) _Selection of Arbitrator(s)_.



(i) In the event of arbitration with an amount in controversy equal to or less
than $250,000, arbitration shall be conducted by one (1) neutral arbitrator
mutually agreed upon by the parties. If no arbitrator is agreed upon within
ten (10) days of commencement of Arbitration, or if the arbitrator selected by
the Buyer and Sellers Representative is unable or unwilling to arbitrate the
Dispute, the parties shall request that a neutral arbitrator be selected by
the AAA.



(ii) In the event of arbitration with an amount in controversy greater than
$250,000, Arbitration shall be conducted by three neutral arbitrators.
Within fifteen (15) days of commencement of arbitration, each of Buyer and
Sellers Representative shall select one (1) neutral arbitrator in whatever
area(s) of expertise such party believes is relevant to the dispute. Within
ten (10) days of their appointment, the two (2) neutral arbitrators so
selected shall select the third neutral arbitrator from a list provided by the
AAA who shall be a practicing attorney having experience in the area of
commercial contracts and who shall act as chair of the arbitration panel. If
the arbitrators selected by Buyer and Sellers Representatives are unable or
fail to agree upon the third arbitrator, the third arbitrator shall be
selected by the AAA.



(d) _Procedure_. The arbitrator(s) shall set a limited time period
and establish procedures designed to reduce the cost and time for discovery
while allowing the parties an opportunity, in the discretion of the
arbitrator(s) to discover relevant information from the opposing party about
the subject matter of the Dispute. Any dispute regarding discovery, or the
relevance or scope thereof, shall be determined by the sole arbitrator or the
chair of the arbitration panel, as the case may be, and shall be governed by
the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The award by the arbitrator(s) shall be
in writing, shall be signed by the sole arbitrator or a majority of the
arbitrators, as the case may be, and shall include a statement of findings of
fact and conclusions regarding the reasons for the disposition of any claim.
No statements by, or communications between, the parties during negotiation or
mediation, or both, will be admissible for any purpose in arbitration.



(e) _Costs and Expenses_. As between Buyer and Selling Persons, each shall
bear its own expenses and its attorneys fees and expenses, and shall equally
share the arbitrators fees, administrative fees and travel expenses,
provided, however, that each of Buyer and the Selling Parties shall be
responsible for 50% of the fees and expenses due to the Escrow Agent.
Judgment on the award entered by the arbitrators may be entered in and
enforced by any court of competent jurisdiction. (f) _Limitations/Injunctive Relief_. Except as set forth in _Section
7.10(h)_, the arbitrator shall not be empowered to award punitive, special,
indirect, consequential or incidental damages, including loss of profits.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may resort to a court by applying
for interim, injunctive, or equitable relief, if such party reasonably
determines that such relief is necessary to prevent irreparable injury to it
or to a third party.



9.17 _Consent and Waiver of Rights._ As additional consideration for receiving
his/her/its Pro Rata Share of the net proceeds of the Purchase Price, each
Selling Person hereby: (a) acknowledges that this Agreement contemplates the
sale of all of the Ownership Interests in Keys by all of the Selling Persons
to Buyer and that pursuant to it all of the holders of Preferred Shares and
Common Shares are selling their Ownership Interests to Buyer; (b) waives any
and all rights to receive notice of the proposed sale of Ownership Interests
by any of the other Selling Persons to which the Selling Person might
otherwise be entitled under the Limited Liability Company Agreement dated
January, 2002, as amended (the "Operating Agreement"), the Investors Rights
Agreement dated January, 2002, the Series B Common Share Purchase Warrant
dated September 24, 2002, or any other agreement, instrument or document
(collectively, the "Share Agreements"); (c) waives any and all rights to
purchase Ownership Interests from any of the other Selling Persons which the
Selling Person might have under the Share Agreements; (d) consents to the
sale by each of the other Selling Persons of his/her/its Ownership Interests
to Buyer pursuant to this Agreement free and clear of all Liens; and (e)
waives his/her/its right to apply Section 11.2 of the Operating Agreement to
the purchase of Ownership Interests by Buyer.



9.18 _Waiver of Existing Non-Competition and Non-Solicitation Covenants_.
Buyer hereby agrees to waive and cause Keys to waive any right it might have
following Closing to enforce the non-competition and non-solicitation
covenants contained in Section 9.5 of the Operating Agreement with respect to
the Selling Persons. Furthermore, Buyer hereby agrees to waive and cause Keys
to waive any right it might have following Closing to enforce the non-
competition and non-solicitation covenants contained in Section 10(d) of the
Keys Share Option Plan with respect to Selling Option Holders. Nothing
contained in this _Section 9.18_ shall modify, restrict or otherwise
affect in any way Buyers rights under the provisions set forth in _Section
7.13_.



9.19. _Schedules_. Between October 3, 2005 and October 5, 2005, Buyer and the
Management Sellers shall review the Schedules provided to such party and shall
communicate with each other in order to determine if they can reach mutual
agreement regarding the content of the Schedules under this Agreement. In the
event that Buyer and the Management Sellers are unable to reach mutual
agreement regarding the content of the Schedules required under this
Agreement by 6:00 p.m. ET on October 5, 2005 (or such later date or time as
the Buyer and the Management Sellers may mutually agree upon in writing), then
either Buyer or the Management Sellers may upon written notice to the
other terminate this Agreement.



9.20 _Red River_. Red River Ventures I, L.P. ("RRV") is the owner of one
hundred percent of the issued and outstanding capital stock (the "KGK Stock")
of Keystone Group Kids, Inc. ("KGK") and has requested that Buyer consider
acquiring the Ownership Interests held by KGK indirectly through a purchase
of the KGK Stock. In the event Buyer determines, in its sole discretion, that
it is willing to acquire KGKs Ownership Interests indirectly through a
purchase of the KGK Stock, the Selling Persons hereby consent to Buyers
purchase of the KGK Stock. If, contemporaneous with the Closing, the Sellers
Representative receives (i) written notice from Buyer that it will be
consummating the purchase of the KGK Stock contemporaneously with the Closing
and (ii) an undertaking by RRV in favor of the Selling Persons and Buyer, in a
form acceptable to Sellers Representative and Buyer, whereby RRV agrees (a)
to become a substitute party, in all respects, for KGK under this Agreement
and (b) to assume and be responsible for all liabilities and obligations which
KGK would have been responsible for under    this Agreement and all other Transaction Documents but for the substitution
of parties; then, at Closing, the Sellers Representative will deliver
to Buyer and KGK a release acceptable to Buyer releasing KGK from any
liability and obligations under this Agreement all other Transaction
Documents. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, it is expressly
understood and agreed that Buyer shall be under no obligation to purchase the
KGK Stock or enter into negotiations for the purchase of the KGK Stock or take
any other action with respect thereto.
