ARTICLE II 

   

DISSENTING SHARES; PAYMENT FOR SHARES; OPTIONS 

  

 Section 2.01. _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by stockholders who shall have neither voted in favor of the Merger nor consented thereto in writing and who shall have properly and validly perfected their statutory rights of appraisal in respect of such Shares under Section 262 of the Corporation Law (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into or be exchangeable for the right to receive the Merger Consideration, unless and until such holders shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal under the Corporation Law. Dissenting Shares shall be treated in accordance with Section 262 of the Corporation Law. If any such holder shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such right to appraisal, such holders Shares shall thereupon be converted into and become exchangeable only for the right to receive, as of the later of the Effective Time and the time that such right to appraisal shall have been irrevocably lost, withdrawn or expired, the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon. The Company shall give Parent and Merger Sub (a) prompt notice of any written demands for appraisal of any Shares, attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the Corporation Law and received by the Company relating to rights to be paid the "fair value" of Dissenting Shares, as provided in Section 262 of the Corporation Law and (b) the opportunity to participate in, and direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the Corporation Law. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make or agree to make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisals of capital stock of the Company, offer to settle or settle any such demands or approve any withdrawal of any such demands. 

  

 Section 2.02. _Payment for Shares_. 

  

 (a) _Payment Fund_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall select a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as the paying agent for the Merger (the " _Paying Agent_ "). Immediately prior to the Effective Time, MSD will, or Parent will cause MSD or the Surviving Corporation to, deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent sufficient funds to make the payments due pursuant to Section 1.06 on a timely basis to holders of Shares that are issued and 

   ##### 

  

    

outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (such amounts being
hereinafter referred to as the " _Payment Fund_ "). The Paying Agent shall,
pursuant to irrevocable instructions, make the payments provided for in the
preceding sentence out of the Payment Fund. Until disbursed in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement, the Payment Fund shall be invested by the
Paying Agent as directed by Parent, MSD or the Surviving Corporation;
_provided_ , that (i) no such investment or losses thereon shall affect the
Merger Consideration payable to the holders of Shares and following any
losses that result in the amount of funds in the Payment Fund being
insufficient to pay the portion of the aggregate Merger Consideration that
remains unpaid, Parent shall promptly provide additional funds to the Paying
Agent for the benefit of the Company Stockholders to the extent of such
insufficiency and (ii) such investments shall be in obligations of or
guaranteed by the United States of America or in commercial paper obligations
rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investor Services, Inc. or Standard and
Poors Corporation, respectively. The Payment Fund shall not be used for any
other purpose, except as provided in this Agreement or that certain agreement
between Parent, the Company and the Paying Agent regarding the Payment Fund
(the " _Paying Agent Agreement_ "). 

  

 (b) _Letters of Transmittal_. As of or promptly following the Effective Time, and in any event within three (3) Business Days after the later of (ii) the Effective Time, or (ii) the date on which the Companys transfer agent has provided the Paying Agent with appropriate records and information reasonably requested, the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each Person who, as of the Effective Time, was the record holder of Shares whose Shares were converted into the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 1.06: (A) a letter of transmittal in reasonable form (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented Shares (the " _Certificates_ ") shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent) and (B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or non-certificated Shares represented by book-entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Following surrender to the Paying Agent of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares, together with such letter of transmittal duly executed, the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares shall be paid in exchange therefor cash in an amount (subject to any applicable withholding Tax) equal to the product of the number of Shares represented by such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares multiplied by the Merger Consideration, and such Certificate shall forthwith be canceled. No interest will be paid or accrued on the cash payable upon the surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. If payment is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate or Book-Entry Shares surrendered is or are registered, it shall be a condition of payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or otherwise in proper form for transfer (or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares, that such documentation as may be reasonably requested by the Paying Agent is provided) and that the Person requesting such payment pay any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate or Book-Entry Shares surrendered or establish to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable. From and after the Effective Time and until surrendered in accordance with the provisions of this Section 2.02, each Certificate and Book-Entry Share shall represent for all purposes solely the right to receive, in accordance with the terms hereof, the Merger Consideration in cash multiplied by the number of Shares evidenced by such Certificate or represented by such Book-Entry Share, without any interest thereon. The Paying Agent shall accept Certificates or Book-Entry Shares upon compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Paying Agent may impose to effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal practices. 

  

 (c) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond in such customary and reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will deliver in 

   ##### 

  

    

exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the applicable Merger
Consideration with respect to the Shares formerly represented thereby. 

  

 (d) _Duration of Payment Fund_. Any portion of the Payment Fund (including the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains unclaimed by the former Company Stockholders for one (1) year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation. Any former Company Stockholders who have not complied with this Section 2.02 prior to the end of such one-year period shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) but only as general creditors thereof for payment of their claim for the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon. Neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any holder of Shares for any amounts (whether in respect of such Shares or otherwise) delivered from the Payment Fund or otherwise to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificates shall not have been surrendered immediately prior to the date that such unclaimed funds would otherwise become subject to any abandoned property, escheat or similar Law, any unclaimed funds payable with respect to such Certificates shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. 

  

 Section 2.03. _Closing of the Company s Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and no transfer of Shares shall thereafter be made; _provided_ , that trades effected prior the Effective Time shall be recorded in accordance with customary settlement procedures. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for transfer, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration as provided in this Article II. 

  

 Section 2.04. _Existing Stock Options and Existing Restricted Stock Units_.

Each option to purchase Shares (" _Existing Stock Options_ ") granted by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to the terms of the Companys Amended and Restated 2000 Stock Plan, the Companys 2007 Stock Incentive Plan and the Companys 1991 Independent Directors Stock Option Plan (collectively, the " _Stock Plans_ ") or otherwise outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, at the Effective Time, whether vested or unvested, be accelerated and canceled in exchange for the right to receive an amount, payable in cash as soon as practicable following the Effective Time, equal to the product of (x) the total number of Shares subject to such Existing Stock Option as of the Effective Time, multiplied by (y) the excess, if any, of the amount of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share of the Shares subject to such Existing Stock Option, less applicable withholding Taxes, if any, required to be withheld with respect to such payment. 

  

 (b) _Existing Restricted Stock Units_. Each unvested restricted stock unit (" _Existing Restricted Stock Units_ ") granted by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to the terms of any of the Stock Plans or that is otherwise outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, at the Effective Time, be accelerated and canceled in exchange for the right to receive an amount, payable in cash as soon as practicable following the Effective Time, equal to the product of (x) the total number of Shares represented by such Existing Restricted Stock Unit as of the Effective Time, multiplied by (y) the Merger Consideration, less applicable withholding Taxes, if any, required to be withheld with respect to such payment.

favorable to the Company Stockholders as such Acquisition Proposal; 
_provided_ , that, in the event of any amendment to the financial or other
material terms of such Acquisition Proposal, the Company shall be required to
deliver to Parent and Merger Sub an additional written Notice of Superior
Proposal, and the three (3) Business Day period referenced above shall expire
on the later of (x) three (3) Business Days after Parents and Merger Subs

approval or recommendation of this Agreement, the agreement of merger
contained herein or the Merger or any termination of this Agreement under

If any litigation or other administrative or judicial action is commenced challenging any of the transactions contemplated hereby and such litigation, action or proceeding seeks to prevent, materially impede or materially delay the consummation of the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement, each of the Company, Parent, MSD and Merger Sub shall cooperate with each other and use its respective reasonable best efforts to contest and resist any such litigation, action or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

 (e) _No Acquisitions_. Neither Parent nor the Company shall, nor shall they permit their respective Affiliates or Subsidiaries to, acquire or agree to acquire any business, Person or division thereof, or otherwise acquire or agree to acquire any assets (except in each case pursuant to any agreement in effect on the date hereof), if the entering into of a definitive agreement relating to or the consummation of such acquisition, could reasonably be expected to materially increase the risk of not obtaining the applicable clearance, approval or waiver under the HSR Act or any Foreign Antitrust Law with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

 Section 5.06. _Indemnification and Insurance_. 

  

 (a) _Rights of Indemnified Persons_. Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to indemnification, exculpation and advancement of expenses existing in favor of the current or former directors, officers and employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (each an " _Indemnified Person_ ") as provided in the Companys Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws, or the articles of organization, bylaws or similar constituent documents of any of the Companys Subsidiaries, or under any agreement listed on Section 3.16 of the Disclosure Letter, as in effect as of the date hereof with respect to matters occurring prior to or at the Effective Time (including such matters that arise in whole or in part out of or pertain to this Agreement or the transaction contemplated hereby) and regardless of whether or not asserted or claimed prior to or at or after the Effective Time, shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect for a period of not less than the statutes of limitations applicable to such matters. 

  

 (b) _D andO Insurance_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall obtain, in respect of acts or omissions occurring prior to or at the Effective Time (including such acts or omissions in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby), and pay all premiums and other costs with respect to policies of directors and officers liability insurance (which may take the form of an 

   ##### 

  

 

extended reporting period, endorsement or policy) covering the Company and
other Persons currently covered by the Companys existing directors and
officers liability insurance policies, for a period of six (6) years after
the Effective Time; _provided_ that if the aggregate premiums for such
policies exceeds $550,000, the Company shall first consult with Parent and
shall obtain and pay for such policies only on terms reasonably acceptable to
Parent. From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will not
take any action to cancel such policies. This covenant shall not be
considered satisfied by the Company in all material respects if the Company
fails to obtain the insurance described in the first sentence of this
Section. 

   

 (c) _Claims_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any Indemnified Person notifies the Surviving Corporation on or prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time that a claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before, at or after the Effective Time) has been made against such Indemnified Person, the provisions of this Section 5.06 shall continue in effect until the final disposition of such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation. 

  

 (d) _Survival; Beneficiaries_. This Section 5.06 shall survive the consummation of the Merger and is intended to benefit, and shall be enforceable by, the Indemnified Persons and their respective heirs and legal representatives. 

  

 (e) _Successors and Assigns_. If the Surviving Corporation or Parent or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving Person of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers of conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, shall succeed to the obligations set forth in this Section 5.06. In addition, the Surviving Corporation shall not distribute, sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of any of its assets in a manner that would reasonably be expected to render the Surviving Corporation unable to satisfy its obligations under this Section 5.06. 

  

 Section 5.07. _Employee Matters_. 

  

 (a) _Compensation and Employee Benefits for Company Employees_. From and for the twelve (12) month period following the Effective Time, except as provided herein Parent shall provide, or shall cause to be provided, to the employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the date hereof (the " _Company Employees_ ") employee benefits that are substantially comparable, in the aggregate, to those offered by Parent and its Subsidiaries generally pursuant to Parents and its Subsidiaries employee benefit plans as may be in effect from time to time, to the same extent as similarly situated employees of Parent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to each individual who is a Company Employee on the date of this Agreement: (i) for so long as that individual continues to be an employee of Parent or any of its subsidiaries (including but not limited to the Company and its Subsidiaries), Parent shall provide or cause to be provided paid vacation on a basis consistent with the vacation policy of the Company and its Subsidiaries that is in effect on the date of this Agreement; and (ii) if the individuals employment is terminated within the first year after the Effective Time, the individual shall be entitled to severance pay under the terms and conditions of Parents severance pay plan or policy as in effect before the Effective Time but in an amount equal to two (2) weeks of base pay for each full year of service, subject to a minimum of four (4) weeks and a maximum of fifty-two (52) weeks of severance pay. 

  

 (b) _Treatment Under Parent Benefit Plans_. With respect to each employee benefit plan of Parent (" _Parent Benefit Plan_ ") in which the Company Employees participate after the Effective Time, for purposes of determining vesting and entitlement to benefits, including for severance benefits and vacation entitlement, service with the Company (or predecessor employers to the extent the Company provides past service credit) shall be treated as service with Parent; _provided_ , that such service shall not be recognized to the extent that such recognition would result in a duplication of benefits or to the extent that 

   ##### 

  

 

such service was not recognized under the applicable Company Plan. If
applicable and to the extent possible under Parent Benefit Plans (as
reasonably amended to the extent necessary in accordance with applicable
law), Parent shall cause any and all pre-existing condition (or actively at
work or similar) limitations, eligibility waiting periods and evidence of
insurability requirements under Parent Benefit Plans to be waived with
respect to such Company Employees and their eligible dependents and shall
provide them with credit for any co-payments, deductibles, and offsets (or
similar payments) made during the plan year including the Effective Time for
the purposes of satisfying any applicable deductible, out-of-pocket, or
similar requirements under any Parent Benefit Plans in which they are
eligible to participate after the Effective Time. 

   

 (c) _Termination Rights_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall provide to Parent a true, complete and accurate list of all employees that have been terminated by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries since the date of this Agreement and through the Effective Time. Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to limit or otherwise affect the right of Parent or the Surviving Corporation (i) to terminate employment or change the place of work, responsibilities, status or description of any employee or group of employees, or (ii) subject to its obligations under Section 5.07(a), to terminate any employee benefit plan without establishing a replacement plan to the extent the Company would have had such right prior to the Effective Time, in each case as Parent or the Surviving Corporation may determine in its discretion. 

  

 (d) _No Amendments to Plans_. No provision in this Agreement shall modify or amend any Plan unless this Agreement explicitly states that the provision "amends" such Plan. This shall not prevent the parties entitled to enforce this Agreement from enforcing any provision in this Agreement, but no other party shall be entitled to enforce any provision in this Agreement on the grounds that it is an amendment to such Plan. If a party not entitled to enforce this Agreement brings a lawsuit or other action to enforce any provision in this Agreement as an amendment to such Company Plan and that provision is construed to be such an amendment despite not being explicitly designated as one in this Agreement, that provision shall lapse retroactively as of its inception, thereby precluding it from having any amendatory effect. 

  

 Section 5.08. _Takeover Laws; Company Rights Plan_. The Company shall take all reasonable steps to exclude the Merger and any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement from the application of Takeover Laws and the Company Rights Plan, and to otherwise assist Parent or Merger Sub in any challenge to the validity, or applicability to the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement, of Takeover Laws or the Company Rights Plan. 

  

 Section 5.09. _Proxy Statement_. The Company shall prepare and file with the SEC, with the assistance of and subject to prior consultation with Parent, as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date hereof, a preliminary Proxy Statement (the " _Preliminary Proxy Statement_ ") relating to the Merger as required by the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder. Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall furnish to the Company the information relating to it required by the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder to be included in the Preliminary Proxy Statement. The Company shall obtain and furnish the information required to be included in the Preliminary Proxy Statement, shall provide Parent with, and consult with Parent regarding, any comments that may be received from the SEC or its staff with respect thereto, shall, subject to prior consultation with Parent, respond promptly to any such comments made by the SEC or its staff with respect to the Preliminary Proxy Statement, shall cause the definitive Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Company Stockholders at the earliest reasonably practicable date and shall use its reasonable best efforts (subject to Section 5.02) to obtain the Requisite Stockholder Approval. The Company shall ensure that neither the Preliminary Proxy Statement nor the definitive Proxy Statement contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. Parent shall ensure that none of the 

   ##### 

  

 

information it supplies for inclusion in the Preliminary Proxy Statement or
the definitive Proxy Statement contains any untrue statement of a material
fact or omits to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. If, at any time prior
to the Special Meeting, any information relating to the Company, Parent,
Merger Sub, any of their respective Affiliates, this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby (including the Merger), should be discovered
by the Company or Parent which should be set forth in an amendment
or supplement to the definitive Proxy Statement, so that the definitive Proxy
Statement shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they are made, not misleading, the party that discovers such information
shall promptly notify the other party, and the Company shall cause an
appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information to be filed
with the SEC, and to the extent required by applicable Law, disseminated to
the Company Stockholders. The Company shall cause the definitive Proxy
Statement to comply as to form in all material respects with the provisions
of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated
thereunder. Except as Section 5.02 expressly permits, the definitive Proxy
Statement shall include the recommendation of the Company Board that the
Company Stockholders adopt the agreement of merger set forth in this
Agreement. 

   

 Section 5.10. _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company, of the occurrence, or non-occurrence, of any event the occurrence, or non-occurrence, of which is reasonably likely (a) in the case of the Company, to cause any representation or warranty of the Company contained in Section 3.03 (Authority for this Agreement; Board Action), Section 3.04 (Consents and Approvals; No Violation), Section 3.05 (Reports; Financial Statements), Section 3.10 (Litigation), Section 3.17 (Regulatory Compliance), Section 3.19 (Customers and Suppliers), Section 3.20 (Questionable Payments), or Section 3.26 (OFAC / Export Control Provision) of this Agreement (disregarding any materiality or Material Adverse Effect qualification contained therein) to be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect if made as of any time at or prior to the Effective Time or (b) to result in any material failure of such party to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied hereunder; _provided_ , _however_ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 5.10 shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to any of the parties receiving such notice. 

  

 Section 5.11. _Securityholder Litigation_. The Company shall give Parent the opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any securityholder litigation against the Company and/or its directors relating to the transactions contemplated in this Agreement (" _Securityholder Litigation_ "), and no settlement shall be agreed to without Parents prior consent. 

  

 Section 5.12. _Subsequent Filings_. Until the Effective Time, the Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to timely file with the SEC each form, report and document required to be filed by the Company under the Exchange Act, each in form and substance that complies with applicable Laws, the provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder, and will promptly make available to Parent copies of each such report filed with the SEC. 

  

 Section 5.13. _Pending Litigation_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall obtain and deliver to Parent a letter executed by an authorized representative of each of its insurance provider(s), as applicable, to the effect that those matters listed on Section 3.10 of the Disclosure Letter which have been submitted and accepted by such insurance provider(s) for coverage prior to the Effective Time will be covered after the Effective Time, subject only to payment of the deductible and the limits of the corresponding policy as set forth on Section 3.18 of the Disclosure Letter. This covenant shall not be considered satisfied by the Company in all material respects if the Company fails to obtain the letter(s) described in the first sentence of this Section. 

   ##### 

  

  

 Section 5.14. _Press Releases_. Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub agrees that no public release or announcement concerning the transactions contemplated hereby shall be issued by any party without the prior written consent of the Company and Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), except as such release or announcement may be required by Law or the rules or regulations of any applicable United States or non-U.S. securities exchange or regulatory or governmental body to which the relevant party is subject or submits, in which case the party required to make the release or announcement shall use its reasonable best efforts to allow each other party reasonable time to comment on such release or announcement in advance of such issuance, it being understood that the final form and content of any such release or announcement, to the extent so required, shall be at the final discretion of the announcing party.

To the extent that any amounts are so withheld, those amounts shall be treated as having been paid to the holder of such Existing Stock Option or Existing Restricted Stock Unit for all purposes under this Agreement. The Company shall promptly provide information reasonably required to determine the proper amounts to be withheld. Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation, or the Paying Agent, to make such payments in respect of the Existing Stock Options and Existing Restricted Stock Units as promptly as practicable following the Effective Time by wire transfers or checks payable to the holders of such Existing Stock Options and Existing Restricted Stock Units. Holders of Existing Stock Options who are not employees of the Company shall be required to submit appropriate documentation, such as Letters of Transmittal and/or properly completed Forms W-9, in order to receive payment.

 (ii) if this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 7.01(e) or Section 7.01(f)(i), as the result of a knowing and material breach by the Company of its covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement, then the Company shall reimburse Parent for the Parent Expenses, as directed by Parent in writing, simultaneously with such termination by the Company, or on the first Business Day immediately following such termination by Parent; and if any Alternative Transaction is consummated, or a Company Acquisition Agreement is entered into, within twelve (12) months after the date of such termination, then the Company shall pay an amount equal to the Fee less the Parent Expenses on the date of such consummation or the execution of such Company Acquisition Agreement, whichever is earlier;

 (c) _Right to Interest_. The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 7.03 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, Parent would not have entered into this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails to promptly pay any amounts due pursuant to this Section 7.03 and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent commences a suit which results in a judgment against the Company for the amount of the Fee set forth in this Section 7.03, the Company shall pay to Parent Parents reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses of enforcement) in connection with such suit, together with interest on the amounts owed at the prime lending rate prevailing at such time, as published in the Wall Street Journal, plus two percent (2%) per annum from the date such amounts were required to be paid until the date actually received by Parent.

 Section 7.04. _Amendment_.

party or in any document, certificate or writing delivered pursuant hereto by
any other applicable party or (iii) waive compliance by any party with any of
the agreements or conditions contained herein. Any agreement on the part of
any party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in
an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. 

   

 (b) _Cumulative Remedies_. All rights, powers and remedies provided under this Agreement or otherwise available in respect hereof at law or in equity shall be cumulative and not alternative, and the exercise of any thereof by any party shall not preclude the simultaneous or later exercise of any other such right, power or remedy by such party. The failure of any party hereto to exercise any rights, power or remedy provided under this Agreement or otherwise available in respect hereof at law or in equity, or to insist upon compliance by any other party hereto with its obligations hereunder, and any custom or practice of the parties at variance with the terms hereof, shall not constitute a waiver by such party of its right to exercise any such or other right, power or remedy or to demand such compliance.

 (ii) any representation and warranty contained in Section 3.17 (Regulatory Compliance), Section 3.20 (Questionable Payments) or Section 3.26 (OFAC / Export Control Provision) shall be deemed to be untrue and incorrect only if such representation and warranty is untrue or incorrect in any respect which is material to the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole, it being understood that the untruth or incorrectness in question need not involve a Material Adverse Effect to render such representation untrue or incorrect "in any respect which is material to the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole";

   #####
