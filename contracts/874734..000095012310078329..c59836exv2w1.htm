rights to appraisal under the Corporation Law. Dissenting Shares shall be treated in accordance
with Section&nbsp;262 of the Corporation Law. If any such holder shall have failed to perfect or shall
have effectively withdrawn or lost such right to appraisal, such holder&#146;s Shares shall thereupon be
converted into and become exchangeable only for the right to receive, as of the later of the
Effective Time and the time that such right to appraisal shall have been irrevocably lost,
withdrawn or expired, the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon. The Company shall
give Parent and Merger Sub (a)&nbsp;prompt notice of any written demands for appraisal of any Shares,

any such demands or approve any withdrawal of any such demands.

make the payments provided for in the preceding sentence out of the Payment Fund. Until disbursed
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the Payment Fund shall be invested by the Paying
Agent as directed by Parent, MSD or the Surviving Corporation; <I>provided</I>, that (i)&nbsp;no such
investment or losses thereon shall affect the Merger Consideration payable to the holders of Shares

date on which the Company&#146;s transfer agent has provided the Paying Agent with appropriate records
and information reasonably requested, the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to
mail to each Person who, as of the Effective Time, was the record holder of Shares whose Shares
were converted into the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section&nbsp;1.06: (A)&nbsp;a letter of transmittal

lieu thereof) or non-certificated Shares represented by book-entry (&#147;<I>Book-Entry Shares</I>&#148;) in
exchange for the Merger Consideration. Following surrender to the Paying Agent of a Certificate
(or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares, together with such letter of
transmittal duly executed, the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares shall be paid in
exchange therefor cash in an amount (subject to any applicable withholding Tax) equal to the
product of the number of Shares represented by such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu
thereof) or Book-Entry Shares multiplied by the Merger Consideration, and such Certificate shall
forthwith be canceled. No interest will be paid or accrued on the cash payable upon the surrender
of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. If payment is to be made to a Person other than the
Person in whose name the Certificate or Book-Entry Shares surrendered is or are registered, it
shall be a condition of payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or
otherwise in proper form for transfer (or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares, that such
documentation as may be reasonably requested by the Paying Agent is provided) and that the Person
requesting such payment pay any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the payment to a
Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate or Book-Entry Shares surrendered or
establish to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Tax has been paid or is not
applicable. From and after the Effective Time and until surrendered in accordance with the
