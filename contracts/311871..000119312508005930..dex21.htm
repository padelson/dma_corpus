not obtained, shall continue in full force and effect without penalty or other
adverse consequence. Except as disclosed in _Section 3.12(b)_ of
the Disclosure Schedule, the applicable Seller and, to the Knowledge of the
Sellers, the counterparties thereto, are not in breach of, or default under,
any Material Contract to which any of them is a party except for breaches or
defaults that, upon entry or issuance of the Transaction Approval Orders by
the Bankruptcy Court and the Canadian Court, would not preclude the Sellers
from assigning such Material Contract to the Purchaser and that would be cured
or rendered unenforceable in accordance with the Transaction Approval Orders.



 

\- 39 - SECTION 3.13 _Brokers_. Except for the Financial Advisor, no broker, finder or
investment banker is entitled to any brokerage, finders or other fee or
commission in connection with the Transactions based upon arrangements made by
or on behalf of the Seller. The Sellers are solely responsible for the fees
and expenses of the Financial Advisor.

SECTION 3.14 _Title to Purchased Assets; Good Condition_. (a) The Sellers have
good and valid title to, or in the case of leased assets, a valid leasehold
interest in all of the Purchased Assets.

(b) To the Sellers Knowledge, all of the tangible personal property used or
held for use in connection with the Business is in good operating condition
and repair, free of defects and in a state of good maintenance, ordinary wear
and tear excepted, and is adequate and suitable for the purposes for which it
is presently being used or intended.

SECTION 3.15 _Sufficiency of Assets_. The Purchased Assets constitute all of
the assets, rights, interests and properties of every nature and kind
whatsoever used or held for use in the conduct of the Business, or otherwise
necessary for the Purchaser to conduct and operate the Business immediately
after the Closing in all material respects as conducted and operated by the
Sellers immediately prior to the Closing.

SECTION 3.16 _Insurance_. Set forth in Section 3.16 of the Disclosure
Schedule is an accurate and complete list of each insurance policy and
insurance arrangement that covers businesses, properties, assets (including
the Purchased Assets), Liabilities (including the Assumed Liabilities) or
employees (including self insurance, but excluding insurance policies
providing benefits under welfare plans and directors and officers insurance)
of the Business (the " _Insurance Policies_ "). The Insurance Policies are in
full force and effect, all premiums thereon have been paid, and the Sellers
are otherwise in compliance in all material respects with the terms and
provisions of such policies. No Seller is in default under any of
the Insurance Policies (or any policy required to be set forth in Section
3.16 of the Disclosure Schedule) and there exists no event, occurrence,
condition or act (including the purchase of the Purchased Assets hereunder)
that, with the giving of notice, the lapse of time or the happening of any
other event or condition, would become a default thereunder. No Seller has
received any notice of cancellation or non-renewal of any such Insurance
Policies nor has the termination of any such Insurance Policies been
threatened, and there exists no event, occurrence, condition or act (including
the purchase of the Purchased Assets hereunder) that, with the giving of
notice, the lapse of time or the happening of any other event or condition,
would entitle any insurer to terminate or cancel any such Insurance Policies.
Each of the Insurance Policies is of a type and in such amount and covers such
risks as are consistent with customary practices and standards of
companies engaged in businesses and operations similar to the Business. Since
December 31, 2006, there has not been any material adverse change in any
Sellers relationship with its insurers or in the premiums payable pursuant to
such Insurance Policies. Section 3.16 of the Disclosure Schedule also sets
forth a list of all pending claims and the claims history with respect to the
Business during the past five (5) years (including with respect to insurance
obtained but not currently maintained).

SECTION 3.17 _Suppliers and Customers_. Section 3.17 of the Disclosure
Schedule sets forth (a) each customer accounting for more than one percent
(1%) of the sales volume of the Business since December 31, 2006 and (b) each
supplier (i) accounting for more than one percent (1%) of the consolidated
purchases by the Business during such period. The  



 

\- 40 -  relationships of the respective Sellers with each such supplier and customer
are good commercial working relationships and, except as set forth in Section
3.17 of the Disclosure Schedule, no such supplier or customer has canceled or
otherwise terminated its relationship with any Seller. Except as set forth in
Section 3.17 of the Disclosures Schedule, no Seller has received any
notice that any such supplier or customer has cancelled its relationship with
Sellers or the Business.

SECTION 3.18 _Permits_. The Sellers have made available to the Purchaser

authorization of any Governmental Authority (each, a " _Permit_ ") obtained
or possessed by any Seller in respect of the Business or any Purchased Asset,
each of which is listed in Section 3.18 of the Disclosure Schedule. Except as
would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, the
Sellers have obtained and possess all Permits and have made all registrations
or filings with or notices to any Governmental Authority necessary for the
lawful conduct of the Business as presently conducted and operated,
or necessary for the lawful ownership of their properties and assets or the
operation of the Business as presently conducted and operated. Each such
Permit is valid and in full force and effect and the Sellers are in material
compliance with all such Permits. Each such Permit is included in the
Purchased Assets. The consummation of the Transactions will not result in the
revocation, cancellation or termination of, or any adverse amendment or
modification to, any such Permit. Any applications for the renewal of any
such Permit that are due prior to the Closing Date will be timely made or
filed by the applicable Seller prior to the Closing Date. Except as would not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, no proceeding
to modify, suspend, revoke, withdraw, terminate or otherwise limit any such
Permit is pending or threatened and, to the Sellers Knowledge, there is no
valid basis for any such proceeding, including the Transactions. No
administrative or governmental action or proceeding has been taken in
connection with the expiration, continuance or renewal of any such Permit and,
to the Sellers Knowledge, there is no valid basis for any such proceeding.

SECTION 3.19 _Absence of Certain Changes_. Other than as a result of the
commencement of the Canadian Proceedings and the Chapter 11 Cases, since
December 31, 2006 the Business has not experienced any (a) damage, destruction
or loss, whether covered by insurance or not, individually having a cost of
$2,500,000 or more; (b) change in accounting methods or principles or

of business and in accordance with GAAP; or (c) sale, assignment, transfer,
lease or license (other than a Permitted Encumbrance) of or on any of the
Business tangible assets (including, without limitation, the Fixed Assets as

are no pending, or to the Sellers Knowledge, threatened actions, grievances,

Disclosure Schedule, all Inventory of the Sellers is of good merchantable

before January 8, 2008, the Sellers shall file with the Bankruptcy Court a
copy of this Agreement and a notice of hearing or motion materials, as
applicable, pursuant to which the Sellers will seek approval of the Stalking
Horse Protections, which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall include the Break
Up Fee and certain Auction Overbid Protections reasonably acceptable to the
Purchaser. The Stalking Horse Protections Orders shall be approved by the
Bankruptcy Court and the Canadian Court no later than January 15, 2008.

SECTION 5.02 _Break Up Fee_. (a) If this Agreement is terminated as a result
of the occurrence of an event under Section 8.01(a)(ii), (iii) or (iv), (b)

7.02(o)_ or _Section 7.02(p)_), (ii), (iii) or (iv) , then, the Sellers shall
promptly (and in any event within two Business Days after such termination)
pay the Purchaser, in immediately available funds, a fee (the " _Break Up
Fee_ ") in the aggregate amount of Three Million Eight Hundred Thousand
Dollars ($3,800,000), which Break Up Fee shall be fully earned upon the
Sellers execution of this Agreement and shall be payable in accordance with
the terms hereof, together with any applicable GST. The Break Up Fee shall

the Bankruptcy Court approving the DIP Credit Agreement. The parties hereby
agree that is impossible to determine accurately the amount of damages that
the Purchaser would suffer if the Transactions were not consummated as a
result of a breach of this Agreement by the Sellers. As a result,
notwithstanding anything in this Agreement (or the Ancillary Agreements) to
the contrary, the Purchaser hereby agrees that, in the event of a failure by
the Sellers to consummate the Transactions and consequent termination of this
Agreement by the Purchaser in accordance with _Section 8.01(d)(i)_, (i) the
Purchasers right to receive the Break-Up Fee pursuant to _Section 5.02_
shall serve as liquidated damages against the Sellers and (ii) such liquidated
damages shall be the sole and exclusive remedy, at law and equity, of the
Purchaser against the Sellers for the Sellers breach and such termination.

(b) The Sellers shall deliver to the Purchaser, on or before February 4,

by them or their professionals or advisors, and shall promptly deliver or
cause to be delivered to the Purchaser upon receipt thereof all summaries,
digests or compilations of same prepared by the Sellers or for the Sellers by
their professionals or advisors to the extent that such summaries, digests or
compilations are provided to any other Qualified Bidder (as defined in the Bid
Procedures attached as Exhibit A to the US Pulp Assets Bid Procedures
Order). In the event that the Purchaser is not the Successful Bidder (as
defined in the Bid Procedures attached as Exhibit A to the US Pulp Assets Bid
Procedures Order), the Purchaser shall have the right, but not the obligation,
to maintain its stalking horse bid as the Back-Up Bid (as defined in and in
accordance with the terms of the US Pulp Assets Bid Procedures Order).

the Transaction Approval Orders, the Purchaser may, by written notice to
Sellers, elect to exclude any one or more of the Material Contracts (including
any lease pursuant to which the Leased Real Property is leased by a Seller)
and Permits and Licenses, from the Transactions. Any Material Contract or
Permit and License identified in such a notice (each, an " _Excluded Contract_
") shall no longer be an Assigned Contract, or a Permit and License to be
assigned to the Purchaser hereunder. There shall be no adjustment to the
Purchase Price as a result of the Purchasers election to exclude any one or
more of the Material Contracts or Permits and Licenses from the Transactions
pursuant to this Section 5.03(a) except that the Purchaser shall not be
required to make any payments for Cure Costs or any other amounts for any such
Excluded Contracts.

(b) At the time of Closing, and subject to the approval of the Bankruptcy
Court and the Canadian Court pursuant to the Transaction Approval Orders
and/or the consent of the applicable counterparties to the extent necessary
to effect the assignment in each case, the Sellers shall assume (to the extent
required) and then assign to the Purchaser, and the Purchaser shall assume
from the Sellers, to the extent provided in _Section 2.02_, all the Assigned
Contracts.

(c) Subject to the terms of _Section 2.04_, the Purchaser shall make
provision for the payment of, the cure and reinstatement costs and expenses in
respect of the Assigned Contracts that are required to be paid pursuant to the
Transaction Approval Orders or such other Order of the Bankruptcy Court or
the Canadian Court (collectively, the " _Cure Costs_ "), or that are otherwise
required to be paid under the Assigned Contracts to effect their assignment or
in connection with any required consents, to the extent they are Determined
Cure Costs and assumed pursuant to _Section 2.02_. The Sellers shall be
responsible for (i) the verification of all Cure Costs, including all
administrative responsibilities associated therewith, and (ii) any costs
or other payments due and payable to such counterparty as of the Closing Date
in excess of the Cure Costs. The Sellers shall use their reasonable best
efforts to establish the proper Cure Costs, if any, for each Assigned
Contract, including the filing and prosecution of any and all appropriate
proceedings in the Bankruptcy Court or the Canadian Court.

(d) The Sellers shall have delivered to the Purchaser true and complete copies
of the Material Contracts (including all amendments thereto and assignments
thereof) on or before the fourth (4th) Business Day prior to the hearings to
approve the Transaction Approval Orders. Notwithstanding any provision in this
Agreement to the contrary, from and after the date hereof through the Closing
Date, the Sellers will not reject, repudiate or disclaim, without prior
consent of the Purchaser, any Material Contract.

(e) If any of the Contracts, or relevant portions of such a Contract, related
to the leased personal property listed in _Section 5.03(e)_ of the Disclosure
Schedule (each such Contract, or such relevant portion of such Contract, a "
_Shared Contract_ ") cannot be assigned in relevant part to the applicable
Purchaser, then such Shared Contract shall be an Excluded Contract and the
Purchaser and the Sellers shall take commercially reasonable and permissible
 



 

\- 48 -  actions to cause the Shared Contract to be replaced with one or more
Contracts for the benefit of the Purchaser and one or more Contracts for the
benefit of the Sellers. Nothing in this _Section 5.03(e)_ shall require the
Purchaser or any Seller to make any material payment, incur any material
obligation or grant any material concession to any counterparty under any
Contract in order to effect any transaction contemplated by this _Section
5.03(e)_.

SECTION 5.04 _Conduct of Business Prior to the Closing_. (a) The Sellers
covenant and agree that, except as described in _Section 5.04_ of the
Disclosure Schedule, between the date hereof and the Closing Date, and except
as a result of the Chapter 11 Cases and Canadian Proceedings, each Seller, to
the extent related solely to the Business, shall:

(i) conduct its business in the ordinary course in all material respects and
in compliance with applicable Laws, taking into account past practice, its
current and projected financial condition and the condition of the markets in
which the Business operates;

with respect to the sale of kraft pulp;

(vi) use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain in full force and effect

(viii) subject to Section 5.03(c), use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain all necessary consents to the transfer of the Contracts that are to be

for such payment;



 

\- 49 - (ix) use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain authorization pursuant to

(b) The Sellers covenant and agree that, except as described in _Section
5.04_ of the Disclosure Schedule, between the date hereof and the Closing
Date, and except as required by applicable Law or a result of the Chapter 11
Cases and Canadian Proceedings, each Seller, to the extent related solely to
the Business, shall not, without the prior written consent of the Purchaser,
and shall cause each of their Affiliates and the Sellers and Affiliates
officers, directors, shareholders, employees, partners, representatives and

(ii) grant or announce any increase in the salaries, bonuses, severance or
other benefits payable by the Sellers to any of the Business Employees who are
to be offered employment by the Purchaser pursuant to _Article VI_ , other
than pursuant to any plans, programs or agreements existing on the date
hereof and set forth in _Section 5.04_ of the Disclosure Schedule or in the
ordinary course of business and consistent with past business practices,
without providing the Purchaser with reasonable notice of the same and a
reasonable opportunity to consult with the Sellers;

(iii) hire any new employees or transfer employees from any other operations
of the Sellers, or enter into any employment Contract or other arrangement
with any Business Employees, if any such Business Employees are to be offered
employment by, or are to become employees of, the Purchaser pursuant to
_Article VI_ , except as may be required to replace any Business Employees who
terminate voluntarily, without providing the Purchaser with reasonable notice
of the same and a reasonable opportunity to consult with the Sellers;

(iv) effect any involuntary termination of any Business Employees who are to

\- 50 - (v) adopt any new benefit, retention, severance, or bonus plan for any

reasonably be anticipated to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Business or

except as contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements.

SECTION 5.05 _Access to Information_. From the date hereof until the Closing,
upon reasonable notice, the Sellers shall, and shall cause their respective
officers, directors, employees, agents, representatives, accountants and
counsel to: (a) afford the Purchaser and their authorized representatives
reasonable access to the offices, properties and books and records of the
Sellers (to the extent relating to the Business); and (b) furnish to the
officers, employees, and authorized agents and representatives of the
Purchaser such additional financial and operating data and other
information regarding the Business (or copies thereof) as the Purchaser may
from time to time reasonably request; provided, however, that any such access
or furnishing of information shall be conducted at the Purchasers expense,
during normal business hours, under the supervision of the applicable
Sellers personnel and in such a manner as not to interfere with the normal
operations of the Business; provided, further, that such review by and any
information furnished to the Purchaser shall not affect the representations
and warranties made by the Sellers in this Agreement or the remedies of
Purchaser for breaches of those representations and warranties. From time to
time prior to the Closing Date, the Sellers shall promptly supplement or
amend information previously delivered to the Purchaser with  



 

\- 51 -  respect to any matter hereafter arising which, if existing or occurring
prior to or at the date of this Agreement, would have been required to be set
forth or disclosed herein; provided, however, that such supplemental
information shall not be deemed to be an amendment to the Disclosure Schedule
or the representations and warranties made by the Sellers in this Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Sellers shall
not be required to disclose any information to the Purchaser if such
disclosure would, in the Sellers sole discretion: (i) cause significant
competitive harm to the Business if the Transactions are not consummated,
(ii) jeopardize any attorney-client or other legal privilege or (iii)
contravene any applicable Laws, fiduciary duty or binding agreement entered
into prior to the date hereof.

SECTION 5.06 _Damage or Destruction_. Until the Closing, the Purchased Assets
shall remain at the risk of the Sellers. In the event of any material damage
to or destruction of any Mill or any other Purchased Asset (other than normal
wear and tear) after the date hereof and prior to the Closing (in any such
case, a " _Loss_ "), the Sellers shall give notice thereof to the Purchaser.
If any such Loss is covered by policies of insurance, all right and claim of
the Sellers to any proceeds of insurance for such Loss shall be assigned and
(if previously received by the Sellers and not used prior to the Closing Date
to repair any damage or destruction) paid to the Purchaser at Closing, and
the Purchaser shall complete the Transactions as provided in this Agreement
without any reduction in the Purchase Price with respect to such Loss. If any
such Loss is not covered by policies of insurance, the Purchaser shall have
the right to reduce the Purchase Price by an amount equal to (i) the estimated
cost to repair or restore the Purchased Assets affected by such Loss (the "
_Affected Assets_ ") to substantially repair or restore their condition
immediately prior to the occurrence of such Loss or (ii) if such Affected
Assets are destroyed or damaged beyond repair, the replacement cost of the
Affected Assets and, in either case the Purchaser shall complete the
Transactions as provided in this Agreement and all compensation payable on
account of such Loss shall be retained by the Sellers. If the Purchaser elects
to reduce the Purchase Price pursuant to this  _Section 5.06_, the Sellers
and the Purchaser shall negotiate in good faith in an effort to agree upon the
amount of such reduction. If the parties are unable to reach agreement within
five (5) Business Days after notice of the Loss is given by the Sellers, then
the amount of the reduction shall be determined by an independent, qualified
insurance adjuster selected by the parties (or, if they are unable to agree on
such selection, one appointed by the Bankruptcy Court upon application of
either party).

SECTION 5.07 _Confidentiality_. (a) The terms of the letter agreement dated as
of August 29, 2007 (as amended from time to time, the " _Confidentiality
Agreement_ ") between PTI and the Purchaser are hereby incorporated herein by
reference, and shall continue in full force and effect until the Closing, at
which time the confidentiality and employee non-solicitation obligations of
the Purchaser under the Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate; provided,
however, that such obligations shall terminate only in respect of that portion
of the Evaluation Material (as defined in the Confidentiality Agreement) and
those employees exclusively relating to the Business; provided, further, that
notwithstanding anything herein or in the Confidentiality Agreement to the
contrary, the Sellers shall not be required to maintain the name of the
Purchaser, this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement as confidential. If this
Agreement is, for any reason, terminated prior to the Closing, the
Confidentiality Agreement shall nonetheless continue in full force and
effect.



 

\- 52 - (b) Nothing provided to the Purchaser pursuant to _Section 5.05_ shall in any
way amend or diminish the Purchasers obligations under the Confidentiality
Agreement. The Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that any Evaluation Material
provided to the Purchaser pursuant to _Section 5.05_ or otherwise by PTI or
any Representative (as defined in the Confidentiality Agreement) thereof
shall be subject to the terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement.

(c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, each party hereto (and
its representatives, agents and employees) may consult any tax advisor
regarding the tax treatment and tax structure of the Transactions, and may
disclose to any person, without limitation of any kind, the tax treatment and
tax structure of such transactions and all materials (including opinions and
other tax analyses) that are provided relating to such treatment or structure.

SECTION 5.08 _Regulatory and Other Authorizations; Notices and Consents_. (a)
The Purchaser and the Sellers shall each use their commercially reasonable
efforts to promptly obtain all waivers, authorizations, notices to proceed,
consents, orders and approvals of all Governmental Authorities and officials,
make all required filings, applications and petitions with, and give all
required notices to, the applicable Governmental Authorities that may be or
become necessary for its execution and delivery of, and the performance of its
obligations pursuant to, this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and will
cooperate fully with the other parties in promptly seeking to obtain all such
waivers, authorizations, consents, orders, notices to proceed and approvals.
Each party hereto agrees to make promptly its respective filing, if necessary,
pursuant to the HSR Act and the Competition Act (the filing fees in regard of
which shall be payable by the Purchaser) with respect to the Transactions
within ten (10) Business Days of the date hereof, to request expedited
treatment of any such filings and to supply as promptly as practicable to the
appropriate Governmental Authorities any additional information and
documentary material that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act or the
Competition Act, and the Purchaser will promptly make all filings
or notifications required under the ICA, if any. The Purchaser and Sellers
each agree that, during the term of this Agreement, it will not withdraw its
filing under the HSR Act or any other applicable antitrust, competition or
trade regulation law without the written consent of the other party. The
Purchaser and Sellers each agree that it will not enter into any timing
agreement with any Governmental Authority without the written consent of the
other party. The Sellers shall not be required to pay any fees, or other
payments to any Governmental Authorities in order to obtain any authorization,
notice to proceed, consent, order or approval, including any made pursuant to
the HSR Act or the Competition Act in connection with the Transactions.

(b) Without limiting the generality of the undertakings made by the parties
hereto pursuant to _Section 5.08(a)_, each party agrees to use its
commercially reasonable efforts and to take any and all steps necessary to
avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under any antitrust, competition
or trade regulation Law that may be asserted by any United States or non-
United States governmental antitrust authority or any other party so as to
enable the parties hereto to expeditiously close the Transactions as promptly
as practicable, and in any event, no later than the Termination Date.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, neither the
Purchaser nor any of their Affiliates shall be required, in connection with
obtaining any action or no action, waiver, authorization, consent, Order or
approval of any Governmental Authority or other Person, or otherwise in
connection with the consummation or making  



 

\- 53 -  effective of the Transactions, to (x) sell, divest, hold separate, otherwise
dispose of or license or conduct any portion of their respective
assets, properties or businesses or the assets, properties or businesses to
be acquired by the Purchaser pursuant hereto in a specified manner, or (y)
agree to sell, divest, hold separate, otherwise dispose of or license or
conduct any portion of their respective assets, properties or businesses or
the assets, properties or businesses to be acquired by the Purchaser pursuant
hereto in a specified manner, or (z) take or agree to take any other action or
agree to any limitation that, in the case of clauses (x), (y) or (z), would
have a material adverse effect on the Purchaser or their Affiliates or a
material adverse effect on the benefits, taken as a whole, reasonably expected
to be derived by Purchaser from the Transactions (any such term or condition
in clauses (x), (y) or (z) being referred to herein as a " _Burdensome Term or
Condition_ "). In addition, each party hereto shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to defend through litigation on the merits any claim
asserted in court by any party in order to avoid entry of, or to have vacated
or terminated, any decree, order or judgment (whether temporary, preliminary
or permanent) that would prevent the Closing by the Termination Date. 

(c) Each party to this Agreement shall promptly notify the other parties when
any such approval referred to in _Section 5.08(a)_ is obtained, taken, made,
given or denied, as applicable, and will notify the other parties of any
material communication it or any of its Affiliates receives from any
Governmental Authority relating to the matters that are the subject of
this Agreement and permit the other party to review in advance any proposed
material communication by such party to any Governmental Authority. None of
the parties to this Agreement shall agree to participate in any meeting with
any Governmental Authority in respect of any filings, investigation or other
inquiry unless it consults with the other parties in advance and, to the
extent permitted by such Governmental Authority, gives the other parties the
opportunity to attend and participate at such meeting. Subject to the
Confidentiality Agreement, the parties to this Agreement will coordinate and
cooperate fully with the other parties in exchanging such information and
providing such assistance as such other parties may reasonably request in
connection with the foregoing and in seeking early termination of any
applicable waiting periods including under the HSR Act. Subject to the
Confidentiality Agreement, the parties to this Agreement will provide the
other parties with copies of all correspondence, filings or communications
between them or any of their representatives, on the one hand, and any
Governmental Authority or members of its staff, on the other hand, with
respect to this Agreement and the Transactions. 

(d) The parties to this Agreement shall not, and shall cause their respective
Affiliates not to, take any action, or enter into any transaction or any
agreement to effect any transaction (including any merger or acquisition but
not including transactions or agreements in the ordinary course of business),
that would reasonably be expected to make it materially more difficult
to: (i) obtain the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the
HSR Act applicable to the purchase of the Purchased Assets contemplated by
this Agreement, (ii) obtain the approval under any applicable antitrust,
competition or trade regulation law, (iii) avoid the entry of, the
commencement of litigation seeking the entry of, or to effect the dissolution
of, any injunction, temporary restraining order or other order that would
prevent the completion of the Transactions, or (iv) obtain all
authorizations, consents, orders and approvals of Governmental Authorities
necessary for the consummation of the Transactions, in each case prior to the
Termination Date.



 

\- 54 - SECTION 5.09 _Permits and Licenses_. (a) Commencing on the date of this
Agreement, the parties, cooperating in good faith, shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to take such steps, including the filing of any required
applications with Governmental Authorities, as may be necessary (i) to effect
the transfer of the Permits and Licenses to the Purchaser on or as soon as
practicable after the Closing Date, to the extent such transfer is permissible
under applicable Law, and (ii) to enable the Purchaser to obtain, on or as
soon as practicable after the Closing Date, any additional licenses, permits,
approvals, consents, certificates, registrations, and authorizations (whether
governmental, regulatory, or otherwise) as may be necessary for the lawful
operation of the Mills from and after the Closing Date (the actions described
in the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) being referred to herein as the "
_Permitting Process_ "). Any filing or other fees and other out-of-pocket
expenses associated with the Permitting Process shall be paid by the
Purchaser.

(b) The Purchaser acknowledges that it may not be possible to complete the
Permitting Process prior to the Closing Date and agree that completion of the
Permitting Process prior to the Closing Date shall not be a condition to its
obligation to proceed with this transaction as provided in this Agreement.

SECTION 5.10 _Transferred Names and Marks_. (a) No later than six (6) months
following the Closing, each Seller shall, and shall cause each of its
Affiliates to, file amendments with the appropriate Governmental Authorities
changing its corporate name, "doing business as" name, trade name, and any
other similar corporate identifier (each, a " _Corporate Name_ ") to a
Corporate Name that does not contain any of the Transferred Names and Marks.

(b) Effective as of the Closing, the Purchaser hereby grants to the Sellers
and their Affiliates a worldwide, royalty-free, nonexclusive right and license
to use the Transferred Names and Marks, together with any and all variations
and acronyms thereof and all trademarks, service marks, domain names, email
addresses, trade names, trade dress and other identifiers of source or
goodwill containing, incorporating, or associated with any of the foregoing,
in connection with the continued operation of their respective businesses (i)
as or as part of any Corporate Name during the six (6) months following the
Closing (the " _Transition Period_ "), (ii) to the extent necessary to grant
the license granted, and otherwise to comply with Sellers duties and
obligations, under Section 5.11 of the Interfor Asset Purchase Agreement, and
(iii) on all of their existing stocks of signs, business cards, packaging,
letterheads, invoice stock, Internet and Intranet websites,
advertisements and promotional materials, inventory and other documents and
materials during the Transition Period. During the Transition Period, the
Sellers and their Affiliates may sublicense the rights granted hereunder to
their authorized distributors, vendors, subcontractors and resellers solely
for the purpose of using the Transferred Names and Marks in connection with
the continued operation of the respective businesses of the Sellers and their
Affiliates in accordance with the provisions of this Section 5.10.

(c) Except as expressly provided in this Agreement, no other right to use the
Transferred Names and Marks is granted by the Purchaser to the Sellers or
their Affiliates, whether by implication or otherwise. The Sellers shall
ensure that all use of the Transferred Names and Marks by the Sellers and
their Affiliates as provided in this  _Section 5.10_ shall be only with
respect to goods and services of a level of quality equal to or greater than
the quality of goods and services with respect to which the Transferred Names
and Marks were used in the  



 

\- 55 -  Business prior to the Closing. Any and all goodwill generated by the use of
the Transferred Names and Marks under this _Section 5.10_ shall inure solely
to the benefit of the Purchaser. For the avoidance of doubt, the Purchaser
agrees that no Seller or any of its Affiliates shall have any responsibility
for claims by third parties arising out of, or relating to, the use by the
Purchaser of any Transferred Names and Marks from and after the Closing.

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, and
without limiting the rights otherwise granted in this Section 5.10, the
Sellers and their Affiliates shall have the right, at all times after the
Closing, to (i) keep records and other historical or archived documents
containing or referencing the Transferred Names and Marks, (ii) use the
Transferred Names and Marks to the extent required by or permitted as a fair
use under applicable Law, and (iii) refer to the historical fact that the
Sellers and their Affiliates previously conducted their respective businesses
under the Transferred Names and Marks.

SECTION 5.11 _Bulk Transfer Laws_. The Purchaser hereby waives compliance by
the Sellers with any applicable bulk sale or bulk transfer laws of any
jurisdiction in connection with the sale of the Purchased Assets to the
Purchaser, including the delivery of any clearance certificate under
section 99 of the _Social Services Tax Act_ (British Columbia).

SECTION 5.12 _Transition Services_. Following the Closing, the Sellers and
the Purchaser shall provide, or cause to be provided, certain services as may
be agreed to between the Sellers and the Purchaser, as further set forth in a
term sheet to be agreed by the Sellers and the Purchaser on or before January
14, 2007 and in a transition services agreement to be entered into by the
Sellers and the Purchaser as of the Closing and in form and substance
satisfactory to the Purchaser and the Sellers (the " _Transition
Services Agreement_ ").

SECTION 5.13 _Further Action_. The parties hereto shall use all reasonable
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate action, to do or cause
to be done all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law, and
to execute and deliver such documents and other papers, as may be required to
carry out the provisions of this Agreement and consummate and make effective
the Transactions.

SECTION 5.14 _Tax Cooperation and Exchange of Information_. The parties
hereto will provide the other parties with such cooperation and information
as may be reasonably requested in filing any Tax Return, amended Tax Return or
claim for refund, determining any liability for Taxes or a right to a refund
of Taxes or participating in or conducting any audit or other proceeding in
respect of Taxes relating to the Purchased Assets or the Business. Such
cooperation and information shall include providing copies of relevant Tax
Returns or portions thereof, together with accompanying schedules and related
work papers and documents relating to rulings or other determinations by
taxing authorities. Each of the parties will make themselves (and their
respective employees) available, on a mutually convenient basis, to provide
explanations of any documents or information provided under this Section 5.14.
Each of the parties will retain all Tax Returns, schedules and work papers and
all material records or other documents in its possession (or in
the possession of its Affiliates) relating to Tax matters relevant to the
Purchased Assets or the Business for the taxable period first ending after the
Closing and for all prior taxable periods (the " _Tax Documents_ ") until the
later of (i) the expiration of the statute of limitations of the taxable
periods to which such Tax Returns and other documents  



 

\- 56 -  relate, without regard to extensions, or (ii) eight (8) years following the
due date (without extension) for such Tax Returns. After such time, before
any of the parties shall dispose of any such documents in its possession (or
in the possession of its Affiliates), the other party shall be given the
opportunity, after 90 days prior written notice, to remove and retain all or
any part of such documents as such other party may select (at such other
partys expense). In the event that a Seller is liquidated or otherwise ceases
to be a going concern prior to the expiration of the period described in the
second preceding sentence, such Seller shall offer the Purchaser the
opportunity described in the preceding sentence (with 90 days prior written
notice or such shorter period of notice as may be practicable) to remove and
retain Tax Documents and such Seller may then dispose of any such documents
not removed by Purchaser. If it is not practical to give the other party the
right to retain Tax Documents, the other party may instead be given a
reasonable opportunity to make copies, at its own expense of such Tax
Documents. Any information obtained under this _Section 5.14_ shall be kept
confidential, except as may be otherwise of reasonable assistance in
connection with the filing of Tax Returns or claims for refund or in
conducting an audit or other proceeding.

SECTION 5.15 _Conveyance Taxes_.

(a) _Canadian Conveyance Taxes_. The Purchaser agrees to assume liability for
and to pay all Conveyance Taxes incurred in Canada as a result of
the Transactions.

(b) _United States Conveyance Taxes_. In the event that any Conveyance Taxes
(as may be reduced or eliminated pursuant to Section 1146(b) of the
Bankruptcy Code and/or the Transaction Approval Order entered by the
Bankruptcy Court) are assessed in the United States on the transfer of the
Purchased Assets to the Purchaser, the Sellers and the Purchaser shall each
pay one-half of such Conveyance Taxes. The Sellers shall complete and file all
returns associated therewith.

(c) _GST_. On the Closing Date the Purchaser and the Sellers shall jointly
elect under paragraph 167(l)(b) of the Excise Tax Act (Canada) in the
prescribed form and containing the prescribed information to permit the
Purchased Assets to be conveyed from the Sellers to the Purchaser without GST
being payable in respect of the sale and purchase of the Purchased Assets. The
Purchaser and the Sellers shall jointly complete the election form in respect
of that election and the Purchaser will file the election form no later than
the due date for the Purchasers GST return for the first reporting period in
which GST would, in the absence of that election, become payable in connection
with the Transactions and provide the Sellers with a copy of the filed form.
The Purchaser shall indemnify and hold harmless the Sellers for any Taxes
assessed against the Sellers due to the Sellers not collecting, as a result of
entering into the election contemplated in this section with the Purchaser,
any Taxes under the Excise Tax Act (Canada) in respect of the sale and the
transfer of the Purchased Assets or because of the failure by the Purchaser to
file the election as required by this _Section 5.15(c)_.

(d) _Social Services Tax_. At the Closing, the Purchaser shall self-assess and
remit the applicable PST imposed on the Purchaser with respect to the sale
and purchase of the Purchased Assets under this Agreement. The Purchaser shall
indemnify and hold harmless the Sellers for any Taxes assessed against the
Sellers under the Social Services Tax Act (British Columbia) due to the
failure of the Purchaser to deliver to the Sellers any Taxes payable under
the Social Services Tax Act (British Columbia) with respect to the sale and
purchase of the Purchased Assets under this Agreement.



 

\- 57 - SECTION 5.16 _Proration of Taxes and Certain Charges_. (a) Except as provided
in this  _Section 5.16_, all real property Taxes, personal property Taxes or
similar ad valorem obligations levied with respect to the Purchased Assets for
any taxable period that includes the day before the Closing Date and ends
after the Closing Date, whether imposed or assessed before or after the
Closing Date, shall be prorated between the Sellers and the Purchaser as of
12:01 a.m. New York time on the Closing Date (using the same methodology set
forth in the definition of Excluded Taxes). If any Taxes subject to proration
are paid by the Purchaser, on the one hand, or the Sellers, on the other hand,
the proportionate amount of such Taxes paid (or in the event a refund of any
portion of such Taxes previously paid is received, such refund) shall be paid
promptly by (or to) the other after the payment of such Taxes (or promptly
following the receipt of any such refund).

(b) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, all installments of
special assessments or other charges on or with respect to the Purchased
Assets payable by any of the Sellers for any period in which the Closing Date
shall occur, including base rent, common area maintenance, royalties, all
municipal, utility or authority charges for water, sewer, electric or gas
charges, garbage or waste removal, cost of fuel, fees and charges under
Permits and Licenses and other charges commonly apportioned on the sale of
real property and interests therein in the applicable jurisdiction, shall be
apportioned as of the Closing, and each party shall pay its proportionate
share promptly upon the receipt of any bill, statement or other charge with
respect thereto. If such charges or rates are assessed either based upon time
or for a specified period, such charges or rates shall be prorated as of 12:01
a.m. New York time on the Closing Date. If such charges or rates are assessed
based upon usage of utility or similar services, such charges shall be
prorated based upon meter readings taken on the Closing Date.

(c) All refunds, reimbursements, installments of base rent, additional rent,
license fees or other use related revenue receivable by any party to the
extent attributable to the operation of the Business for any period in which
the Closing shall occur shall be prorated so that the Sellers shall be
entitled to that portion of any such installment applicable to the period up
to but not including the Closing Date and the Purchaser shall be entitled to
that portion of any such installment applicable to any period from and after
the Closing Date, and if the Purchaser or the Sellers, as the case may be,
shall receive any such payments after the Closing Date, they shall promptly
remit to such other parties their share of such payments. 

(d) The prorations pursuant to this _Section 5.16_ may be calculated after
the Closing Date, as each item to be prorated (including any such Tax,
obligation, assessment, charge, refund, reimbursement, rent installment, fee
or revenue) accrues or comes due, provided that, in any event, any such
proration shall be calculated not later than 30 days after the
party requesting proration of any item obtains the information required to
calculate such proration of such item.

(e) The Sellers shall not take any actions (including, but not limited to,
filing any Tax Return or amended Tax Return, responding to any audit or
inquiry by a taxing authority, or settling or compromising any controversy
with a taxing authority) that could affect the Tax Liability of the Purchaser
or any of their Affiliates without the prior written consent of the Purchaser,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed _provided_ that
this _Section 5.16(e)_ shall not apply to income taxes or Tax Returns in
respect thereof.



 

\- 58 - SECTION 5.17 _Personal Information_. In respect of any Personal Information
contained in the books and records of the Sellers that the Purchaser has had
access to or acquire at Closing, the Purchaser will: (a) before the Closing,
use the Personal Information solely for purposes relating to the Transactions
and, if the Closing does not occur, return the Personal Information to the
Sellers; and (b) if the Closing does occur, then after the Closing: (i) use
and disclose any such Personal Information only for necessary employment
purposes in compliance with all applicable Laws; and (ii) to the extent
required by applicable Laws, notify any Person whose Personal Information has
been disclosed to the Purchaser through the books and records that the
Transactions have taken place and that the Personal Information was disclosed
to the Purchaser as a consequence of such Transactions.

SECTION 5.18 _Waiver of Site Profile_. The Purchaser waives any requirement
under the Environmental Management Act (British Columbia) or any replacement
legislation for the Sellers to provide a site profile for any of the real
property included in or in which any interest in which is included in any of
the Purchased Assets.

SECTION 5.19 _Vehicle Registration_. Effective upon Closing, the Sellers and
Purchaser shall arrange for the transfer of the registration of all
registered trucks, cars, other vehicles and rolling stock included in the
Purchased Assets into the Purchasers name. Purchaser shall not use such
trucks, cars, other vehicles or rolling stock until such registrations have
been so transferred.

ARTICLE VI

EMPLOYEE MATTERS

SECTION 6.01 _Salaried Employees_. (a) The Purchaser shall offer employment,
conditional upon Closing and effective as of the Closing Date, to each of the
Salaried Employees listed on Section 6.01(a) of the Disclosure Schedule, as
may be amended by the Sellers by notice to the Purchaser after the date
hereof and prior to Closing, who are, on the Closing Date, not Inactive
