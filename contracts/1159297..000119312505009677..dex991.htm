to Purchaser or any obligation or liability is imposed upon or is to be
assumed by Purchaser under this Agreement (including indemnification
obligations under Article XI hereof), the Exhibits and the other agreements

CONSIDERATION



Section 2.1. _Amount and Form of Consideration_. The consideration to be paid
by Purchaser to Seller in full consideration of the Purchased Equity Interests
and the Purchased Assets shall consist of:



(a) U.S.$ 2,300,000,000.00 (the " _Initial Cash Consideration_ ") in cash,
subject to adjustment as set forth in Section 2.3 and 6.12 (the Initial Cash
Consideration, as so adjusted, the " _Final Cash Consideration_ "), to be paid
in the manner and at the time set forth in Sections 2.2 and 2.3; and



 

11 (b) the assumption by Purchaser and/or one or more of its Designated
Affiliates on and as of the Closing Date of the Assumed Liabilities.



Section 2.2.  _Payment of Cash Consideration_. At the Closing, the Closing
Date Cash Consideration (as defined below) shall be paid by wire transfer of
immediately available funds in U.S. Dollars to an account or accounts
designated by Seller, such designation to be made in writing at least three
Business Days prior to the Closing Date.



Section 2.3. _Purchase Price Adjustment_. (a) At least five Business Days
prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, and
deliver to Purchaser a good faith estimated statement of Working Capital of
the Business as of the close of business on the Closing Date (the "
_Estimated_ _Closing Date Working Capital Statement_ "), and a certificate
setting forth a good faith estimate of Working Capital as of close of
business on the Closing Date (" _Estimated_ _Closing Date Working Capital_ "),
an estimate of Closing Date Cash (" _Estimated Closing Date Cash_ ") and an
estimate of Assumed Indebtedness (" _Estimated_ _Assumed Indebtedness_ ").
The Estimated Closing Date Working Capital Statement shall be prepared in
accordance with GAAP, as modified by the accounting policies specified on
_Schedule 2.3(a)_ (" _Specified Accounting Policies_ "), and to the extent
consistent with GAAP, in accordance with the accounting principles,
procedures, policies, methods that were employed in preparing the Benchmark
Balance Sheet, consistently applied. The Initial Cash Consideration shall be
(i)(A) increased dollar for dollar to the extent the Estimated Closing Date
Working Capital exceeds the Target Working Capital, or (B) decreased dollar
for dollar to the extent the Estimated Closing Date Working Capital is less
than the Target Working Capital, (ii) increased dollar for dollar to the
extent that Estimated Closing Date Cash is greater than U.S.$0 and (iii)
decreased dollar for dollar by the Estimated Assumed Indebtedness (the
Initial Cash Consideration, as adjusted pursuant to this sentence and Section
6.12, the " _Closing Date Cash Consideration_ ").



(b) Within 90 calendar days following the Closing Date, Purchaser shall
prepare, or cause to be prepared, and deliver to Seller a statement of
Working Capital of the Business as of the close of business on the Closing
Date (as such may be adjusted following resolution of disputes in accordance
with Section 2.3(d), the " _Closing Date Working Capital Statement_ "), and a
certificate setting forth a calculation of Working Capital as of the close of
business on the Closing Date (" _Closing Date Working Capital_ "), a
calculation of Closing Date Cash and a calculation of Assumed Indebtedness.
The Closing Date Working Capital Statement shall be prepared in accordance
with GAAP, as modified by the Specified Accounting Policies, using (to the
extent consistent with GAAP) the same accounting principles,
procedures, policies, methods that were employed in preparing the Benchmark
Balance Sheet, consistently applied.



(c) During the preparation of the Estimated Closing Date Working Capital
Statement and the calculation of Estimated Closing Date Working
Capital, Estimated Closing Date Cash and Estimated Assumed Indebtedness (the
" _Estimated Closing Date Financial Data_ "), Seller shall, and shall cause
its Subsidiaries to afford Purchaser reasonable opportunity to review
such preparation, including supporting detail. Purchaser shall provide to
Seller the same reasonable opportunity to review, during such preparation,
Sellers preparations of the Closing Date Working Capital Statement and the
accompanying certificate.



 

12 (d) After receipt of the Closing Date Working Capital Statement, Seller shall
have 30 calendar days to review the Closing Date Working Capital Statement
and the accompanying certificate (collectively, the _"Closing Date Financial
Data"_ ), together with the work-papers used in the preparation thereof.
Seller and its authorized representatives shall have full access to all
relevant books and records and employees of Purchaser and the Acquired
Companies to the extent reasonably required to complete their review of the
Closing Date Financial Data. Seller may dispute items reflected in the
calculation of Closing Date Working Capital and Closing Date Cash and Assumed
Indebtedness only on the basis that such amounts (i) were not determined in
conformity with GAAP, as modified by the Specified Accounting
Policies, applied by Purchaser on a consistent basis (to the extent
consistent with GAAP) with the accounting principles, procedures, policies,
methods that were employed in preparing the Benchmark Balance Sheet,
consistently applied) or (ii) contain arithmetic error. Unless Seller
delivers written notice to Purchaser on or prior to the 20th calendar day
after Sellers receipt of the Closing Date Working Capital Statement, which
notice shall set forth a specific description of the basis of Sellers
objection or objections and the adjustments to the amount of Closing Date
Working Capital and/or Closing Date Cash and/or Assumed Indebtedness which
Seller believes should be made, Seller shall be deemed to have accepted and
agreed to the calculation of Closing Date Working Capital and Closing Date
Cash and/or Assumed Indebtedness. If Seller so notifies Purchaser of its
objection to the calculation of Closing Date Working Capital, Closing Date
Cash and/or Assumed Indebtedness, Purchaser and Seller shall, within 30
calendar days following such notice (the " _Resolution Period_ "), attempt to
resolve their differences and any resolution by them as to any disputed
amounts shall be final, binding and conclusive. If following resolution of
any disputed amounts there do not remain in dispute amounts the aggregate net
effect of which exceeds U.S.$1 million with respect to the Closing Date
Working Capital, the Closing Date Cash or Assumed Indebtedness, then all
amounts remaining in dispute shall be deemed to have been resolved in favor of
the calculation of Closing Date Working Capital, Closing Date Cash or Assumed
Indebtedness, as the case may be, delivered by Seller to Purchaser. 



(e) If, at the conclusion of the Resolution Period, the aggregate net effect
of all amounts remaining in dispute exceeds U.S.$1 million with respect to
Closing Date Working Capital, Closing Date Cash or Assumed Indebtedness, then
all amounts remaining in dispute shall be submitted to Deloitte and Touche LLP
(the " _Neutral Auditors_ "). Each party agrees to execute, if requested by
the Neutral Auditors, a reasonable engagement letter, including customary
indemnities in favor of the Neutral Auditors. All fees and expenses relating
to the work, if any, to be performed by the Neutral Auditors shall be borne
pro rata as between Seller on the one hand and Purchaser on the other, in
proportion to the allocation of the dollar value of the amounts remaining in
dispute between Seller and Purchaser made by the Neutral Auditors such that
the prevailing party pays the lesser proportion of the fees and expenses. The
Neutral Auditors shall act as an expert to determine, based solely on the
provisions of this Section 2.3 and the presentations by Seller and Purchaser,
and not by independent review, only those issues still in dispute and only as
to whether such amounts were arrived at in conformity with Specified
Accounting Policies and Section 2.3(a) hereof. The Neutral Auditors
determination shall be made within 30 calendar days of their selection, shall
be set forth in a written statement delivered to Seller and Purchaser and
shall be final, binding and conclusive. The term " _Final Closing Date
Working Capital_ " shall mean the definitive Closing Date Working Capital, the
term " _Final Closing Date Cash_ " shall mean the definitive Closing Date Cash
and the term " _Final Assumed Indebtedness_ " shall mean the definitive
Assumed Indebtedness, respectively, agreed to (or  



 

13  deemed to be agreed to) by Purchaser and Seller in accordance with the terms
of Section 2.3(d) or the definitive Closing Date Financial Data resulting
from the determinations made by the Neutral Auditors in accordance with this
Section 2.3(e) (in addition to those items theretofore agreed to by Seller and
Purchaser).



(f) The Closing Date Cash Consideration shall be (i)(A) increased dollar for
dollar to the extent the Final Closing Date Working Capital exceeds Estimated
Closing Date Working Capital, or (B) decreased dollar for dollar to the extent
the Final Closing Date Working Capital is less than Estimated Closing Date
Working Capital and (ii)(A) increased dollar for dollar to the extent that
Final Closing Date Cash is greater than Estimated Closing Date Cash or (B)
decreased dollar for dollar to the extent that Final Closing Date Cash is less
than Estimated Closing Date Cash and (iii)(A) increased dollar for dollar
by the amount Estimated Assumed Indebtedness exceeds Final Assumed
Indebtedness and (B) decreased dollar for dollar by the amount Final Assumed
Indebtedness exceeds Estimated Assumed Indebtedness. Any adjustments to the
Closing Date Cash Consideration made pursuant to this Section 2.3(f),
together with interest on such amount from the Closing Date to the date of
payment at a per annum rate equal to the JP Morgan Chase prime rate
(determined as of the Closing Date), shall be paid by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the account or accounts specified by Seller, if
Seller is owed payment, or to the account or accounts specified by Purchaser,
if Purchaser is owed payment, within five Business Days after the Final
Closing Date Working Capital, Final Closing Date Cash and Final Assumed
Indebtedness are agreed to by Purchaser and Seller or any remaining disputed
items are ultimately determined by the Neutral Auditors.



(g) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if at any time prior
to the Closing, Seller or Purchaser determines that, in the course of the
preparation or review of the balance sheet included in the Historical Audited
Financial Statements or Stub Period Consolidated Financial Statements or
otherwise, any asset or liability recorded on the Benchmark Balance Sheet was
improperly classified as a "current" or "non-current" asset or liability,
Seller or Purchaser shall notify the other party and, unless the other party
delivers a notice of objection to such determination within 10 days of such
notice, the Benchmark Balance Sheet and the Target Working Capital shall be
adjusted to reflect the reclassification of any such assets or liabilities.
Irrespective of whether any such adjustment is made on or prior to the
Closing Date, Purchaser shall not be bound by any determination by Seller with
respect to the classification of any assets or liabilities included in the
Benchmark Balance Sheet, the Estimated Closing Date Working Capital or the
Estimated Closing Date Working Capital Statement in its determination of
Closing Date Working Capital or the Closing Date Working Capital Statement
(except with respect to determinations by Seller that are consistent with
GAAP to use one classification rather than another, which determinations
shall be final and binding upon the parties). To the extent there is any
dispute concerning the classification of assets or liabilities in the
calculation of the Benchmark Balance Sheet, the Target Working Capital and
the Closing Date Working Capital, such dispute, whether arising before or
(within the time periods in which Seller may deliver a notice of objection
generally with respect to the Closing Date Working Capital Statement) after
the Closing Date, shall be subject to resolution by the Neutral Auditors in
accordance with the terms of this Section 2.3.

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SELLER



As an inducement to Purchaser to enter into this Agreement and to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby, Seller hereby represents and
warrants to Purchaser that, except as set forth in the applicable Schedules
to this Agreement delivered by Seller to Purchaser and dated as of the date
hereof:



Section 4.1. _Organization and Good Standing_. Each of Seller, CP and the
Acquired Companies is an entity duly organized, validly existing and,
if applicable, in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its
organization or formation, as set forth on _Schedule 4.1_ , and has the
requisite power and authority to own or lease and operate its properties and
to carry on, in all material respects, its business as now being conducted.
Each of Seller, CP and the Acquired Companies is duly qualified, authorized or
licensed to conduct its business as a foreign corporation and, if applicable,
is in good standing under the laws of each jurisdiction in which the conduct
of its business or the ownership of its properties or assets requires such
qualification, authorization or license, except where the failure to be so
qualified, authorized or licensed or to be in good standing would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect. CP is a direct, wholly-owned Subsidiary of Seller.



 

17 Section 4.2. _Capital Structure of Acquired Companies_. As of the date hereof,
the authorized capital stock or other equity interests of each of the
Acquired Companies and the number of shares of such capital stock or other
equity interests that are issued and outstanding and the ownership thereof,
are as set forth on _Schedule 4.2_. The Acquired Company Equity Interests are
duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable (except as
disclosed on _Schedule 4.2_ ) and are not subject to any pre-emptive or
subscription rights (and were not issued in violation of any preemptive or
subscription rights). As set forth on _Schedule 4.2_ , Seller, directly or
indirectly through one or more wholly owned Subsidiaries of Seller,
beneficially owns and has good and valid title to all the Acquired Company
Equity Interests, free and clear of all Liens other than Liens disclosed on
_Schedule 4.2_ and Liens imposed by this Agreement and under state and federal
securities Laws. Except as set forth in _Schedule 4.2_ , (i) there are no
options, warrants, or similar rights to purchase any of the shares or other
equity interests of any of the Acquired Companies, and no obligations binding
upon any Acquired Company to issue, sell, redeem, purchase or exchange any of
its capital stock or any other equity interest or any right relating thereto,
and (ii) there are no shareholders agreements, voting agreements, voting
trusts or other agreements or rights of third parties with respect to or
affecting any of the Acquired Companies or any of their shares of capital
stock or other equity interests. Seller has delivered to Purchaser prior to
the date hereof true and complete copies of the certificate of incorporation,
bylaws, operating agreement and each other organizational document of each of
the Acquired Companies, each as in effect as of the date hereof.



Section 4.3. _Subsidiaries_. _Schedule 4.3_ contains a true and complete list
of all Subsidiaries of the Purchased Companies and the ownership thereof. All
of the outstanding shares of capital stock or other equity interests of each
Subsidiary of the Purchased Companies (collectively, the " _Purchased Company
Subsidiaries_ ") are owned directly or indirectly by the Purchased Companies,
as set forth on _Schedule 4.3_ , free and clear of all Liens other than Liens
disclosed on _Schedule 4.3_ and Liens imposed by this Agreement and under
state and federal securities Laws, and are duly authorized, validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable and are not subject to any preemptive or
subscription rights. The applicable Purchased Companies and/or Subsidiaries
thereof, as set forth on _Schedule 4.3_ , have good and valid title to all
such shares.



Section 4.4. _Authorization of Agreement_. Seller has all requisite corporate
power and authority to execute and deliver (or cause to be executed and
delivered) this Agreement and each other agreement, document, instrument or
certificate contemplated hereby to be executed by Seller or its Subsidiaries
in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
(all such other agreements, documents, instruments and certificates required
to be executed by Seller or any of its Subsidiaries being hereinafter referred
to, collectively, as the " _Seller Documents_ "), and to perform (or cause to
be performed) fully Sellers obligations hereunder and thereunder. The
execution, delivery and performance by Seller of this Agreement and by Seller
or its Subsidiaries of each of the Seller Documents has been duly and validly
authorized by all necessary action on the part of Seller or such Subsidiaries,
as applicable, and no additional authorization, consent or approval by Seller,
its Subsidiaries or the shareholders of Seller is required in connection with
the execution, delivery and performance by them of the Seller Documents. This
Agreement has been, and each of the Seller Documents will be, on or prior to
the Closing Date, duly executed and delivered by Seller and its Subsidiaries,
as applicable, and (assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by
the other parties hereto and thereto) this Agreement constitutes, and each of
the Seller  



 

18  Documents when so executed and delivered will constitute valid and legally
binding obligations of Seller and its Subsidiaries, as applicable,
enforceable against each in accordance with its terms, except as such
enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or other similar Laws affecting the enforcement of
creditors rights generally, and general principles of equity (regardless of
whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in Law or equity).



Section 4.5. _No Conflicts; Consents of Third Parties_. (a) None of the
execution and delivery by Seller or any of its Subsidiaries of this
Agreement and the Seller Documents, the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby or compliance by Seller and its Subsidiaries
with any of the provisions hereof or thereof will (i) result in the breach of
any provision of the certificate or articles of incorporation, by-laws or
similar organizational documents of Seller, CP or any Acquired Company; (ii)
except as set forth on _Schedule 4.5_ , violate, result in the breach or
termination of, or constitute (with or without notice or lapse of time or
both) a default or give rise to any right of consent, cancellation,
termination or acceleration or right to increase the obligations or otherwise
modify the terms under any Business Contract; or (iii) constitute a violation
of any Law applicable to Seller or any Acquired Company, except as would not,
in the case of clause (ii) only, reasonably be expected to have, individually
or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

Body is required on the part of Seller, CP or any Acquired Company in

Body the failure of which to be received or made would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect
on the Purchasers ability to operate the Business after Closing substantially
as conducted as of the date hereof or a material adverse effect on the
Purchasers or Sellers ability to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.



Section 4.6. _Financial Statements_. (a) _Schedule 4.6(a)_ contains true and
complete copies of the unaudited balance sheets of the Business, as of
September 30, 2004, December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002, and the unaudited
statements of operations of the Business for the nine months ended September
30, 2004 and the fiscal years ended December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002
(collectively, the " _Unaudited Historical Financial Statements_ "). Each of
the Unaudited Historical Financial Statements has been prepared in accordance
with GAAP as applied to carve-out financial statements (except for normal and
recurring year end adjustments, which are not expected in the aggregate to be
material in amount, and the omission of footnotes, the omission of cash flow
statements and the selection of periods presented), consistently with
Regulation S-X. The Unaudited Historical Financial Statements were prepared
 



 

19  on the basis of the books and records of the Business (in each case, as of
the date of such Unaudited Historical Financial Statements) and present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Business as
of the dates thereof and the results of its operations for each of the periods
then ended in conformity with GAAP as applied to carve-out financial
statements (except for normal and recurring year end adjustments, which are
not expected in the aggregate to be material in amount, and the omission of
footnotes, the omission of cash flow statements and the selection of periods
presented), consistently with Regulation S-X. Such books and records are a
portion of the books and records from which Sellers audited financial
statements are prepared. The procedures and application of GAAP used in the
preparation of the Unaudited Historical Financial Statements were consistent
with the procedures and application of GAAP used by Seller in preparation of
Sellers audited financial statements as filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission, except as set forth in _Schedule 4.6(a)(ii)_.

 



(b) Seller has made available to Purchaser a true and correct copy of
the unaudited balance sheet of the Business, as of September 30, 2004 (the "
_Balance Sheet Date_ "), which reflects adjustments to the balance sheet of
the Business as of such date as if the balance sheet were prepared in
accordance with GAAP as modified by the Specified Accounting Principles (such
balance sheet being the " _Benchmark Balance Sheet_ "). The Benchmark Balance
Sheet was prepared on the basis of the books and records of the Business as of
the date thereof and presents fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of the Business as of the date thereof in conformity with GAAP, as
modified by the Specified Accounting Principles, as applied to carve-out
financial statements (except for normal and recurring year end adjustments,
which are not expected in the aggregate to be material in amount, and the
omission of footnotes, the omission of cash flow statements and the selection
of periods presented), consistently with Regulation S-X.

Statements, the Stub Period Financial Statements and the Additional Financial
Data will, upon their delivery to Purchaser in accordance with Section 6.9
hereof, fairly present in all material respects, the results of operations,
the financial condition and cash flows of the Business, the Timber Business or
the Paper Business, as applicable, stated and presented in compliance with
Regulation S-X and GAAP, consistently applied with the preparation of the
Unaudited Historical Financial Statements, except as set forth in _Schedule
4.6(c)_.



(d) Except as set forth in _Schedule 4.6(d)_ , when delivered pursuant to
Section 6.9, the Historical Combined Audited Financial Statements will not,
excluding the effect of all extraordinary gains or losses (as determined in
accordance with GAAP), differ in any material respect from the corresponding
Unaudited Historical Financial Statements for the corresponding period. Except
as set forth in _Schedule 4.6(d)_ , when delivered pursuant to Section
6.9, the Stub Period Combined Financial Statements will not, excluding the
effect of all extraordinary gains or losses (as determined in accordance with
GAAP), differ in any material respect from the corresponding Unaudited
Financial Statements. 



(e) None of the Seller, CP nor any of the Acquired Companies has or is
subject to any Liabilities which would be required to be recorded by GAAP
other than: (i) Liabilities recorded or disclosed on the September 30, 2004
balance sheet included in the Unaudited Historical Financial Statements, (ii)
Liabilities which have arisen after September 30,  



 

20  2004 in the Ordinary Course that are not material to the Balance Sheet of
the Business, (iii) Liabilities reflected in the Closing Date Working Capital,
(iv) Excluded Liabilities and (v) Liabilities arising from matters disclosed
by Seller in the Schedules to this Agreement as of the date hereof.



(f) All accounts and notes receivable reflected on the Unaudited Historical
Financial Statements were, and all accounts and notes receivable to be
shown in the computation of Closing Date Net Working Capital will be, bona
fide receivables, accounted for in accordance with GAAP, consistently applied,
and subject to no offsets or counterclaims (other than any offsets or
counterclaims for which adequate reserves have been, or will be, recorded to
the extent required by GAAP), representing amounts due with respect to actual
transactions in the operation of the Business.



(g) [Reserved].



(h) Except as set forth in _Schedule 4.6(h)_ , the Seller and its Subsidiaries
maintain, as it relates to the Business, in all material respects internal
controls over financial reporting to provide reasonable assurance regarding
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements of Seller and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated, enterprise-wide
basis, for external purposes in accordance with GAAP, including policies and
procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable
detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the
assets of the Seller and its Subsidiaries, (ii) provide reasonable assurance
that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements of Seller on a consolidated basis in accordance with GAAP, and that
receipts and expenditures of the Seller and its Subsidiaries are being made
only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the
Seller and its Subsidiaries and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use
or disposition of the assets of the Seller and its Subsidiaries.

forth on _Schedule 4.7_ , (a) the Business has been conducted in all

Company (collectively, the " _Title Company_ ") on (i) the Mills, other than
any Leased Real Property that is not material to the operation of the Mills or
the Business conducted at the Mills, (ii) the Chillicothe Distribution
Center, and (iii) the Timberlands (collectively, the " _Titled Property_ ").
 



 

53  Seller and its Subsidiaries shall provide full cooperation to Purchaser and
the Title Company in connection with the compilation, review and examination
of the title to the Titled Property. Such cooperation by Seller and its
Subsidiaries shall include providing Purchaser reasonable access to (and
access to make copies of) any (and to use reasonable efforts to provide copies
of reasonably requested specific) existing surveys, maps, GIS data (including
GIS-based compartment maps), aerial photographs, existing Contracts relating
to the Titled Properties and title reports in Sellers possession pertaining
to the Titled Property, access to its forestry personnel and providing the
Title Company with full and complete (subject to reasonable restrictions so as
not to unreasonably interfere with Sellers business) access to (A) Sellers
existing title records pertaining to the Titled Property, and (B) the Titled
Property itself for purposes of preparation of Express Maps.



(b) Purchaser and Seller shall cooperate with the Title Company and use
commercially reasonable efforts so that Purchaser will obtain (a) no later
than forty five (45) days prior to the Closing Date, a commitment from the
Title Company for an ALTA Owners (or, if applicable, Leasehold) Title
Insurance Policy (and a commitment for a corresponding lenders policy), 1992
Form (or other ALTA form currently used in the applicable jurisdiction),
together with a copy of all underlying title documents referenced therein
(including any amendments, modifications or supplements thereto, the " _Title
Commitments_ "), and (b) at Closing, title insurance policies from the Title
Company (which may be in the form of a mark-up of a pro forma of the Title
Commitments) in accordance with the Title Commitments, insuring Purchasers
fee simple title (or a valid leasehold interest with respect to any material
Leased Real Property relating to the Mills, as the case may be) to the Titled
Properties (without blanket exceptions for matters that would be addressed or
eliminated with delivery of a survey), with gap coverage through the date of
recording, and (except as provided in Section 6.12) subject only to the
Permitted Exceptions, in such amounts as Purchaser and the Title Company shall
reasonably determine (the " _Title Policies_ "). The Title Policies will
include affirmative insurance and/or title insurance indorsements (in
customary form and if available in the applicable jurisdiction) with respect
to (1) commercial vehicular access to the Titled Property from public
roads; (2) the separate tax parcels that comprise the Titled Property (in the
case of the Timberlands, based upon a forest as a whole); (3) the Titled
Property being the "same as" shown on the applicable Express Map; (4) non-
imputation coverage regarding the Acquired Company Owned Real Property (or
Acquired Company Leased Real Property, if applicable), (5) the Titled Property
being the "same as" the real property listed on the applicable Owned Real
Property Schedules attached hereto, subject to modifications thereto as may
be required under Section 4.10(a)(iv) or Section 7.11; (6) "tie-in" coverage;
(7) subsequent purchasers (through a "future purchaser" indorsement); and (8)
such other customary title insurance indorsements as may be reasonably
required by Purchasers lender. Seller shall execute (or shall cause its
Subsidiary that is the owner of any Titled Property to execute) at Closing
such customary title affidavits with respect to the Titled Property as shall
be reasonably required by the Title Company. The premiums, fees, costs and
expenses charged by the Title Company for the Title Commitments and Title
Policies shall be borne by Purchaser. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, from and after the date hereof and through the
date that is ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, Seller and its
Subsidiaries shall use commercially reasonable and good faith efforts to
resolve, remove and/or cure Title Defects, which efforts shall in include (i)
delivering affidavits to the Title Company (including indemnifications
customarily contained in title affidavits) containing factual statements
within Sellers knowledge with respect to the Titled Property, (ii) retaining
outside counsel as may be  



 

54  reasonable and appropriate to assist in resolving, removing and/or curing
such Title Defects (as hereinafter defined), and (iii) making available
all appropriate internal resources, including James Hill and other forestry
division personnel, to address and attempt to resolve, remove and/or cure such
Title Defects, provided that (except as contemplated by subsection (ii) above)
Seller or its Subsidiaries shall not be required to pay consideration to
third parties to resolve, remove or cure such matters. During the ninety (90)
day period subsequent to the Closing, Purchaser shall reasonably cooperate
with Seller and its Subsidiaries in connection with Sellers efforts to
resolve, remove and/or cure such Title Defects.



(c) Purchaser and Seller have ordered an express map (an " _Express Map_ ")
from the Title Company for each Titled Property (and, with respect to the
Chillicothe Distribution Center, Purchaser and Seller have ordered a survey),
which Express Map (or, with respect to the Chillicothe Distribution Center,
survey) shall (i) indicate all perimeter boundaries of the Titled Properties,
(ii) be sufficient to remove any survey exceptions from the Title Policies in
respect of such properties, (iii) be certified to Seller, Purchaser,
Purchasers financing sources and the Title Company, and (iv) indicate no
encroachments or other title defects other than Permitted Exceptions. Seller
shall fully cooperate and shall cause its Subsidiaries to cooperate (as
contemplated in Section 6.10(a)) in connection with the preparation of the
Express Maps (and with respect to the Chillicothe Distribution Center, the
survey). The fees, costs and expenses with respect (i) to Express Maps for
any Mills (and the survey with respect to the Chillicothe Distribution Center)
shall be borne by Seller, and (ii) to Express Maps for any Timberlands shall
be borne by 50% by Seller and 50% by Purchaser. Any references in the
definition of Permitted Exceptions set forth herein to "any state of facts
which a visual inspection or an accurate survey of the property would
disclose" (or other references in such definition relating to matters shown
or disclosed in a survey or visual inspection of real property) shall not
modify Purchasers rights with respect to obtaining Express Maps (and, with
respect to the Chillicothe Distribution Center, a survey) and the deletion of
survey exceptions on the Title Policies as set forth in this Section 6.10.



Section 6.11. _Objections to Title_. Up until the date that is thirty (30)
days from the receipt of a Title Commitment and copies of all material
underlying title documents, together with Purchasers receipt of and
opportunity to inspect such maps, surveys and diagrams of the Titled
Properties as are in Sellers (or its Subsidiaries) possession and the
applicable Express Maps (or the survey, in the case of the Chillicothe
Distribution Center) (the " _Title Review Period_ "), Purchaser shall have
the right to object to any matter set forth in a Title Commitment which is not
a Permitted Exception, by giving written notice to Seller of Purchasers
objection and the basis (in reasonable detail) for Purchasers position that
such matter is not a Permitted Exception (any such matter that is not a
Permitted Exception, a " _Title Defect_ "). Purchaser shall also have the
right to object to any title exceptions created or suffered by Seller (or its
Subsidiaries), or first made known to Purchaser, between the date of the
applicable Title Commitment obtained by Purchaser and the date of Closing,
which is not a Permitted Exception, by written notice to Seller on or before
the Closing Date. Purchaser shall not be entitled to object to any Liens or
other title exceptions (and the same shall not constitute Title Defects or any
breach of Sellers representations hereunder, but shall instead be deemed to
be Permitted Exceptions) (i) over which the Title Company is willing to insure
(without additional cost to Purchaser  



 

55  or where Seller elects to pay such cost for Purchasers account), (ii)
against which the Title Company is willing to provide affirmative
insurance (without additional cost to Purchaser or where Seller elects to pay
such cost for Purchasers account), or (iii) which will be extinguished upon
the transfer of the Property. Seller shall have the right, but not the
obligation, to cure or remove at or prior to Closing, any Title Defects;
provided, however, that Seller will cause any deed to secure debt, any deed of
trust, any mortgage or any monetary lien encumbering any Titled Property to be
satisfied or otherwise released on or before the Closing. In the event that a
Title Defect exists and Purchaser gives a timely notice of objection to such
Title Defect and Seller fails to cure or remove such exception at or prior to
Closing, Purchaser shall have the rights set forth in Section 6.12 hereof
(with respect to the Timberlands), in addition to any other applicable rights
set forth in this Agreement.



Section 6.12. _Defect Notices; Deleted Parcels_.



(a) In addition to Purchasers right to give Seller notice during the Title
Review Period of a Title Defect with respect to the Timberlands as provided
in Section 6.11, Purchaser shall have the right to deliver to Seller a written
objection notice if there shall be any Environmental Condition affecting the
Timberlands or any portion thereof (an " _Environmental Defect_ "), which
notice shall be given by Purchaser to Seller within thirty (30) days after
Purchaser shall have obtained knowledge of the material facts and
circumstances concerning such Environmental Condition. Any written
objection notice from Purchaser to Seller shall set forth, in reasonable
detail, the basis for Purchasers claim that a defect exists, and the
particular portion of the Timberlands that is subject to such alleged Title
Defect or Environmental Defect (any Timberlands parcel on which such defect
exists being referred to herein as a " _Defective Parcel_ ," which parcel
shall only be the portion of the Timberlands which is actually affected by
such defect, and may be less than a deeded or legal tract). Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, any buffer zones or
other areas within the Timberlands that are not harvested pursuant to
applicable Law, Sustainable Forestry Initiative Program standards or
applicable state forestry Best Management Practices shall not be deemed to be
Defective Parcels due to the fact that commercial harvesting of timber is not
performed thereon.



(b) With respect to a Defective Parcel that has an Environmental Defect (an "
_Environmentally Defective Parcel_ "), Seller has the right, but not the
obligation to remediate such Environmental Defect and if, by the Closing Date,
Seller has cured or remediated such defect, the Environmentally Defective
Parcel shall remain part of the Timberlands to be conveyed by Seller to
Purchaser at Closing and shall not be deemed to be a Deleted Parcel (as
hereinafter defined). If Seller refuses or fails to remediate, in a manner
reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser, any Environmental Defect prior to
Closing, Purchaser shall have the option upon written notice delivered to
Seller at least ten (10) days prior to Closing of: (i) waiving the
Environmental Defect and accepting title to the Environmentally Defective
Parcel at Closing with no adjustment to the Purchase Price therefor (in which
event Purchaser shall acquire the Environmentally Defective Parcel subject to
the Environmental Defect, further subject to the applicable provisions of
Article XI), or (ii) by written notice to Seller, electing not to purchase
the Environmentally Defective Parcel at Closing, in which event (A) Seller
shall not convey such Environmentally Defective Parcel to Purchaser at
Closing, (B) the applicable Deleted Parcel shall be excluded from
this transaction at Closing and shall be retained by Seller, and (C) the
Purchase Price shall be reduced by an amount equal to $300 per acre of the
Deleted Parcel if such parcel is in the Escanaba forest, and $400 per acre of
the Deleted Parcel for any other Timberlands.



 

56 (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in the event that any
Title Commitment for any portion of the Timberlands in the Escanaba Forest
shall not provide for Access Insurance (as hereinafter defined) with respect
to such portion of the Timberlands for which Seller has represented that it
has had legal or historical access (i.e., all the Timberlands in the Escanaba
Forest other than the acres in such forest (estimated by Seller in good faith
to be approximately 13,635 acres) for which Seller has not had such access and
to which the provisions of this Section 6.12 concerning Defective Parcels
shall be applicable), the Purchaser shall give Seller prompt written notice
thereof, and if Seller shall be unable to cause the Title Company (whether by
delivery of an affidavit or otherwise) to provide affirmative
insurance and/or indorsement (in customary form), with respect to commercial
vehicular access to the applicable Timberlands property from public roads (the
" _Access Insurance_ ") in the Title Policy delivered at Closing with respect
to such property (which Title Policy may also include an exception on
Schedule B thereto with respect to lack of documented access, to the extent
that same is the subject of such Access Insurance), then (provided that such
property is not otherwise a Defective Parcel for reasons other than lack of
documented access) such property shall be conveyed to Purchaser at Closing and
shall be deemed not to be a Defective Parcel, _provided_ that Purchaser shall
receive a credit at Closing in the amount of $200 multiplied by the number of
acres in the Escanaba Forest for which Seller has represented that it has had
legal or historical access and Access Insurance shall not have been obtained
at Closing. If, within ninety (90) days after the Closing, Seller shall cause
the Title Company to deliver to Purchaser Access Insurance for any such
property in the Escanaba Forest for which Purchaser received such credit at
Closing (and Purchaser shall reasonably cooperate with any efforts of Seller
in this regard), then Purchaser, within fifteen (15) days after receipt of
such Access Insurance, shall pay to Seller the amount of such credit received
at Closing with respect to such property. Purchasers rights to a $200 per
acre credit under this Section 6.12(c) shall not be modified or affected by
any provisions of the definition of "Permitted Exceptions" that refer to lack
of access, access restrictions or similar matters.



(d) With respect to Defective Parcels which are the subject of a
Title Defect, Purchaser shall be required to purchase such Defective Parcels
at Closing without adjustment in the Purchase Price, _provided_ that if the
aggregate acreage of such Defective Parcels exceeds (i) 45,220 acres in the
Escanaba Forest, (ii) 7,700 acres in the Wickliffe Forest, or (iii) 10,360
acres in the Chillicothe Forest (each such number of acres, a " _Threshold
Amount_ "), then Purchaser shall be entitled to a Purchase Price Credit (as
hereinafter defined) at Closing with respect to the number of acres of
Defective Parcels in a forest that exceeds the Threshold Amount for such
forest, provided that, if within ninety (90) days after the Closing, Seller
shall have cured any Title Defect with respect to a Defective Parcel (and
Purchaser shall reasonably cooperate with Seller in this regard), then
Purchaser, within fifteen (15) days after such cure shall have been completed
and Seller shall have given Purchaser written notice thereof, shall pay
to Seller the amount of the Purchase Price Credit that Purchaser shall have
received at Closing with respect to the applicable Defective Parcel.



(e) In addition, if Seller (or its Subsidiaries) shall own on the Closing Date
and convey to Purchaser at Closing in accordance with the terms hereof
less than 647,000 acres of Timberlands in the Escanaba Forest, 149,000 acres
of Timberlands in the Chillicothe Forest, or 108,000 acres of Timberlands in
the Wickliffe Forest (as determined by Sellers GIS data), Purchaser shall be
entitled to a credit equal to $300 per acre (with respect to the Escanaba
Forest)  



 

57  or $400 per acre (with respect to the Chillicothe or Wickliffe Forests) for
each acre of Timberlands owned and conveyed by Seller (or its Subsidiaries)
at Closing that is less than the applicable minimum acreage (with the acreage
of any Deleted Parcels being deducted from such applicable minimum acreage
amount for purposes of determining such credit).



(f) As used in this Section 6.12, the term (i) " _Purchase Price Credit_ "
for each Defective Parcel (excluding any Environmentally Defective Parcel)
that exceeds the applicable Threshold Amount shall equal $200 per acre with
respect to such Defective Parcel, _provided_ that the Purchase Price Credit
with respect to all Defective Parcels (excluding any reduction in the Purchase
Price on account of an Environmentally Defective Parcel pursuant to Section
6.12(b) hereunder and any Purchase Price credit provided pursuant to Sections
6.12(c) or 6.12(e) hereunder) shall not exceed $20 million in the aggregate,
and (ii) " _Deleted Parcel_ " shall mean, (A) the Environmentally Defective
Parcel, if such Environmentally Defective Parcel is either an entire separate
legal or deeded tract, or (if not) can be subdivided by the execution and
recordation of a deed (in which event Purchaser and Seller, each acting
reasonably, shall mutually agree on the boundaries and configuration of such
Deleted Parcel, provided that such Deleted Parcel shall be configured to be
merchantable timberlands and to not adversely affect the ability of Purchaser
or its successors to operate and harvest the Timberlands contiguous thereto),
or (B) otherwise, the full deeded or legal tract or tracts in which such
Environmentally Defective Parcel is located (regardless of how much larger the
Deleted Parcel is than the Environmentally Defective Parcel).



(g) At Closing, Purchaser shall grant to Seller, without cost, access
easements over and across the Timberlands upon reasonable terms and over
reasonable routes as may be necessary for Sellers access to any Deleted
Parcels, and Seller shall grant to Purchaser, without cost, access easements
over and across the Deleted Parcels upon reasonable terms and over reasonable
routes as may be necessary for Purchasers access to the Timberlands. The
grantor of any such easements shall have the right to relocate the easements,
from time to time, at grantors expense, so long as adequate access shall
be assured to the grantee.



(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 6.12, if within
ninety (90) days after the Closing, Seller completes the remediation of the
Environmental Defect on a Deleted Parcel in a manner reasonably acceptable to
Purchaser, and notifies Purchaser thereof in writing, Purchaser shall
purchase the Deleted Parcel from Seller at a price equal to the value by which
the Purchase Price was reduced because of the Deleted Parcel (and otherwise on
the terms set forth in this Agreement), provided that the Deleted Parcel
is in substantially the same condition, reasonable wear and tear excluded, as
it was as of the date of Closing, and provided that Seller shall not have
harvested timber (other than to a _de_ _minimis_ extent) on such Deleted
Parcel since the Closing Date. The parties shall close the purchase and sale
of any such Deleted Parcel on a date that is on or about thirty (30) days
after Seller so notifies Purchaser that the cure or remediation has been
completed (or on such other date as Purchaser and Seller may agree), and at
such closing the parties shall take the actions (and bear the costs) with
respect to the purchase and sale of such Deleted Parcel that would have been
taken (or borne) by such party under this Agreement had the Deleted Parcel
been included in the Property, and such closing thereafter shall be considered
the " _Closing_ " with respect to such parcel for all purposes of this
Agreement.



 

58 (i) If Seller objects to any timely notice from Purchaser raising a Title
Defect, then Seller, within fifteen (15) days after receipt of Purchasers
notice, shall send to Purchaser a written notice setting forth, in reasonable
detail, the basis of Sellers objection to Purchasers notice. If Seller and
Purchaser have not resolved, within ten (10) days after such written response
by Seller to Purchasers delivery of written notice of objection within the
applicable time period provided herein (prior to the Closing), any dispute
between them with respect to any alleged Title Defect, then either Seller or
Purchaser shall have the right by written notice (" _Resolution Notice_ ")
given within five (5) days thereafter to submit such dispute for determination
(" _Expedited Resolution_ ") by an independent appraiser experienced in
commercial timberlands, to be mutually approved by Seller and Purchaser, which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed (each, the "
_Forestry Expert_ "), whose decision as to whether the applicable title
matter constitutes a Title Defect or a Permitted Exception (and/or as to the
particular acreage affected by any such Title Defect, if such question cannot
first be resolved by the Title Company to the satisfaction of Seller and
Purchaser) shall be final, unappealable and binding on the parties. Seller and
Purchaser may each submit all relevant written materials (including
affidavits) for consideration by the Forestry Expert within ten (10) days
after the Resolution Notice, and the Forestry Expert shall render his written
decision within fifteen (15) days after the Resolution Notice. The Forestry
Expert shall make his determination based on the particular relevant
provisions of this Agreement, the materials submitted by the parties hereunder
and such other materials that such Forestry Expert may deem to be relevant to
its determination as described above. The parties shall each pay one-half
(1/2) of the fees and expenses of the Forestry Expert and shall otherwise
bear their own costs and expenses of any Expedited Resolution. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, it is acknowledged and agreed that the following limitations
shall apply to the duties of, and matters subject to review and determination
by, a Forestry Expert hereunder: (i) prior to the approval of any Forestry
Expert, all material relationships, affiliations and business dealings that
such proposed Forestry Expert currently has or has had during the three (3)
year period prior to the date hereof with Purchaser, Seller and each of their
respective Affiliates must be disclosed to each party hereto, and the Forestry
Expert and each party hereto (to the extent applicable to it) must certify to
such statement; and (ii) if Seller takes a position that the instrument,
document, agreement or other matter that is the subject of the alleged Title
Defect no longer exists or no longer affects the Timberlands, then Seller
shall cause the Title Company to remove such alleged Title Defect and such
dispute shall not be subject to the review or determination of the Forestry
Expert. __



 

(j) If (x) any parcel of the Timberlands is an Environmentally Defective
Parcel, (y) the relevant Environmental Defect on such
Environmentally Defective Parcel existed prior to the Closing Date or there
is no credible evidence that the applicable Environmental Defect first
occurred subsequent to the Closing Date, and (z) Purchaser did not have actual
knowledge of the material facts and circumstances concerning such
Environmental Defect on or prior to the date that is ten (10) days prior to
the Closing Date, then, in addition to Purchasers rights pursuant to Section
6.12(a) and Section 6.12(b) hereunder, Purchaser shall also have the right
after the Closing Date up until the date that is six (6) months after the
Closing Date to give Seller written notice of such Environmental Defect, which
notice shall be in reasonable detail, whereupon (i) Seller shall have the
right to remediate such Environmental Defect at Sellers cost, and Purchaser
shall reasonably cooperate with Sellers efforts in such regard, and (ii) if
Seller shall fail to remediate such Environmental Defect, in a manner
reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser, within ninety (90) days after Sellers
receipt of Purchasers notice with respect to  



 

59  such Environmental Defect, then Purchaser, within sixty (60) days after the
expiration of such ninety (90) day period, may elect to convey back to Seller
the applicable Timberlands parcel subject only to title matters that existed
as of the Closing Date, and which parcel shall conform to the requirements set
forth in the definition of "Deleted Parcel" in Section 6.12(f)(ii) and Seller
shall pay to Purchaser, at the closing of such re-conveyance, the applicable
amount set forth in Section 6.12(b)(ii)(C). Any such parcel reconveyed by
Purchaser to Seller in accordance with this Section 6.12(j) shall be deemed to
be a Deleted Parcel hereunder.



(k) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 6.12,
Purchasers rights to any credits against the Purchase Price pursuant to
Sections 6.12(b), 6.12(c), 6.12(d) and 6.12(e) shall be applicable only in the
event the Closing occurs in accordance with this Agreement and shall
not modify or affect the provisions of Article VIII with respect to the
conditions to Purchasers obligation to close or to Sellers obligations under
Section 6.2.



(l) The parties hereto agree that the measurement of " _acre_ " and "
_acreage_ " as used in this Agreement has been, and shall be, calculated in
accordance with the GIS method, absent manifest error.



(m) This Section 6.12 shall survive the Closing.



Section 6.13. _Computer Software; Data_.



(a) _Included Seller Software_. Seller hereby conveys to Purchaser and its
Affiliates and designees, effective as of the Closing, a perpetual, royalty-
free, fully-paid, non-exclusive license (with the right to sublicense) to use,
modify and make derivative works of the Included Seller Software.



(b) _Included Third Party Software and Purchased Third Party Software_. Seller
hereby agrees to obtain for Purchaser and its Designated Affiliates the right
to operate the Included Third Party Software and the Purchased Third Party
Software as it was operated by or for the benefit of the Business (including
all configurations and customizations thereof) prior to the Closing (the "
_Necessary IT Licenses_ "). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
Section 6.3 (relating to obtaining consents for the assignment of Contracts),
Purchaser shall pay the costs or fees required to obtain the Necessary
IT Licenses (the " _IT Transfer Fees_ ") up to $8,000,000. If the IT Transfer
Fees exceed $8,000,000, then Seller and Purchaser shall share equally in the
payment of same up to a maximum of $16,000,000 in the aggregate. Seller
shall pay all IT Transfer Fees in excess of $16,000,000.



(c)  _Shared Data_. Seller and Purchaser shall be co-owners, without any
rights or obligations of accounting, of any and all Business Data that was
used by Seller or any of its Subsidiaries (other than the Acquired Companies),
and not solely used by the Business, prior to the Closing Date.



Section 6.14.  _Intellectual Property_.



(a) Subject to Section 12.1(b), Seller hereby grants to Purchaser, its
Affiliates and designees, effective as of the Closing, a perpetual, royalty-
free, fully-paid, non-exclusive license (with the right to sublicense) to use,
practice, lease, license, reproduce, modify and make  



 

60  derivative works of, and to make, sell and distribute goods and services
utilizing or incorporating, the Copyrights, Patents, Invention Records and
Trade Secrets owned or licensed by Seller or any of its Subsidiaries (other
than the Acquired Companies) to the extent necessary to perform the processes
performed in, and otherwise conduct, the Business as of the Closing Date and
not otherwise part of the Acquired Intellectual Property, including without
limitation the Intellectual Property listed on _Schedule 6.14_ (the "
_Licensed Seller IP_ "). For the avoidance of doubt, if Intellectual Property
listed on _Schedule 1.3(d)_ is not listed on _Schedule 6.14_ , such
Intellectual Property is not included in the Licensed Seller IP. Such license
is transferable in connection with the sale or transfer of the Business or the
portion of the Business to which such Intellectual Property relates, and does
not require Purchaser to account for or share revenues resulting from such
use.



(b) Seller shall have the initial right to prosecute and control the
prosecution of, and make all requisite filings for maintaining, all
applications and payment of any fees related to any Licensed Seller IP.



(c) Within sixty (60) days of any prosecution deadline or fee due date for
any Licensed Seller IP, Seller will notify Purchaser if it intends to abandon
such Licensed Seller IP by failing to meet such deadline or pay such fee. Upon
receiving such notice, Purchaser may, in its discretion, pursue and control
such Licensed Seller IP at its own expense.



(d) In the event that either party has reason to believe that any person may
be infringing any of the Licensed Seller IP, such party will promptly
notify the other party by providing all information in its possession,
custody or control to permit the other party to determine whether such
infringement is occurring.



(e) Seller shall have the sole right to bring or defend any action to enforce
the Licensed Seller IP and protect against infringement or unauthorized use
thereof, and may join Purchaser in any such action. Purchaser will cooperate
with Seller in any such enforcement efforts at Sellers expense. In the event
that Seller, in the exercise of its reasonable business judgment, elects not
to enforce the Licensed Seller IP, through legal action or otherwise,
Purchaser may bring legal action or otherwise take any action to enforce the
Licensed Seller IP unless Seller reasonably believes that doing so would
be likely to adversely affect Sellers business interests and provides notice
to Purchaser indicating the basis for such belief. Seller will cooperate with
Purchaser in such permitted enforcement efforts at Sellers expense.



(f) Each party agrees that it will have no right or interest in any
new developments, enhancements or improvements to the Licensed Seller IP
developed by the other party or its Affiliates.



Section 6.15. _Compliance with Environmental Transfer Statutes_. Seller shall,
at its own cost and expense, be responsible for complying with the notice
requirements of any Environmental Laws regarding the sale or transfer of the
Business Facilities, including, but not limited to, in each case, to the
extent possible, prior to the Closing Date.



 

61 ARTICLE VII



COVENANTS OF PURCHASER



From and after the date hereof and until the Closing (except with respect to
Sections 7.4, 7.5, 7.6, 7.7, 7.8, 7.9 and 7.10 which shall survive
the Closing in accordance with their terms), Purchaser hereby covenants and
agrees that:



Section 7.1. _Opportunity to Participate in Q andA_. In accordance with
Purchasers exercise of its rights under Section 6.1, Purchaser shall abide by
the obligations imposed on Purchaser set forth in such Section 6.1, including
permitting Seller to participate in any meetings or discussions with any
Business customers, suppliers, employees or others with whom it has material
commercial dealings.



Section 7.2. _Public Statements_. Before Purchaser shall issue any
press release or otherwise make any public statement concerning this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, Purchaser shall so advise
and cooperate with Seller and shall not release such information without
Sellers consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), unless (a) such information is otherwise publicly
available other than as a result of a disclosure by Purchaser made in breach
of this Section 7.2 or (b) the release thereof is, in the reasonable judgment
of Purchaser, required by any Law (including any rule of any securities
exchange on which Purchasers securities are traded) or Order to which
Purchaser is bound or subject, or is otherwise necessary for the consummation
of the Acquisition Financing.



Section 7.3. _Consents and Conditions_. (a) Purchaser shall use its
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do,
or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with Seller in doing, all
things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective the
transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable, including, but
not limited to: (i) obtaining all necessary consents, approvals or waivers
from, and giving any necessary notifications to, third parties; (ii)
making all registrations and filings with, and obtaining all necessary
actions or non-actions, waivers, consents and approvals from, all Governmental
Bodies (including those in connection with the HSR Act and comparable
requirements in foreign jurisdictions) and taking all steps as may be
necessary to obtain an approval or waiver from, or to avoid an action or
proceeding by, a Governmental Body; and (iii) defending any Legal Proceedings
challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, including seeking to have any stay or temporary
restraining order or preliminary or permanent injunction entered by any
Governmental Body vacated or reversed.



(b) [Intentionally Omitted]

matters relating to the completion of the transactions contemplated hereby,
including promptly furnishing Seller with copies of notices or other
communications received by Purchaser or by any of its Subsidiaries from any
third party and/or any Governmental Body with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby. Purchaser shall promptly furnish to Seller such necessary
information and reasonable assistance as Seller may request in connection with
the foregoing and  



 

62  shall promptly provide counsel for Seller with copies of all filings made by
Purchaser, and all correspondence between Purchaser (and its advisors) with
any Governmental Body and any other information supplied by Purchaser and its
Affiliates to a Governmental Body in connection herewith and the transactions
contemplated hereby; _provided_ , _however_ , that Purchaser may, as it deems
advisable and necessary, reasonably designate any competitively sensitive
material provided to Seller as "outside counsel only," and materials may be
redacted (i) to remove references concerning the valuation of the Business and
(ii) as necessary to comply with contractual arrangements. Materials
designated as for "outside counsel only" and the information contained therein
shall be given only to the outside legal counsel of Seller and will not be
disclosed by such outside counsel to employees, officers or directors of
Seller unless express permission is obtained in advance from Purchaser or its
legal counsel. Purchaser shall, subject to applicable Law, permit counsel for
Seller reasonable opportunity to review in advance, and consider in good
faith the views of Seller in connection with, any proposed written
communication to any Governmental Body. Purchaser agrees not to participate,
or to permit its Affiliates to participate, in any substantive meeting or
discussion, either in person or by telephone, with any Governmental Body in
connection herewith and the transactions contemplated hereby unless it
consults with Seller in advance and, to the extent not prohibited by such
Governmental Body, gives Seller the opportunity to attend and participate.



Section 7.4.  _Seller s Access to Documents_. Purchaser shall, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries to, afford to Sellers representatives, upon reasonable
notice and without undue interruption to Purchasers business, access during
normal business hours to the books and records of Purchaser pertaining to the
operations of the Business prior to the Closing Date for a period of eight
years following the Closing Date in connection with financial statements and
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission reporting obligations, Excluded
Liabilities, Excluded Assets and other reasonable business purposes; provided
that nothing herein shall limit Sellers rights of discovery. Purchaser agrees
to hold all of the books and records of the Business (other than records
relating to Taxes, which shall be governed by Section 14.5) existing on the
Closing Date or included in the Purchased Assets in accordance with
Purchasers standard record retention policies; provided that Purchaser shall
not destroy, alter or dispose of any of such books and records for a period of
eight years from the Closing Date or such longer time as may be required by
Law without first offering in writing at least 90 calendar days prior to such
destruction or disposition to surrender them to Seller.



Section 7.5. _Further Actions_. Purchaser, whether before, at or after the
Closing, shall execute and deliver such instruments and take such other
actions as may reasonably be required to (a) carry out the intent hereof and
of the Transition Agreements and (b) consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby including the taking of all acts necessary to cause the
conditions to Closing to be satisfied as promptly as possible. Purchaser shall
use its reasonable best efforts to secure the Acquisition Financing pursuant
to the Financing Commitments. If Purchasers financing source notifies
Purchaser that it is unwilling or unable to provide the Acquisition Financing
on the terms and conditions set forth in the Financing Commitments, then
Purchaser shall so notify the Seller of such fact and then Purchaser shall use
its reasonable best efforts to secure alternative financing with its original
and any other nationally recognized financial institutions; provided that
such alternative financing is on terms and conditions that in the aggregate
are no less favorable to the Purchaser than the terms and conditions
contemplated by the original Financing Commitments and in no event shall
Purchaser  



 

63  be required to enter into any alternative financing arrangements pursuant to
which the cost of capital to Purchaser shall exceed the cost of
capital contemplated by the original Financing Commitments.



Section 7.6. _Guarantees; Letters of Credit_. Purchaser shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause itself or one or more of its Affiliates to be
substituted in all respects for Seller or any of its Subsidiaries that is not
an Acquired Company, effective as of the Closing Date, in respect of all
obligations of Seller and any such Subsidiary that is not an Acquired Company
under each of the guarantees, surety bonds, letters of credit, letters of
comfort, bid bonds, performance bonds and other financial assurance
arrangements or commitments obtained or entered into by Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries that is not an Acquired Company for the benefit of the Business
(and Seller and its Subsidiaries shall be released from any such
obligations), including those guarantees, surety bonds, letters of credit,
letters of comfort, bid bonds and performance bonds are set forth in _Schedule
7.6_ (the " _Guarantees_ "). To the extent such substitution contemplated by
the first sentence of this Section 7.6 has been effected, Seller and its
Subsidiaries that are not Acquired Companies shall from and after the Closing
cease to have any obligation whatsoever arising from or in connection with
the Guarantees. To the extent such substitution contemplated by the first
sentence of this Section 7.6 has not been effected, Purchaser shall (i) use
commercially reasonable efforts to affect such substitution as soon as
practicable following the Closing, but in any event within 6 months thereof,
and (ii) indemnify Seller and its Subsidiaries that are not Acquired Companies
with respect to any such Guarantees in accordance with Article XI; _provided_
, _however_ , that notwithstanding anything in the foregoing, with respect to
any of the Guarantees set forth in _Schedule 7.6_ , Seller and its
Subsidiaries may at any time following the six month anniversary of the
Closing terminate one or more of such Guarantees and thereafter cease to have
any obligation whatsoever arising from or in connection with any such
terminated Guarantee.



Section 7.7. _Use of Seller s Name_. Purchaser agrees that, subject to the
terms of the Transition Agreements:



(a) within six months after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall remove
"MeadWestvaco," the MeadWestvaco logo and any other similar mark (the "
_Seller Name_ ") and any other Trademark, design or logo previously or
currently used by Seller or any of its Affiliates that is not part of the
Acquired Intellectual Property from all buildings, signs and vehicles of the
Business;



(b) except for use of the MeadWare name in the presently existing MeadWare
product line for one year, as set forth in _Schedule 6.14(6)_ , within six
months after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall cease using the Excluded IP
Assets and the Seller Name and any other Trademark, design or logo previously
or currently used by Seller or any of its Affiliates that is not part of the
Acquired Intellectual Property in all invoices, letterhead, domain names and
web sites, advertising and promotional materials, office forms and business
cards;



(c) Purchaser will (i) within twelve months after the Closing Date, remove the
proprietary MeadWestvaco packaging from the inventory of packaging materials
of the Business that is in existence as of the Closing Date (" _Existing
Inventory_ ") and (ii) will  



 

64  use its best efforts to remove within six months after the Closing Date the
Seller Name, and any other Trademark, design or logo previously or currently
used by Seller that is not part of the Acquired Intellectual Property, from
those assets of the Business that are not Existing Inventory, including those
assets (such as, but not limited to, tools, molds and machines) used in
association with the manufacture of the products of the Business or otherwise
reasonably used in the conduct of the Business after the Closing Date (such
assets, " _Other Marked Assets_ ");



(d) At the Closing, Seller will grant to Purchaser a limited right to use the
Seller Name and associated Trademarks, designs and logos with regard to the
Existing Inventory and Other Marked Assets, and any other Trademarks forming a
part of the Excluded IP Assets, in accordance with the terms and
conditions set forth in this Section 7.7;



(e) In no event shall Purchaser or any Affiliate of Purchaser advertise or
hold itself out as Seller or an Affiliate of Seller at any time before, on or
after the Closing Date; and



(f) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing Date, but in no event
later than three months following the Closing Date, Purchaser shall change
the name of the Acquired Companies, to the extent applicable, to delete any
references to "MeadWestvaco."



Section 7.8. _Litigation Support_. In the event and for so long as Seller
actively is contesting or defending against any action, investigation,
charge, claim, or demand by a third party (other than Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates) in connection with (a) any transaction contemplated under this
Agreement or (b) any fact, situation, circumstance, status, condition,
activity, practice, plan, occurrence, event, incident, action, failure to act,
or transaction on or prior to the Closing Date involving the Business,
Purchaser will cooperate with Seller and its counsel in the contest or
defense, make available its personnel, and provide such testimony and access
to its books and records as shall be reasonably necessary in connection with
the contest or defense, all at the sole control, cost and expense of Seller
(unless Seller is entitled to indemnification therefor under Article XI).



Section 7.9.  _Patent License_.



(a) Subject to Section 12.1(a), Purchaser and/or one or more of its
Designated Affiliates hereby grant(s) to Seller, its Affiliates and designees,
effective as of the Closing, a perpetual, royalty-free, fully-paid, non-
exclusive license (with the right to sublicense) to make, use or sell
products or services based upon, and practice, the Patents and Invention
Records set forth on _Schedule 7.9_ (the " _Licensed Purchaser Patents_ ").
For the avoidance of doubt, if Patents listed on  _Schedule 1.2(g)_ are not
listed on _Schedule 7.9_ , such Patents are not included in the Licensed
Purchaser Patents. Such license is transferable in connection with the sale or
transfer of Sellers business to which such Patents relate, and does not
require Seller to account for or share revenues resulting from such use.



 

65 (b) Purchaser shall have the initial right to prosecute and control the
prosecution of, and make all requisite filings for maintaining, all
applications and payment of any fees related to any Licensed Purchaser
Patents.



(c) Within sixty (60) days of any prosecution deadline or fee due date for any
Licensed Purchaser Patents, Purchaser will notify Seller if it intends to
abandon such Licensed Purchaser Patents by failing to meet such deadline or
pay such fee. Upon receiving such notice, Seller may, in its discretion,
pursue and control such Licensed Purchaser Patents at its own expense.



(d) In the event that either party has reason to believe that any person may
be infringing any of the Licensed Purchaser Patents, such party will promptly
notify the other party by providing all information in its possession, custody
or control to permit the other party to determine whether such infringement
is occurring.



(e) Purchaser shall have the sole right to bring or defend any action to
enforce the Licensed Purchaser Patents and protect against infringement or
unauthorized use thereof, and may join Seller in any such action. Seller will
cooperate with Purchaser in any such enforcement efforts at Purchasers
expense. In the event that Purchaser, in the exercise of its reasonable
business judgment, elects not to enforce the Licensed Purchaser Patents,
through legal action or otherwise, Seller may bring legal action or otherwise
take any action to enforce the Licensed Purchaser Patents unless Purchaser
reasonably believes that doing so would be likely to adversely affect
Purchasers business interests and provides notice to Seller indicating the
basis for such belief. Purchaser will cooperate with Seller in such permitted
enforcement efforts at Purchasers expense.



(f) Each party agrees that it will have no right or interest in any new
developments, enhancements or improvements to the Licensed Purchaser Patents
developed by the other party or its Affiliates



Section 7.10. _Bulk Sales Law_. Purchaser hereby waives compliance by Seller,
in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, with the provisions
of any applicable bulk sales law; provided that, Seller shall
indemnify Purchaser for any Losses arising from such non-compliance under
Article XI.



Section 7.11. _Unidentified Properties_. Seller shall use its reasonable best
efforts from and after the date hereof to identify any real property (whether
leased or owned) of the Seller or any of its Subsidiaries that is Related to
the Business (other than the Timberlands) and that has not been identified in
Sellers Disclosure Schedule as real property that comprises part of the
Assets to be conveyed hereunder (each, an " _Undisclosed Business Property_
"). As promptly as practicable, but in no event more than fifteen (15)
Business Days, after becoming aware of the existence of any Undisclosed
Business Property, Seller shall deliver to Purchaser a written description of
such Undisclosed Business Property, the location and approximate acreage
thereof and the basis on which such Undisclosed Business Property is Related
to the Paper Business. Seller shall afford Purchaser and its representatives
full access for a period of 45 days after delivery of any written notification
of the existence of such Undisclosed Business Property  



 

66  to the Undisclosed Business Property and all information, data, reports,
surveys and other written materials (including any correspondence or
written communications with Governmental Authorities relating to the
Undisclosed Business Property), including the right to conduct Phase I
environmental surveys with respect to such Undisclosed Business Property. If
during such 45-day period, Purchaser notifies Seller in writing either (i)
that Purchasers environmental consultant has determined that Environmental
Liabilities associated with such Undisclosed Business Property exceed $250,000
or (ii) that the fair market value of such Undisclosed Business Property is
less than the amount of Environmental Liabilities associated with such
Undisclosed Business Property, Purchaser, at its option, may treat such
Undisclosed Business Property as an Asset to be conveyed under this Agreement
or may treat such Undisclosed Business Property as an Excluded Property, and
such determination by Purchaser shall be final, binding and conclusive for all
purposes of this Agreement. Absent such notification by Purchaser within
such 45-day period, such Undisclosed Business Property shall become part of
the Assets to be conveyed pursuant to the terms of this Agreement (including,
if such Undisclosed Business Property is part of the Mills, Chillicothe
Distribution Center or the Timberlands, Sections 6.10, 6.11 and 6.12).

ARTICLE X



ADDITIONAL POST-CLOSING COVENANTS



Section 10.1. _Certain Employment Matters_. (a) _Transferred Employees_. (i)
_Offers of Employment_. The parties hereto intend that there will be a
continuity of employment for all Acquired Company Employees and Business
Employees following the Closing Date, except as specifically provided in this
Section 10.1(a). At least five days prior to the Closing Date, Purchaser
shall, or shall cause one or more of its Designated Affiliates to, make a
general  



 

69  offer of employment, effective as of the Closing Date, through a general
notice of transfer (pursuant to methodologies mutually agreed upon by Seller
and Purchaser) to each Business Employee (including any individuals on
maternity leave, short-term disability leave or another approved leave of
absence). In the case of each Business Employee whose terms of employment are
governed by a Collective Bargaining Agreement (" _Represented Employees_ "),
such offer shall be on terms and conditions satisfying the requirements of the
applicable Collective Bargaining Agreement (as set forth in Section
10.1(a)(ii) below concerning Purchasers (or one or more of its Designated
Affiliates) assumption of the Collective Bargaining Agreements). In the case
of each other Business Employee (" _Non-Represented Employees_ "), such offer
shall be at the same base salary or base hourly wage rate as in effect
immediately before the Closing Date. Each Business Employee will be deemed to
have accepted such offer, unless (A) the Business Employee expressly rejects
such offer before the Closing Date or (B) the Business Employee otherwise
indicates by his or her actions that such offer of employment has not been
accepted and Purchaser or one or more of its Designated Affiliates notifies
Seller within 30 days following the Closing Date of such non-acceptance of
the offer. The Business Employees who are deemed to have accepted such offer,
and all Acquired Company Employees, are collectively referred to as the "
_Transferred Employees_." The parties will cooperate to comply with legal and
regulatory requirements to accomplish the employment transfers described in
this Section 10.1.



(ii) _Collective Bargaining Agreements_. As of the Closing, Purchaser shall,
or shall cause one or more of its Designated Affiliates to, assume
all Collective Bargaining Agreements and Sellers obligations under the
Collective Bargaining Agreements (which specifically shall require Purchaser
or one or more of its Designated Affiliates to establish employee benefit
plans with the same benefit levels, benefit design and, if applicable,
employee contribution rates as in effect under each of the Employee Benefit
Plans in which Represented Employees are entitled to participate under the
Collective Bargaining Agreements).

 



(b) _Post-Closing Compensation and Benefits Generally_. (i)  _Benefit Plans
Generally_. Effective as of the Closing, Seller shall cause the Acquired
Companies to cease to be participating employers in the Seller Employee
Benefit Plans and, as of the Closing Date, all Transferred Employees shall
cease to accrue benefits under and otherwise to participate as active
participants in the Seller Employee Benefit Plans. Purchaser agrees that, from
the Closing Date until December 31, 2005, it shall, or shall cause one or more
of its Designated Affiliates and/or the Acquired Companies to, maintain
employee benefit and compensation (including incentive bonus opportunity but
excluding (i) post-employment health and life benefits (other than Cobra
Coverage), (ii) defined benefit pension benefits for Non-Represented
Employees, (iii) equity-based or related compensation, (iv) supplemental
executive retirement benefits and (v) deferred compensation arrangements)
plans, programs and arrangements for the benefit of the Non-Represented
Employees that, when taken as a whole, are comparable to those provided to
such Non-Represented Employees immediately before the Closing.



(ii) _Service Credit; Benefit Transition_. For all purposes under the employee
benefit plans of Purchaser and its Designated Affiliates providing benefits
to any Non-Represented Employees after the Closing (the " _New Plans_ "), each
Non-Represented Employee shall be credited with his or her years of service
with Seller and its Subsidiaries (including the Acquired Companies) as of the
Closing Date (and any additional service credited under the Employee Benefit
Plans), to the same extent as such Non-Represented Employee was entitled,  



 

70  before the Closing, to credit for such service under any similar Employee
Benefit Plans, except to the extent such credit would result in a duplication
of benefits, and except for purposes of benefit accrual under any defined
benefit pension plan. In addition, and without limiting the generality of the
foregoing: (A) each Non-Represented Employee shall be immediately eligible to
participate, without any waiting time, in any and all New Plans to the extent
coverage under such New Plan replaces coverage under a comparable Employee
Benefit Plan in which such Non-Represented Employee previously participated
(such plans, collectively, the " _Old Plans_ "); and (B) for purposes of each
New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical, vision and/or disability
benefits to any Non-Represented Employee, Purchaser shall, or shall cause one
or more of its Designated Affiliates to, cause all preexisting condition
exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be waived for
such employee and his or her covered dependents, to the extent such exclusions
and requirements were waived with respect to the Non-Represented Employee
under comparable Old Plans, and Purchaser shall, or shall cause one or more of
its Designated Affiliates to, cause any eligible expenses incurred by such
Non-Represented Employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion
of the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the date such Non-Represented
Employees participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into
account under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all
deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to
such Non-Represented Employee and his or her covered dependents for the
applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such
New Plan.



(c) _Certain Specific Compensation and Benefits_. (i) _Severance_. Purchaser
will maintain, or cause one or more of its Designated Affiliates and/or the
Acquired Companies to maintain, for the benefit of Non-Represented Employees
whose employment terminates at any time from the Closing Date through December
31, 2005, a severance plan or plans providing benefits, terms and conditions
that are not less favorable to such employees than those provided under the
MeadWestvaco Corporation Severance Pay Plan for Salaried and Non-Union Hourly
Employees as in effect on the Closing Date.



(ii) _Other Welfare Benefits_. (A) Without in any way limiting Purchasers
(or its Designated Affiliates or, following Closing, the Acquired Companies)
obligations under Section 10.1(a)(ii), Seller, the Acquired Companies, and
Purchaser shall cooperate so that there shall be in effect, as of Closing,
medical, life insurance, disability and other welfare plans sponsored by the
Acquired Companies, Purchaser, and/or one or more of its Designated Affiliates
(" _New Welfare Plans_ "), that provide Transferred Employees with benefits
that, when taken as a whole, are comparable to the benefits provided under the
Seller Welfare Plans immediately prior to Closing (such benefits being
collectively referred to as " _Welfare Benefits_ "). Seller and its
Subsidiaries (other than the Acquired Companies) shall be responsible for, and
shall retain all Liability and indemnify and hold Purchaser, its Subsidiaries
and Designated Affiliates harmless with respect to all medical, life
insurance and other welfare plan expenses and benefits for each Transferred
Employee with respect to claims incurred by such employees or their covered
dependents prior to the Closing Date, including providing Cobra Coverage
from and after the Closing Date for Former Acquired Company Employees, Former
Business Employees and their respective beneficiaries and dependents.
Purchaser shall, or shall cause one or more of its Designated Affiliates to,
be responsible for, and shall assume all Liability and indemnify and hold
Seller, its Subsidiaries and Affiliates harmless with respect to (x) all
medical, life insurance and other welfare plan expenses and benefits for each
Acquired  



 

71  Company or Business Employee with respect to claims incurred by such
employees or their covered dependents on or after the Closing Date, (y)
providing any required notices regarding Cobra Coverage for all Transferred
Employees and their beneficiaries and dependents with respect to qualifying
events that occur on or after the Closing Date, and (z) providing Cobra
Coverage from and after the Closing Date for Transferred Employees and their
beneficiaries and dependents, regardless of whether the applicable qualifying
event occurred or occurs before, on or after the Closing Date, to the extent
such coverage was being provided under the Seller Employee Benefit Plans. For
purposes of this paragraph, a claim is deemed incurred when the services that
are the subject of the claim are performed; in the case of life insurance,
when the death occurs and, in the case of a hospital stay, when the employee
first enters the hospital. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Section 10.1(c)(ii)(A), Liabilities in respect of Retiree Medical Benefits and
long term disability shall be treated in accordance with the provisions of
Sections 10.1(c)(ii)(B) and 10.1(c)(ii)(C), respectively.



(B) Following the Closing Date, Purchaser or one or more of its Designated
Affiliates that employs the Transferred Represented Employees (as defined
below) shall assume all liabilities, obligations and responsibilities to
provide post-retirement medical, health and life insurance benefits ("
_Retiree Medical Benefits_ ") for Transferred Employees who are Represented
Employees (the " _Transferred Represented Employees_ ") pursuant to the terms
of any Retiree Medical Plan. Seller shall retain all liabilities, obligations
and responsibilities to provide Retiree Medical Benefits to all employees
other than Transferred Represented Employees.



(C) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, any individual who
has, as of the Closing, met the conditions to receive long-term disability
benefits under Seller Employee Benefit Plan that is a long-term disability
plan of Seller and its Subsidiaries as of Closing shall receive such benefits
under such Seller Employee Benefit Plan in accordance with its terms after
Closing, and neither Purchaser nor any of its Designated Affiliates nor any
Acquired Company shall assume any Liabilities for providing such benefits to
such individuals, provided, that any such individual does not return to
service within twelve (12) months of the Closing Date and (ii) any Transferred
Employee who is in a long-term disability waiting period prior to the Closing
Date (including a Transferred Employee receiving short-term disability from
the Purchaser or one or more of its Designated Affiliates after the Closing
Date for injuries or illnesses occurring prior to the Closing Date) and
becomes "Disabled" (as defined under Sellers long-term disability plan)
after the Closing Date as a result of such injuries or illnesses, shall be
entitled to benefits under Sellers long-term disability plan, provided, that
such employee does not return to service.



(D) As of the Closing Date, (i) Sellers flexible spending account plan ("
_Seller s Flex Plan_") shall transfer and a plan under Section 125 of the
Code established or maintained by Purchaser or one or more of its Designated
Affiliates (" _Purchaser s Flex Plan_") shall accept the transfer of all of
the account balances (whether positive or negative) (the " _Transferred
Account Balances_ ") under Sellers Flex Plan of the Transferred Employees,
(ii) the elections, contribution levels and coverage levels of the
Transferred Employees shall apply under Purchasers Flex Plan in the same
manner as under Sellers Flex Plan; and (iii) the Transferred Employees shall
be reimbursed from Purchasers Flex Plan for claims incurred at any time
during the plan year of Sellers Flex Plan in which the Closing Date occurs
submitted to  



 

72  Purchasers Flex Plan from and after the Closing Date on the same basis and
the same terms and conditions as under Sellers Flex Plan. As soon
as practicable after the Closing Date, and in any event within 10 Business
Days after the amount of the Transferred Account Balances is determined,
Seller shall pay Purchaser or one or more of its Designated Affiliates the net
aggregate amount of the Transferred Account Balances, if such amount is
positive, and Purchaser shall, or shall cause one or more of its Designated
Affiliates to, pay Seller the net aggregate amount of the Transferred Account
Balances, if such amount is negative. 



(iii) _Savings Plans_. (A) Transferred Employees shall not be entitled to
make contributions to or to benefit from matching or other contributions under
the Seller Savings Plans on and after the Closing Date.



(B) Purchaser shall, or shall cause one or more of its Designated Affiliates
to, take all action necessary and appropriate to ensure that, as soon
as practicable after the Closing Date and effective as of the Closing Date,
Purchaser or one or more of its Designated Affiliates (including the Acquired
Companies) has in effect one or more savings plans (hereinafter referred to in
the aggregate as the " _Purchaser Savings Plans_ " and individually as the "
_Purchaser Savings Plan_ ") meeting the following requirements: (I) each
Purchaser Savings Plan is a qualified, single-employer individual
account plan under Section 401(a) of the Code; (II) each Transferred Employee
is eligible to participate in a Purchaser Savings Plan that permits him or her
to make before-tax contributions (under Section 401(k) of the Code) and to
take participant loans on a basis at least as favorable as under the
applicable Seller Savings Plan; and (III) each Purchaser Savings Plan in which
Represented Employees are eligible to participate satisfies any applicable
requirements of the relevant Collective Bargaining Agreement(s).



(C) The terms of the Purchaser Savings Plans, or each such Purchaser Savings
Plan, shall provide that each Transferred Employee shall have the right to
make a direct rollover to a Purchaser Savings Plan of his or her account in a
Seller Savings Plan, including a direct rollover of any notes evidencing
loans made to such Transferred Employee; _provided_ that each Transferred
Employee who elects to roll over an account in a Seller Savings Plan must roll
over his or her entire account balance (including a rollover of any
notes evidencing loans made to such Transferred Employee).



(D) As soon as practicable after the Closing Date, Seller shall deliver to
Purchaser or one or more of its Designated Affiliates a list of the
Transferred Employees covered by the Seller Savings Plans, together with each
Transferred Employees service under each of the Seller Savings Plans as of
the Closing Date.



(iv) _Annual Bonus_. Each Transferred Employee who is eligible for an annual
bonus under any of the Employee Benefit Plans for the year in which the

(y) the applicable date of payment), and pro-rated through the Closing Date.
Seller shall pay or cause to be paid such bonuses that are payable to
Corporate Business Employees. Purchaser shall, or shall cause one or more of
its Designated Affiliates to, pay or cause to be paid such bonuses to all
other Transferred Employees; provided, that in no event shall the aggregate
amount of the bonuses so paid by Purchaser or one or more of its Designated
Affiliates be greater than the amount accrued for such bonuses on the Final
Closing Date Working Capital.



 

73 (v) _Vacation_. To the extent applicable Law requires the payment in cash of
the vacation entitlements that Transferred Employees have, under the
applicable policies of Seller and the Acquired Companies, accrued but not used
through Closing (" _Accrued Vacation_ "), Purchaser shall, or shall cause one
or more of its Designated Affiliates to, pay or cause to be paid such amounts
to Transferred Employees at or promptly following Closing. Purchaser shall
permit Transferred Employees to carry over, and to use after Closing, all
other Accrued Vacation in accordance with the applicable policies of Seller
and the Acquired Companies as in effect as of the Closing Date, subject to the
requirements of any applicable Collective Bargaining Agreement and to such
reasonable limitations and conditions as Purchaser may impose. In no event
shall Purchaser or one or more of its Designated Affiliates be liable for
payments or accruals with respect to Accrued Vacation which exceeds the amount
accrued for Accrued Vacation on the Final Closing Date Working Capital. 



(vi) _Workers  Compensation_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, Purchaser and its Designated Affiliates shall be solely responsible
(including where Seller remains primarily liable as a matter of law) for
claims for workers compensation that are incurred with respect to
any Business Employee or Acquired Company Employee or any Former Acquired
Company Employee or Former Business Employee prior to, on or after the Closing
Date.



(vii) _Defined Benefit Pension Plans_. (A) Purchaser shall, or shall cause one
or more of its Designated Affiliates to, establish a defined benefit pension
plan (" _Purchaser s Bargained Pension Plan_") for Transferred Represented
Employees who are participants in the MeadWestvaco Corporation Retirement Plan
for Bargained Hourly Employees (" _Seller s Bargained Pension Plan_")
effective as of the Closing Date.



(B) Subject to Section 10.1(c)(vii)(E), as soon as practicable following the
Closing Date, Seller will direct that the trustee of Sellers Bargained
Pension Plan transfer to the Purchasers Bargained Pension Plan an amount
(the " _Pension Transfer Amount_ ") in cash or readily marketable securities
(to the extent determined by the fiduciaries of Sellers Bargained Pension
Plan; provided, that such fiduciaries shall inform and discuss with the
trustee of Purchasers Bargained Pension Plan as to the nature of any non-cash
amounts to be transferred prior to such transfer; it being understood that the
final mix of cash or readily marketable securities to be transferred shall be
determined by the fiduciaries of Sellers Bargained Pension Plan in their sole
discretion), calculated in accordance with the following formula:



 

W = X minus Y



     |  |  |  | 
---|---|---|---|--- 
    |  |  |  | where: 
  W |  | = |  | the amount to be transferred to Purchasers Bargained
Pension Plan under this clause 10.1(c)(vii)(B); 
  X |  | = |  | the assets in Sellers Bargained Pension Plan with a
value equal to the amount required to be transferred under Section 414(l) of
the Code (using ERISA Section 
 



 

74 ---|---|---|---|--- 
    |  |  |  | 4044 safe harbor assumptions and where an assumption
is not defined under Section 4044 relying on the assumptions used in Sellers
most recent actuarial valuation prior to the date of this Agreement
calculated by or on behalf of Seller in accordance with FAS 87 prior to the
date of this Agreement) as of the first Business Day after the Closing Date
(the " _Measurement Date_ "); and 
   |  | 
  Y |  | = |  | any benefits paid by Sellers Bargained Pension Plan
to or in respect of the Transferred Represented Employees after the Closing
Date and prior to the date of such transfer under this Section 10.1
(c)(vii)(B). 
 



(C) All determinations of the amount of assets of Sellers Bargained Pension
Plan to be transferred under Section 10.1(c)(vii)(B) will be made by the
actuary for Sellers Bargained Pension Plan. Purchaser or one or more of its
Designated Affiliates may retain its designated actuary to perform the
determinations under Section 10.1(c)(vii)(B). The actuary for Sellers
Bargained Pension Plan shall provide all information to the actuary for
Purchasers Bargained Pension Plan as such actuary, acting reasonably and in
good faith, determines is reasonably necessary to perform the transfer
calculation. If there is a dispute between those actuaries, then Seller and
Purchaser (or one or more of Purchasers Designated Affiliates) will agree on
a third actuary to resolve the dispute. The independent actuary shall act on
the following bases, as applicable:



     | (i) | the independent actuary shall not act as an arbitrator; 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | Seller and Purchaser shall (or Purchaser shall cause one or
more of its Designated Affiliates to) each provide the independent actuary
with all information relating to the dispute which the independent actuary
reasonably requires; and 
---|---|--- 



     | (iii) | any findings or reports prepared by the independent
actuary will be provided to both Seller and Purchaser (or one or more of its
Designated Affiliates) at the same time.  
---|---|--- 



The decision of the independent actuary will be, in the absence of fraud or
manifest error, final and binding on the parties. Seller and Purchaser shall
each pay one-half of the independent actuarys costs.



(D) In connection with matters addressed in this Section 10.1(c)(vii),
Purchaser and Seller will cooperate in:

 



     | (i) | the filing by Seller of any IRS Forms 5310-A required with
respect to the transfer of assets and liabilities described in this Section
10.1(c)(vii); 
---|---|--- 


     | (ii) | the parties hereto making all other filings required under
the Code or ERISA and any applicable securities laws; 
---|---|--- 


     | (iii) | implementing all appropriate communications with
participants; 
---|---|--- 



     | (iv) | transferring appropriate records; 
---|---|--- 



     | (v) | taking all such other actions as may be necessary and
appropriate to implement the provisions of this Section 10.1(c)(vii) in a
timely manner; and 
---|---|--- 


 

75 actuaries for Sellers Bargained Pension Plan and Purchasers Bargained
Pension Plan to issue the certifications required by Section 6058(b) of the
Code (Form 5310-A). 
---|---|--- 



(E) The transfer referred to in Section 10.1(c)(vii)(B) will not take place
until the " _Transfer Date_ ", which shall be the date that is as soon as
practicable after the latest of:



     | (i) | the expiration of the 30-day period following the filing of
any required notices with the IRS pursuant to Section 6058(b) of the Code; 
---|---|---

to the effect that the Sellers Bargained Pension Plan is qualified under
Section 401(a) of the Code, together with documentation (in a form and
substance satisfactory to Purchaser (or one or more of its Designated
Affiliates) acting reasonably) evidencing the due adoption of any amendments
to the Sellers Bargained Pension Plan required by the IRS as a condition to
such qualification and a certificate from Seller that no events have occurred
that would adversely affect the continued validity of such determination
letters (apart from the enactment of any law for which the remedial amendment
period under Section 401(b) of the Code has not yet expired); or 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | an opinion of Sellers attorneys (in form and substance
satisfactory to Purchaser (or one or more of its Designated Affiliates) acting
reasonably) that the Sellers Bargained Pension Plan is qualified under
Section 401(a) of the Code as of the date of transfer; and 
---|---|--- 



     | (iii) | the date Purchaser (or one or more of its Designated
Affiliates that is the sponsor of Purchasers Bargained Pension Plan) has

Bargained Pension Plan) either:

     | (a) | a copy of the most recent determination letter from the IRS
to the effect that Purchasers Bargained Pension Plan is qualified under
Section 401(a) of the Code, together with documentation (in a form and
substance satisfactory to Seller acting reasonably) evidencing the due
adoption of any amendments to Purchasers Bargained Pension Plan required by
the IRS as a condition to such qualification and a certificate from Purchaser
(or one or more of its Designated Affiliates that is the sponsor of
Purchasers Bargained Pension Plan) that no events have occurred that would

401(b) of the Code has not yet expired); or 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | an opinion of Purchasers attorneys (or of the attorneys for
one or more of Purchasers Designated Affiliates that is the sponsor of
Purchasers Bargained Pension Plan) (in form and substance satisfactory to
Seller acting reasonably) that Purchasers Bargained Pension Plan is qualified
under Section 401(a) of the Code as of the date of transfer. 
---|---|--- 


 

76 The parties agree to pursue the receipt of the items described in this Section
10.1(c)(vii)(E) as soon as reasonably practicable following the Closing Date.
If Purchasers Bargained Pension Plan is newly created, Purchaser will (or
will cause one or more of its Designated Affiliates that is the sponsor of
Purchasers Bargained Pension Plan to) provide Seller with written evidence
(in form and substance satisfactory to Seller acting reasonably) of: (x) the
adoption of Purchasers Bargained Pension Plan; and (y) the creation of the
trust under Purchasers Bargained Pension Plan. 



(F) With respect to Transferred Employees who are Non-Represented Employees,
Seller shall fully vest, as of the Closing Date, the accrued benefit of such
employees under the MeadWestvaco Corporation Retirement Plan for Salaried and
Non-Bargained Hourly Employees based on their service with the Seller or any
of its Subsidiaries prior to the Closing Date.



(d) _General_. (i) _Seller s Retained Liabilities_. Except as specifically
provided in this Section 10.1, Seller shall remain solely responsible for any
and all Liabilities and obligations arising under, in connection with or in
respect of the Seller Employee Benefit Plans, and neither Purchaser nor any
Designated Affiliate (including, after the Closing Date, the Acquired
Companies) shall have any responsibility or obligation in respect of any such
plan, including, but not limited to, any severance pursuant to the terms of
the MeadWestvaco Corporation Severance Pay Plan for Salaried and Non-Union
Hourly Employees. Except with respect to Sections 10.1(c)(ii)(D), 10.1(c)(iii)
and 10.1(c)(vii), no assets held in trust for any Seller Employee Benefit
Plan will be transferred to Purchaser or one or more of its Designated
Affiliates or to any employee benefit plan adopted or maintained by Purchaser
or any of its Subsidiaries.



(ii) _Purchaser s Assumed Liabilities_. Effective as of the Closing Date,
and except as specifically provided in this Section 10.1, Purchaser shall (and
shall cause its Designated Affiliates, including, as of the Closing Date, the
Acquired Companies to) be solely responsible for any and all Liabilities
and obligations arising under, in connection with or in respect of the
Acquired Company Plans and neither Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries (other
than the Acquired Companies) shall have any responsibility or obligation in
respect of any such plan. Without limiting the generality of Section 1.4, and
except as specifically provided in this Section 10.1, Purchaser shall (and
shall cause its Designated Affiliates, including the Acquired Companies to) be
solely responsible for any Liabilities arising out of the employment of any
Transferred Employee before, on or after the Closing Date, including without
limitation accrued obligations for salaries, wages and other compensation
payable after the Closing Date, personal days and floating holidays and sick
pay of the Transferred Employees, and Liabilities relating to, arising out of
or resulting from any Collective Bargaining Agreement, and including,
effective upon the transfer of assets under Section 10.1(c)(vii) above,
all liabilities for benefits under the Sellers Bargained Pension Plan with
respect to Transferred Represented Employees.



(e) _WARN_. Seller retains sole responsibility for any obligations or
liabilities to any Former Acquired Company Employees, Former
Business Employees, Acquired Company  



 

77  Employees and Business Employees under WARN and any other state, local or
provincial law regarding notice of employment termination in respect of
the termination of employment of any such employees effective prior to the
Closing Date, and indemnifies and agrees to hold Purchaser, its Designated
Affiliates and Affiliates harmless for same. Purchaser assumes (or shall cause
one or more of its Designated Affiliates to assume) sole responsibility for
any obligations or liabilities to any Transferred Employees under WARN and any
other state, local or provincial law regarding notice of employment
termination in respect of the termination of employment of any Transferred
Employee effective on or following the Closing Date. Any indemnification
pursuant to this Section 10.1(e) shall cover, but shall not be limited to, any
claim for back pay, front pay, notice pay, benefits, or compensatory or
punitive damages, any claim by any Governmental Body for penalties regarding
any issue of prior notification (or any lack thereof) of any plant closing or
mass layoff, as well as defense costs, including attorneys fees,
in defending any such claim.



(f) _Actions of Purchaser_. Until the Closing Date, except as required by
applicable Law or permitted by the terms of this Agreement, Purchaser will
not, and will cause its Designated Affiliates and Affiliates and its and their
representatives not to, take any intentional action to cause or influence any
Acquired Company Employee(s) or Business Employee(s) to take any actions (or
fail to take actions) to adversely affect the Business, the financial
condition of the Business, or the results of operations of the Business.



Section 10.2. _Cooperation_. After the Closing, Purchaser and Seller (and
their Subsidiaries and Affiliates) will each mutually cooperate in providing
the other party access to and/or copies of relevant data and employment
records of Transferred Employees (including personnel files,
workers compensation claim files and other employee books and records
pertaining to Transferred Employees) to the extent (a) permitted by applicable
law and (b) reasonably necessary to administer the benefits of Acquired
Company Employees and Business Employees under any Seller Employee Benefit
Plan or any New Plan, as applicable, or otherwise concerning the employment
relationship of Transferred Employees.



 

Section 10.3. _Transition Agreements_. Effective at the Closing, Purchaser and
Seller, or such of their respective Subsidiaries as appropriate, shall enter
into agreements substantially in the form of Exhibits H, I, J, K, L and M,
each as listed on _Schedule 10.3_ (collectively, the " _Transition Agreements_
"). The Parties agree that to the extent any Transition Agreement explicitly
provides that the Parties shall agree prior to the Closing on a specific
matter described in such agreement, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith
to reach a reasonable resolution with respect to such specified matter
in accordance with the guidelines, if any, specified with respect to such
matter in such agreement.



Section 10.4. _Further Assurances; Further Conveyances and Assumptions;
Consent of Third Parties_. (a) From time to time following the
Closing, Seller and Purchaser shall, and shall cause their respective
Subsidiaries or Designated Affiliates to, execute, acknowledge and deliver all
such further conveyances, notices, assumptions, releases and acquittances and
such other instruments, and shall take such further actions, as may be
necessary or appropriate to assure fully to Purchaser and its respective
successors or assigns, all of the properties, rights, titles, interests,
estates, remedies, powers and privileges intended to be conveyed to
Purchaser, and the retention or assumption of the Liabilities intended to be
retained  



 

78  or assumed by Seller and/or its Subsidiaries, under this Agreement and the
Transition Agreements and to assure fully to Seller and its Subsidiaries and
their successors and assigns, the assumption of the Liabilities intended to
be assumed by Purchaser under this Agreement and the Transition Agreements,
and to otherwise make effective the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby (including (i) transferring back to Seller or the applicable
Subsidiary any asset or Liability not contemplated by this Agreement to be a
Purchased Asset or an Assumed Liability, respectively, which asset or
Liability was transferred to Purchaser at the Closing, (ii) transferring back
to Seller any asset or Liability of the Acquired Companies not related to the
Business and (iii) transferring to Purchaser any asset or Liability
contemplated by this Agreement to be a Purchased Asset or an Assumed
Liability, respectively, which was not transferred to Purchaser at the
Closing).



(b) Nothing in this Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be construed as an attempt or agreement to assign
any Purchased Asset, including any Contract, Permit, certificate, approval,
authorization or other right, which by its terms or by Law is nonassignable
without the consent of a third party or a Governmental Body or is cancelable
by a third party in the event of an assignment (" _Nonassignable Assets_ ")
unless and until such consent shall have been obtained. Seller shall, and
shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use reasonable best efforts to obtain such
consents promptly; _provided_ , _however_ , that, such cooperation shall not
require Seller or any of its Subsidiaries to remain secondarily liable or to
make any payment to obtain any such consent with respect to any Nonassignable
Asset, except to the extent provided in Section 6.13(b).



(c) Purchaser and Seller shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to
obtain, or to cause to be obtained, any consent, substitution, approval or
amendment required to novate all obligations under any and all Contracts or
other Liabilities that constitute Assumed Liabilities or to obtain in writing
the unconditional release of Seller and its Subsidiaries so that, in any such
case, Purchaser and its Subsidiaries shall be solely responsible for such
Liabilities. To the extent permitted by applicable Law, in the event consents
to the assignment thereof cannot be obtained, such Nonassignable Assets
shall be held, as of and from the Closing Date, by Seller or the applicable
Subsidiaries of Seller in trust for Purchaser and the covenants and
obligations thereunder shall be performed by Purchaser in Sellers or such
Subsidiaries name and all benefits and obligations existing thereunder shall
be for Purchasers account. Seller shall take or cause to be taken at
Purchasers expense such actions in its name or otherwise as Purchaser may
reasonably request so as to provide Purchaser with the benefits of the
Nonassignable Assets and to effect collection of money or other consideration
that becomes due and payable under the Nonassignable Assets, and Seller or the
applicable Subsidiaries of Seller shall promptly pay over to Purchaser all
money or other consideration received by it in respect of all Nonassignable
Assets.



(d) As of and from the Closing Date, Seller on behalf of itself and its
Subsidiaries authorizes Purchaser, to the extent permitted by applicable Law
and the terms of the Nonassignable Assets, at Purchasers expense, to perform
all the obligations and receive all the benefits of Seller or its Subsidiaries
under the Nonassignable Assets and appoints Purchaser its attorney-in-fact to
act in its name on its behalf or in the name of the applicable Subsidiary of
Seller and on such Subsidiarys behalf with respect thereto.



 

79 (e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, unless and
until any consent or approval with respect to any Nonassignable Asset is
obtained, such Nonassignable Asset shall not constitute a Purchased Asset and
any associated Liability shall not constitute an Assumed Liability for any
purpose under this Agreement.



Section 10.5. _Historical Off-Site Environmental Liabilities Limitations_.
Purchaser agrees that, with regard to Historical Off-Site Environmental
Liabilities, neither Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates shall undertake any
non-subsurface sampling or analysis, subsurface investigation, or any
communication with any Governmental Body by or on behalf of Purchaser or its
Affiliates after the Closing Date unless such sampling, analysis,
investigation, or communication is (1) required by any Environmental Law; (2)
in response to a request of a Governmental Body; or (3) during the normal
course of business arising out of repairs, modifications, maintenance or
construction activities that are conducted consistent with normal industrial
practices (provided, however, any such sampling or analysis, subsurface
investigation, or communication with a Governmental Body shall not be
considered "required by Environmental Law" if such sampling, analysis,
investigation or communication occurs as a result of: (a) a Change at a
Business Facility; or (b) due diligence conducted by a future purchaser or
financing source). Subject to the limitations set forth in Section 11.1(d),
Seller shall have the right to recover for Losses from Purchaser for a breach
of this provision, notwithstanding the status of Historical Off-Site
Environmental Liabilities as Excluded Liabilities, if and solely to the extent
that the action taken constituting the breach of this provision was taken by
an employee of the Purchaser or its Designated Affiliates who, at the time of
such action, was (i) a managerial employee, (ii) a person whose principal
responsibility is environmental compliance, (iii) an officer of Purchaser or
its Designated Affiliates, or (iv) any person acting at the request, or with
the authorization, of any of the foregoing. In the event of a sale of the
Business or change in control involving the Business, the foregoing limitation
shall apply to a comparable employee or agent of any successor entity or its
Affiliates. For the avoidance of doubt, Sellers right to pursue a contractual
claim to recover any Losses from Purchaser caused by a breach of this
provision by Purchaser shall in no way affect Sellers and Purchasers rights
or obligations under Article XI with respect to Historical Off-Site
Environmental Liabilities, and any amount paid by Purchaser as damages
resulting from such a breach shall not be considered a Loss that is subject to
indemnification by Seller under Section 11.2.



Section 10.6. _Environmental Reports_. Seller agrees to transfer with the
Business all material environmental reports, studies, investigations and
correspondence regarding Environmental Liabilities of the Business in the
possession of the Seller, or its counsel and environmental consultants on the
Closing Date or, on request, within a reasonable period thereafter.

Sections 4.9, 4.10 and 4.11 with respect to title to the Owned Real Property,

with respect to such properties for which Purchaser has obtained a Title
Policy pursuant to Section 6.10 hereof and has received any Purchase Price
Credit to which Purchaser may be entitled pursuant to Section 6.12, and
neither Purchaser nor Seller nor their respective Subsidiaries shall have any
Liability whatsoever with respect to such representations or warranties

under the appropriate provisions of this Article XI). For purposes of clarity,
the obligations of Seller to indemnify the Purchaser Indemnified Group for
Excluded Assets, Historical Off-Site Environmental Liabilities and Excluded
Liabilities shall be without limitation as to duration; _provided_ , _however_
, that Sellers obligation to indemnify the Purchaser Indemnified Group for

to claims properly asserted under Section 11.4 prior to such date) at the
close of business on the date that is eight years after the Closing Date, and
neither Seller nor its Subsidiaries shall have any Liability whatsoever under
Sections 11.2(a)(v) and 11.4 after that date; _provided_ , _further_ , that
Sellers responsibility of its allocated share of Straddle Environmental

as to claims properly asserted under Section 11.5 prior to such date) at the
close of business on the date that is eight years after the Closing Date, and
neither Seller nor its Subsidiaries shall have any Liability whatsoever under
Sections 11.2(a)(vii) and 11.5 after that date. The covenants and agreements
of the parties hereto contained herein, in any Seller Document and in any
Purchaser Document (A) that contemplate actions to be taken after Closing
shall survive the Closing and continue in effect in accordance with their
terms and (B) that contemplate actions to be taken only on or prior to Closing
shall terminate and cease to be obligations as of the Closing and no claim,
action or proceeding with respect to such covenant or agreement may be
brought after the Closing except with respect to breaches of such covenant or
agreement occurring on or prior to Closing.



(b) Except as specifically set forth in this Agreement, effective as of the
Closing, in the absence of fraud or willful misconduct on the part of either
Seller or any of its Representatives in connection with the negotiation,
execution or delivery of this Agreement or any of the Seller or Purchaser
Documents or any schedule, certificate or other document delivered pursuant
hereto or thereto or in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby
(to the extent determined by a final judgment by a court of competent
jurisdiction), Purchaser (on  



 

81  behalf of itself and its Affiliates) waives any rights and claims it may
have against either Seller or any of its Affiliates and their respective
directors, officers, employees, Affiliates, controlling persons or
Representatives, whether in law or in equity, relating to the transactions
contemplated hereby, the Business or the assets thereof. The rights and claims
waived pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence include, without
limitation, claims for contribution or other rights of recovery arising out of
or relating to any Environmental Laws, claims for breach of contract, breach
of representation or warranty, negligent misrepresentation and all other
claims for breach of duty. After the Closing, subject to the foregoing, this
Article XI will provide the exclusive remedy of the Purchaser and its
Affiliates, and their respective successors and assigns for any breach of any
representation or warranty or other claim arising out of this Agreement or any
of the Ancillary Agreements or any schedule, certificate or other document
delivered pursuant hereto or thereto or in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby; _provided_ , _however_ , the foregoing shall not limit
the right of either party hereto to seek specific enforcement for a breach of
such covenants or agreements. Each Person entitled to indemnification
hereunder shall use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate Losses for
which it seeks indemnification hereunder.



(c) In calculating any amount of Losses recoverable pursuant to this Section
11.1, the amount of such Losses shall be reduced by (i) any
insurance proceeds actually received from any unaffiliated insurance carrier
offsetting the amount of such Loss, net of any expenses incurred by the
Indemnified Party in obtaining such insurance proceeds ( _provided_ that the
Indemnified Party shall be obligated to reasonably seek any such proceeds to
which it may be entitled) and (ii) any recoveries from third parties pursuant
to indemnification (or otherwise) with respect thereto, net of any expenses
incurred by the Indemnified Party in obtaining such third party payment. If
any Losses for which indemnification is provided hereunder are subsequently
reduced by any insurance payment or other recovery from a third party, the
Indemnified Party shall promptly remit the amount of such reduction to the
Indemnifying Party.



(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no party shall be liable
to any Indemnified Party for special, incidental or consequential damages that
are not reasonably foreseeable by the Indemnifying Party nor for any punitive
or exemplary Losses.

 



(e) Anything in Article XI to the contrary notwithstanding, indemnification
for any and all Tax matters and the procedures with respect thereto shall be
governed exclusively by Article XIV, and the limitations set forth in the
final paragraphs of Sections 11.2(a) and (b) shall not be applicable with
respect to Tax matters.



Section 11.2. _Indemnification_. (a) Seller hereby agrees to indemnify and
hold the Purchaser Indemnified Group harmless from and against any and all
claims, judgments, causes of action, liabilities, obligations, damages,
losses, deficiencies, costs, penalties, interest and expenses (including the

out of or resulting from:

contained in such representations and warranties, and in the case of
the representations contained in Section 4.11(e) and in clause (A) of Section
4.11(m), disregarding the Knowledge qualifications therein), _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in the case of the representations contained in Section 4.19
(Environmental Matters) all indemnity obligations of the Seller will be
governed exclusively by Sections 11.2(a)(v), 11.2(a)(vi), 11.2(a)(vii),
11.2(a)(viii), 11.4, 11.5, and 11.6, unless Purchaser establishes actual fraud
on the part of the Seller in connection with the negotiation and execution of
this Agreement (after taking into account the Material Adverse Effect and
Knowledge qualifications contained in Section 4.19);

     | (ii) | any breach or non-fulfillment of any covenant, agreement or
undertaking on the part of Seller herein or in any Seller Document;

---|---|--- 



     | (v) | Historical On-Site Environmental Liabilities in excess of
any amounts designated to cover Historical On-Site Environmental Liabilities
specifically identified and reserved for in the balance sheet, reserves,

_Schedule 11.2(a)(v)_ , in accordance with and subject to the limitations and
procedures set out below and in Section 11.4; 
---|---|--- 



     | (vi) | Historical Off-Site Environmental Liabilities in accordance
with and subject to the procedures set out below and in Section 11.4;

     | (vii) | Sellers share of Losses arising from Straddle

accordance with and subject to the limitations and procedures set out below
and in Section 11.5 and in excess of any amounts designated to cover Straddle
Environmental Liabilities identified and reserved for in the balance sheet,
reserves, capital expenditure budgets, accruals, transferred
financial assurance instruments, working capital statements or operating
budgets of the Business disclosed to Purchaser prior to Closing as set forth
on _Schedule 11.2(a)(vii)_ (" _Straddle Environmental Liability Reserves_ ");
and  
---|---|--- 



     | (viii) | Sellers responsibility Losses set forth in _Schedule
11.2(a)(viii)_. 
---|---|--- 



 

83 Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, (1) Seller shall
not be liable for any Losses with respect to the matters set forth in Section
11.2(a)(i), unless (x) a claim is timely asserted during the survival period
specified in Section 11.1(a) and (y) the aggregate of all Losses under Section
11.2(a)(i), exceeds, on a cumulative basis, 1% of the Initial Cash
Consideration (and then only to the extent of such excess); (2) Seller shall
not be liable for any Losses with respect to the matters set forth in Sections
11.2(a)(v) and 11.2(a)(vii) unless (x) a claim is timely asserted during the
applicable survival period specified in Section 11.1(a) and (y) the aggregate
of all indemnifiable Losses under Section 11.2(a)(v) and Sellers allocated
portion of indemnifiable Losses under Section 11.2(a)(vii) exceeds, on
a cumulative basis, 1% of the Initial Cash Consideration (and then only to
the extent of such excess), and (3) Seller shall not be required to pay an
aggregate amount in excess of 15% of the Initial Cash Consideration in respect
of all Losses for the matters set forth in Sections 11.2(a)(i), 11.2(a)(v)
and 11.2(a)(vii). _For the avoidance of doubt_ , (1) Seller shall not be
liable for any Losses under Section 11.2(a) arising out of any breach of the
representations contained in Section 4.19 (Environmental Matters) other than
exclusively in the manner provided for in the proviso to Section 11.2(a)(i),
and (2) the limitations in this paragraph do not apply to clauses (ii), (iii),
(iv), (vi) or (viii) of Section 11.2(a).

limitations set forth in Section 11.4) and 11.2(a)(vii) (subject to the
limitations set forth in Section 11.5) for any Losses resulting from changes
in any Environmental Law occurring after the Closing Date, provided that any
Remedial Action of Straddle Environmental Liabilities or Historical On-Site
Environmental Liabilities may be governed by applicable post-Closing
requirements for conducting Remedial Actions, so long as any Remedial Action
is conducted in a Lowest-Cost Commercially Reasonable Manner.



(b) Purchaser hereby agrees to indemnify and hold the Seller Indemnified Group
harmless from and against any and all Losses arising out of or
resulting from:



     | (i) | any inaccuracy of any representation or any breach of
warranty on the part of Purchaser herein or in any Purchaser Document or any
schedule or certificate which is delivered pursuant thereto (disregarding
Material Adverse Effect and materiality qualifications contained in such
representations and warranties); 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | any breach or non-fulfillment of any covenant, agreement or
undertaking on the part of Purchaser herein or in any Purchaser Document,
subject to the limitations and conditions contained therein;

Affiliates is not able to assume in place of Seller or its Subsidiaries

Business, the Acquired Companies or the Purchased Assets   

---|---|--- 



 

84  from and after the Closing Date (excluding Excluded Liabilities or
Liabilities for which Seller has agreed to indemnify Purchaser hereunder);  

---|--- 



     | (v) | any Assumed Liabilities or the failure of any of the
Acquired Companies (or their successors or assigns) to pay, perform and
discharge when due any of their respective Liabilities except to the extent
that the existence of such Liabilities constitutes a breach of any Seller
representation or warranty or results from a breach of any of Sellers
covenants under this Agreement or any Seller Document;  
---|---|--- 



     | (vi) | Reserved Pre-Closing Environmental Liabilities; 
---|---|--- 



     | (vii) | Post-Closing Environmental Liabilities;

     | (viii) | Purchasers responsibility for Losses arising from
Straddle Environmental Liabilities allocated to Purchaser pursuant to Section
11.5; 
---|---|--- 


     | (ix) | any failure to satisfy Purchasers responsibilities as set
forth in _Schedule 11.2(a)(viii)_. 
---|---|--- 



Purchaser shall not be liable for any Losses with respect to the matters set
forth in Section 11.2(b)(i) unless (x) a claim is timely asserted during the
survival period specified in Section 11.1(a) and (y) the aggregate of all
Losses under Section 11.2(b)(i) exceeds, on a cumulative basis, 1% of the
Initial Cash Consideration (and then only to the extent of such excess);
_provided_ , _however_ , notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
Purchaser shall not be required to pay an aggregate amount in excess of 15% of
the Initial Cash Consideration in respect of Losses for the matters set
forth in Section 11.2(b)(i). For the avoidance of doubt, the limitations in
this paragraph do not apply to clauses (ii), (iii), (iv), (v), (vi), (vii),
(viii) or (ix) of Section 11.2(b).



Section 11.3. _Procedures for Indemnification_. Subject to the following
sentence, whenever a claim shall arise for indemnification under this Article
XI (other than claims arising under (1) Sections 11.2(a)(v) and 11.2(a)(vi),
which are governed by the limitations and procedures set out in Section 11.4,
(2) Sections 11.2(a)(vii) and (b)(viii), which are governed by the
limitations and procedures set out in Section 11.5, (3) Sections 11.2(b)(vi)
and (vii), which are governed by the limitations and procedures set out in
Section 11.6, and (4) Section 11.2(a)(viii) and 11.2(b)(ix), which is governed
by the limitations and procedures set out in _Schedule 11.2(a)(viii)_ ), the
party entitled to indemnification (the " _Indemnified Party_ ") shall promptly
notify the party from which indemnification is sought (the " _Indemnifying
Party_ ") of such claim and, when known, the facts constituting the basis for
such claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the event of any claim for
indemnification hereunder resulting from or in connection with any claim or
Legal Proceeding by a third party, the Indemnified Party shall give such
notice thereof to the Indemnifying Party not later than ten Business Days
prior to the time any response to the asserted claim is required,
if possible, and in any event within five Business Days  



 

85  following receipt of notice thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the
case of claims for indemnification hereunder not arising in connection with
any claim or Legal Proceeding by a third party, the Indemnified Party shall
not submit such claims to the Indemnifying Party in increments aggregating
less than $50,000. The Indemnified Partys failure to give timely notice or to
furnish the Indemnifying Party with any relevant facts in connection with any
third party claim shall not constitute a defense (in part or in whole) to any
claim for indemnification by such party, except and only to the extent that
such failure shall result in any material prejudice to the Indemnifying
Party. In the event of any such claim for indemnification resulting from or in
connection with a claim or Legal Proceeding by a third party, the Indemnifying
Party may, at its sole cost and expense, assume the defense thereof by
written notice within 10 Business Days, using counsel that is reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnified Party. If an Indemnifying Party assumes the
defense of any such claim or Legal Proceeding, the Indemnifying Party
shall be entitled to take all steps necessary in the defense thereof
including the settlement of any case that involves solely monetary damages
without the consent of the Indemnified Party; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the Indemnified Party may, at its own expense, participate in any such
proceeding with the counsel of its choice without any right of control
thereof. The Indemnifying Party, if it has assumed the defense of any claim or
Legal Proceeding by a third party as provided herein, shall not consent to,
or enter into, any compromise or settlement of (which settlement (i) commits
the Indemnified Party to take, or to forbear to take, any action or (ii) does
not provide for a full and complete written release by such third party of
the Indemnified Party), or consent to the entry of any judgment that does not
relate solely to monetary damages arising from, any such claim or Legal
Proceeding by a third party without the Indemnified Partys prior written
consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.
The Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall cooperate fully in all
aspects of any investigation, defense, pre-trial activities, trial,
compromise, settlement or discharge of any claim in respect of which
indemnity is sought pursuant to this Article XI, including, but not limited
to, by providing the other party with reasonable access to employees and
officers (including as witnesses) and other information, provided, that
in each case, such access shall be given at reasonable times and upon
reasonable notice and without undue interruption to such partys business or
personnel. So long as the Indemnifying Party is in good faith defending such
claim or proceeding, the Indemnified Party shall not compromise or settle
such claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. If the
Indemnifying Party does not assume the defense of any such claim or
litigation in accordance with the terms hereof, the Indemnified Party may
defend against such claim or litigation in such manner as it may deem
appropriate, including settling such claim or litigation (after giving
prior written notice of the same to the Indemnifying Party and obtaining the
prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) on such terms as the
Indemnified Party may reasonably deem appropriate, and the Indemnifying Party
will promptly indemnify the Indemnified Party in accordance with the
provisions of this Section 11.3.



Section 11.4. _Limitations and Procedures Applicable to Indemnification for
Historical Environmental Liabilities_.



(a) Subject to the terms of this Section 11.4, whenever a claim shall
arise for indemnification under Section 11.2(a)(v) or 11.2(a)(vi), the claim
shall be submitted by the Indemnified Party to the Indemnifying Party in
accordance with the timelines and procedures set out in Section 11.3.



 

86 (b) _Indemnification Procedures Relating to Historical Off-Site Environmental
Liabilities_. In the event that Purchaser submits a claim for indemnification
under Section 11.2(a)(vi) relating to an Historical Off-Site Environmental
Liability, the Seller may, at its sole cost and expense, assume the defense
and/or resolution (including, without limitation, undertaking Remedial
Action) by written notice to Purchaser given within twenty (20) Business Days
of receipt of Purchasers written notice of claim. If Seller assumes the
defense and/or resolution of any Historical Off-Site Environmental Liability,
Seller shall be entitled to take all steps necessary in the defense and/or
resolution thereof. Where Remedial Action is required, Seller agrees to use
commercially reasonable efforts to avoid (i) unreasonable interference with
the operations of any Business Facilities provided there is no Change after
the Closing Date or (ii) unreasonably restricting the ability to use any
Business Facility for the use it was employed on the Closing Date or for
substantially similar uses, without the consent of Purchaser or its
Designated Affiliates, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. Purchaser may, at its own expense, monitor any
proceeding with counsel of its choice without any right of control thereof.
If Seller does not assume the defense and/or resolution of any Environmental
Claim relating to any Historical Off-Site Environmental Liability, then
Purchaser may defend and/or resolve such Environmental Claim in a
commercially reasonable manner, including settling claims or litigation
(after giving prior notice of the same to the Seller and obtaining the prior
written consent of Seller, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed).

 



(c) _Indemnification Provisions Relating to Historical On-Site Environmental
Liabilities_. In the event that Purchaser submits a claim for indemnification
under Section 11.2(a)(v) relating to an Historical On-Site Environmental
Liability, the Seller shall assume the defense and/or resolution
(including without limitation, undertaking Remedial Action) thereof. Seller
shall be entitled to take all steps necessary in the defense and/or resolution
thereof, including the settlement thereof (which settlement shall require the
consent of Purchaser, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed
or conditioned); provided, however, that (i) Purchaser may, at its expense,
monitor any proceeding with counsel of its choice without any right of control
thereof, and (ii) Seller shall consult with Purchaser regarding the defense
and resolution thereof, allowing Purchaser reasonable participation therein.
"Reasonable participation" shall be broadly construed and shall include, by
way of example and not limitation, being given reasonable advanced notice for
conduct of investigations and an opportunity to participate in significant
meetings or communications with any Governmental Body. Seller shall afford
Purchaser or its designees with the opportunity to review draft documents
prepared in connection with such matters and shall reasonably consider
Purchasers comments. Seller shall provide all plans, reports, pleadings and
other documents in draft form to Purchaser in a reasonable time prior to
delivering such documents to a governmental entity or claimant, and Seller
shall reasonably consider Purchasers comments thereon. Where an On-Site
Remedial Action is required, Seller agrees to use commercially reasonable
efforts to avoid (i) unreasonable interference with the operations of any
Business Facilities provided there is no Change after the Closing Date or (ii)
unreasonably restricting the ability to use any Business Facility for the use
it was employed on the Closing Date or for substantially similar uses,
without the consent of Purchaser or its Designated Affiliates, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.



 

87 (d) Seller and Purchaser shall cooperate fully in all aspects of any
investigation, defense, pre-trial activities, trial, compromise, settlement,
discharge or Remedial Action arising in connection with any claim in respect
of which indemnity is sought, including, but not limited to, by providing the
other party with reasonable access to: 1) employees and officers (including
as witnesses); 2) other relevant information; and 3) facilities, provided,
that in each case, such access shall be given at reasonable times and upon
reasonable notice and without undue interruption to such partys business or
personnel. So long as Seller is in good faith defending and/or resolving a
Historical Environmental Liability under this Section, Purchaser shall not
compromise, settle or in any manner interfere with the defense or resolution
of such Historical Environmental Liability. If Seller does not assume the
defense and/or resolution of any such Historical Environmental Liability claim
or litigation in accordance with the terms hereof, Purchaser may defend and/or
resolve such Historical Environmental Liability in a commercially reasonable
manner, including settling claims or litigation (after giving prior written
notice of the same to the Seller and obtaining the prior written consent of
Seller, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed).



(e) In connection with any Remedial Action covered by the indemnities in
Sections 11.2(a)(v) and 11.2 (a)(vi), Seller shall only be required to
undertake or reimburse Losses incurred in the course of Remedial Action
conducted in a " _Lowest-Cost Commercially Reasonable Manner_ ," which shall
mean, the lowest cost methods permitted by applicable Environmental Law
determined from the perspective of a reasonable business person acting without
regard to the availability of indemnification hereunder to achieve compliance
with Environmental Law (taking all relevant circumstances into consideration,
including, without limitation, the lowest-cost method that would minimize
exposure to additional Losses that would be subject to indemnification
hereunder). Such Lowest-Cost Commercially Reasonable Manner shall include,
where appropriate, the use of risk-based remedies, institutional or
engineering controls, or deed restrictions, provided such remedies,
controls, or restrictions do not: (1) unreasonably interfere with the
operations of any Business Facilities provided there is no Change to such
facilities after the Closing Date, or (2) unreasonably restrict the ability to
use any Business Facility for the use it was employed on the Closing Date or
for substantially similar uses, without the consent of Purchaser or its
Designated Affiliates, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. Seller shall have no indemnification obligations
under Section 11.2(a)(v) to the extent Losses result from any Change after the
Closing Date caused by Purchaser or any subsequent owner or operator of the
Business Facilities. For purposes of this Article XI, "Change" means
a material change in the use of a Business Facility after the Closing Date,
provided that a material change in use does not include a cessation in
operations other than a voluntary decommissioning or demolition (or
involuntary decommissioning or demolition that is not required by
Environmental Law) of all or substantially all of a Business Facility or the
operations conducted thereon.



(f) Seller shall have no indemnification obligations under Section 11.2(a)(v)
for Losses arising from any non-subsurface sampling or analysis,
subsurface investigation, or any communication with any Governmental Body by
or on behalf of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates after the Closing Date
unless (and only to the extent) such sampling, analysis,  



 

88  investigation or communication is: (1) required by any Environmental Law;
(2) in response to a request of a Governmental Body; or (3) during the
normal course of business arising out of repairs, modifications, maintenance
or construction activities that are conducted consistent with normal
industrial practices; (provided, however, that any such sampling, analysis,
investigation or communication with a Governmental Body shall not be
considered "required by Environmental Law" for purposes of this Article XI if
such sampling, analysis, investigation or communication occurs as a result of:
1) a Change at a Business Facility; or 2) due diligence conducted by a future
purchaser or financing source.



(g) Seller shall have no indemnification obligations under Section 11.2(a)(v)
to the extent that, as a result of any negligence or willful misconduct of
Purchaser or its Affiliates after the Closing Date, the amount of Losses
subject to indemnification by Seller is exacerbated.



(h) Purchaser or its designees agree to make commercially reasonable efforts
to provide Seller with advance notice of repairs, modifications, maintenance
or construction activities that might cause Losses related to Environmental
Matters listed on _Schedule 4.19_  (to the extent that the location of the
environmental matter is reasonably identified therein) for purposes of
consultation with Seller. The Purchaser and Seller agree that any
communications between the parties during such consultation are made without
prejudice and shall be treated as confidential settlement discussions not to
be used in evidence in any dispute.



Section 11.5. _Procedures for Allocation of Responsibility for Straddle
Environmental Liabilities_



(a) A Party seeking to have responsibility for that Straddle
Environmental Liability allocated pursuant to this Section 11.5 shall
promptly notify the other party in writing of the matter and the facts
constituting the basis for the notifying partys belief that the matter
qualifies as a Straddle Environmental Liability.



(b) For purposes of Section 11.2(a)(vii) and 11.2(b)(viii), responsibility
for Losses arising from Straddle Environmental Liabilities will be allocated
as follows.



     | (i) | Responsibility for Losses that are the subject of a Straddle
Environmental Liability Claim Notice delivered by one party to another on or
before the second anniversary of the Closing Date shall be allocated 70% to
Seller and 30% to Purchaser. 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | Responsibility for Losses that are the subject of a
Straddle Environmental Liability Claim Notice delivered by one party to
another after the second anniversary of the Closing Date and on or before the
third anniversary of the Closing Date shall be allocated 60% to Seller and 40%
to Purchaser. 
---|---|--- 



     | (iii) | Responsibility for Losses that are the subject of a
Straddle Environmental Liability Claim Notice delivered by one party to
another after the third anniversary of the Closing Date and on or before the
sixth anniversary of the Closing Date shall be allocated 50% to Seller and 50%
to Purchaser. 
---|---|--- 



 

89 Straddle Environmental Liability Claim Notice delivered by one party to
another after the sixth anniversary of the Closing Date and on or before the
seventh anniversary of the Closing Date shall be allocated 40% to Seller and
60% to Purchaser. 
---|---|--- 



     | (v) | Responsibility for Losses that are the subject of a Straddle
Environmental Liability Claim Notice delivered by one party to another after
the seventh anniversary of the Closing Date and on or before the eighth
anniversary of the Closing Date shall be allocated 30% to Seller and 70% to
Purchaser. 
---|---|--- 



     | (vi) | Responsibility for any and all Losses arising from Straddle
Environmental Liabilities incurred after the eighth anniversary of the Closing
Date shall reside with Purchaser.  
---|---|--- 



(c) Seller shall have the right to control the defense and/or resolution of
any Straddle Environmental Liabilities covered by the allocation ratios set
out in Sections 11.5(b)(i) and (b)(ii). Purchaser shall have the right to
control the defense and/or resolution of any Straddle
Environmental Liabilities covered by the allocation ratios set out in
Sections 11.5(b)(iii), (b)(iv), (b)(v) and (b)(vi). The party controlling
defense and/or resolution of a Straddle Environmental Liability under either
of the two immediately preceding sentences (the " _Controlling Party_ ")
shall be entitled to take all steps necessary in the defense and/or resolution
thereof including, without limitation, the settlement of any matter without
the consent of the other party (the " _Non-Controlling Party_ ") (so long as
such settlement obtains for the Non-Controlling Party a complete release of
future liability in connection with the subject matter); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Non-Controlling Party may, at its own expense, monitor
any proceeding with the counsel of its choice without any right of control
thereof. If the Controlling Party elects to control the defense and/or
resolution of any Straddle Environmental Liabilities with respect to which it
has such election right, the Controlling Party alone shall control all
Remedial Action or other actions (including without limitation all
communications with Governmental Bodies) undertaken in connection with
the defense or resolution of the Straddle Environmental Liabilities for which
it is responsible; _provided_ _however_ , that any Remedial Action
responsibility for which is allocated under this Section 11.5 shall be
conducted in a Lowest-Cost Commercially Reasonable Manner; _provided further_
, that where any On-Site Remedial Action is required, Seller agrees to use
commercially reasonable efforts to avoid (i) unreasonable interference with
the operations of any Business Facilities provided there is no Change after
the Closing Date or (ii) unreasonably restricting the ability to use any
Business Facility for the use it was employed on the Closing Date or for
substantially similar uses, without the consent of Purchaser or
its Designated Affiliates, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. The Controlling Party shall afford the Non-Controlling
Party or its designees with the opportunity to review draft documents prepared
in connection with such matters and shall reasonably consider such other
partys comments. The Controlling Party shall provide all plans, reports,
pleadings and other documents in draft form to the Non-Controlling Party in a
reasonable time prior to delivering such documents to a governmental entity
or claimant, and the Non-Controlling Party and the Controlling Party shall
each use its reasonable best efforts not to delay the filing or submission of
such documents.



 

90 (d) Seller shall have no obligation under Section 11.2(a)(vii) to contribute
its allocated share of Losses arising from any Straddle Environmental
Liability to the extent such Losses result from: (1) any Change after the
Closing Date caused by Purchaser or any subsequent owner or operator of the
Business Facilities; (2) any Remedial Action not conducted in a Lowest-Cost
Commercially Reasonable Manner; (3) any gross negligence or willful misconduct
of Purchaser or its Affiliates after the Closing Date; or (4) any non-
subsurface sampling or analysis, or any subsurface investigation, or
any communication with any Governmental Body by or on behalf of Purchaser or
any of its Affiliates after the Closing Date related thereto, unless (and only
to the extent) such sampling, analysis, subsurface investigation or
communication is: (X) required by any Environmental Law; (Y) in response to a
request of a Governmental Body; or (Z) during the normal course of business
arising out of repairs, modifications, maintenance or construction activities
that are conducted consistent with normal industrial practices; provided
further that any sampling or analysis, subsurface investigation, or
communication with a Governmental Body shall not be considered "required by
Environmental Law" for purposes of this Article XI if such sampling,
analysis, investigation or communication occurs as a result of: (a) a Change
at a Business Facility; or (b) due diligence conducted by a future purchaser
or financing source.



(e) Purchaser or its designees agree to make commercially reasonable
efforts to provide Seller with advance notice of repairs, modifications,
maintenance or construction activities that might cause Losses related to
Environmental Matters listed on _Schedule 4.19_ for purposes of consultation
with Seller. The Purchaser and Seller agree that any communications between
the parties during such consultation are made without prejudice and shall be
treated as confidential settlement discussions not to be used in evidence in
any dispute.



(f) Seller and Purchaser shall cooperate fully in all aspects of
any investigation, defense, pre-trial activities, trial, compromise,
settlement, discharge or Remedial Action arising in connection with any claim
covered by this Section 11.5. So long as the Controlling Party is in good
faith defending and/or resolving a Straddle Environmental Liability under
this Section, the Non-Controlling Party shall not compromise, settle or in any
manner interfere with the defense or resolution of such Straddle Environmental
Liability. If the Controlling Party does not assume the defense and/or
resolution of any such Straddle Environmental Liability claim or litigation in
accordance with the terms hereof, the Non-Controlling Party may defend and/or
resolve such Straddle Environmental Liability in such manner as it may deem
appropriate, including settling claims or litigation (after giving prior
written notice of the same to the Controlling Party and obtaining the prior
written consent of the Controlling Party, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) on such terms as the Non-
Controlling Party may reasonably deem appropriate, and the Controlling Party
will promptly indemnify the Non-Controlling Party in accordance with the
provisions of this Article XI.



(g) _Schedule 11.5(g)_ includes, without limitation, identified items that
the parties agree meet the definition of "Straddle Environmental Liability."
The inclusion of any matter on _Schedule 11.5(g)_ shall not in any way be
construed as an admission of the existence of any liability with respect to
or breach of a representation or warranty.



 

91 (h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Sections 11.4(f) and 11.5(d),
Purchaser may undertake commercially reasonable non-subsurface sampling or
analysis, and subsurface investigations to the extent necessary to give effect
to the rights granted in Section 6.12 regarding Environmentally Defective
Parcels. Purchaser may communicate to Seller the results of such sampling,
analysis or investigations consistent with the provisions of Section 6.12,
provided, however, Purchaser or any of its Affiliates will not communicate
with any Governmental Body concerning the results of such sampling, analysis,
or investigation unless: (1) required by any Environmental Law or (2) in
response to a request of a Governmental Body (and then only to the extent so
required). This Section 11.5(h) applies only to Timberlands and expires
entirely six months after the Closing Date.



Section 11.6. _Procedures Applicable to Indemnification by Purchaser for Pre-
Closing Reserved Environmental Liabilities and Post-Closing Environmental
Liabilities_



(a) In the event that Seller submits a claim for indemnification under Section
11.2(b)(vi) or (vii), Purchaser may, at its sole cost and expense, assume the
defense and/or resolution (including, without limitation, undertaking Remedial
Action) thereof by written notice to Seller within 20 Business Days of receipt
of Sellers written notice of claim. If Purchaser assumes the defense
and/or resolution of any Reserved Pre-Closing Environmental Liabilities or
Post-Closing Environmental Liability, Purchaser shall be entitled to take all
steps necessary in the defense and/or resolution thereof including, without
limitation, the settlement of any matter without the consent of Seller (so
long as such settlement obtains for Seller a complete release of future
liability in connection with the subject matter); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that Seller may, at its own expense, monitor any proceeding with the counsel
of its choice without any right of control thereof. If Purchaser elects to
assume the defense and/or resolution of any Reserved Pre-Closing Environmental
Liability or Post-Closing Environmental Liability, Purchaser alone shall
control all Remedial Action or other actions (including without limitation all
communications with Governmental Bodies) undertaken pursuant to the indemnity
in Section 11.2(b)(vi) or (b)(viii); provided, however, that such
Remedial Action and other actions shall be conducted in a Lowest-Cost
Commercially Reasonable Manner.



(b) Seller and Purchaser shall cooperate fully in all aspects of any
investigation, defense, pre-trial activities, trial, compromise, settlement,
discharge or Remedial Action arising in connection with any claim in respect
of which indemnity is sought, including, but not limited to, by providing the
other party with reasonable access to: 1) employees and officers (including as
witnesses); 2) other relevant information; and 3) facilities, provided, that
in each case, such access shall be given at reasonable times and upon
reasonable notice and without undue interruption to such partys business or
personnel. So long as Purchaser is in good faith defending and/or resolving a
Reserved Pre-Closing Environmental Liability or Post-Closing Environmental
Liability under this Section, Seller shall not compromise, settle or in any
manner interfere with the defense or resolution of such Reserved Pre-Closing
Environmental Liability or Post-Closing Environmental Liability. If Purchaser
does not assume the defense and/or resolution of any such Reserved Pre-Closing
Environmental Liability or Post-Closing Environmental Liability in accordance
with the terms hereof, Seller may defend and/or resolve such Reserved Pre-
Closing Environmental Liability or Post-Closing Environmental Liability in a
commercially reasonable manner, including settling claims or litigation (after
giving prior written notice of the same to the Purchaser and obtaining the
prior written consent of Purchaser, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed).



 

92 Section 11.7. _Warranties in Deeds._ Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
set forth in this Agreement, (a) the grantor under any Deed shall not be
liable to the grantee pursuant to any warranty set forth in such Deed if the
grantee shall have obtained title insurance with respect to the applicable
real property conveyed pursuant to such Deed, and (b) if the grantee under
such Deed shall not have obtained title insurance with respect to such
transfer, then any liability of the grantor under such Deed with respect to
warranties of title set forth in such Deed shall be subject to and governed
by the terms and conditions of this _Article XI_.

manufacture the paperboard and paperboard packaging products at the Wickliffe
Mill as currently manufactured, or, with respect to the Enhanced Surface
Cover Gradeline - C1S and C2S, as currently under development for
manufacturing, and sell such products so manufactured.



(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 12.1(a):



     | (i) | in the event that during the Covenant Term Seller completes
a business combination transaction with a Person that is engaged in any Seller
Competitive Business, which transaction results in the holders of the voting
securities of Seller outstanding immediately prior to the consummation of such
transaction owning less than 50% of the voting power of the voting securities
of Seller or the surviving entity in the transaction or any parent thereof
(any such entity, an " _Acquiror_ ") outstanding immediately after the
consummation of such transaction, such Acquiror or any of its Subsidiaries or
Affiliates may engage in any activity prohibited or restricted by Section
12.1(a); 
---|---|--- 



 

93 securities of any Person to the extent that such investment does not directly
or indirectly confer on Seller more than 15% of the voting power of such
Person; and Seller does not have any representation on the board of directors
or other managing body of such Person; 
---|---|--- 



     | (iii) | Seller may maintain and continue, and Section 12.1(a)
shall not be understood to restrict in any manner whatsoever, the operations
of Seller and its Subsidiaries that are not being transferred to Purchaser
hereunder in accordance with current and past practices and the normal
expansion thereof, including the production, sale and distribution of all
products and grades currently produced by Seller and its Subsidiaries that
are not included within the Business; 
---|---|--- 



     | (iv) | Seller may acquire interests in or securities of any Person
as an investment by Sellers pension funds or funds of any other benefit plan
of Seller whether or not such Person is engaged in any Seller Competitive
Business; 
---|---|--- 



     | (v) | Seller may acquire interests in or securities of any Person
that derived 25% or less of its total annual revenues in its most recent
fiscal year from activities that constitute Seller Competitive Businesses; 
---|---|--- 



     | (vi) | Subject to Section 12.1(e) hereof, Seller may acquire a
business, assets and/or more than 50% of the outstanding capital stock or
other equity interests in any Person (or any lesser percentage if, pursuant
to contractual or other arrangements, Seller has the right to cause such
Person to take the actions specified in the following proviso) that derived in
excess of 25% of its total annual revenues in its most recent fiscal
year from activities that constitute Seller Competitive Businesses;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to divest that portion of such Person that engages in activities constituting
Seller Competitive Businesses on commercially reasonable terms as soon as
reasonably practicable and in any event within twelve months following the
acquisition of such ownership or interest; 
---|---|--- 



     | (vii) | Seller may acquire or use any product for internal uses or
to conduct Sellers or its Subsidiaries other businesses that consume, use,
contain, depend upon or otherwise incorporate any such product; and 
---|---|--- 



     | (viii) | Seller may perform any act or conduct any business
contemplated hereby or the Transition Agreements. 
---|---|--- 



 

94 (d) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that nothing herein shall be
deemed to require Seller to give notice to or obtain the consent of Purchaser
in order to engage in any activity or transaction of the types described in
Section 12.1(c) or otherwise.



(e) If at any time and from time to time during the Covenant Term, Seller
engages in any acquisition or series of related acquisitions covered
under Section 12.1(c)(vi) hereof (a " _Permitted Competitive Acquisition_ "),
Seller shall notify Purchaser of such Permitted Competitive Acquisition as
promptly as practicable following the consummation of such acquisition. Not
later than the ninetieth (90th) calendar day after the consummation of the
Permitted Competitive Acquisition (or an earlier date, as determined by
Seller), Seller shall provide Purchaser (or its designee) and its counsel,
accountants, debt financing sources and other representatives reasonable
access to the books, records, employees, officers, accountants, attorneys,
representatives and properties of the Seller Competitive Business, for a
period of sixty (60) calendar days from the date such access is first provided
(such period, the " _Due Diligence Period_ "), subject to any then existing
confidentiality restrictions and limitations on access to competitively
sensitive information required for compliance with antitrust Law and to
Purchasers entry into a confidentiality agreement on substantially the same
terms as those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement. Within sixty (60)
days of the commencement of the Due Diligence Period, Purchaser (or its
designee) may, but is not obligated to, make a final comprehensive written
offer (the " _Final Offer_ ") to Seller to acquire the Seller Competitive
Business. In the event that Seller determines that Final Offer is acceptable,
subject to completion of definitive documentation, the Purchaser (or its
designee) and Seller shall engage in good faith negotiations following the
delivery of such Final Offer to reach agreement on the definitive terms of
such transaction. In the event that (a) Seller rejects such Final Offer in
writing, (b) Purchaser (or its designee) fails to make any such Final Offer
within such sixty (60) day period described above or notifies Seller that
Purchaser (or its designee) does not intend to make any such Final Offer, or
(c) Purchaser (or its designee) and Seller are unable to reach agreement on
the definitive terms of such transaction within thirty (30) calendar days
from the receipt of the Final Offer, Seller may engage in discussions
regarding and consummate a divestiture of the Seller Competitive Business;
_provided_ that Seller may not enter into any definitive agreement concerning
or consummate a divestiture of the Seller Competitive Business with any other
third party on terms that are, in the aggregate, less favorable to Seller than
those offered by Purchaser (or its designee), unless Purchaser (or its
designee) has been provided a summary of the material terms of the offer made
by any such third party, and Purchaser has not within a period of ten (10)
calendar days following receipt of such third party offer notified Seller in
writing that it is willing to acquire the Seller Competitive Business on the
terms and conditions contained in such third party offer and within ten (10)
calendar days following such written notification from Purchaser, Seller
and Purchaser enter into definitive agreements on such terms and conditions.
Seller agrees that from the consummation of a Permitted Competitive
Acquisition until the earlier to occur of (a) the date on which Purchaser
notifies Seller in writing that Purchaser (or its designee) does not intend
to make a Final Offer, (b) the end of the Due Diligence Period, provided that
Purchaser (or its designee) has failed to make a Final Offer within the Due
Diligence Period, (c) the date on which Seller rejects such Final Offer in
writing, and (d) the date which is 30 days after the end of the Due Diligence
Period, Seller may not engage in discussions with, or provide confidential
information to, a third party regarding the divestiture to such party of, or
consummate such a divestiture of, the Seller Competitive Business.



 

95 Section 12.2. _Nonsolicitation of Purchaser Employees_. Seller covenants and
agrees that, except to the extent otherwise mutually agreed between the
parties hereto, for a period of one year following the Closing Date it shall
not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, (i) solicit any Acquired Company
Employee or Transferred Employee (at a time when such person is an employee
of Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries or for a period of six months
thereafter) to terminate his or her employment relationship with Purchaser or
any of its Subsidiaries or (ii) hire or extend an offer to hire any employee
of Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries (at a time when such person is an
employee of Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries or for a period of six months
thereafter).



Section 12.3. _Nonsolicitation of Seller Employees_. Purchaser covenants and
agrees that, except (x) as expressly contemplated by this Agreement and (y)
except to the extent otherwise mutually agreed between the parties hereto, for
a period of one year following the Closing Date it shall not, and shall cause
its Subsidiaries not to, (i) solicit any employee of Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries (at a time when such person is an employee of Seller or any of
its Subsidiaries or for a period of six months thereafter) to terminate his or
her employment relationship with Seller or any of its Subsidiaries or (ii)
hire or extend an offer to hire any employee of Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries (at a time when such person is an employee of Seller or any of
its Subsidiaries or for a period of six months thereafter).



Section 12.4. _Remedies_. Purchaser and Seller each acknowledge that
the time, scope and other provisions of this Article XII have been
specifically negotiated by sophisticated commercial parties and specifically
hereby agree that such time, scope and other provisions are reasonable under
the circumstances. It is further agreed that other remedies cannot fully
compensate Purchaser or Seller, as the case may be, for a violation by Seller
or Purchaser, as the case may be, of the terms of this Article XII and that
Purchaser or Seller, as the case may be, shall be entitled to injunctive
relief to prevent any such violation or continuing violation by Seller or
Purchaser, as the case may be. It is the intent and understanding of each
party hereto that if, in any Legal Proceeding, any term, restriction,
covenant or promise herein is found to be unreasonable and for that reason
unenforceable, then such term, restriction, covenant or promise shall be
deemed modified to the extent necessary to make it enforceable.



ARTICLE XIII

Section 13.1. _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated and the
transactions contemplated hereby abandoned any time prior to the Closing: 



(a) upon the written agreement of Purchaser and Seller;



(b) by Purchaser, upon ten Business Days prior written notice to Seller, if
any of the conditions set forth in Section 8.1 or 8.2 becomes incapable of
fulfillment, other than as a result of actions or inactions by Purchaser in
violation of this Agreement that render any such condition incapable of
fulfillment;



 

96 (c) by Seller, upon ten Business Days prior written notice to Purchaser, if
any of the conditions set forth in Section 9.1 or 9.2 becomes incapable of

(d) by Purchaser or by Seller on or after June 30, 2005 if the Closing has
not occurred prior to such date or at such earlier time if either a court of
competent jurisdiction in the United States issues a preliminary injunction
prohibiting closing; _provided_ , that the right to terminate this
Agreement under this Section 13.1(d) shall not be available to any party
hereto whose failure to perform any covenant or obligation hereunder has
caused or resulted into the failure of the Closing to occur on or before such
date; or



(e) by Purchaser, on or after April 15, 2005, if (i) Seller has not delivered
to Purchaser on or before such date the Historical Combined Audited Financial
Statements and the Stub Period Combined Financial Statements in accordance
with Section 6.9 hereof or (ii) the representation and warranty set forth
in Section 4.6(d) shall not be true and correct such that the Historical
Combined Audited Financial Statements or the Stub Period Combined Financial
Statements reflect a material impairment in the value of the Business as
evidenced by lower earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortization or tangible net worth, as compared to the earnings before
interest, tax, depreciation and amortization or tangible net worth reflected
in the corresponding Unaudited Historical Financial Statements or the
corresponding Unaudited Financial Statements for the corresponding periods.



Section 13.2. _Procedure and Effect of Termination_. In the event of
termination party under Section 13.1(b), (c), or (d), written notice thereof
shall be given to the other party and this Agreement shall terminate and the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be abandoned, without further action by
either party, upon delivery of such notice, except that the Confidentiality
Agreement shall survive in accordance with its terms and Sections 13.2, 15.3,
15.4 and 15.5 shall also survive such termination. Upon any termination hereof
pursuant to Section 13.1, no party hereto shall thereafter have any further
liability or obligation hereunder or under any Transition Agreement (except as
expressly provided therein); _provided_ , _however_ , that no such
termination shall relieve any party hereto or thereto of any liability for any
willful breach of any term hereof prior to the date of such termination;
_provided_ _further_ ,  _however_ , that if the Agreement is terminated by
Purchaser under Section 13.1(e), Seller shall, within ten Business Days of
written request from Purchaser, reimburse Purchaser and its Affiliates for all
specifically documented and invoiced, actual third party out-of pocket fees
and expenses incurred by them in connection with the negotiation and execution
of this Agreement and the agreements ancillary hereto (including those
relating to the Acquisition Financing) and their due diligence
investigations, including, without limitation, the fees and expenses of their
legal counsel, engineers, auditors and other advisors and consultants;
provided that Seller shall in no event be obligated to reimburse Purchaser for
amounts in excess of $10 million pursuant to this Section 13.2.



 

97 ARTICLE XIV



TAX MATTERS



Section 14.1. _Tax Indemnification_. (a) Seller shall indemnify Purchaser and
its Affiliates and hold them harmless from all liability for (A) Excluded
Taxes (other than (i) the portion of Transfer Taxes required to be borne by
Purchaser pursuant to Section 14.10 and (ii) Tax liabilities or Tax accruals
taken into account in the calculation of Closing Date Working Capital), (B)
the portion of Transfer Taxes required to be borne by Seller pursuant to
Section 14.10 and (C) all reasonable costs and expenses, including reasonable
legal fees and expenses, attributable to any item in clause (A) or (B).



(b) Purchaser shall indemnify Seller and its Affiliates and hold
them harmless from all liability for (A) any and all Taxes imposed on or
payable with respect to the Acquired Companies or the Business, other than
Excluded Taxes, (B) the Transfer Taxes required to be borne by Purchaser
pursuant to Section 1.6 and the portion of Transfer Taxes required to be
borne by Purchaser pursuant to Section 14.10, and (C) all reasonable costs and
expenses, including reasonable legal fees and expenses, attributable to any
item in clauses (A) and (B).



(c) Any indemnity payment to be made pursuant to Section 14.1 shall be
paid no later than the later of (i) ten (10) days after the indemnified party
makes written demand upon the indemnifying party and (ii) five (5) days prior
to the date on which the underlying amount is required to be paid by the
indemnified party. 



(d) The indemnification provisions in this Section 14.1 shall survive the
Closing until 90 days after the expiration of the applicable statute of
limitations.



Section 14.2. _Section 338(h)(10) Elections_. (a) Seller and Purchaser shall
jointly make timely and irrevocable elections under Section 338(h)(10) of the
Code (and any corresponding elections under state or local tax law) (the "
_338(h)(10) Elections_ ") with respect to the Acquired Companies for which an
election may be made under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code and the applicable
Treasury Regulations thereunder (such Acquired Companies, the " _338(h)(10)
Election Entities_ "). Seller and Purchaser shall cause their respective
subsidiaries and affiliates to (i) treat the 338(h)(10) Elections as valid,
(ii) file all Tax Returns in a manner consistent with such 338(h)(10)
Elections and (iii) take no position contrary thereto, except to the extent
required to do otherwise pursuant to a determination (as defined in Section
1313(a) of the Code or any similar state or local tax provision) (a "
_Determination_ "). Seller shall pay any Tax attributable to the making of the
Section 338(h)(10) Elections and shall indemnify Purchaser and its Affiliates
and hold them harmless from all liability arising out of any failure to pay
such Tax.



Section 14.3. _Allocation of Consideration_. Within 90 calendar days following
the determination of the Final Consideration, Purchaser and Seller shall
attempt in good faith to agree upon the allocation of the Final Consideration
among the Purchased Equity Interests and the Purchased Assets. The allocation
of this amount shall be made in the manner required by Section 1060 of the
Internal Revenue Code and the applicable Treasury Regulations thereunder.
In the event that Purchaser and Seller are unable to reach an agreement
within such 90 calendar day period, Purchaser and Seller shall each set forth
in writing their positions regarding any  



 

98  remaining disagreed items and such positions shall be submitted to the
Neutral Auditors for resolution in the next 20 days. The Neutral Auditors
shall be instructed to determine whether the position maintained by Seller or
by Purchaser is the more reasonable allocation of such difference in respect
of any item in dispute and shall select one of the two positions. Each of
Seller and Purchaser shall bear all fees and costs incurred by it in
connection with such dispute, except that each party shall pay one-half (50%)
of the fees and expenses of the Neutral Auditors. Once the allocation is
agreed upon (or determined by the Neutral Auditors), the parties shall
prepare and reflect such allocation on _Schedule 14.3_ which shall be attached
to this agreement and become a part thereof. Except as otherwise required
pursuant to a Determination, Purchaser and Seller agree to act in
accordance with the allocations contained in _Schedule 14.3_ , for all Tax
purposes and that neither of them will (or will permit its Affiliates to) take
any position inconsistent therewith in any Tax Returns or similar filings
(including IRS Form 8594 or any similar form required to be filed under
state, local or foreign Law), any refund claim, litigation, or otherwise.
Purchaser and Seller each agree to provide the other party with any additional
information reasonably required to complete IRS Form 8594 (or any similar
form required to be filed under state, local or foreign Law) and with
completed copies of such forms.



Section 14.4. _Allocation of Purchase Price for the Purchased Equity
Interests_. Seller and Purchaser agree that the portion of the
Final Consideration allocated to the Purchased Equity Interests pursuant to
Section 14.3 shall be further allocated in the manner described in this
Section. With respect to each 338(h)(10) Election, Seller and Purchaser shall
agree within 90 calendar days following the determination of the Final
Consideration on (i) the aggregate deemed sale price (as defined in Treasury
Regulation § 1.338-4) (the " _ADSP_ ") and (ii) the allocation of the ADSP
among the assets of each of the 338(h)(10) Election Entities (collectively,
the " _338(h)(10) Election Allocations_ "). The 338(h)(10) Election
Allocations shall be reasonable and shall be determined in accordance with
Section 338(h)(10) of the Internal Revenue Code and the applicable Treasury
Regulations thereunder. Purchaser and Seller shall jointly prepare, consistent
with the 338(h)(10) Election Allocations (if any), any form or document
required to effect a valid and timely 338(h)(10) Election. Except as may be
required by a Determination, Seller and Purchaser shall file, or cause to be
filed, all Tax Returns in a manner consistent with the 338(h)(10) Election
Allocations (if any).



Section 14.5. _Preparation and Filing of Tax Returns_. (a) Seller shall timely
prepare and file or shall cause to be timely prepared and filed (i) any
combined, consolidated or unitary Tax Return that includes Seller or any of
its Affiliates, and (ii) any Tax Return of the Acquired Companies for any Pre-
Closing Tax Period and pay any Taxes due with respect to such Tax Returns.
Purchaser shall not amend or revoke such Tax Returns (or any notification or
election relating thereto). Seller shall prepare and submit to Purchaser, no
later than three months after the Closing Date, blank Tax Return
workpaper packages or questionnaires for Pre-Closing Tax Periods. Purchaser
shall, and shall cause the Acquired Companies to, prepare in good faith and
submit to Seller in accordance with past practice, within three months of
receipt, all information as Seller shall reasonably request in such Tax
Return workpaper packages or questionnaires.



(b) Purchaser shall, except to the extent that such Tax Returns are the
responsibility of Seller under Section 14.5(a), timely prepare and file or
shall cause to be timely prepared and filed all Tax Returns with respect to
the Acquired Companies. For any Straddle  



 

99  Period Tax Return of the Acquired Companies that is the responsibility of
Purchaser under this Section 14.5(b), Purchaser shall, and shall cause
its Affiliates to, prepare such Tax Return in a manner consistent with past
practices of the Acquired Companies unless otherwise required by applicable
Laws and Purchaser shall deliver to Seller for its review, comment and
approval (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld) a copy of such
proposed Tax Return (accompanied, in the case of a Straddle Period Tax Return,
by an allocation between the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the Post-Closing Tax
Period of the Taxes shown to be due on such Tax Return) at least thirty
Business Days prior to the due date (giving effect to any validly obtained
extensions) thereof. Purchaser shall not unreasonably fail to reflect any
comments received from Seller within ten Business Days following Sellers
receipt of such Tax Return and the failure of Seller to propose any changes
within such ten Business Days shall constitute its approval thereof. Purchaser
shall not amend or revoke any Straddle Period Tax Return (or any notification
or election relating thereto). Purchaser shall promptly reimburse Seller for
any overpayment of Taxes with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, including
by reason of the payment of any estimated Taxes by Seller or its Affiliates.



Section 14.6. _Refunds, Credits and Carrybacks_. (a) Seller shall be entitled
to any refunds or credits of or against any Excluded Taxes. Purchaser shall,
at Sellers reasonable request and at Sellers expense, cause the relevant
entity to file for and use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
any refund to which Seller is entitled. Subject to Section 14.6(c), Purchaser
shall be entitled to any refunds or credits of or against any Taxes other than
refunds or credits of or against Excluded Taxes.



(b) Purchaser shall, and shall cause the Acquired Companies to,
promptly forward to Seller or reimburse Seller for any refunds or credits of
Taxes due Seller (pursuant to the terms of this Article XIV) after receipt
thereof, and Seller shall promptly forward to Purchaser or reimburse Purchaser
for any refunds or credits of Taxes due Purchaser (pursuant to the terms of
this Article XIV) after receipt thereof.



(c) Purchaser shall cause the Acquired Companies to elect, where permitted by
applicable Law, to carry forward any item of loss, deduction or credit which
arises in any taxable period ending after the Closing Date. 



Section 14.7. _Tax Contests_. (a) If any taxing authority asserts a Tax Claim
in respect of the Acquired Companies, then the party hereto first receiving
notice of such Tax Claim shall provide written notice thereof to the other
party or parties hereto within fourteen (14) calendar days; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that the failure of such party to give timely notice shall not
relieve the other party of any of its obligations under this Article XIV, but
the other partys indemnity obligations shall be reduced (including the
complete elimination thereof if applicable), but only to the extent of any
liability under this Article XIV (or any increase thereof) incurred as a
result of the delay or failure to receive such timely notice. Such notice
shall specify in reasonable detail the basis for such Tax Claim and shall
include a copy of the relevant portion of any correspondence received from the
taxing authority.



(b) Seller shall have the sole and absolute right to control any audit,
examination, contest, litigation or other proceeding involving federal
income Taxes of the Acquired Companies for all taxable periods that end on or
before the Closing Date. Seller shall  



 

100  have the right to control, any audit, examination, contest, litigation or
other proceeding by or against any state and local taxing authority (a " _Tax
Proceeding_ ") of the Acquired Companies for any taxable period that ends on
or before the Closing Date; provided, that Seller shall not settle, compromise
or abandon any such Tax Proceeding if such action would reasonably be
expected to have a significant adverse impact on Purchaser without obtaining
the prior written consent of Purchaser, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Purchaser shall promptly notify
Seller upon receipt by Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries of notice of any
claim, assessment or dispute relating to any Tax Proceeding which Seller is
entitled to control under this Section 14.7(b) and shall promptly forward to
Seller any communications received from or sent to any taxing authority in
connection with any such Tax Proceeding. Notwithstanding Section 14.7(a) and
the foregoing provisions of this Section 14.7(b), in the event that Seller is
entitled to and does seek Purchasers consent to settle a Tax Claim and
Purchaser determines that it prefers to pursue the Tax Claim further,
Purchaser may take over control of the Tax Claim at its own cost and expense
and, to the extent that the amount of the Tax Claim ultimately is determined
to be greater than the amount for which Seller was willing to settle,
Purchaser shall bear such excess cost. In the event that Purchaser takes over
control of a Tax Claim, Seller shall cooperate fully with Purchaser in
connection with such Tax Claim (including, if necessary, executing or causing
to be executed powers-of-attorney or other documents necessary in order for
Purchaser to exercise its control over such Tax Claim) and Purchaser shall
then be able to settle such Tax Claim without the consent of Seller. In the
case of a Tax Proceeding for a Straddle Period of the Acquired Companies,
Purchaser shall have the right to control such Tax Proceeding; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that (i) Purchaser shall provide Seller with a timely and
reasonably detailed account of each phase of such Tax Proceeding, (ii) Seller
shall be entitled to receive copies of all correspondence and documents
related to such Tax Proceeding, (iii) Purchaser shall consult with Seller
before taking any significant action in connection with such Tax Proceeding,
(iv) Purchaser shall consult with Seller and offer Seller an opportunity to
comment before submitting any written materials prepared or furnished in
connection with such Tax Proceeding, (v) Purchaser shall defend such Tax
Proceeding diligently and in good faith as if it were the only party in
interest in connection with such Tax Proceeding, (vi) Seller shall be entitled
to participate in (but not control) such Tax Proceeding, at its own expense,
if such Tax Proceeding could have a significant adverse impact on Seller or
any of its Affiliates and (vii) Purchaser shall not settle, compromise or
abandon any such Tax Proceeding without obtaining the prior written consent,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, of
Seller if such settlement, compromise or abandonment would have a significant
adverse impact on Seller or any of its Affiliates.



(c) Subject to Sections 14.7(a) and (b), Purchaser shall have the right
to control any Tax Proceeding involving the Acquired Companies; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Purchaser shall not settle, compromise or abandon any such
Tax Proceeding, if such action would reasonably be expected to have a
significant adverse impact on Seller, without obtaining the prior written
consent of Seller, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. Notwithstanding Sections 14.7(a) and (b) or the
foregoing provisions of this Section 14.7(c), in the event that Purchaser is
entitled to and does seek Sellers consent to settle a Tax Claim and Seller
determines that it prefers to pursue the Tax Claim further, Seller may take

applicable Law. Seller and Purchaser shall cooperate in the execution and
filing of any Tax Returns, affidavits or other documents relating to any
Transfer Taxes and in attempting to obtain all available exemptions from such
Transfer Taxes (including by providing each other with resale certificates and
any other documents necessary to satisfy any such exemptions). 



 

102 Section 14.11. _Post-Closing Dispositions_. For the absence of doubt, the
covenants of Purchaser and the Acquired Companies set forth in this Article
XIV shall apply to Purchaser and the Acquired Companies regardless of any
post-Closing disposition of the Acquired Companies by Purchaser or any of its
subsidiaries.



Section 14.12. _Termination of Tax Sharing Agreements_. Anything in any other
agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, all liabilities and obligations
between Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than any of the Acquired
Companies), on the one hand, and any of the Acquired Companies, on the other
hand, under any Tax allocation or Tax sharing agreement in effect prior to
the Closing Date (other than this Agreement) shall cease and terminate with
respect to the Acquired Companies as of the Closing and from and after the

payment, or entitled to receive any payment, pursuant to any such agreement
for any past or future period.

partnership for Tax purposes shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement
as if its taxable year ended as of the close of business on the Closing Date

to the Pre-Closing Tax Period.

parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns. Nothing herein
shall create or be deemed to create any third party beneficiary rights in any
Person not a party hereto (except for Indemnified Parties in Article XI). No
assignment hereof or of any rights or obligations hereunder may be made by
any party hereto (by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written
consent of the other party hereto and any attempted assignment without such
required consent shall be without effect; _provided_ , _however_ , that
Purchaser may assign, in whole or in part, its rights, duties and obligations
under this Agreement to any of the lenders providing the Acquisition Financing
(or any replacement financing or refinancing thereof), to any purchaser of a
substantial portion of the Business and to any one or more of its Affiliates
(any such subsidiary or affiliate so designated shall be deemed a "
_Designated Affiliate_ " hereunder); provided that any such assignment shall
not (i) relieve Purchaser of its obligations hereunder to the extent any such
Affiliate does not satisfy its obligations hereunder or (ii) be reasonably
likely to delay the Closing.



Section 15.10. _Amendments_. This Agreement may be amended, supplemented or
modified, and any provision hereof may be waived, only pursuant to a written
instrument making specific reference hereto signed by each of the parties
hereto.



Section 15.11. _Waiver_. At any time prior to the Closing Date, the parties
may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or
other acts of the parties, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations
and warranties contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto
or (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained
herein, to the extent permitted by applicable Law. Any agreement on the part
of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver will be valid only if set
forth in a writing signed on behalf of such party. No waiver by any party of
any default, misrepresentation, or breach of warranty or covenant hereunder,
whether intentional or not, shall be deemed to extend to any prior or
subsequent default, misrepresentation, or breach of warranty or covenant
hereunder or affect in any way any rights arising by virtue of any such prior
or subsequent occurrence.



Section 15.12. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which
together shall constitute one and the same instrument. 



 

126 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed this Agreement as of the
date and year first above written.
