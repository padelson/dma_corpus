       | (a)  |   | Subject to sub-clauses (b), (c) and (d) below, no
right or obligation arising under this Agreement or any other Transaction
Document may be assigned, transferred or otherwise disposed of, in whole or
in part, without the prior written agreement of the other parties and
provided that the liability of the Seller is not thereby increased.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | The Seller may assign the benefit of this Agreement to
any member of the Sellers Group. However, the assignee will only be entitled
to enforce the benefit assigned to it while it remains a member of the

    | (d)  |   | If there is an assignment or encumbrance by a party as

of any action taken by it in accordance with this clause 18.3.

circular:  
      

  ##### 

  

   

     

  

       | (A)  |   | made or issued by the Buyer after Completion
to a customer, client or supplier of any Group Company solely for
the purposes of informing it of the Buyers purchase of the Sale Shares; or  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (B)  |   | required to be made by any applicable law
or regulatory body or the rules of any Authority, by the party with
an obligation to make an announcement, provided that, the Buyer or
the Seller (as the case may be) shall, where practicable and lawful to
do so, promptly notify the other of the requirement to disclose and
shall co-operate with the other party regarding the timing and content
of such disclosure and any action the other party may reasonably elect
to take to challenge the validity of such requirement. The Buyer and
the Seller each acknowledge that they will each be required to make
an announcement regarding the signing of this Agreement and in due
course, Completion.  
   

  

     18.5  |   | Entire Agreement:  
---|---|---

Documents) sets out the entire agreement and understanding between the
parties in connection with the sale and purchase of the Sale Shares and other
matters described in them.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | Without prejudice to the generality of clause 18.5(a),
this Agreement (with the other Transaction Documents) supersedes as from the
date of this Agreement all prior negotiations, representations, undertakings
and agreements on any subject matter of this Agreement.  
      
    | (c)  |   | Each of the parties acknowledges that it is not relying
on any statement, warranty, representation, collateral contract or other
assurance given or made by any of the parties in relation to the subject
matter of this Agreement, save for those expressly set out in this Agreement
and the other Transaction Documents. Each party waives all rights and
remedies which, but for this clause 18.5(c), might otherwise be available to
it in respect of any such statement, warranty, representation,
collateral contract or other assurance not set out in this Agreement or any
other Transaction Document. Nothing in this clause 18.5(c) will exclude or
limit any liability for fraud.  
   

  

     18.6  |   | Alterations: Any alteration to this Agreement must be
in writing, refer specifically to this Agreement and be duly executed by each
party.  
---|---|--- 
      
  18.7  |   | Severability: If any provision in this Agreement is or at
any time becomes to any extent invalid, illegal or unenforceable under any
enactment or rule of law, such provision will to that extent be deemed not to
form part of this Agreement but the validity, legality and enforceability of
the remainder of this Agreement will not be affected, provided that
the operation of this clause 18.7 would not negate the commercial intent and
purpose of the parties in entering into this Agreement.  
      
  18.8  |   | Counterparts: This Agreement may be entered into in the form
of two or more counterparts, each executed by one or more of the parties but,
taken together, executed by all and, provided that all the parties so enter
into this Agreement, each of the executed counterparts, when duly exchanged
and delivered, will be deemed to be an original, but, taken together, they
will constitute one instrument.  
      
  18.9  |   | Payment of costs: Except where this Agreement or another
Transaction Document provides otherwise, each party shall pay its own costs
and expenses incurred in relation to the  
   

  ##### 

  

   

       |   | negotiation, preparation and completion of this Agreement
and each Transaction Document. The Buyer shall be liable for and shall pay
any stamp duty payable in respect of the entry into this Agreement or any
transfer of shares pursuant to this Agreement. The Seller shall be liable for
and shall, immediately after Completion, pay any stamp duty payable in
respect of the acquisition of MEM Holdings Shares pursuant to the Minority
SPA.  
---|---|--- 
      
  18.10  |   | Continuing effect of this Agreement: All provisions of this
Agreement and any other Transaction Document will, so far as they are capable
of being performed or observed, continue in full force notwithstanding
Completion, except for those matters then already performed and Completion
will not constitute a waiver of any of the Buyers rights in relation to
this Agreement or any other Transaction Document.  
      
  19  |   | Choice of law and submission to jurisdiction  
      
    |   | Choice of law  
      
  19.1  |   | This Agreement will be governed by and construed in
accordance with English law and all claims and disputes (including non-
contractual claims and disputes) arising out of or in connection with this
Agreement, its subject matter, negotiation or formation will be determined in
accordance with English law.  
      
  19.2  |   | Each party irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction
of the English courts in relation to all matters (including non-contractual
matters) arising out of or in connection with this Agreement.

       | (a)  |   | for any Claim under the Tax Warranties or under
the Tax Covenant, on or before the date falling on the seventh anniversary of
Completion; and  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | for any other Claim, on or before the date falling

not satisfied, settled or withdrawn will be unenforceable against the Seller
on the expiry of the period of 6 months starting on the day of notification
of the Claim, unless proceedings (including particulars of claim) in respect
of such Claim have been both issued and validly served on the Seller within
that period and provided that where a Claim is based upon a liability that is
contingent or otherwise not capable of being quantified:  
---|---|--- 
   

  

       | (a)  |   | such 6 month period shall commence on the date
that the contingent liability becomes an actual liability or the liability
becomes capable of being quantified; and  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | until such time as the contingent liability becomes an
actual liability or the liability becomes capable of being quantified, the
Seller shall have no liability for such Claim.  
   

  

     5.3  |   | The Buyer will not be prevented by paragraph 10 (Claims
against third party) from notifying pursuant to paragraph 5.1 a Claim to
which those paragraphs apply. If any such Claim is notified within the
applicable time limit in paragraph 5.1 then the 6 month period in paragraph
5.2 will commence on the day on which paragraph 10 ceases to prevent the
Buyer taking any further steps to pursue the relevant Claim.  
---|---|--- 
      
  6  |   | Rights to information  
      
  6.1  |   | If the Buyer gives any notice under paragraphs 5.1, 10 or 11,
the Buyer shall, and shall ensure that each Group Company shall:  
   

  

       | (a)  |   | allow the Seller and its duly authorised
representatives and professional advisers access for the purposes of the
relevant Claim or Third Party Claim to the premises and personnel of the
Buyer and each Group Company, and to any relevant records and information of
the Buyer or any Group Company, (other than records or other information
which would be subject to legal privilege), and permit the Seller and
those representatives and advisers to make copies (at their own cost) of
those records and information; and  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | if so requested by the Seller, procure at the cost of
the Seller that the auditors of the relevant Group Company at the relevant
time(s) grant to the firm of accountants appointed by the Seller access to
their audit working papers in respect of audits of the  
   

  ##### 

  

   

     |   |   | relevant Group Company accounts for any relevant
financial year in connection with the relevant Claim or Third Party Claim.  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  

     6.2  |   | Access under paragraph 6.1 may be required only at
reasonable times during normal business hours and on reasonable notice and
will be subject to the Seller giving such undertakings as to confidentiality
as the Buyer may reasonably require and, in the case of access to
the auditors working papers, to the Seller and its appointed accountants
signing such letters holding the auditors harmless as the auditors may
reasonably require.  
---|---|--- 
      
  7  |   | Buyers knowledge  
      
  7.1  |   | The Buyer acknowledges that as at the date of this Agreement
it is not actually aware of any matter which will entitle it to make a Claim
(other than a Tax Claim). For the purposes of this paragraph the actual
awareness of the Buyer shall be construed as a reference to the actual
knowledge of Jeff Wheatley, Carol Cross, Carl Spilker, Mike Marcus and Mike
Coury.  
      
  8  |   | General limitations  
      
  8.1  |   | The Seller will not be liable for any Claim (other than a Tax
Claim) and accordingly no Claim may be brought to the extent that:

specifically provided for in the Accounts (and not subsequently released
before Completion), the Interim Accounts (and not subsequently released
before Completion) or the Completion Statement;  
      
    | (c)  |   | the Claim arises in connection with, or the amount of
the Claim is increased by:  
   

  

       | (i)  |   | any voluntary act, omission, transaction or

Buyer or any Group Company or any member of the Buyers Group or any of their
respective officers, employees or agents before or at Completion;

not entitle the Buyer to compensation unless and to the extent that such
breach has not been remedied by the Seller to the reasonable satisfaction of
the Buyer within 40 Business Days after the date of service of the notice of
the Claim under this schedule.

giving rise to the Claim (less any Expenses incurred in making such
recovery).

(other than a Tax Claim) (a Third Party Recovery), the Buyer:  
   

  

       | (a)  |   | shall notify the Seller of the Third Party
Recovery within 10 Business Days of the Buyer or relevant Group Company or
any member of the Buyers Group becoming aware that it may be entitled to
make the Third Party Recovery, and in any event prior to taking any material
step to enforce, compromise, settle or waive any right in relation to that
Third Party Recovery;  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | shall provide the Seller with such information as the
Seller may reasonably require relating to the Third Party Recovery and shall
keep the Seller fully informed of any material development in the conduct of

first taken steps (including the commencement and prosecution of
proceedings), to enforce such Third Party Recovery as the Seller
may reasonably require before taking steps (other than notification of the
Claim under paragraph 5.1) to pursue the Claim against the Seller;  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | if and to the extent that such Claim arises from or is
increased by the Buyers failure to comply with the provision of this
paragraph 10.2.  
   

  

     10.3  |   | The Buyer shall not be obliged to transfer conduct of
any Third Party Recovery to the Seller or take any action requested under

faith), have a material impact on the business of the Group as a whole having
regard to its commercial interests, business activities and reputation in the
market; or

    | (b)  |   | involves a governmental or regulatory authority,

---|---|--- 
      
  10.4  |   | Any Claim will be limited (in addition to the other
limitations on the Sellers liability referred to in this schedule) to the
amount by which the loss or damage suffered by the Buyer as a result of such
breach exceeds the amount (if any) so recovered by way of the Third
Party Recovery.  
      
  10.5  |   | If the Third Party Recovery involves a claim or other right
of action against the Sellers (as defined in the Parker Fox Agreement) the
Buyer shall pursue such Third Party Recovery at the same time, so far as is
practicable, as pursuing a Claim and nothing in this paragraph 10 shall
require the Buyer to pursue that Third Party Recovery before pursuing a
Claim.  
      
  11  |   | Claims by third party  
      
  11.1  |   | In this paragraph 11, Third Party Claim means any Claim,

Claim or to compromise, settle or waive any right in relation to the Third
Party Claim), notify the Seller of the Third Party Claim;  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | shall provide the Seller with such information as the

---|---|---|--- 
   

  

       | (i)  |   | take, and procure that the relevant Group Company
and each member of the Buyers Group take, such action as the Seller may
reasonably request to avoid, dispute, resist, appeal, defend or compromise
the Third Party Claim; and

Group Company and each member of the Buyers Group do not) compromise, settle
or waive any right or admit any liability in relation to that Third Party
Claim without the written consent of the Seller, not to be unreasonably
withheld.  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  

     11.2  |   | The Buyer shall not be obliged to transfer conduct of
any Third Party Claim to the Seller or take any action requested under clause
11.1(c)(i) where such Third Party Claim:  
---|---|--- 
   

  

       | (a)  |   | may, in the Buyers opinion (acting in good
faith), have a material impact on the business of the Group as a whole having
regard to its commercial interests, business activities and reputation in the
market; or  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | involves a governmental or regulatory authority,  
   

  

       |   | provided that in such cases the Seller shall not be
liable to pay the Buyers Expenses in respect of the relevant Third Party
Claim.  
---|---|--- 
      
  11.3  |   | The Seller shall not be liable for any Claim if and to the
extent that such Claim arises from or is increased by the Buyers failure to
comply with the provision of this paragraph 11.  
      
  12  |   | Duty to mitigate  
      
    |   | Nothing in this Agreement will be deemed to relieve the Buyer
from its common law duty to mitigate its loss.  
      
  13  |   | No double recovery  
      
    |   | Neither the Buyer nor any member of the Buyers Group will be
entitled to recover damages or any other amount in respect of any Claim or
otherwise obtain reimbursement or restitution more than once in respect of
the same loss or liability and for this purpose any payment by the Seller
under the Tax Covenant will be deemed to satisfy any Warranty Claim in respect
of the same loss or liability.  
      
  14  |   | No reliance on statements  
      
    |   | The Buyer shall not make any claim against the Seller in
respect of any warranty, representation, indemnity, covenant, undertaking or
otherwise arising out of or in connection with the sale of the Sale Shares
except where it is expressly contained in this Agreement or a Transaction
Document. The Buyer confirms that it has not relied upon or been induced to
enter into this Agreement by any warranty, representation, indemnity, covenant
or undertaking given by any person which is not expressly contained in this
Agreement or a Transaction Document.

being liable to make any payment in consideration for such surrender) and
the liability of the Seller under the Tax Covenant or for breach of any Tax
Warranty shall be satisfied or avoided to the extent of the amount of
Taxation which could be satisfied or avoided as a result of such surrender.
The Buyer shall procure that the Company takes all such reasonable steps,
including (without limitation) making and giving all such claims and consents
as may be necessary to effect any such surrender.

provision and if so its amount;

    | (b)  |   | any right to a repayment of Taxation treated as an
asset in the Completion Statement has proved to be understated and if so its

the Completion Statement, whether any such  
   

  ##### 

  

   

     |   |   | amount should have been treated as an asset in the
Completion Statement and if so the amount; or  
---|---|---|---

so saved or the amount of that repayment; and  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  

       |   | if the Auditors determine that there has proved to be any
such over-provision, understatement or amount, the amount of such over-
provision, understatement or amount (as the case may be) shall be dealt with
in accordance with paragraph 4.3.  
---|---|--- 
      
  4.2  |   | The Buyer shall at the request and expense of the Seller
request the Auditors to determine (as experts and not as arbitrators and at
the expense of the Seller) whether any Taxation Liability (or the Event
giving rise to such Taxation Liability or the discharge of it) which has
resulted in any sum having been paid or becoming payable by the Seller under
the Tax Covenant or for breach of any Tax Warranty has given rise to a Relief
(or would give rise to a Relief assuming that all reasonable steps are taken
to obtain such Relief) which would not otherwise have arisen, and:  
   

  

       | (a)  |   | a liability of the Company to make an actual
payment or increased payment of Taxation has been or could have been
satisfied or avoided in whole or in part by the use of that Relief; or  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | a right to a repayment of Taxation has or could have
arisen as a result of the use of that Relief; and  
   

  

       |   | if the Auditors so determine, the amount by which that
liability has or could have been satisfied or avoided or an amount equal to
the amount of that repayment (as the case may be) shall be dealt with in
accordance with paragraph 4.3.  
---|---|--- 
      
  4.3  |   | Where it is provided under paragraph 4.1 or 4.2 that any
amount is to be dealt with in accordance with this paragraph 4.3:  
   

  

       | (a)  |   | the amount shall first be set off against any
payment then due from the Seller under the Tax Covenant or for breach of any
Tax Warranty;  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | to the extent there is an excess, a refund shall be
made to the Seller, within 10 Business Days of the Auditors determination
referred to in paragraph 4.1 or 4.2 (as appropriate), of any previous payment
made by the Seller under the Tax Covenant or for breach of any Tax Warranty
and not previously refunded under this paragraph up to the amount of such
excess; and  
      
    | (c)  |   | to the extent that the excess referred to in paragraph
4.3(b) is not exhausted thereunder, the remainder of that excess shall be
carried forward and set off against any future payment which becomes due from
the Seller under the Tax Covenant or for breach of any Tax Warranty;  
   

  

     4.4  |   | Where such determination by the Auditors as is
mentioned in paragraph 4.1 or 4.2 has been made, the Seller or the Buyer may
request the Auditors to review such determination (at the expense of the
person making the request) in the light of all relevant
circumstances, including any facts which have become known only since such
determination, and to determine  
---|---|--- 
   

  ##### 

  

   

     |   | whether such determination remains correct or whether, in the
light of those circumstances, the amount that was the subject of such
determination should be amended.  
---|---|--- 
   

  

     4.5  |   | If the Auditors determine under paragraph 4.4 that an
amount previously determined should be amended, that amended amount shall be
substituted for the purposes of paragraph 4.1 or 4.2, as the case may be, in
place of the amount originally determined and such adjusting payment (if any)
as may be required by virtue of such substitution shall forthwith be made by
the Seller to the Buyer or, as the case may be, by the Buyer to the Seller.  
---|---|--- 
      
  5  |   | Recovery from third parties  
      
  5.1  |   | If the Seller has made, or is liable to make, a payment to
the Buyer under the Tax Covenant or for breach of any Tax Warranty and any
member of the Buyers Group is before the seventh anniversary of Completion
entitled to recover from any third party (including any Taxation Authority) a
payment which would not have been made but for such Actual Taxation
Liability, the Buyer shall and shall procure that the relevant member of the
Buyers Group shall inform the Seller of this entitlement and use all
reasonable endeavours to effect such recovery.  
      
  5.2  |   | The Buyer covenants with the Seller to pay to the Seller a
sum equal to the lesser of:  
   

  

       | (a)  |   | the amount of any payment so received, after
deduction therefrom of an amount equal to any costs, fees and expenses
incurred in obtaining it and any Taxation Liability incurred in respect of
it; and

    | (b)  |   | the amount paid by the Seller under the Tax Covenant or
in respect of the Tax Warranties in respect of the Taxation Liability in

---|---|--- 
      
  6.1  |   | If the Buyer or the Company (or any of their officers,

liability of the Seller under the Tax Covenant or in respect of the Tax
Warranties, the Buyer shall or shall procure that the Company shall as
soon as reasonably practicable give written notice of the Claim to the Seller
and, in any event, where a statutory or other time limit is applicable for
responding to or appealing against the Claim or to any assessment, notice,
demand or other document issued (or deemed to be issued) or action taken
which constitutes the Claim, the Buyer shall, where reasonably
practicable, give written notice of the Claim to the Seller at least 21 days
prior to the expiry of such time limit. Such written notice shall, where
reasonably practicable, include an estimate of the liability of the Seller
under the Tax Covenant or in respect of the Tax Warranties in respect of such
Claim, the basis of calculation of that estimate and such details of the
Claim as are then available to the Buyer or the Company.

take such action to appeal, compromise, protest against, mitigate, reduce,
avoid, dispute, resist or compromise the Claim and make available such

Seller may by written notice reasonably request provided the Seller shall
indemnify the Buyer and the Company against all reasonable costs and expenses
which the Buyer or the Company properly incurs as a result of taking such
action or providing such information and assistance.  
      
  6.3  |   | The Seller may, at the Sellers expense, elect to have any
action referred to in paragraph 6.2 conducted by professional advisers acting

be unreasonably withheld or delayed) to:  
   

  

       | (i)  |   | the settlement or compromise of the Claim which
is the subject of the action; and  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (ii)  |   | the agreement of any matter in the conduct of the
action which is likely to affect the amount of the Claim.  
   

  

     6.5  |   | The Buyer shall not be obliged to procure that the
Company take any action under this paragraph 6 (including paragraph 6.3)
which involves contesting any matter beyond the first appellate body
(excluding the Taxation Authority which has or shall have made the Claim

tier Tribunal and the Finance and Tax Chamber of the Upper Tribunal) unless
the Seller furnishes the Buyer with the written opinion of Counsel of at
least five years call who is experienced in the subject matter of the Claim
to the effect that an appeal in respect of the matter in question has
a reasonable prospect of being won.  
---|---|--- 
      
  6.6  |   | If at any time the Seller has not exercised the election
referred to in paragraph 6.3 but requests that the Buyer take, or procure
that the Company take, any action referred to in paragraph 6.2, the
provisions of paragraph 6.4 shall apply as if references to "Seller"
are references to "Buyer" and reference to "Buyer" are references to
"Seller".

  7.1  |   | In the event of any dispute under paragraph 3, 4, 5, 6 or 8
of this schedule, such dispute shall at the election of either/any party be
determined by the Independent Expert (acting as expert and not as arbitrator)
and in the absence of manifest error his determination shall be conclusive
and binding on the parties. The proper charges and disbursements of the
Independent Expert shall be paid and borne on each occasion by the parties
concerned in such proportions as the Independent Expert may in his absolute
discretion consider fair and reasonable.  
      
  7.2  |   | If either party is dissatisfied with any determination of the
Auditors, the matter shall be referred to the Independent Expert for
determination in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 7.1.

    | (b)  |   | that no written communications (including e-mails)
shall be transmitted to any Taxation Authority without first being submitted
to the Buyer and/or its duly authorised agents as soon as reasonably
practicable for their comments, authorisation and written approval and shall
only finally be submitted or transmitted to the relevant Tax Authority on the
receipt of the written approval of the Buyer (such approval not to be
unreasonably withheld or unreasonably delayed).  
   

  

     8.3  |   | The Buyer shall be obliged to procure that the Company
makes or gives any returns, claims, elections, surrenders and consents in
relation to Taxation, to the extent it was assumed they would be made or
given in computing any provision which appears in the Completion
Statement (or in eliminating any provision which would have so appeared)
provided that the Seller has notified the Buyer in writing of the action
required as soon as practicable and, in any event, prior to the end of the
time limit to make the claim.  
---|---|--- 
      
  8.4  |   | The Buyer shall be under no obligation to procure the signing
and/or authorisation of any document delivered to it under paragraph 8.2(b)

  8.5  |   | The Buyer shall provide and shall procure that the Company
provides with all such documents and information (including, without
limitation, access to books, accounts and records as well as copies of any
written communications from any Tax Authority) as the Seller may
reasonably require in connection with its rights pursuant to this paragraph
8.  
      
  8.6  |   | In respect of the accounting period of the Company commencing
prior to Completion and ending after Completion (Straddle Period) the Buyer
shall procure that the corporation tax returns of the company shall be
prepared on the basis which is consistent with the manner in
which corporation tax returns of the Company are or have been prepared for
all accounting periods ended prior to Completion.  
      
  8.7  |   | The Buyer shall procure that the Company keeps the Seller
fully informed of the Taxation affairs of the Company in respect of the
Straddle Period and shall provide the Seller with copies of all relevant
documents and shall not submit any correspondence or submit or agree any
return or computation for such period, to any Taxation Authority without
giving the Seller a reasonable opportunity to make representations thereon
and without the written consent of the Seller (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed).  
      
  8.8  |   | The Seller or its duly appointed agents, as appropriate,
shall provide and shall procure that, at the Buyers expense, the Company
provides with all such documents and information (including, without

any Taxation Warranty, the value of the Company shall not be taken as
exceeding the Consideration.  
      
  9.2  |   | If any potential claim under the Tax Covenant or for breach
of any Tax Warranty arises in consequence of a liability of the Company which
is contingent only, the Seller shall not be liable in respect of the claim
until such time as the contingent liability ceases to be contingent and
becomes an actual liability.  
      
  10  |   | Buyers Covenant  
      
  10.1  |   | The Buyer covenants with the Seller to pay to the Seller by
way of additional payment of purchase price for the Sale Shares an amount

is under the control of the Seller at any time after Completion (and any
costs and expenses incurred by the Seller or the company in relation to such
Actual Taxation Liability or in making any claim under this paragraph 10.1),
where such Actual Taxation Liability arises as a result of the failure by the
Company to discharge after Completion an Actual Taxation Liability for which
the Company is primarily liable and which is not within the Tax Covenant.  
      
  10.2  |   | If the Buyer becomes liable to make a payment under
paragraph 10.1, the Buyer shall pay such amount in cleared immediately
available funds on or before the later of the date 5 Business Days before
that Actual Taxation Liability is finally due and payable and the date 5
Business Days after the date of written demand on the Buyer by the Seller.  
      
  10.3  |   | The provisions of paragraphs 4.1 to 4.3 of Part 2 of this
Schedule shall apply to payments under this paragraph 10 as it applies to
