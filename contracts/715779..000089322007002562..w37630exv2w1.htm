 _AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER_  

   

 THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this "Agreement"), dated as of July 26, 2007, by and among DSI Holdings LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ("Parent"), DSI Acquisition, Inc., a Pennsylvania corporation ("Merger Sub") and wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, and Deb Shops, Inc., a Pennsylvania corporation (the "Company"). 

  

WITNESSETH: 

   

 WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company has determined that it is fair to, advisable and in the best interests of the Company and the holders of (i) the Series A Preferred Stock of the Company, par value $1.00 per share (the "Company Preferred Stock"), and (ii) the common stock of the Company, par value $0.01 per share (the "Company Common Stock" and together with the Company Preferred Stock, the "Company Capital Stock"), to enter into and consummate this Agreement with Parent and Merger Sub, providing for the merger (the "Merger") of Merger Sub with and into the Company, with the Company as the Surviving Corporation, in accordance with the Pennsylvania Business Corporation Law of 1988, as amended (the "PBCL"), and the other transactions contemplated hereby, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein; 

  

 WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of each of Parent and Merger Sub have approved and declared advisable this Agreement and the Merger on the terms and conditions contained in this Agreement and the Board of Directors of Parent, as the sole shareholder of Merger Sub, has adopted this Agreement and approved the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement; 

  

 WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and as a condition to Parent and Merger Subs willingness to enter into this Agreement, Parent and certain shareholders of the Company have entered into a voting agreement ("Voting Agreement"), and Merger Sub and certain shareholders have entered into consulting agreements; 

  

 WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, and as a condition to the willingness of the Company to enter into this Agreement, Parent and Merger Sub have delivered to the Company a limited guarantee (the "Guarantee") of the Investor, dated as of the date hereof, and pursuant to which the Investor has guaranteed the payment in full, when due, of the Parent Termination Fee; and 

  

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto agree as follows: 

  

ARTICLE I 

   

THE MERGER  

  

 Section 1.1 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions hereof, and in accordance with the relevant provisions of the PBCL, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company at the Effective Time. Following the Merger, the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation (the "Surviving Corporation") under the name "Diamond, Inc." and shall continue its existence under the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease. 

  

 Section 1.2 _Effective Time; Closing_. As soon as practicable (and in any event within five (5) Business Days) after the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in _Article VIII_ (or such later 

   ##### 

  

    

date contemplated by the last sentence of this _Section 1.2_), the parties
hereto shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing articles of merger
(the "Articles of Merger") with the Department of State of the Commonwealth
of Pennsylvania (the "Department of State"), in such form as required by and
executed in accordance with the relevant provisions of the PBCL (the date
and time of the filing of the Articles of Merger with the Department of State
(or such later time as is specified in the Articles of Merger) being the
"Effective Time"). On the date of such filing (the "Closing Date"), a closing
(the "Closing") shall be held at 9:00 a.m., Philadelphia time, at the offices
of Morgan, Lewis and Bockius LLP, 1701 Market Street, Philadelphia, PA (or such
other place as the parties may agree). Notwithstanding the foregoing, unless
otherwise agreed to by the parties in writing, in no event shall the Closing
take place prior to the earlier of (i) a date during the Marketing Period
specified by Parent, provided that Parent has given the Company at least five
(5) Business Days prior notice, and (ii) the final day of the Marketing
Period. 

  

 Section 1.3 _Effect of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in the applicable provisions of Section 1929 of the PBCL. 

  

 Section 1.4 _Conversion of Company Preferred Stock and Company Common Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of any holder thereof: 

  

 (a) Each issued and outstanding share of Company Preferred Stock (other than shares cancelled pursuant to _Section 1.4(c)_, if any) shall be converted into the right to receive $1,000.00, in cash (the "Preferred Stock Merger Consideration") upon surrender of the certificate that formerly evidenced such share of Company Preferred Stock in the manner provided in _Section 2.2_ , without interest. 

   

 (b) Each issued and outstanding share of Company Common Stock (other than shares cancelled pursuant to _Section 1.4(c)_) shall be converted into the right to receive $27.25, in cash (the "Common Stock Merger Consideration" and, collectively with the Preferred Stock Merger Consideration, the "Merger Consideration") upon surrender of the certificate that formerly evidenced such share of Company Common Stock in the manner provided in _Section 2.2_, without interest. 

   

 (c) Each share of Company Preferred Stock and Company Common Stock (i) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that is owned by Parent or Merger Sub or (ii) that is owned by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be automatically cancelled and retired and cease to exist, and no payment or distribution shall be made with respect thereto. 

   

 (d) All shares of the Company Preferred Stock and Company Common Stock cancelled and converted pursuant to _Section 1.4(a)_ or _Section 1.4(b)_, as the case may be, shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and retired and cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate ("Certificate") which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any such shares of Company Preferred Stock and Company Common Stock shall from and after the Effective Time cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with _Section 1.4(a)_ and _Section 1.4(b)_. 

   

 Section 1.5 _Conversion of Common Stock of Merger Sub_. Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation and shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation. 

   ##### 

  

  

ARTICLE II 

   

EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES  

  

 Section 2.1 _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall appoint a paying agent mutually agreeable to the Company and Parent to act as paying agent (the "Paying Agent") for the payment of the Merger Consideration. On the Closing Date, Parent shall deposit or shall cause the Company to deposit with the Paying Agent, in a separate fund established for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company Preferred Stock and Company Common Stock, and the holders of Options, for payment in accordance with this _Article II_, immediately available funds constituting an amount equal to (i) the Merger Consideration _plus_ (ii) the Total Option Cash Payments (such aggregate amount as deposited with the Paying Agent, the "Payment Fund"). 

  

 Section 2.2 _Exchange Procedures_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (and in any event within five (5) Business Days), Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate (i) a letter of transmittal which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent, and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of such Certificates in exchange for the applicable Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate to the Paying Agent together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed and completed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor cash in an amount equal to the product of (a) the number of shares of Company Preferred Stock or Company Common Stock, as the case may be, represented by such Certificate multiplied by (b) the Preferred Stock Merger Consideration or Common Stock Merger Consideration, as the case may be, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or will accrue on the Merger Consideration payable. 

  

 Section 2.3 _No Further Ownership Rights_. All cash paid as Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 1.4(a)_ and _Section 1.4(b)_ shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Preferred Stock and Company Common Stock. 

  

 Section 2.4 _No Liability_. If any Certificate shall not have been surrendered prior to one (1) year after the Effective Time, any such Merger Consideration or dividends or distributions in respect thereof shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any holders of Company Preferred Stock or Company Common Stock who have not theretofore complied with the provisions of this _Article II_ shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for satisfaction of their claims for such Merger Consideration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any Merger Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate shall not have been surrendered prior to six (6) years after the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which any Merger Consideration payable to the holder of such Certificate would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any governmental or regulatory (including stock exchange) authority, agency, court commission, or other governmental body (each, a "Governmental Entity")), any such Merger Consideration, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, shall become the property of Parent, free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. 

  

 Section 2.5 _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond in such 

   ##### 

  

    

reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct as indemnity against
any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the
Paying Agent will deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate the applicable Merger Consideration with respect to the shares of
Company Preferred Stock or Company Common Stock, as the case may be,
formerly represented thereby, pursuant to this Agreement. 

  

 Section 2.6 _Withholding Rights_. Each of Parent and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Company Preferred Stock or Company Common Stock such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or any provision of state, local or foreign tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company Preferred Stock or Company Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made. 

  

 Section 2.7 _Stock Transfer Books_. At the close of business on the Closing Date, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and there shall be no further registration of transfers of shares of Company Preferred Stock or Company Common Stock thereafter on the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares of Company Preferred Stock and Company Common Stock formerly represented thereby, except as otherwise provided herein or by Law. On or after the Effective Time, any Certificates presented to the Paying Agent or Parent for any reason shall be converted into the Preferred Stock Merger Consideration or Common Stock Merger Consideration, as the case may be, with respect to the shares of Company Preferred Stock and Company Common Stock formerly represented thereby. 

  

 Section 2.8 _Company Equity Plans_. Simultaneously with the execution of this Agreement, the Board of Directors of the Company (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof) has adopted appropriate resolutions, and the Company hereby agrees to take all other actions necessary after the date hereof, if any, to provide that each outstanding stock option (each "Option") heretofore granted by the Company, whether under the Companys Incentive Stock Option Plan as Amended and Restated Effective January 1, 2002 (the "Company Stock Option Plan") or otherwise, shall, immediately prior to the Effective Time accelerate and become fully-vested and exercisable and each holder of outstanding Options which are vested and exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be entitled to receive a cash payment with respect thereto equal to the product of (a) the excess, if any, of the Common Stock Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share of such Option _multiplied by_ (b) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Option (the "Total Option Cash Payments"). Such payments shall be made through the Companys payroll systems and the Company shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from such payments any amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payments under the Code and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or any provision of state, local or foreign tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Company, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Option in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Company. As provided herein, the Company Stock Option Plan (and any feature of any Benefit Plan or other plan, program or arrangement providing for the issuance or grant of any other interest in respect of the capital stock of the Company or any Subsidiary) shall terminate as of the Effective Time. As of the Effective Time, all Options shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically cease to exist and each holder of an Option shall cease to have any right, with respect thereto, except for the right to receive cash for any Options exercised in accordance with the terms set forth in this Section 2.8. 

   ##### 

  

  

ARTICLE III

At the Effective Time and without any further action on the part of the Company and Merger Sub, the articles of incorporation of the Company, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time until thereafter further amended as provided therein and under the PBCL, shall be the articles of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation following the Merger. 

  

 Section 3.2 _Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation_. At the Effective Time and without any further action on the part of the Company and Merger Sub, the bylaws of the Merger Sub shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation and thereafter may be amended or repealed in accordance with their terms or the articles of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation and as provided by applicable Law. 

  

 Section 3.3 _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation_. From and after the Effective Time, until successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified in accordance with applicable Law, (a) the directors of Merger Sub at the Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation and (b) the officers of the Company at the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation, _provided_ , _however_ , that Marvin Rounick and Warren Weiner shall resign from all positions as officers and directors of the Company and its Subsidiaries, effective as of the Effective Time. 

  

ARTICLE IV 

   

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY  

  

 Except as set forth in the Company SEC Reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") prior to the date hereof or in the Disclosure Letter delivered by the Company to Parent prior to the execution of this Agreement (the "Company Disclosure Letter"), which identifies exceptions only by specific Section or subsection references ( _provided_ , that disclosure made with respect to any Section and/or subsection will also be deemed to be disclosure against other Sections and/or subsections of this Agreement to the extent that it is readily apparent that such disclosure is applicable to such other Section and/or subsections), the Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as follows:

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES 
 OF PARENT AND MERGER SUB 

   

 Except as set forth in the Disclosure Letter delivered by Parent to the Company prior to the execution of this Agreement (the "Parent Disclosure Letter"), which identifies exceptions only by specific Section or subsection references ( _provided_ , that disclosure made with respect to any Section and/or subsection will also be deemed to be disclosure against other Sections and/or subsections of this Agreement to the extent that it is readily apparent that such disclosure is applicable to such other Section and/or subsections), Parent and Merger Sub hereby jointly and severally represent and warrant to the Company as follows: 

  

 Section 5.1 _Organization_. Each of Parent and Merger Sub is a limited liability company and corporation, respectively, duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization and has the requisite power and authority to own, operate or lease its properties and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted, except where the failure to be so organized, existing or in good standing or to have such power or authority would not prevent, materially delay or materially impede the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Parent owns beneficially and of record all of the outstanding capital stock of Merger Sub free and clear of all security interests, liens, claims, pledges, agreements, limitations in voting rights, charges or other encumbrances of any nature whatsoever.

This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by Parent and Merger Sub and, assuming due authorization, execution and delivery hereof by the Company, constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of each of Parent and Merger Sub enforceable against each of Parent and Merger Sub in accordance with its terms, subject to the effects of bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and other similar Laws relating to or affecting creditors rights generally, general equitable principles (whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law) and any implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. 

  

 Section 5.3 _No Conflict; Required Filings and Consents_. (a) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub, do not and will not (i) conflict with or violate the respective articles of incorporation or bylaws (or similar organizational documents) of Parent or Merger Sub, (ii) assuming that all consents, approvals and authorizations contemplated by clauses (i) through (v) of subsection (b) below have been obtained, and all filings described in such clauses have been made, conflict with or violate any Law, rule, regulation, order, judgment or decree applicable to Parent or Merger Sub or by which either of them or any of their respective properties are bound or (iii) result in any breach or violation of or constitute a default (or an event which with notice or lapse of time or both would become a default) or result in the loss of a benefit under, or give rise to any right of termination, cancellation, amendment or acceleration of, any Contracts to which Parent or Merger Sub is 

   ##### 

  

    

a party or by which Parent or Merger Sub or its or any of their respective
properties are bound, except, in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii), for any
such conflict, violation, breach, default, acceleration, loss, right or other
occurrence which would not prevent, materially delay or materially impede the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. 

  

 (b) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by each of Parent and Merger Sub and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby by each of Parent and Merger Sub do not and will not require any consent, approval, authorization or permit of, action by, filing with or notification to, any Governmental Entity, except for (i) the applicable requirements, if any, of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the HSR Act and state securities, takeover and "blue sky" laws, (ii) applicable Nasdaq listing requirements, (iii) the filing with the Department of State of the Articles of Merger as required by the PBCL and (iv) any such consent, approval, authorization, permit, action, filing or notification the failure of which to make or obtain would not prevent, materially delay or materially impede the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. 

  

 Section 5.4 _Absence of Litigation_. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no suits, claims, actions, proceedings, arbitrations, mediations or investigations pending or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened against Parent or any of its subsidiaries, other than any such suit, claim, action, proceeding or investigation that would not prevent, materially delay or materially impede the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. As of the date of this Agreement, neither Parent nor any of its subsidiaries nor any of their respective properties is or are subject to any Order, writ, judgment, injunction, decree or award that would prevent, materially delay or materially impede the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. 

  

 Section 5.5 _Proxy Statement_.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent and Merger Sub make no representation or warranty with respect to any information supplied by the Company or any of its representatives which is contained or incorporated by reference in the Proxy Statement. 

  

 Section 5.6 _Brokers_. No broker, finder or investment banker (other than Bear Stearns, whose fees shall be paid by Parent) is entitled to any brokerage, finders or other fee or commission in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement based upon arrangements made by and on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub. 

  

 Section 5.7 _Financing_. (a)Section 5.7(a) of Parent Disclosure Letter sets forth a true, accurate and complete copy of the executed commitment letter (the "Debt Commitment Letter"), pursuant to which, and subject to the terms and conditions thereof, the lender party thereto has committed to lend the amounts set forth therein to Parent for the purpose of funding the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the "Debt Financing"). Section 5.7(a) of Parent Disclosure Letter sets forth a true, accurate and complete copy of the executed commitment letter (the "Equity Commitment Letter" and together with the Debt Commitment Letter, the "Financing Commitments") from the investor party thereto (the "Investor") pursuant to which the Investor has committed to invest the amounts set forth therein (the "Equity Financing" and together with the Debt Financing, the "Financing"). There are no other agreements, side letters or arrangements relating to the Equity Financing, including any syndication thereof, except as set forth in the Equity Commitment Letter. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (b) As of the date hereof, the Financing Commitments are in full force and effect and have not been withdrawn or terminated or otherwise amended or modified in any respect. Each of the Financing Commitments, in the form so delivered, is a legal, valid and binding obligation of Parent and Merger Sub and the other parties thereto. There are no other agreements, side letters or arrangements relating to the Financing Commitments that could affect the availability of the Debt Financing or the Equity Financing. To the knowledge of Parent, no event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a default or breach on the part of Parent or Merger Sub under any term or condition of the Financing Commitments, and neither Parent nor Merger Sub has reason to believe that it will be unable to satisfy on a timely basis any term or condition of closing to be satisfied by it contained in the Financing Commitments. Parent and/or Merger Sub have fully paid any and all commitment fees or other fees required by the Financing Commitments to be paid on or before the date of this Agreement. The aggregate proceeds from the Financing constitute all of the financing required to be provided by Parent for the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, and are sufficient for the satisfaction of all of Parents and Merger Subs obligations under this Agreement, including the payment of the aggregate Merger Consideration (including any refinancing of indebtedness of Parent or the Company required in connection therewith). The Financing Commitments contain all of the conditions precedent to the obligations of the parties thereunder to make the Financing available to Parent on the terms therein. 

   

 Section 5.8 _Operations of Parent and Merger Sub_. Each of Parent and Merger Sub has been formed solely for the purpose of engaging in the transactions contemplated hereby and prior to the Effective Time will have engaged in no other business activities and will have incurred no liabilities or obligations other than as contemplated herein and the Financing.

All of the issued and outstanding share capital of Merger Sub is, and at the Effective Time will be, owned by Parent or a direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent. 

  

 Section 5.9 _Solvency_. Assuming that (a) the conditions to the obligation of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the Merger have been satisfied or waived, (b) any estimates, projections or forecasts prepared by the Company or its Representatives and made available to Parent, Merger Sub or their Representatives have been prepared in good faith based upon reasonable assumptions, and (c) the financial statements included in the Company SEC Reports fairly present the consolidated financial condition of the Company and its subsidiaries as at the end of the periods covered thereby and the consolidated results of operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries for the periods covered thereby, then immediately following the Effective Time and after giving effect to all of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Debt Financing, the payment of the aggregate consideration to which the shareholders of the Company are entitled under _Articles I and II_ , funding of any obligations of the Surviving Corporation or its subsidiaries which become due or payable by the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries in connection with, or as a result of, the Merger and payment of all related fees and expenses, the Surviving Corporation and each of its Subsidiaries will not: (i) be insolvent (either because its financial condition is such that the sum of its debts, including contingent and other liabilities, is greater than the fair market value of its assets or because the fair saleable value of its assets is less than the amount required to pay its probable liability on its existing debts, including contingent and other liabilities, as they mature); (ii) have unreasonably small capital for the operation of the businesses in which it is engaged or proposed to be engaged; or (iii) have incurred debts, or be expected to incur debts, including contingent and other liabilities, beyond its ability to pay them as they become due. 

  

 Section 5.10 _Ownership of Shares_. As of the date of this Agreement, none of Parent, Merger Sub or their respective affiliates owns (directly or indirectly, beneficially or of record) any shares of 

   ##### 

  

    

Company Capital Stock and none of Parent, Merger Sub or their respective
affiliates holds any rights to acquire or vote any shares of Company Capital
Stock except pursuant to this Agreement. 

  

 Section 5.11 _Vote/Approval Required_. No vote or consent of the holders of any class or series of capital stock of Parent is necessary to approve this Agreement or the Merger or the transactions contemplated hereby. The vote or consent of Parent, or of a direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent, as the sole shareholder of Merger Sub, (which vote or consent shall have occurred prior to the Effective Time), is the only vote or consent of the holders of any class or series of capital stock of Merger Sub necessary to approve this Agreement or the Merger or the transactions contemplated hereby. 

  

 Section 5.12 _No Other Representations or Warranties_. Except for the representations and warranties contained in this _Article V_, the Company acknowledges that none of Parent, Merger Sub or any other person on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub makes any other express or implied representation or warranty with respect to Parent or Merger Sub or with respect to any other information provided to the Company.

 (c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if, at any time prior to obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval, the Company receives a Competing Proposal which the Board of Directors of the Company concludes in good faith constitutes a Superior Proposal, the Board of Directors of the Company may (i) effect a Change of Recommendation and/or (ii) terminate this Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the Board of Directors may not effect a Change of Recommendation relating to a Superior Proposal pursuant to the foregoing clause (i) or terminate this Agreement pursuant to the foregoing clause (ii) unless the Company shall have provided prior written notice to Parent and Merger Sub, at least four (4) Business Days in advance of such Change of Recommendation or such termination, of its intention to effect a Change of Recommendation in response to such Superior Proposal or terminate this Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal, which notice shall specify the material terms and conditions of any such Superior Proposal (including the identity of the party making such Superior Proposal) and, in the event the Company intends to terminate this Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal, a copy of the relevant proposed transaction agreement with the other transaction documents; _provided_ , _further_ , that, in the event of any material revisions to the Superior Proposal, the Company shall be required to deliver a new written notice to Parent and to comply with the requirements above with respect to such new written notice (it being understood and agreed that any such amendment shall require a new four (4) Business Day period). During any such four (4) Business Day period, the Company shall take into account any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent in determining whether such Competing Proposal still constitutes a Superior Proposal. 

   

 (d) As used in this Agreement, 

   

 (i) the term "Competing Proposal" means any written bona fide proposal made by a third party relating to any direct or indirect acquisition or purchase of 25% or more of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or 25% or more of the combined voting power of the shares of Company Capital Stock, any tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would result in any Person beneficially owning 25% or more of the combined voting power of the shares of Company Capital Stock or any merger, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in which the other party thereto or its shareholders will own 25% or more of the combined voting power of the parent entity resulting from any such transaction, other than transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and 

  

 (ii) the term "Superior Proposal" means a Competing Proposal after the date, and not in breach, of this Agreement or any standstill or confidentiality agreement applicable to the offer and that the Board of Directors of the Company in good faith, after consultation with its legal and financial advisors, and consideration of all terms and conditions of such offer or proposal, determines would, if consummated, result in a transaction that is more favorable to the Companys shareholders than the transactions contemplated hereby, after taking into account such factors (including likelihood of consummation in light of all financial, regulatory, legal and other aspects of such proposal) as the Board of Directors of the Company considers to be appropriate after giving effect to any modifications proposed to be made to this Agreement or any other offer by Parent after Parents receipt of notice under Section 

   ##### 

  

 

7.3(c); _provided_ that, for purposes of the definition of "Superior
Proposal," the references to "25% or more" in the definition of Competing
Proposal shall be deemed to be references to "a majority." 

   

 (e) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the Board of Directors of the Company from (i) disclosing to the Companys shareholders a position contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii) making any disclosure to its shareholders if the Board of Directors of the Company has reasonably determined in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with any applicable Law; _provided_ that disclosures under this _Section 7.3(e)_ shall not be a basis, in themselves, for Parent to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.1(f)_. 

   

 Section 7.4 _Reasonable Best Efforts; Cooperation_. 

  

 (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each party will use its reasonable best efforts to (i) take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (ii) seek to obtain all necessary consents, waivers and approvals from third parties reasonably requested by Parent to be obtained in connection with the Merger under the Leased Real Property; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the Company or any of its subsidiaries be required to pay prior to the Effective Time any fee, penalty or other consideration to the Landlord or other person to obtain any such consent, waiver or approval. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each party hereto agrees to make an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable and in any event within fifteen (15) Business Days of the date hereof and to respond as promptly as practicable to any request for additional information and documentary material pursuant to the HSR Act and to take all other actions necessary, proper or advisable to cause the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act as soon as practicable. 

   

 (b) Each of Parent and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, shall, in connection with the efforts referenced in _Section 7.4(a)_ to obtain all requisite approvals and authorizations for the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Law, use its reasonable best efforts to (i) cooperate in all respects with each other in connection with any filing or submission and in connection with any investigation or other inquiry, including any proceeding initiated by a private party; (ii) keep the other party reasonably informed of any communication received by such party from, or given by such party to, the Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC"), the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (the "DOJ") or any other U.S. or foreign Governmental Entity and of any communication received or given in connection with any proceeding by a private party, in each case regarding any of the transactions contemplated hereby; and (iii) permit the other party to review any communication given by it to, and consult with each other in advance of any meeting or conference with, the FTC, the DOJ or any other Governmental Entity or, in connection with any proceeding by a private party, with any other person, and to the extent permitted by the FTC, the DOJ or such other applicable Governmental Entity or other person, give the other party the opportunity to attend and participate in such meetings and conferences. As used in this Agreement, the term "Antitrust Law" means the Sherman Act, as amended, the Clayton Act, as amended, the HSR Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, and all other federal, state and foreign, if any, statutes, rules, regulations, orders, decrees, administrative and judicial doctrines and other Laws that are designed or intended to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint of trade or lessening of competition through merger or acquisition. 

   

 (c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties contained in  _Sections 7.4(a)_ and _(b)_ , if any objections are asserted with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby   ##### 

  

  

  

under any Antitrust Law or if any suit is instituted (or threatened to be
instituted) by the FTC, the DOJ or any other applicable Governmental Entity
or any private party challenging any of the transactions contemplated hereby
as violative of any Antitrust Law or which would otherwise prevent,
materially impede or materially delay the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall use its
best efforts to resolve any such objections or suits so as to permit
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

   

 (d) Subject to the obligations under _Section 7.4(c)_, in the event that any administrative or judicial action or proceeding is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) by a Governmental Entity or private party challenging the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement, or any other agreement contemplated hereby, each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall cooperate in all respects with each other and use its respective reasonable best efforts to contest and resist any such action or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other Order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

   

 Section 7.5 _Employee Benefit Matters_. 

  

 (a) During the one-year period commencing on the Effective Time, Parent shall provide or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide to employees of the Company and any of its Subsidiaries who become employees of the Surviving Corporation ("Company Employees") compensation and benefits that are in the aggregate, no less favorable than the compensation and benefits being provided to Company Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time under the Company Benefit Plans;  _provided_ that, for purposes of determining whether benefits are in the aggregate, no less favorable than the compensation and benefits being provided to Company Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time under the Company Benefit Plans, equity-based compensation, increases in co-pays, deductibles or employee cost with respect to coverage under the Companys medical plan shall not be taken into account. 

   

 (b) Without limiting Section 7.5(a), (i) during the one-year period commencing on the Effective Time, Parent shall provide or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide to Company Employees who experience a termination of employment severance benefits that are no less favorable than the severance benefits that would have been provided to such employees upon a termination of employment immediately prior to the Effective Time pursuant to the Companys past practice as in effect prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) Parent shall honor, fulfill and discharge, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to honor, fulfill and discharge, the Companys and its Subsidiaries obligations to any Company Employees or other participants under any Company Benefit Plan, without any amendment or change that is inconsistent with Parents obligations under this Section 7.5. During the period specified in clause (i) above, severance benefits to Company Employees shall be determined without taking into account any reduction after the Effective Time in the compensation paid to Company Employees and used to determine severance benefits. 

   

 (c) For purposes of eligibility and vesting (but not for purposes of benefit accrual under any defined benefit plan) under the Employee Benefit Plans of Parent, the Company, the Company Subsidiaries and their respective Affiliates providing benefits to any Company Employees after the Closing (the "New Plans"), and for purposes of accrual of vacation and other paid time off and severance benefits under New Plans, each Company Employee shall be credited with his or her years of service with the Company, the Company Subsidiaries and their respective Affiliates (and any additional service with any predecessor employer) before the Closing, to the same extent as such Company Employee was entitled, before the Closing, to credit for such service under any similar Company Benefit Plan. In   ##### 

  

  

  

addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing: (i) each
Company Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate, without any
waiting time, in any and all New Plans to the extent coverage under such New
Plan replaces coverage under a comparable Company Benefit Plan in which such
Company Employee participated immediately before the replacement; and (ii)
for purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical
and/or vision benefits to any Company Employee, Parent shall cause all pre-
existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New
Plan to be waived for such Company Employee and his or her
covered dependents, and Parent shall cause any eligible expenses incurred by
such Company Employee and his or her covered dependents under any Company
Benefit Plan during the portion of the plan year of the New Plan ending on
the date such Company Employees participation in the corresponding New
Plan begins to be taken into account under such New Plan for purposes of
satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements
applicable to such Company Employee and his or her covered dependents for the
applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such
New Plan. 

   

 Section 7.6 _Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance_. 

  

 (a) Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to exculpation and indemnification for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time (including any matters arising in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement), now existing in favor of the current or former directors, officers or employees, as the case may be, of the Company or its Subsidiaries as provided in their respective articles of association, certificates of incorporation or bylaws (or comparable organization documents) or in any agreement provided or made available to Parent prior to the date hereof shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect. Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) indemnify, defend and hold harmless, and advance expenses to Indemnitees with respect to all acts or omissions by them in their capacities as such at any time prior to the Effective Time, to the fullest extent required by: (i) the articles of incorporation or bylaws (or equivalent organizational documents) of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates as in effect on the date of this Agreement; and (ii) any indemnification agreements of the Company or its Subsidiaries or other applicable contract as in effect on the date of this Agreement provided or made available to Parent prior to the date hereof. 

   

 (b) Without limiting the provisions of _Section 7.6(a)_, during the period ending on the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, Parent will, to the full extent permitted by applicable Law: (i) indemnify and hold harmless each Indemnitee against and from any costs or expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, to the extent such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation arises out of or pertains to: (A) any action or omission or alleged action or omission in such Indemnitees capacity as a director, officer or employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates; or (B) the Merger, this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby; and (ii) pay in advance of the final disposition of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation the expenses (including attorneys fees) of any Indemnitee upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such Indemnitee to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that such Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this _Section 7.6(b)_ or elsewhere in this Agreement, neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation not to) settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment or otherwise seek termination with respect to any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation for which indemnification may be sought under this _Section 7.6(b)_ unless such settlement, compromise, consent or termination includes an unconditional release of all Indemnitees from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (c) Parent will provide, or cause the Surviving Corporation to provide, for a period of not less than six (6) years after the Effective Time, (i) the Indemnitees who are insured under the Companys directors and officers insurance and indemnification policy with an insurance and indemnification policy that provides coverage for events occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (the "DandO Insurance") that is no less favorable in any material respect in the aggregate than the existing policy of the Company or, if substantially equivalent insurance coverage is unavailable, the best available coverage; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not be required to pay an annual premium for the DandO Insurance in excess of 300% of the annual premium currently paid by the Company for such insurance;  _provided_ , _further_ , that if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount, Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding such amount, or (ii) a non-cancellable "tail" coverage insurance policy under the Companys current directors and officers liability insurance policies (providing coverage not less favorable than provided by such insurance in effect on the date hereof) with respect to matters existing or occurring prior to the Effective Time. 

   

 (d) The Indemnitees to whom this _Section 7.6_ applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this _Section 7.6_. The provisions of this _Section 7.6_ are intended to be for the benefit of each Indemnitee, his or her successors, heirs or representatives. 

   

 (e) Notwithstanding anything contained in _Section 10.1_ or _Section 10.10_ hereof to the contrary, this _Section 7.6_ shall survive the consummation of the Merger indefinitely and shall be binding, jointly and severally, on all successors and assigns of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, and shall be enforceable by the Indemnitees and their successors, heirs or representatives. In the event that the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or transfers or conveys all or a majority of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation shall succeed to the obligations set forth in this _Section 7.6_. 

   

 Section 7.7 _Public Announcements_. 

  

 (a) Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub agrees that no public release or announcement concerning the transactions contemplated hereby shall be issued by any party without the prior written consent of the Company and Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), except as such release or announcement may be required by Law or exchange listing requirements to which the relevant party is subject or submits, wherever situated, in which case the party required to make the release or announcement shall use its reasonable best efforts to allow each other party reasonable time to comment on such release or announcement in advance of such issuance, it being understood that the final form and content of any such release or announcement, to the extent so required, shall be at the final discretion of the disclosing party. 

   

 (b) The Company agrees that it shall provide Parent prior notice of, and reasonable opportunity to comment on, any communication between the Company and its employees, suppliers or landlords with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

In the event that any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable in the manner or from the sources contemplated in the Financing Commitments, (A) Parent shall immediately notify the Company and (B) Parent and Merger Sub shall use their reasonable best efforts to arrange to obtain any such portion from alternative sources, on terms that are no more adverse to the Company, as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event, including entering into definitive agreements with respect thereto (such definitive agreements entered into pursuant to the first or second sentence of this _Section 7.9(a)_ being referred to as the "Financing Agreements"). Parent and Merger Sub shall, shall cause their Affiliates to, and shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause their Representatives to, comply with the terms, and satisfy on a timely basis the conditions, of the Financing Commitments, any alternative financing commitments, the Financing Agreements and any related fee and engagement letters. Any material breach of the Financing Commitments, the Financing Agreements, any alternative financing commitment and any related fee and engagement letter by Parent or Merger Sub shall be deemed a breach by Parent of this _Section 7.9(a)_. Parent shall (x) furnish complete, correct and executed copies of the Financing Agreements promptly upon their execution, (y) give the Company prompt notice of any breach by any party of any of the Financing Commitments, any alternative financing commitment or the Financing Arrangements of which Parent or Merger Sub becomes aware or any termination thereof and (z) otherwise keep the Company reasonably informed of the status of its efforts to arrange the Financing (or any replacement thereof). 

   

 (b) The Company shall and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, at Parents sole expense, cooperate in connection with the arrangement of the Financing as may be reasonably requested by Parent ( _provided_ that, subject to the following sentence, such requested cooperation does not interfere with the ongoing operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries). Such cooperation by the Company shall include, at the request of Parent, (i) agreeing to enter into such agreements, and to deliver such officers certificates (including solvency certificates), as are contemplated by the Financing Commitments and as are, in the good faith determination of the Persons executing such officers certificates, accurate, and agreeing to pledge, grant security interests in, and otherwise grant liens on, the Companys assets pursuant to such agreements as may be reasonably requested, _provided_ that no obligation of the Company under any such agreement, pledge, grant or certificate shall be effective until the Effective Time, (ii) providing to the lenders specified in the Financing Commitments financial and other information (including financial projections) in the Companys possession contemplated by the Financing Commitments, making the Companys senior officers available to attend rating agency presentations and bank meetings and to otherwise assist the lenders specified in the Financing Commitments and otherwise cooperate in connection with the consummation of the Financing, (iii) obtaining or providing customary accountants comfort letters and consents, legal opinions, survey and title insurance as reasonably requested by Parent, along with such assistance and cooperation from such independent accountants and other advisors as reasonably requested by Parent, and (iv) taking all corporate actions, subject to the occurrence of the Effective Time, reasonably requested by Parent to permit the consummation of the Financing.

If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to  _Section 9.1_, this Agreement shall become void and of no effect with no liability on the part of any party hereto, except (i) as set forth in _Section 9.4_, (ii) that the agreements contained in this _Section 9.3_, and in _Sections 10.3_, _10.6_ , _10.7_ and  _10.10_ , shall survive the termination hereof and (iii) that, subject to Section 9.4(b), no such termination shall relieve any party of any liability or damages resulting from any breach by that party of this Agreement. 

  

 Section 9.4 _Fees and Expenses_. 

  

 (a) Whether or not the Merger is consummated, all Expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party incurring such Expenses, except (i) Expenses incurred in connection with the filing, printing and mailing of the Proxy Statement (including SEC filing fees), (ii) the filing fees for the premerger notification and report forms under the HSR Act, and (iii) all other expenses not directly attributable to any one of the parties, each of which shall be shared equally by Parent and the Company. As used in this Agreement, "Expenses" means the out-of-pocket fees and expenses of the partys independent advisor, counsel and accountants, incurred by the party or on its behalf in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, and the out-of-pocket expenses of the preparation, printing, filing and mailing of the Proxy Statement and the solicitation of shareholder approvals related to the transactions contemplated hereby. 

   

 (b) (i) If this Agreement is terminated (A) by either the Company or Parent pursuant to  _Section 9.1(b)_, _(d)_ , or _(f)_ and, prior to the Company Shareholders Meeting, a Competing Proposal has been publicly proposed or disclosed (whether or not conditional or withdrawn) or made known or (B) by the Company pursuant to _Section 9.1(g)_ or by Parent pursuant to _Section 9.1(i)_, then the Company shall promptly, but in no event later than two (2) Business Days after the date of such termination, pay Parent by wire transfer of same day funds a fee equal to $15,000,000 (the "Termination Fee"); _provided_ , _however_ , that no Termination Fee will be payable by the Company pursuant to clause (A) above unless and until within 12 months of such termination the Company or any of its Subsidiaries enters into a definitive agreement relating to such Competing Proposal or consummates the transactions contemplated by such Competing Proposal with the person who made the Competing Proposal referred to in clause (A) above, in which case such Termination Fee shall be paid within five (5) Business Days following the execution of such definitive agreement or consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Competing Proposal. For purposes of the preceding proviso of this Section 9.4(b), each reference to 25% in the definition of "Competing Proposal" shall be deemed to be 40%. Upon payment of the Termination Fee, the Company shall have no further liability to Parent with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. 

   

 (c) If this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to _Section 9.1(e)_ or  _(h)_ then, Parent shall pay to the Company by wire transfer of same day funds a fee equal to $15,000,000 (the "Parent Termination Fee") such payment to be made within five (5) Business Days after written notice   ##### 

  

  

  

of such termination. The Companys receipt of payment of the Parent
Termination Fee shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Company and its
Affiliates against Parent, Merger Sub and any of their respective current,
former or future directors, officers, employees, agents, partners, managers,
members, stockholders, assignees, representatives or Affiliates for any loss
or damage suffered in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby. 

   

 (d) Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges that the agreements contained in  _Sections 9.4(b)_ and _(c)_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In the event that the Company shall fail to pay the Company Termination Fee when due or Parent shall fail to pay the Parent Termination Fee when due, the Company or Parent, as the case may be, shall reimburse the other party for all reasonable costs and expenses actually incurred or accrued by such other party (including reasonable fees and expenses of counsel) in connection with any action (including the filing of any lawsuit) taken to collect payment of such amounts, together with interest on such unpaid amounts at the prime lending rate prevailing during such period as published in The Wall Street Journal, calculated on a daily basis from the date such amounts were required to be paid to the date of actual payment.
