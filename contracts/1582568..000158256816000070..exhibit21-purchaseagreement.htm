upon reasonable notice, Seller shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to
provide to Buyer, or cause to be provided to Buyer, access during normal
business hours throughout the Interim Period to the Purchased Terminal
Facilities, and shall provide Seller (and its external auditors and
accountants, to the extent necessary for financial reporting purposes) access
to the Books and Records and other data and information relating exclusively
to or used exclusively in connection with the operations of the Purchased
Terminal Facilities in Seller's possession or control ("Data"); provided that,
Buyer shall not have the right to conduct any environmental sampling or
testing at or around the Purchased Assets. During the Interim Period, Seller

available, or cause to be made available, such personnel of Seller during
normal business hours as may reasonably be requested for the furnishing of
such Data; and further provided that Data shall not include any (i) data or
information relating to Seller's operations or businesses other than the
Purchased Assets, or (ii) data or information subject to legal privilege or
obligations of confidentiality owed to Third Parties. During the Interim
Period, Buyer shall not contact or communicate with any employees of Seller or
Seller's Affiliates, or any customers of, distributors of or suppliers of the
Purchased Terminal Facilities 

without Seller's prior written consent; provided that, for the avoidance of
doubt, as long as Buyer or any Affiliate of Buyer does not disclose or use
Confidential Information (as that term is defined in the Confidentiality
Agreement) contrary to the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, neither
Buyer nor any Affiliate of Buyer shall be restricted in its ability to have
contact with any customer, distributor or supplier of Seller or Seller's
Affiliates to the extent Buyer or any Affiliate of Buyer has an existing
relationship with such party. Buyer shall indemnify and hold Seller Group
harmless against any and all Losses suffered in connection with the exercise
of Buyer's rights under this Section 6.1(a), including any Losses arising out
of Buyer's access to the Purchased Assets, regardless of cause or of any
negligence, concurrent negligence or strict liability of any member of Seller
Group. Notwithstanding any provision in this Purchase Agreement to the
contrary, Buyer's obligations under this Section 6.1(a) shall survive the
termination of this Purchase Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby.

(b) Conduct of Business. From and after the date hereof and up to and
including the Closing Date (or earlier termination of this Purchase Agreement)
(the "Interim Period"), except (i) as may be required by emergency or force
majeure conditions, or (ii) for all reasonably necessary actions taken in
connection with, in contemplation of or in preparation for the sale of the
Purchased Assets, the Closing and any other transaction contemplated by this
Purchase Agreement, Seller shall operate the Purchased Terminal Facilities in
the Ordinary Course of Business or as otherwise contemplated by this Purchase
Agreement. During the Interim Period, the Seller shall maintain the Purchased
Assets in the ordinary course and use their Commercially Reasonable Efforts
consistent with past practice to keep available the services of employees, and
maintain existing relationships with any Governmental Authority, licensors,
suppliers, distributors, clients, and others having business relationships
with them related to the Purchased Assets, including by using their
Commercially Reasonable Efforts to (i) (A) renew, extend or otherwise modify
any Assigned Contracts scheduled to expire during the Interim Period in
consultation with Buyer on terms and conditions that are commercially no less
favorable than the terms of the existing contract, and (B) to include in such
Assigned Contracts an assignment clause that will allow the assignment of such
Specified Assumed Contracts to Buyer and (ii) continue the Remediation and
Monitoring Projects.

(c) PBF Refinery Pipeline Connection Project. Seller agrees to design,
engineer, procure and construct the PBF Refinery Pipeline Connection Project
at Seller's expense up to a total expenditure of four million dollars

Ordinary Course of Business and as such Project is detailed in Schedule
6.1(c). In the event Seller is unable to complete the PBF Refinery Pipeline
Connection Project before the Closing Date, Buyer shall complete such Project
after Closing but shall receive a credit to the Purchase Price from Seller
equal to the difference between the amounts actually expended by Seller in
connection with the PBF Refinery Pipeline Connection Project as determined in
accordance with Schedule 6.1(c) and the Connection Project Cap. All materials,
equipment and contract rights of Seller relating to the PBF Refinery Pipeline
Connection Project shall constitute Purchased Assets. Buyer shall return to
Seller an amount of cash equal to any unutilized Purchase Price credit upon
completion of the PBF Refinery Pipeline Connection Project. 

(d) Paulsboro Terminal Contract. Seller agrees that if Contract
#6717-15-08-5108 (the "Specified Assigned Contract"), which is one of the
Assigned Contracts, is terminated before December 31, 2016 when, following
Closing, Buyer is not in default of the Specified Assigned Contract, Seller
shall have contractual obligations equal to the Specified Assigned Contract.
At Closing, Seller agrees to execute the contract attached as Exhibit L, the
"Paulsboro Terminal Contract," which shall become effective if and when the
Specified Assigned Contract is terminated, provided that Buyer has used
commercially reasonable efforts, from the period Buyer receives notification
of termination of the Specified Assigned Contract until the Paulsboro Terminal
Contract would become effective, to enter into a contract with a Third Party
on substantially similar terms to the Specified Assigned Contract, and Buyer
has been unable to obtain such contract. If effective, the Paulsboro Terminal
Contract shall have a term that ends on December 31, 2016.

(e) Industrial Site Remediation Act ("ISRA"). Purchaser and Seller acknowledge
that the NJ Property only constitutes an "Industrial Establishment" as that
term is defined under the New Jersey Industrial Site Recovery Act, N.J.S.A.
13:1K et seq. and N.J.A.C. 7:26B et seq. ("ISRA"). The parties agree to comply

ISRA, including the preparation of any Remediation Certification, Preliminary
Assessment, Site Investigation and/or Remedial Investigation (collectively,
the "ISRA Documentation"), and the cost of such ISRA Documentation shall be at

remediation expenses or costs associated with a modification of the
Remediation and Monitoring Projects under a Remedial Action Workplan shall be
subject to the provisions of Section 6.1(j)(ii).

(ii) Both Seller and Purchaser agree to cooperate in order to control the
costs and expenses incurred to comply with ISRA, including, but not limited
to, the use of Institutional Controls (as defined in N.J.A.C. 7:26B-1.4) as
part of any required remediation.

(f) Transition Services Agreement. Seller agrees to provide the transition

(g) Delivery of Books and Records. Seller shall deliver all Books and Records,
to Buyer as promptly as practicable but in any event within one hundred eighty
(180) days after the Closing Date. Seller is not obligated to create any Books
and Records for Buyer or to provide them in a form or format other than the
form or format in which they exist as of the date hereof or to provide them to
Buyer in any sequence or priority except as otherwise expressly provided
herein. Books and Records will be provided to Buyer in the formats and on
media used by Seller in the Ordinary Course of Business, or native to the
system in which such data or information resides. If Buyer requests any Books
and Records in a specific format or report form, and Seller agrees, in its
sole discretion, Buyer will be responsible for all reasonable costs incurred
by Seller to provide such Books and Records in such requested format or report
form. 

(h) Title Matters.

(i) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Date, Buyer shall
cause Fidelity National Title Insurance Company ("Title Company"), whose
address is 1400 Post Oak Blvd., Suite 740, Houston, Texas 77056, to issue
standard commitments for title insurance (each a "Title Commitment" and
collectively, the "Title Commitments") covering the Fee Owned Property. The
Title Company shall provide a copy of such Title Commitments to Buyer along
with a true, complete, legible and where applicable, recorded, copy of all
documents and instruments referred to or identified in the Title Commitments.
Each Title Commitment shall commit the Title Company to issue to Buyer an
owner's policy of title insurance on the basic form of policy then commonly in
use by the Title Company in the applicable state. Buyer shall pay all costs
related to such policies, including without limitation any title search or
report fees and the basic premium for such policies as well as any additional
premium charged for (A) any "comprehensive," "extended coverage" or similar
endorsement (if available), (B) the deletion of any exception from the
policies, or (C) the issuance of any other endorsements to the policies.
Seller shall be under no obligation to make any payments, assume any
liabilities or take any actions beyond those required in this Purchase
Agreement in order to facilitate the issuance of any endorsements or the
making of any modifications to such policies. The issuance of any endorsements
or deletions requested by Buyer shall not be a condition to Closing.

(ii) Within fifteen (15) days after receiving the Title Commitments, Buyer
shall notify Seller in writing of any encumbrance or defect to the Fee Owned
Property (excluding Permitted Liens) that would cause a Material Adverse
Effect (the "Title Objections"). Buyer may not object to any Permitted Liens.
The notice of Buyer's Title Objections (the "Title Objections Notice") shall
include (i) a description of the alleged Title Objections and (ii) the Fee
Owned Property affected.

(iii) Seller shall elect, in its sole discretion, to do one of the following
with regard to such Title Objections: (A) cause such encumbrance or defect to
be removed, or (B) settle such Title Objections through a payment to Buyer, in
an amount agreed upon by the Parties, not to exceed five million dollars
($5,000,000) in the aggregate; provided that if the Parties are unable to
agree upon a settlement, the transaction shall proceed to Closing, after which
such settlement shall be determined by a panel of three (3) neutral real
estate attorneys, with one attorney to be selected by each Party and the final
attorney shall be selected by the two (2) other attorneys, as a post-Closing
adjustment to the Purchase Price, not to exceed five million dollars
($5,000,000) in the aggregate. Seller shall notify Buyer of its election to
cure or settle the Title Objections within ten (10) days of receiving such
Title Objection Notice. In the event that the value of the Title Objections
exceeds five million dollars ($5,000,000) in the aggregate, Seller may elect
not to cure or settle the Title Objections under (A) or (B), above, and Buyer
may terminate this Purchase Agreement without liability.

(iv) Buyer's sole and exclusive remedies for any Title Objections shall be the
remedies set forth in Section 6.1(h)(iii). 

(i) Financial Statements. Within 7 Business Days of the Effective Date, upon
the written request of Buyer, at Buyer's sole cost and expense and only to the
extent necessary to comply with the disclosure obligations of Buyer or its
Affiliates under Rule 3-05 of Regulation S-X, Seller shall use reasonable
commercial efforts to (i) prepare historical financial statements required by
Rule 3-05 of Regulation S-X and deliver them to Buyer for its comment and
review no less than 10 days prior to the filing deadline stipulated by Rule
3-05 or (ii) use reasonable commercial efforts to provide Buyer and its
representatives (including its legal counsel and independent auditors)
reasonable access during normal business hours to such historical financial
information that is necessary to allow Buyer to prepare the historical
financial statements required by Rule 3-05 of Regulation S-X, and to enable
the audit and review thereof by an independent registered accounting firm,
within the timeframe stipulated by Rule 3-05. The obligations of Seller to
disclose or provide reasonable access to any such historical financial
information shall terminate one (1) year after the Effective Date. Buyer shall
reimburse Seller for its and its Affiliates' reasonable internal costs and
out-of-pocket costs associated with this Section 6.1(i). Buyer agrees that it
shall consult with Seller in advance of requesting any such access with a view
towards establishing a mutually agreeable plan for such access that shall not
unreasonably interfere with the normal operation of Seller, and Buyer shall
indemnify Seller for any and all Losses incurred by Seller with respect to
such matter.

(j) Remediation and Monitoring Projects.

(i) Where consent is needed, Seller agrees (x) to use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain consent to assignment of Seller's rights with respect to
Remediation and Monitoring Projects under agreements with prior owners (the
"Settlement Agreements"), including the settlement agreements listed on
Schedule 6.1(j)(i), at Closing and (y) until such consent requirement is
satisfied, waived or such agreement expires in accordance with its terms,
Seller shall provide Buyer, on a quarterly basis, with a payment equivalent to
the economic benefits of the Settlement Agreements (the "Settlement Agreement
Payment Obligations").

(ii) For a period of ten years following the Closing Date (the "Reimbursement
Period"), Seller agrees to reimburse Buyer for the amount by which the
aggregate operating expenses incurred, and capital investments made, by Buyer
associated with Remediation and Monitoring Projects, including any
modification of the Remediation and Monitoring Projects pursuant to ISRA (the
"Remediation and Monitoring Costs"), in a given year exceeds $250,000 after
giving effect to (i) the payments actually received by Buyer from Seller in
respect of the Settlement Agreements Payment Obligations, prior to the
assignment of such agreements and (ii) the third party reimbursement
obligations directly made to Buyer under the Settlement Agreements, following
assignment of such agreements (the "Operating and Capital Expense
Reimbursement Obligations").

(iii) For each fiscal quarter for which Buyer requests reimbursement of the
Operating and Capital Expense Reimbursement Obligations set forth in Section
6.1(j) 

(ii), Buyer shall deliver to Seller, an itemized invoice for all expenses
related to the Remediation and Monitoring Projects.

(iv) During the Reimbursement Period, Buyer shall provide Seller with its
projected Remediation and Monitoring Costs for each year and representatives
of Buyer and Seller shall (x) schedule a meeting to discuss Remediation and
Monitoring Costs to the extent that such Costs will result in Seller having an
Operating and Capital Expense Reimbursement Obligation. Seller shall have the
right to approve Remediation and Monitoring Costs to the extent that Seller's
Operating and Capital Expense Reimbursement Obligation will exceed $100,000,
such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, provided that in no event shall
Seller be relieved of its Operating and Capital Expense Reimbursement
Obligation if the Remediation and Monitoring Costs to be incurred arise from
Buyer taking action in accordance with prudent industry standards or as
required by any Governmental Authority.

(v) At any time within twelve (12) months after each calendar year end and
after thirty (30) days' notice in writing to Buyer, Seller shall have the
right pursuant to this Section 6.1(j) to conduct, at Seller's expense an
during normal business hours, an audit or examination of the accounts, records
and operations of Buyer relating solely to the Remediation and Monitoring
Projects and direct, at Seller's expense and during normal business hours,
Buyer to exercise any audit rights that Buyer has pursuant to agreements
between Buyer and Buyer's contractors relating directly to the Remediation and
Monitoring Costs under this Purchase Agreement (each such audit or examination
conducted pursuant to this Section 6.1(j)(v) is referred to as an "Audit"). If
any Audit reveals Seller would not have had an Operating and Capital Expense
Reimbursement Obligation for a given year, Buyer shall reimburse Seller for
the amount of the payment by Seller of Operating and Capital Expense
Reimbursement Obligations for such year or, if any Audit reveals an error in
the amount of the Operating and Capital Expense Reimbursement Obligation in
Buyer's favor, Seller shall pay Buyer the additional amount of the Operating
and Capital Expense Reimbursement Obligation.

(k) TTB Permit. Prior to Closing, Seller agrees to cancel the Operating Permit
and Distilled Spirits Bond issued to Seller by the United States Alcohol and
Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau, and Buyer acknowledges that such cancellation
shall take place prior to Closing.

6.2 Covenants of Buyer. Buyer hereby covenants and agrees with Seller that:

(a) Environmental Matters. For a period of five (5) years after the Closing,
Buyer shall not, and shall cause its employees, contractors, representatives,
agents and affiliates not to, conduct any sampling of soil or groundwater or
other environmental assessments at or of the Purchased Terminal Facilities
except where a reasonably prudent operator of a refined products storage
terminal, not afforded the indemnities provided in Article X, would conduct
such environmental assessments (i) to maintain or achieve compliance with the
Environmental Laws (which for purposes of this Section 6.2(a) are the
Environmental Laws in effect at the time such environmental assessment is
conducted); (ii) 

as ordered by any Governmental Authority or court; (iii) to respond to a
release or suspected release of a Hazardous Substance; (iv) as required to
safeguard, protect or prevent any adverse consequences to the health, safety

Buyer's immediate successor or assignee, Buyer shall (A) legally bind such
successor or assignee to comply with terms and conditions substantially
similar to the terms and conditions contained in this Section 6.2(a), (B)
require such successor or assignee to indemnify Seller for any breach of such
substantially similar terms and conditions in an amount and on terms that are
no less favorable to Seller than the indemnification obtained by Buyer from
such successor or assignee (as applicable) for such breach and (C) require
such successor or assignee to legally bind their respective immediate
successor or assignee to terms and conditions substantially similar to the
terms and conditions contained in this Section 6.2(a).

(b) Removal of Seller Marks. Buyer agrees that, within sixty (60) days after
the Closing Date, Buyer shall (i) remove, obliterate, cover or replace, as
appropriate, all signs, billboards, containers, drums, advertisements or other

Purchased Assets; and (ii) return to Seller or, at Seller's option, destroy
(and certify such destruction to Seller) all items and materials, including
stationery, letterhead and purchase orders, located at any of the Purchased
Assets containing the above described marks. In addition, Buyer agrees that,
by the date that is sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall
replace all signs located at the Terminal Facilities which identify Seller or
Seller's Affiliates as the operator of such Terminal Facilities.

(c) Utilities and Billing Transfers. Within sixty (60) days following Closing,
Buyer shall transfer to itself all utility accounts related to any utility
services provided to and utilized by the Terminal Facilities. These utility
services include electricity, heat, sewer, and water, and may include services
for ongoing telephone and internet service and a deposit from Buyer required
by the utility provider. If Buyer fails to pay any utility bill and payment is
demanded from Seller, and Seller pays the utility bill, then Buyer shall
promptly reimburse Seller for payment of any such utility bill. If Buyer fails
to affect the transfer to itself of utility services within seventy-five (75)
days following Closing, Seller then has the option to inform the utility
provider to discontinue the utility service, without any liability for such
discontinuance to Seller.

(d) Records. For a period of five (5) years following the Closing Date, Buyer
shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to provide to Seller and its
Affiliates (and their counsel, auditors, accountants, agents, advisors or
other representatives) reasonable access to the Purchased Terminal Facilities
and reasonable access and permission to make copies of any books, records or
accounts relating to the Purchased Assets through and including the Closing
Date at Seller's expense; provided Seller shall reimburse Buyer's and its
Affiliates' reasonable internal costs and out-of-pocket costs associated with
this Section 6.2(d). Seller 

agrees that it shall consult with Buyer in advance of requesting any such
access following the Closing Date with a view towards establishing a mutually
agreeable plan for such access so that shall not unreasonably interfere with
the normal operation of the Terminal Facilities, and Seller shall indemnify
Seller for any and all Losses incurred by Buyer with respect to such matter.
Buyer shall not destroy or dispose of any such books, records and accounts for
a period of at least five (5) years after the Closing Date without first
giving reasonable prior notice thereof and offering to surrender to Seller
such books, records and accounts which Buyer may intend to destroy or dispose
of.

(e) Consent Judgment Financial Assurance. Subject to the assignment of the
Settlement Agreements pursuant to Section 6.1(j)(i) and receipt of any
required consents thereto, Buyer agrees that, following such assignment, it
shall be responsible for complying with Seller's obligations in respect of the
financial assurance requirement set forth in paragraph 9 of the Consent
Judgment, ordered September 28, 2011 in the Superior Court of New Jersey, Law
Division, Gloucester County, Docket No. L-1063007, against Kinder Morgan
Liquids Terminal and Seller, requiring Kinder Morgan Liquids Terminal and
Seller to be jointly and severally responsible for providing financial
assurance in the amount of One Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars
($1,500,000) in the form of assurances acceptable to the New Jersey Department
of Environmental Protection.

6.3 Mutual Covenants. Seller hereby covenants and agrees with Buyer and Buyer
hereby covenants and agrees with Seller that:

(a) Material Adverse Effect and Major Loss. In the event that there is an
occurrence of a Material Adverse Effect or a Major Loss during the Interim
Period, Seller shall notify Buyer thereof as soon as reasonably practicable.

(i) In the event of a Major Loss during the Interim Period, Seller shall
elect, at its option, to either (1) repair or replace or make adequate
provision for the repair or replacement of the affected Purchased Asset at
Seller's cost prior to the Closing, in which case Buyer's obligation to effect
the Closing shall not be affected, but the Closing Date shall be deferred as
set forth in Section 9.2 until after repairs or replacement have been
completed and the affected Purchased Asset has been restored to at least a
substantially comparable condition in all material respects as compared to
that prior to the Major Loss, or (2) negotiate with Buyer to reduce the
Purchase Price by an amount agreed to by Seller and Buyer to reflect the cost
to repair or replace the affected Purchased Asset (the "Repair Costs"), in
which case, the Closing Date and the Long Stop Date shall not be deferred
unless there is a Repair Cost Dispute as provided in Section 6.3(a)(iv). For
the avoidance of doubt, in the event that there is any damage, destruction or
other casualty losses with respect to or taking of the Purchased Assets, that
has an estimated cost to repair or replace or a value of less than three
percent (3%) of the Purchase Price, the transaction shall proceed to Closing
without adjustment to the Purchase Price pursuant to this Section 6.3(a).

(ii) If Seller elects to proceed with Section 6.3(a)(i)(2) and Seller and
Buyer agree on the Repair Costs within fifteen (15) days of Buyer's receipt of
Seller's notice of the Major Loss (the "Repair Negotiation Period"), Buyer's
obligation to effect the 

Closing shall not be affected, but the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the
Repair Costs so agreed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Parties mutually
agree that the Repair Costs are greater than an amount equal to ten percent
(10%) of the Purchase Price, either Seller or Buyer may elect, by giving
written notice to the other of such election within five (5) Business Days of
the expiration of the Repair Negotiation Period, to terminate this Purchase
Agreement without further obligation under this Purchase Agreement (other than
those sections which expressly survive termination, which shall continue in
effect).

(iii) If Seller and Buyer do not agree on the Repair Costs within the Repair
Negotiation Period (a "Repair Cost Dispute"), either Party may request an
engineering company mutually agreed to by the Parties to evaluate the affected
Purchased Assets and deliver to Buyer and Seller its written estimate of the
Repair Costs (the "Third-Party Estimate") within fifteen (15) days after the
end of the Repair Negotiation Period.

(iv) If the Third-Party Estimate is equal to or less than an amount equal to
ten percent (10%) of the Purchase Price, Buyer's obligation to proceed to
Closing in accordance with the terms of this Purchase Agreement shall not be
affected and the Parties shall submit the Repair Cost Dispute to binding
arbitration under the dispute resolution procedures in this Purchase Agreement
for resolution after the Closing, with no reduction of the Purchase Price at
Closing and a post-Closing adjustment to the Purchase Price equal to the
finally-determined Repair Costs.

(v) If the Third-Party Estimate is greater than an amount equal to ten percent
(10%) of the Purchase Price, either Seller or Buyer may elect, by giving
written notice to the other of election within fifteen (15) days of receipt of
the Third-Party Estimate, to terminate this Purchase Agreement without further
obligation under this Purchase Agreement (other than those sections which
expressly survive termination, which shall continue in effect). If neither
Party terminates, the Parties shall proceed to Closing and submit the Repair
Cost Dispute to binding arbitration under the dispute resolution procedures
under this Purchase Agreement for resolution after the Closing, with no
reduction of the Purchase Price at Closing and a post-Closing adjustment to
the Purchase Price equal to the finally-determined Repair Costs.

(vi) In the event of a Material Adverse Effect that exceeds three percent (3%)
of the Purchase Price during the Interim Period (provided however, that such
Material Adverse Effect shall not include a contractual counterparty's
bankruptcy or breach or non-renewal of any Assigned Contract), Seller shall
negotiate with Buyer to reduce the Purchase Price by an amount agreed to by
Seller and Buyer to reflect the economic impact on the Purchased Assets (the
"Economic Impact"), in which case, the Closing Date and the Long Stop Date
shall not be deferred unless there is an Economic Impact Dispute as provided
in Section 6.3(a)(vii). For avoidance of doubt, in the event that there is a
Material Adverse Effect that has an estimated Economic Impact of less than
three percent (3%) of the Purchase Price, the transaction shall proceed to
Closing without adjustment to the Purchase Price pursuant to this Section
6.3(a). 

(vii) If Seller and Buyer do not agree on the Economic Impact (an "Economic
Impact Dispute") within fifteen (15) days of Buyer's receipt of Seller's
notice of a Material Adverse Effect (the "Impact Negotiation Period"), either
Party may request an independent third party evaluator mutually agreed to by
the Parties to evaluate the impact on the Purchased Assets and deliver to
Buyer and Seller its written estimate of the Economic Impact (the "Third-Party
Economic Impact Estimate") within fifteen (15) days after the end of the
Impact Negotiation Period.

(viii) If the Third-Party Economic Impact Estimate is equal to or less than an
amount equal to ten percent (10%) of the Purchase Price, Buyer's obligation to
proceed to Closing in accordance with the terms of this Purchase Agreement
shall not be affected and the Parties shall submit the Economic Impact Dispute
to binding arbitration under the dispute resolution procedures in this
Purchase Agreement for resolution after the Closing, with no reduction of the
Purchase Price at Closing and a post-Closing adjustment to the Purchase Price
equal to the finally-determined Economic Impact.

(ix) If the Third-Party Economic Impact Estimate is greater than an amount
equal to ten percent (10%) of the Purchase Price, either Seller or Buyer may
elect, by giving written notice to the other of election within fifteen (15)
days of receipt of the Third-Party Economic Impact Estimate, to terminate this
Purchase Agreement without further obligation under this Purchase Agreement
(other than those sections which expressly survive termination, which shall
continue in effect). If neither Party terminates, the Parties shall proceed to
Closing and submit the Economic Impact Dispute to binding arbitration under
the dispute resolution procedures under this Purchase Agreement for resolution
after the Closing, with no reduction of the Purchase Price at Closing and a
post-Closing adjustment to the Purchase Price equal to the finally-determined
Economic Impact.

(x) Any adjustment of the Purchase Price pursuant to this Section 6.3(a) which
is necessary to reflect a final determination of Repair Costs after the
Closing shall be made as follows: (i) an adjustment in favor of Buyer shall be
paid in immediately available funds by Seller to Buyer; and (ii) an adjustment
in favor of Seller shall be paid in immediately available funds to the extent
the Purchase Price had been reduced pursuant to this Section 6.3(a). Any such
reduction, refund or payment shall be made within ten (10) Business Days after
such final determination.

(xi) In the event of a Repair Cost Dispute, or an Economic Impact Dispute, the
Closing Date and the Long Stop Date shall be deferred until (i) ten (10)
Business Days after receipt of the Third-Party Repair Estimate or the Third-
Party Economic Impact Estimate, as the case may be, or (ii) if Seller elects
the option in Section 6.3(a)(i), as provided therein.

(b) Further Assurances. Except as provided in Section 6.3(c), each Party shall
execute and deliver such instruments and take such other actions as the other
Party reasonably requests in order to carry out the intent of this Purchase
Agreement. If there are prohibitions against, or conditions to, the conveyance
of any Transferrable Material Permits, Assigned Contracts or Easements,
without the prior written consent of Third Parties either as 

a result of the provisions thereof or the requirements of Applicable Laws, and
such written consents are not obtained on or prior to the Closing, then (i)
any provision contained in this Purchase Agreement to the contrary
notwithstanding, the transfer of title to, or interest in, such Transferrable
Material Permits, Assigned Contracts or Easements pursuant to this Purchase
Agreement shall not become effective unless and until such consent requirement
is satisfied, waived or no longer applies, (ii) until such consent requirement
is satisfied, waived or no longer applies, Seller shall (without infringing on
the legal rights of any Third Party, breaching any such Transferrable Material
Permit, Assigned Contract or Easement, or violating any Applicable Laws)
provide Buyer with the equivalent benefits of the Transferrable Material
Permit, Assigned Contract or Easement, by subcontract, sublease or otherwise,
on the condition that Buyer shall cooperate and assist in such efforts and
Buyer shall bear all economic burdens and other obligations and liabilities of
Seller regarding this post-Closing period under the Transferrable Material
Permit, Assigned Contract or Easement, notwithstanding the fact that the same
has not been transferred to Buyer, and (iii) Closing shall not be delayed
pending satisfaction, waiver or expiration of such consent requirement. When
and if such consent requirement is so satisfied, waived or no longer applies,
to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, the assignment of such
Transferrable Material Permits, Assigned Contracts or Easements shall become
effective automatically as of the Closing Date, without further action on the
part of Seller or Buyer and without payment of further consideration. After
Closing, Seller shall reasonably cooperate with Buyer, at Buyer's request and
expense, to procure the transfer of any Transferrable Material Permits,
Assigned Contracts or Easements not transferred to Buyer at Closing. For the
avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Purchase
Agreement or any document or Ancillary Agreement referred to herein, neither
this Purchase Agreement nor any such document or Ancillary Agreement nor the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be deemed to constitute an agreement to
transfer or assign any claim, right or any benefit arising under any Real
Property Interest if such assignment or transfer would constitute a breach or
contravention of such Real Property Interest without the prior consent of a
Third Party.

(c) Consents. Each Party shall use its Commercially Reasonable Efforts to
cause the transactions contemplated by this Purchase Agreement to be
consummated and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, to make all
filings with and give all notices to, Governmental Authorities and other Third
Parties that may be necessary or reasonably required in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Purchase Agreement;
provided, however, notwithstanding any other provision of this Purchase
Agreement, it shall be (i) Seller's sole responsibility and Seller shall use
its Commercially Reasonable Efforts to obtain all consents, authorizations,
and approvals of or by, and to make all filings with or notices to, Third
Parties which may be necessary or reasonably required in order for Buyer to
obtain rights to any Material Contract or the Settlement Agreements, (ii)
except as provided below with respect to certain Non-Fee Properties, Buyer's
sole responsibility to obtain all consents, authorizations, and approvals of
or by, and to make all filings with or notices to, Third Parties which may be
necessary or reasonably required in order for Buyer to obtain rights to any
Non-Fee Property and (iii) except as otherwise provided in this Purchase
Agreement, including Section 6.3(i) regarding expiration or termination of the
HSR Act waiting period, Buyer shall use its Commercially Reasonable Efforts to
obtain 

all consents, authorizations, and approvals of or by, and to make all filings
with or notices to, Governmental Authorities to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Purchase Agreement. If there are prohibitions against, or
conditions to, the assignment of any Easement, without the prior written
consent of Third Parties either as a result of the provisions thereof or the
requirements of Applicable Law, and such written consents have not been
obtained on or prior to the Closing Date, then (i) any provision contained in
this Purchase Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, the transfer of title
to, or interest in, such Easement shall not become effective unless and until
such consent requirement is satisfied, waived or no longer applies, Seller
shall (without infringing on the legal rights of any third party, breaching
any such Easement or violating any Law) provide Buyer with the equivalent
benefits of the Easement, by subcontract, sublease or otherwise, on the
condition that Buyer shall cooperate and assist in such efforts and shall bear
all economic burdens and obligations and liabilities of Seller regarding such
period under such Easement, notwithstanding the fact that the same has not
been transferred to Buyer. When and if such consent requirement is so
satisfied, waived or no longer applies, to the extent permitted by Law, the
assignment of such Easement shall become effective automatically as of the
Closing Date, without further action on the part of Buyer or Seller and
without the payment of further consideration.

(d) Permits. Each Party will use all Commercially Reasonable Efforts to
transfer any Permits related to or necessary for the efficient operation of
the Purchased Assets which can be transferred. Buyer will bear any transfer

Employees employee benefits in accordance with employee benefit plans (such as

the Transferred Employees shall be given credit for their service recognized

Seller's Affiliates arising out of participation by Transferred Employees in
the employee benefit plans of Seller or Seller's Affiliates.

immediately thereafter, for the Transferred Employees covered by the labor

the Millville Dallas Airmotive Plant Job Loss Notification Act, N.J.S.A.
34:21-1, et seq., the Philadelphia Ordinance relating to Notification of

seq., or any similar provision of any federal, state, regional, foreign, or

that any WARN Obligations might arise as a consequence of the change in
ownership contemplated by this Purchase Agreement or as a consequence of any
subsequent action taken by Buyer or Buyer's Affiliates, Buyer covenants that
Buyer, or Buyer's Affiliates, shall be responsible for, and Buyer shall 

indemnify Seller and its Affiliates against any Losses caused by, arising
from, incurred in connection with or relating in any way to, any such WARN
Obligations. Buyer covenants that for ninety (90) days following the Closing
Date, there shall not be any mass layoff, plant closing, transfer of
operations, termination of operations, closing, relocation or other action
that might trigger WARN Obligations of Seller or Seller's Affiliates.

(xii) Severance. In the event that the employment of any Transferred Employee

shall govern. Effective upon, and only upon, the Closing, the Confidentiality
Agreement shall terminate only with respect to information provided to Buyer
and Buyer's Affiliates, including to their respective directors, officers,
employees, counsel, auditors, accountants, agents, advisors and other
representatives that relates solely to the Purchased Assets and the Assumed
Liabilities; provided that Buyer acknowledges that any and all information
provided or made available to Buyer and Buyer's 

Affiliates, including to their respective directors, officers, employees,
counsel, auditors, accountants, agents, advisors and other representatives by
or on behalf of Seller (other than information relating solely to the
Purchased Assets and the Assumed Liabilities) shall remain subject to the
terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement on and after the Closing
Date.

(iv) Buyer agrees that, from and after the date hereof and for a period of

interrogatories, requests for information or other documents in legal
proceedings, subpoena, civil investigative demand or any other similar legal
process) or legal or administrative process, (B) is authorized by Seller, (C)
reasonably occurs in connection with disputes over the terms of this Purchase
Agreement, or (D) is reasonably necessary for either Party to comply with
their obligations under Section 6.3(c) (provided that the Party desiring to
make such disclosure under the foregoing clause (D) prior to the Closing Date
shall first provide reasonable prior notice to the other Party). The
provisions of this Section 6.3(m) shall not apply to any information,
documents or materials which are in the public domain or shall come into the
public domain, other than by reason of a breach by Buyer of its obligations
hereunder or under the Confidentiality Agreement. Furthermore, notwithstanding
the foregoing, Buyer shall be permitted to disclose Seller's Confidential
Information to any of Buyer's Affiliates, including, their respective
directors, officers, employees, counsel, auditors, accountants, agents,
advisors and other representatives, on a "need to know" basis with respect to
this transaction provided that such Affiliates, directors, officers,
employees, counsel, auditors, accountants, agents, advisors and other
representatives shall comply with the terms of this Section 6.3(m).

(l) Condemnation. If after the Effective Date but prior to the Closing Date,
any portion of the Purchased Assets is taken in condemnation or under right of
eminent domain by any Governmental Authority, the transactions contemplated
hereunder will nevertheless close. In such event, Seller shall, at Closing,
pay to Buyer all sums paid to Seller or its Affiliates by Third Parties by
reason of such taking and shall assign, transfer and set over to Buyer or
subrogate Buyer to all of Seller's or its Affiliates' right, title and
interest (if any) in unpaid awards and other rights against Third Parties
arising out of the taking.

(m) Third Party Hydrocarbon Inventory Determination. Seller covenants that its
inventory processes and documentation (i.e. any and all periodic statements or
reports issued to third parties with inventory at each terminal) accurately
reflect the actual physical inventories for each third party at each terminal
(before accounting for any gain or loss determined by the Hydrocarbon
Inventory Methodology). Seller and Buyer agree to jointly determine the actual
physical volumes and qualities of petroleum product and additives
("Hydrocarbon Inventory") at the Terminal Facilities pursuant to the
procedures and processes set forth on Schedule 6.3(n), Hydrocarbon Inventory
Methodology. Within five (5) Business Days of the reports prepared pursuant to
Schedule 6.3(n), Buyer shall compare the actual 

physical volumes of Hydrocarbon Inventory at the Terminal Facilities at
Closing with the physical volumes of products and additives owned by Third
Parties at the Terminal Facilities at Closing as such volumes are recorded and
reported in Terminal Facility records ("Third Party Hydrocarbon Inventory").
If the actual physical volumes of Hydrocarbon Inventory is less than the
volumes of Third Party Hydrocarbon Inventory, or if any Third Party
Hydrocarbon Inventory does not meet the required product specifications, Buyer
shall amend the settlement invoice for the Purchased Inventory Sales Agreement
to account for any deviations from the Third Party Hydrocarbon Inventory
volumes and specifications, using the prices set forth in Schedule 6.3(n),
Hydrocarbon Inventory Methodology. For Hydrocarbon Inventory that is off
specification, Seller's maximum liability to Buyer shall be limited to
replacement value of the specific Hydrocarbon Inventory at the time of the
issuance of the Inspector's report less the salvage value of the off
specification such Hydrocarbon Inventory. In the case of a shortage, Seller
shall pay the amount set forth on such invoice. In the case of an overage,
Buyer shall pay Seller the amount set forth on such invoice. If Seller or
Buyer disputes the amount on such settlement invoice, the Parties agree to
resolve such dispute in accordance with the dispute resolution procedures in
this Purchase Agreement.

(n) Schedules. From the date hereof through and including the Closing Date, if
either Buyer or Seller becomes aware that any representation, warranty or
schedules made by it was or becomes not true and correct, it shall so notify
the other Party in writing. The representations and warranties and/or
schedules made in this Purchase Agreement shall be deemed to be modified by
any matter contained in such notice provided that, in the case of Seller, if
any such changes in the representations and warranties and/or schedules would
cumulatively adversely affect the value of the Purchased Assets by 0.5% or
more of the Purchase Price, Buyer may object thereto within ten (10) days
after receipt of the notice. If such objection is not given within the ten day
period, or the cumulative changes do not have such adverse effect, then such
changes shall not give rise to any right or remedy. If such objection notice
is timely given and the effect of the cumulative changes on the value of the
Purchased Assets exceeds such amount, and Seller determines that it cannot
cure such adverse effect prior to the Closing by using Commercially Reasonable
Efforts, then the Parties shall negotiate in good faith a reduction of the
Purchase Price to fairly reflect the impact of the change on the value of the
Purchased Assets. In the event that the Parties are unable to agree on a
reduction of the Purchase Price prior to the Closing, then the Parties agree
to resolve the matter in accordance with the dispute resolution provisions of
this Purchase Agreement after the Closing.

(a) Deductible and Cap. Except with respect to Losses arising under Section
3.11, Seller shall have no indemnification obligations for Buyer Group's
Losses under Sections 10.1(a)(i), 10.1(a)(ii), or 10.2(a) unless the aggregate

event shall Seller's aggregate liability for indemnification with respect to
all claims under this Purchase Agreement including for Losses related to any
breach of Seller's Fundamental Representations, exceed an amount equal to the
Purchase Price.

(b) Sole Remedy. The indemnification provisions in Section 6.1(a)(Access and
Information), Section 6.3(f)(xi)(Warn Act) and this Article X shall represent
the exclusive remedy of the Parties under this Purchase Agreement and in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and any claims related
hereto. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, except for the
indemnification provisions of Article X, no Party shall have any liability,
and no Party shall make any claim, for any Losses or other matters (and Buyer
and Seller hereby waive any such claim and any right of contribution against
the other Party and such other Party's respective Affiliates), under, arising
out of or relating to this Purchase Agreement, any other document, agreement,
certificate or other matter delivered pursuant hereto or the transactions
contemplated hereby, whether based on contract, tort, strict liability, other
Applicable Laws or otherwise.

(c) Unauthorized Investigations. A breach of Section 6.2(a) (an "Unauthorized
Investigation") shall automatically extinguish any indemnification obligation
Seller may have under this Purchase Agreement for any Loss that results from
an Unauthorized Investigation, including but not limited to Environmental
Losses or other matters identified as a result of an Unauthorized
Investigation.

(d) Timeliness. Neither Party shall have an obligation to indemnify the other
Party with respect to a matter if they fail to deliver written notification of
a claim for indemnification under Section 10.4 for such matter before
expiration of the applicable survival period set forth in Section 10.5. 

(e) No Betterments. Seller shall have no obligation to indemnify Buyer for any
Losses that represent the cost of repairs, replacements or improvements by
Buyer which enhance the value of any repaired, replaced or improved asset
above its value on the Closing Date or which represent the cost of repair or
replacement exceeding the reasonable cost of repair or replacement.

10.4 Other Provisions Relating to Indemnification.

(a) Notices, etc. Each Person entitled to indemnification pursuant to this
Purchase Agreement (the "Indemnified Party") shall, upon obtaining knowledge
of facts indicating that it may have a claim for indemnification hereunder,
including receipt by it of notice of any demand, assertion, claim or
proceeding by any Third Party (any such Third Party proceeding being referred
to as a "Third Party Action") with respect to any matter as to which it may be
entitled to indemnity hereunder, give prompt notice thereof in writing to the
Person obligated hereunder to provide such indemnification (the "Indemnifying
Party") together with a statement of such information respecting any of the
foregoing as it shall then have.

(b) Right to Contest and Defend. The Indemnifying Party shall be given the
opportunity, at its cost and expense, to contest and defend by all appropriate
legal proceedings any Third Party Action with respect to which it is called
upon to indemnify the Indemnified Party under the provisions of this Purchase
Agreement; provided, however, that notice of the intention to contest and
defend shall be delivered by the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party
within thirty (30) days following receipt of the notice provided for in
Section 10.4(a) above. Any Third Party Action which the Indemnifying Party
elects to contest and defend may be conducted in the name and on behalf of the
Indemnifying Party or the Indemnified Party as may be appropriate. Such Third
Party Action shall be conducted by counsel employed by the Indemnifying Party,
but the Indemnified Party shall have the right to participate in such Third
Party Action and to be represented by counsel of its own choosing at its cost
and expense; provided that, if the defendant(s) in any Third Party Action
include both the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party, and the
Indemnified Party shall have reasonably concluded that (i) there may be legal
defenses available to it that are different from, inconsistent with or in
addition to those defenses available to the Indemnifying Party, or (ii) if
there is a conflict of interest that would prevent counsel for the
Indemnifying Party from also representing the Indemnified Party (clauses (i)
and (ii) collectively, "Differences or Conflicts"), then the Indemnified Party
shall have the right to engage separate counsel at the cost and expense of the
Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnified Party joins in any such Third Party
Action, the Indemnifying Party shall have full authority, absent any
Differences or Conflicts, to determine all action to be taken with respect
thereto. At any time after the commencement of defense of any Third Party
Action, the Indemnifying Party may request the Indemnified Party to agree in
writing to the abandonment of such contest or to the payment or compromise by
the Indemnifying Party of the asserted Third Party Action, which consent,
absent any Differences or Conflicts, shall not be unreasonably withheld. 

(c) Cooperation. If requested by the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party
agrees to cooperate with the Indemnifying Party and its counsel in contesting
any Third Party Action which the Indemnifying Party elects to contest or, if
appropriate, in making any counterclaim against the Person asserting the Third
Party Action, or any cross-complaint against any Person; provided that the
Indemnifying Party shall reimburse the Indemnified Party for any reasonable
expenses incurred by it in so cooperating at the request of the Indemnifying
Party.

(d) Right to Participate. The Indemnified Party agrees to afford the
Indemnifying Party and its counsel the opportunity, at the Indemnifying
Party's expense, to be present at, and to participate in, conferences with all
Persons asserting any Third Party Action against the Indemnified Party and
conferences with representatives of or counsel for such Persons.

(e) Exclusive Remedy. From and after the Closing Date, the indemnification
provisions contained in this Article X shall constitute the sole remedy of the
Parties for all claims arising from or relating to this Purchase Agreement or
any of the instruments or transactions contemplated hereby. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, a Party may also seek a remedy for a Closing Failure Breach
pursuant to Section 12.3.

(f) Burden of Proof. Any Party claiming that it is not required to provide
indemnification under Section 10.1 or 10.2 due to the gross negligence or
willful misconduct of the other Party shall bear the burden of proof with
respect to such issue in any claim, dispute or controversy relating to or
arising out of this Purchase Agreement.

(g) Severability of Indemnification Provisions. If any indemnity obligation
set forth in this Article X or the application of any part thereof is held
invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect by a court of competent
jurisdiction under Applicable Law, then, but only in such event, such
indemnity obligation or part thereof shall be modified, read, construed and
enforced to the maximum extent permitted by law, and any remaining obligations
or part thereof of such indemnity obligation that is valid and enforceable
shall remain in full force and effect and be binding on the Parties.

10.5 Survival of Provisions and Indemnification Obligations.

(a) Subject to Section 10.5(b) and unless as otherwise provided in this
Purchase Agreement, all representations, warranties and indemnifications
herein, the covenants of the Parties and the indemnification obligations of
the Parties set forth in this Purchase Agreement shall survive (x) any
investigation of the Parties and (y) the Closing as follows:

(i) in the case of representations and warranties of the Parties in Article
III and Article IV of this Purchase Agreement (and indemnification obligations
of the Parties therefore), until one (1) year after the Closing Date;
provided, however, that the Fundamental Representations of the Parties shall
survive the Closing until the lapse of the applicable statute of limitations; 

(ii) in the case of covenants and indemnification obligations of the Parties
other than the covenants set forth in Sections 6.1(j) (Remediation and
Monitoring Projects) 6.3(g) (Revenues and Remittance of Monies) and 6.3(l)
(Confidentiality) and the indemnification obligations set forth in Sections
10.1(a)(iii), 10.1(b)(iii), 10.1(b)(iv) 10.1(b)(v), 10.2(a) and 10.2(b), until
one (1) year after the Closing Date, or otherwise in accordance with their
terms;

(iii) in the case of the covenants set forth in Section 6.3(f) (Employee
Covenant), until the second anniversary of the Closing Date;

(iv) in the case of the covenants set forth in Section 6.1(j) (Remediation and
Monitoring Projects), until ten (10) years after the Closing Date; and

(v) in the case of the covenants set forth in Sections 6.3(g) (Revenues and
Remittance of Monies) and 6.3(l) (Confidentiality) and of the indemnification
obligations set forth in Sections 10.1(a)(iii), 10.1(b)(iii), 10.1(b)(iv)
10.1(b)(v), 10.2(a) and 10.2(b), until the lapse of the applicable statute of
limitations.

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event a claim for indemnification is
made in accordance with the provisions hereof on or before the expiration of
the applicable survival period for the provision under which such claim is
made, the obligations of the Indemnifying Party shall continue as to such
claim until it has been finally resolved.

ARTICLE XI 

TAXES AND CHARGES

11.1 Transfer Taxes. If and to the extent that any transfer, excise, stamp,
sales, use or other similar Taxes are or become due and payable in connection
with the transfer of the Purchased Assets pursuant to this Purchase Agreement,
any such Taxes shall be paid by Buyer. Buyer shall also pay any fees for
recording any instruments of conveyance relating to transfer of the Purchased
Assets and the Real Property Interests. Seller and Buyer shall use
Commercially Reasonable Efforts to assist and cooperate with each other in
connection with establishing the applicability of any exemption from any
transfer taxes.

11.2 Allocation of Taxes. Seller shall pay or cause to be paid, directly to
the taxing authority, all ad valorem or similar real and personal property
taxes assessed on the Real Property Interests and Equipment, as applicable
("Real and Personal Property Taxes"), with respect to all periods before the
fiscal tax year during which the Closing occurs (the "Current Tax Year").
Buyer shall pay or cause to be paid directly to the taxing authority all Real
and Personal Property Taxes assessed with respect to any period after the
Current Tax Year. Seller agrees to indemnify and hold Buyer harmless for all
Taxes arising out of, accruing, incident, relating to, or in connection with
Seller or Seller's Affiliates' failure to pay Taxes attributable or allocable
to the Purchased Assets (excluding any sales or transfer Taxes to the extent
arising from the sale and purchase of the Purchased Assets) attributable to or
accruing during periods prior to the Closing Date. 

The Parties shall each pay a share of any Real and Personal Property Taxes for
the Current Tax Year as follows: each Party's share of such taxes shall be the
fraction of the total number of days in such fiscal tax year that such Party
owned the Purchased Assets, as applicable with, for the avoidance of doubt,
Buyer treated as owning the Purchased Assets on and after the Closing Date.

At Closing, Seller shall issue Buyer a credit or charge to the Purchase Price
based on Seller's estimated share of current year taxes, real or personal,
reduced by any property taxes paid by Seller prior to closing. All tax bills
received after closing will be paid by Buyer directly to the taxing
authorities prior to any delinquency date. Any tax bills received by Seller
shall be promptly forwarded to Buyer for payment. Within thirty (30) days
after receiving all tax bills related to the current tax year, Buyer shall
determine the total amount of actual taxes paid directly to taxing authorities
by both Buyer and Seller and shall calculate Seller's share according to this
Section 11.2. If Seller's actual share of taxes exceeds the Seller's estimated
share of current year taxes calculated at closing, then Buyer shall bill
Seller for the underpayment. If Seller's actual share of taxes is less than
the Seller's estimated share of current year taxes calculated at closing, then
Buyer shall pay Seller for the overpayment.

ARTICLE XII


MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS

12.1 Damages. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in no event
shall a Party be liable to the other Party for consequential, incidental,
exemplary, special, indirect or punitive damages (including lost profits, loss
of production, diminution in value or other damages attributable to business
interruption) arising under or in connection with this Purchase Agreement. The
exclusion of consequential, incidental, indirect, special or punitive damages
as set forth in the preceding sentence shall not apply to any such damages
sought by Third Parties against an Indemnified Party in connection with Losses
that may be indemnified pursuant to Article X.

12.2 Amendment and Modification. Subject to Applicable Law, this Purchase
Agreement may only be amended, modified and supplemented by written agreement
of the Parties to this Purchase Agreement.

12.3 Failure to Close; Specific Performance. Each Party acknowledges and
agrees that if the Closing fails to occur, or is rendered incapable of
occurring, as a result of the breach by such Party of any term or provision of
this Purchase Agreement (such breach, a "Closing Failure Breach"), the other
Party would be damaged irreparably. Accordingly, each Party agrees that the
other Party shall be entitled to injunctive relief to prevent any such Closing
Failure Breach and to enforce specifically this Purchase Agreement and the
terms and provisions hereof in any action instituted in any court, subject to
Section 12.9.

12.4 Waiver of Compliance. Any failure of Seller, on the one hand, or Buyer,
on the other hand, to comply with an obligation, covenant, agreement or
condition contained 

in this Purchase Agreement must be expressly waived in writing by the non-
failing Party, but such waiver or failure to insist upon strict compliance
shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent
or other failure.

or permitted under this Purchase Agreement shall be in writing and shall be
(i) delivered personally, (ii) sent by documented overnight delivery service,

laying of venue in such forums and agrees not to plead or claim that any
action in such forums would be inconvenient. 

12.10 Counterparts. This Purchase Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts (including by means of facsimile or a portable document format
(*.pdf)), each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together
shall constitute one and the same instrument.

12.11 Exhibits and Headings. Subject to Section 6.3(o), information set forth
in any Exhibit or Schedule to this Purchase Agreement is deemed to have been
disclosed for all purposes of this Purchase Agreement and shall be deemed to
be disclosed in all Schedules in which such matters are required to be
disclosed. The headings contained in this Purchase Agreement are inserted for
convenience only, do not constitute a part of this Purchase Agreement, and are
in no way to be construed as a limitation on the scope of particular sections
to which they refer. The representations and warranties contained in Article
III and Article IV of this Purchase Agreement are qualified by the Exhibits
and Schedules. Nothing in these Exhibits and/or Schedules is intended to
broaden the scope of any representation or warranty contained in this Purchase
Agreement or to create any covenant unless clearly specified to the contrary
therein. The inclusion of any item in Schedules (a) shall be deemed to be a
disclosure of such item on all Schedules and under the Agreement, (b) does not
represent a determination that such item is material nor shall it be deemed to
establish a standard of materiality, (c) does not represent a determination
that such item did not arise in the Ordinary Course of Business, (d) except as
represented or warranted otherwise, does not represent a determination that
the transactions contemplated by this Purchase Agreement require the consent
of Third Parties and (e) shall not constitute, or be deemed to be, an
admission to any Third Party concerning such item. These Exhibits and/or
Schedules include descriptions of instruments or brief summaries of certain
aspects of the Seller and its Affiliates and business and their respective
operations. To the extent complete documents or other materials have been
previously delivered or made available by Seller to Buyer, such descriptions
and brief summaries are not necessarily complete and are provided in these
Exhibits and Schedules to identify such documents or materials.

12.12 Entire Agreement. This Purchase Agreement (including the Exhibits,
Schedules, and the Ancillary Agreements and other documents referred to
herein, which form a part of this Purchase Agreement) embodies the entire
agreement and understanding of the Parties in respect of the subject matter
contained herein and therein and supersedes all prior agreements and
understandings between the Parties with respect to such subject matter. There
are no restrictions, promises, warranties, covenants or undertakings with
respect to the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, other than those
expressly set forth or referred to in this Purchase Agreement. Except for the
Deeds, nothing contained in the Non-Fee Assignments, the Bill of Sale and any
other transfer documentation shall be deemed to amend, modify or expand any of
the provisions of this Purchase Agreement or any rights or obligations of the
Parties under this Purchase Agreement.

12.13 Representation By Counsel; No Strict Construction. Buyer and Seller
acknowledge that each of them has been represented by counsel in connection
with the negotiation of this Purchase Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby and that the language used in this Purchase Agreement
shall be deemed to be the language chosen 

by the Parties hereto to express their mutual intent. Accordingly, any rule of
law or any legal decision that would require interpretation of any claimed
ambiguities in this Purchase Agreement against the Party that drafted it has
no application and is expressly waived.

12.14 Severability. Whenever possible, each provision or part thereof of this
Purchase Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be valid and
effective under Applicable Law, but if any provision or part thereof of this
Purchase Agreement or the application of any such provision or part thereof to
any Person or circumstance shall be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in
any respect by a court of competent jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality
or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision or part thereof.

12.15 Bulk Transfer Laws. Buyer hereby waives compliance by Seller with the
provisions of any so-called bulk transfer laws of any jurisdiction in
connection with the transfer and conveyance of the Purchased Assets.

12.16 Time Of Essence. With regard to all rights and obligations of the
Parties and all dates and time periods set forth or referred to in this
Purchase Agreement, time is of the essence.

12.17 Like-Kind Exchange. Seller may, at its sole option, assign or transfer
any or all of its rights hereunder to any qualified intermediary in order to
complete an exchange of like-kind property under Section 1031 of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and, at the request of Seller,
Buyer shall execute such agreements and other documents, and take such
actions, as Seller may reasonably request that are necessary to complete and
otherwise effectuate Seller's exchange of properties in accordance with said
Section 1031 and the regulations thereunder. Each of Buyer and Seller shall
remain responsible for the performance of all of its respective obligations
hereunder and Buyer shall not incur any unreimbursed third party costs,
expenses, fees or liabilities as a result of or connected with the exchange.

12.18 Press Releases and Public Announcements. The Parties shall not (and
shall cause their Affiliates not to) issue any press release or make any
public announcement relating to the subject matter of this Purchase Agreement
unless such Party has first consulted with the other Party and obtained the
other Party's prior written approval of the text thereof, which approval shall
not be unreasonably withheld; provided, however, that a Party may make any
public disclosure it believes in good faith is required by Applicable Law or
any listing or trading agreement concerning its publicly traded securities or
as may be necessary or appropriate in connection with customary presentations,
meetings and conference calls with investors and analysts (in which case the
disclosing Party will use its Commercially Reasonable Efforts to allow the
other Party reasonable time to review and comment on the text of the proposed
disclosure prior to making such disclosure).

12.19 Acknowledgment of Parties; Conspicuousness. EACH OF THE PARTIES
SPECIFICALLY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES (A) THAT IT HAS A DUTY TO READ THIS
PURCHASE AGREEMENT AND THAT IT IS CHARGED WITH NOTICE 

AND KNOWLEDGE OF THE TERMS HEREOF, AND (B) THAT IT HAS IN FACT READ THIS
PURCHASE AGREEMENT AND IS FULLY INFORMED AND HAS FULL NOTICE AND KNOWLEDGE OF
THE TERMS, CONDITIONS AND EFFECTS OF THIS PURCHASE AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY
FURTHER AGREES THAT IT WILL NOT CONTEST THE VALIDITY OR ENFORCEABILITY OF ANY
SUCH PROVISIONS OF THIS PURCHASE AGREEMENT ON THE BASIS THAT THE PARTY HAD NO
NOTICE OR KNOWLEDGE OF SUCH PROVISIONS OR THAT SUCH PROVISIONS ARE NOT
"CONSPICUOUS". THE PARTIES INTEND THAT THE INDEMNITIES SET FORTH IN ARTICLE X
BE CONSTRUED AND APPLIED AS WRITTEN ABOVE, NOTWITHSTANDING ANY RULE OF
CONSTRUCTION TO THE CONTRARY. WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, SUCH INDEMNITIES
SHALL APPLY NOTWITHSTANDING ANY STATE'S "EXPRESS NEGLIGENCE" OR SIMILAR RULE
THAT WOULD DENY COVERAGE BASED ON AN INDEMNIFIED PARTY'S SOLE OR CONCURRENT,
ACTIVE OR PASSIVE NEGLIGENCE OR GROSS NEGLIGENCE. IT IS THE INTENT OF THE
PARTIES THAT, TO THE EXTENT PROVIDED ABOVE, THE INDEMNITIES SET FORTH IN
ARTICLE X SHALL APPLY TO AN INDEMNIFIED PARTY'S SOLE OR CONCURRENT, ACTIVE OR
PASSIVE NEGLIGENCE OR GROSS NEGLIGENCE. THE PARTIES AGREE THAT THIS PROVISION
IS "CONSPICUOUS" FOR PURPOSES OF ALL STATE LAWS.

12.20 Dispute Resolution.

(a) Unless this Purchase Agreement expressly provides for a different dispute
resolution process with respect to a particular dispute, this Section 12.20
shall apply to any dispute arising under or in connection with this Purchase
Agreement or the breach, termination, interpretation or invalidity thereof
(whether arising in contract, tort or otherwise, and whether arising at law or
in equity) (a "Dispute").

(b) All Disputes shall first be referred to senior executives of the Parties
designated for such purpose (each, a "Designated Executive"). Such referral
shall toll the applicable statute of limitations.

(c) If the Designated Executives fail to settle such dispute within thirty
(30) days after it is referred to them, either of the Parties may refer the
matter to arbitration before a panel of three (3) neutral arbitrators, with
one arbitrator to be selected by each Party and the final arbitrator shall be
selected by the two (2) other arbitrators. The arbitration will be held in New
York, New York, under the Rules of Arbitration of the American Arbitration
Association. The arbitration shall be held in the English language. All
arbitrators shall have experience resolving commercial disputes in the
petroleum industry and shall have experience resolving disputes reasonably
similar to the dispute they are called upon to resolve. The arbitration
panel's decision shall be in writing and shall be supported by detailed
findings of fact and conclusions of law. The arbitration decision shall be
final and binding on all Parties thereto, except that the arbitration panel
shall have no power to render a decision that contains clearly erroneous
findings of fact or law. With the exception of any decision that 

contains clearly erroneous findings of fact or law, all costs and expenses of
such arbitration shall be borne in the manner determined by the panel;
provided, that, unless otherwise expressly provided in this Purchase
Agreement, if the amount in dispute is reasonably estimated to exceed seven
million dollars ($7,000,000), the arbitration provisions of this Section
12.20(c) shall not apply, and the Parties may pursue any remedies not
otherwise prohibited by this Purchase Agreement.

(d) It is the intent of the Parties that the matters agreed upon to be
arbitrated be decided as set forth herein and they shall not seek to have this
Section 12.20 rendered unenforceable or to have such matter decided in any
other way.
