the Effective Time. "Operating Expenses" means all operating expenses
(including costs of insurance and ad valorem, property, severance, production
and similar Taxes based upon or measured by or attributable to the ownership
or operation of the Assets or the production of Hydrocarbons therefrom, but
excluding any other Taxes) and capital expenditures incurred in the ownership
and operation of the Assets in the ordinary course of business and, where
applicable, in accordance with the relevant operating or unit agreement, if
any, and overhead costs charged to the Assets under the relevant operating
agreement or unit agreement, if any, but excluding Liabilities attributable to
(i) personal injury or death, property damage or violation of any Law, (ii)
Decommission obligations, (iii) environmental matters, including obligations
to remediate any contamination of water or Personal Property under applicable
Environmental Laws, (iv) obligations with respect to Imbalances, or (v)
obligations to pay Working Interests, royalties, overriding royalties or other
interest owners revenues or proceeds attributable to sales of Hydrocarbons
relating to the Assets, including those held in suspense. After Closing, each
Party shall be entitled to participate in all joint interest audits and other
audits of Operating Expenses for which such Party is entirely or in part
responsible under the terms of this Section 2.3. For the avoidance of doubt,
Seller shall remain responsible (by payment, through the adjustments to the
Purchase Price hereunder or pursuant to Section 3.10) for all drilling costs,
completion costs and other capital expenditures for work done or services
performed prior to the Effective Time in connection with the operation of the
Assets (to the extent actually incurred and billed and that have not been
previously paid, the "Unpaid Capital Costs"), including all such costs
associated with the "Activities Completed, Costs Not Yet Fully Billed to
Antero" noted on Schedule 4.13.

prior to Closing, Seller shall prepare and submit to Buyer for review a draft

Within two (2) Business Days of receipt of the Preliminary Settlement
Statement, Buyer will deliver to Seller a written report containing all
changes with the explanation therefor that Buyer proposes to be made to the
Preliminary Settlement Statement. The Parties shall in good faith attempt to
agree on the Preliminary Settlement Statement as soon as possible after
Seller's receipt of Buyer's written report. The Preliminary Settlement
Statement, as agreed upon by the Parties, will be used to adjust the Purchase
Price at Closing; provided that if the Parties do not agree upon an adjustment
set forth in the Preliminary Settlement Statement, then the amount of such
adjustment used to adjust the Purchase Price at Closing shall be that amount
set forth in the draft Preliminary Settlement Statement delivered by Seller to

3.6 Interim Settlement Statement. On or before August 31, 2012, an interim

those adjustments to be made to the Purchase Price pursuant to Sections
3.3(a)(ii), 3.3(b)(i) and 3.3(b)(xi) of this Agreement as of the date of
preparation of such Interim Settlement Statement and the calculation of the
adjustments used to determine such amount. Within two (2) Business Days of
receipt of the Interim Settlement Statement, Buyer will deliver to Seller a
written report containing all changes with the explanation therefor that Buyer
proposes to be made to the Interim Settlement Statement. The Parties shall in
good faith attempt to agree on the Interim Settlement Statement as soon as
possible after Seller's receipt of Buyer's written report. In the event the
Parties agree to the amounts set forth in the Interim Settlement Statement,
the interim Purchase Price adjustment amount determined pursuant to this
Section 3.6 shall be paid by the owing Party within ten (10) days of such
agreement as to such owed amounts to the owed Party. If the Parties do not
agree upon the interim Purchase Price adjustment amount set forth in the
Interim Settlement Statement by September 15, 2012, then the amount of such
adjustment to be paid to the owed Party shall be that amount set forth in the
draft Interim Settlement Statement delivered by Seller to Buyer pursuant to
this Section 3.6, such amount to be paid by the owing Party by September 25,
2012 to the owed Party. All amounts paid pursuant to this Section 3.6 shall be
delivered in United States currency by wire transfer of immediately available

3.7 Final Settlement Statement. On or before one hundred eighty (180) days
after Closing, a final settlement statement (the "Final Settlement Statement")
will be prepared by Seller, based on actual income and expenses during the
Interim Period and which takes into account all final adjustments made to the
Purchase Price and shows the resulting final Purchase Price (the "Final
Price"). The Final Settlement Statement shall set forth the actual proration
of the amounts required by this Agreement. As soon as practicable, and in any
event within thirty (30) days, after receipt of the Final Settlement
Statement, Buyer shall return to Seller a written report containing any
proposed changes to the Final Settlement Statement and an explanation of any
such changes and the reasons therefor (the "Dispute Notice"). Any changes not
so specified in the Dispute Notice shall be deemed waived and Seller's
determinations with respect to all such elements of the Final Settlement
Statement that are not addressed specifically in the Dispute Notice shall
prevail. If Buyer fails to timely deliver a Dispute Notice to Seller
containing changes Buyer proposes to be made to the Final Settlement
Statement, the Final Settlement Statement as delivered by Seller will be
deemed to be correct and will be final and binding on the Parties and not
subject to further audit or arbitration. If the Final Price set forth in the
Final Settlement Statement is mutually agreed upon by Seller and Buyer, the
Final Settlement Statement and the Final Price, shall be final and binding on
the Parties hereto (other than with respect to amounts not accounted for
therein or settled thereby, which amounts shall be subject to the provisions
of Section 3.10). Any difference in the Adjusted Purchase Price as paid at
Closing pursuant to the Preliminary Settlement Statement (as adjusted by any
interim Purchase Price adjustment amount paid pursuant to Section 3.6) and the
Final Price shall be paid by the owing Party within ten (10) days of final
determination of such owed amounts in accordance herewith to the owed Party.
All amounts paid pursuant to this Section 3.7 shall be delivered in United
States currency by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account
specified in writing by the relevant Party.

3.8 Disputes. If Seller and Buyer are unable to resolve the matters addressed
in the Dispute Notice, each of Buyer and Seller shall within ten (10) Business
Days after the delivery of such Dispute Notice, summarize its position with
regard to such dispute in a written document of twenty pages or less and
submit such summaries to the Denver, Colorado office of Ernst and Young or such
other Person as the Parties may mutually select (the "Accounting Arbitrator"),
together with the Dispute Notice, the Final Settlement Statement and any other
documentation such Party may desire to submit. Within ten (10) Business Days
after receiving the Parties' respective submissions, the Accounting Arbitrator
shall render a decision choosing either Seller's position or Buyer's position
with respect to each matter addressed in any Dispute Notice, based on the
materials described above. Any decision rendered by the Accounting Arbitrator
pursuant hereto shall be final, conclusive and binding on Seller and Buyer and
will be enforceable against any of the Parties in any court of competent
jurisdiction. The costs of such Accounting Arbitrators shall be borne one-half
by Buyer and one-half by Seller.

  

  

3.9 Allocation of Purchase Price / Allocated Values. Buyer and Seller agree
that the Purchase Price and any Assumed Obligation or other items treated as
consideration for federal income Tax purposes shall be allocated among the
Assets in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code as set forth in Schedule
3.8 to this Agreement (the "Allocated Values"). Each Party shall utilize the
Allocated Values, as updated by mutual agreement of the Parties to reflect any
adjustment to the Purchase Price pursuant to this Agreement for purposes of
all federal, state and local Tax returns and reports, including Internal
Revenue Service Form 8594, and neither any Party or its Affiliates shall take
any position on any Tax return that is inconsistent with such Allocated
Values, as adjusted, unless such position is mutually agreed by the Parties or
required to be taken pursuant to a final determination, as defined in Section
1313 of the Code. Buyer and Seller agree that such allocation, as adjusted, is
reasonable and shall not take any position inconsistent therewith, including
in notices to Preferential Purchase Right holders. Seller and Buyer agree to
promptly advise the other regarding the existence of any Tax audit or
controversy regarding the correctness of the Allocated Values or any
adjustment thereto.

  

  

3.10 Post-Closing Adjustments after Final Settlement Statement. If, during the
period from and after the Parties' agreement upon the Final Settlement
Statement up until the second (2nd) anniversary of Closing, (a) any Party
receives monies belonging to the other, including proceeds of production, then
such amount shall immediately be paid over to the proper Party, (b) any Party
pays monies for Operating Expenses which are the obligation of the other Party
hereto, then such other Party shall promptly reimburse the Party which paid
such Operating Expenses upon receipt of an invoice from such paying Party, (c)
a Party receives an invoice of an expense or obligation which is owed by the
other Party, such Party receiving the invoice shall promptly forward such
invoice to the Party obligated to pay the same, and (d) if an invoice or other
evidence of an obligation is received by a Party, which is partially an
obligation of both Seller and Buyer, then the Parties shall consult with each
other, and each shall promptly pay its portion of such obligation to the
obligee.

  

  

3.11 Allocation for Imbalances. If, prior to one hundred eighty (180) days
following Closing, either Party discovers an error in the Imbalances set forth
in Schedule 4.12 or updated amounts are available for those Imbalances set
forth on Schedule 4.12 that are identified as not being current as of the
Effective Time, then the Purchase Price shall be further adjusted either at
Closing or pursuant to the Final Settlement Statement pursuant to Section
3.3(a)(v), Section 3.3(a)(vi), Section 3.3(b)(vi) or Section 3.3(b)(vii), as
applicable, and Schedule 4.12 will be deemed amended immediately prior to
Closing to reflect the Imbalances for which the Purchase Price is so adjusted.

so long as Seller has voted its interest in a manner that complies with the
provisions of this Section 6.1.

  

  

6.2 Successor Operator. While Buyer acknowledges that it desires to succeed
Seller as operator of those Assets or portions thereof that Seller may
presently operate, Buyer acknowledges and agrees that Seller cannot and does
not covenant or warrant that Buyer shall become successor operator of such
Assets since the Assets or portions thereof may be subject to operating or

commercially reasonable efforts to support Buyer's efforts to become successor
operator of such Assets (to the extent permitted under any applicable joint

consult with each other with respect to all responses thereto. Each of Seller
and Buyer shall use its reasonable efforts to take all actions reasonably
necessary and appropriate in connection with any HSR Act filing to consummate
the transactions consummated hereby. Each Party shall pay its own fees and
expenses related to filings required by this Section 6.3.

guarantees to the extent such replacements are necessary (a) for Buyer's
ownership of the Assets and (b) to permit the cancellation of the bonds,

copying at Seller's expense, and (c) provide Seller, its Affiliates and its
and their officers, employees and representatives with access, during normal
business hours, to materials received or produced after Closing relating to
any indemnity claim made under Section 13.2 for review and copying at Seller's

of the Records, Buyer shall notify Seller in advance of such destruction and
provide Seller an opportunity to copy such Records at Seller's sole cost and
expense.

  

  

6.6 Guarantees. Buyer shall cooperate with Seller in order to cause Seller and
its Affiliates to be released, as of the Closing Date, from all guarantees,
including any performance bonds previously put in place by Seller, set forth
in Schedule 6.6, which shall describe the security posted (the "Guarantees").
Without limiting the foregoing, if required by the counterparty to any
Guarantee, Buyer shall provide, effective as of the Closing Date, substitute
arrangements of Buyer or its Affiliates covering all periods covered by the
Guarantees, such substitute arrangements to be equivalent or better in terms
of type of security and creditworthiness of the party providing the security
as compared to the Guarantees, as set forth in Schedule 6.6. In the event that
any counterparty to any such Guarantee does not release Seller and its
Affiliates, then, from and after Closing, Buyer shall indemnify Seller or its

Affiliate under such Guarantee (and all costs incurred in connection with such
Guarantee) if applicable to Assets acquired by Buyer. Notwithstanding anything

Seller or any Affiliate of Seller pursuant to the Guarantees must be returned

shall have the continuing right until Closing to add, supplement or amend the
Schedules to its representations and warranties with respect to any matter
hereafter arising or discovered which, if existing or known at the date hereof
or thereafter, would have been required to be set forth or described in such
Schedules. For all purposes of this Agreement, including for purposes of
determining whether the conditions set forth in Article VII have been
fulfilled, the Schedules to Seller's representations and warranties contained
in this Agreement shall be deemed to include only that information contained
therein on the date of this Agreement and shall be deemed to exclude all
information contained in any addition, supplement or amendment thereto;
provided, however, that if Closing shall occur, then all matters disclosed
pursuant to any such addition, supplement or amendment at or prior to Closing
shall be waived and Buyer shall not be entitled to make a claim with respect
thereto pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or otherwise.

assist such auditors, including making available (at Buyer's sole cost and
expense) books, records and personnel of Seller reasonably requested by such
auditing firm; provided, however, that in no event shall Seller or its
Affiliates be required to provide any representation letters to any Person as
a result of its obligations under this Section 6.10; and provided further,
however, that nothing in this Section 6.10 shall require any such cooperation
or assistance on the part of Seller to the extent it would interfere
unreasonably with the business or operations of Seller.

  

  

6.11 Shortfall Amounts. Seller hereby agrees to pay Buyer any "Shortfall
Amounts" (as such term is defined in the GandT Agreement, each a "Shortfall
Amount") due and owing by "Producer" (as such term is defined in the GandT
Agreement) pursuant to the terms of that certain Gas Gathering and Treating
Agreement, dated as of October 1, 2010, by and between Seller and Antero
Resources Midstream Corporation (Cardinal Midstream, LLC) (as amended,

the Assets, Buyer shall maintain, at its sole expense and with insurers
reasonably satisfactory to Seller, policies of insurance of the types and in
the amounts reasonably requested by Seller. Coverage under all insurance
required to be carried by Buyer hereunder will (i) be primary insurance, (ii)
list Seller Indemnified Parties as additional insureds, (iii) waive
subrogation against Seller Indemnified Parties and (iv) provide for ten (10)
days prior notice to Seller in the event of cancellation or modification of
the policy or reduction in coverage. Upon request by Seller, Buyer shall
provide evidence of such insurance to Seller prior to entering the Assets.

  

  

10.2 Confidentiality. Buyer acknowledges that, pursuant to its right of access
to the Records or the Assets, Buyer will become privy to confidential and
other information of Seller or its Affiliates and Buyer shall ensure that such
confidential information shall be held confidential by Buyer and Buyer's
Representatives in accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.
If Closing should occur, the foregoing confidentiality restriction on Buyer,
including the Confidentiality Agreement, shall terminate (except as to (a)
such portion of the Assets that are not conveyed to Buyer pursuant to the
provisions of this Agreement, (b) the Excluded Assets and (c) information
related to assets other than the Assets).

ARTICLE XI

  

  

TITLE MATTERS; CASUALTY; TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS

  

  

11.1 Seller's Title.

  

  

(a) General Disclaimer of Title Warranties and Representations. Except for the
special warranty of title as set forth in Section 11.1(b) and without limiting
Buyer's remedies for Title Defects set forth in this Article XI, Seller makes
no warranty or representation, express, implied, statutory or otherwise, with
respect to Seller's title to any of the Assets and Buyer hereby acknowledges
and agrees that Buyer's sole remedy for any defect of title, including any
Title Defect, with respect to any of the Assets (i) before Closing, shall be
as set forth in Section 11.2 and (ii) after Closing, shall be pursuant to the
special warranty of title set forth in Section 11.1(b).

  

  

(b) Special Warranty of Title. If Closing occurs, then effective as of the
Closing Date, Seller warrants Defensible Title to the Assets (but, with
respect to any Lease and any Well or Undrilled Location associated therewith,
limited to the depths set forth in Exhibit A or Exhibit A-1, as applicable)
unto Buyer against every Person whomsoever lawfully claiming or to claim the
same or any part thereof by, through or under Seller or its Affiliates, but
not otherwise, subject, however, to the Permitted Encumbrances and to any
matters of record in the applicable counties or in the applicable state or
federal records prior to the Defect Claim Date; provided, however, that,
except with respect to any liability of Seller for any claim asserted in
writing by Buyer to Seller in accordance with Section 11.1(c) on or before the
expiration of the Survival Period for breach of such special warranty, such
special warranty shall cease and terminate at the end of such Survival Period.
Said special warranty of title shall be subject to the further limitations and
provisions of this Article XI.

  

  

(c) Recovery on Special Warranty.

  

  

(i) Buyer's Assertion of Title Warranty Breaches. Prior to the expiration of
the period of time commencing as of the Closing Date and ending at 5 p.m.
Central Time on the twelve (12) month anniversary thereof (the "Survival
Period"), Buyer shall furnish Seller a Title Defect Notice meeting the
requirements of Section 11.2(a) setting forth any matters which Buyer intends
to assert as a breach of Seller's special warranty in Section 11.1(b). For all
purposes of this Agreement, Buyer shall be deemed to have waived, and Seller
shall have no further liability for, any breach of Seller's special warranty
that Buyer fails to assert by a Title Defect Notice given to Seller on or
before the expiration of the Survival Period. Seller shall have a reasonable
opportunity, but not the obligation, to cure any Title Defect asserted by
Buyer pursuant to this Section 11.1(c)(i). Buyer agrees to reasonably
cooperate with any attempt by Seller to cure any such Title Defect.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

25  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(ii) Limitations on Special Warranty. For purposes of Seller's special
warranty of title, the value of the Wells and/or Undrilled Locations set forth
in Schedule 3.8, as appropriate (but limited to the depths, if any, set forth
on Exhibit A-1 for such Well and/or Undrilled Location), shall be deemed to be
the Allocated Value thereof, as adjusted herein. Recovery on Seller's special
warranty of title shall be limited to an amount (without any interest accruing
thereon) equal to the reduction in the Purchase Price to which Buyer would
have been entitled had Buyer asserted the Title Defect giving rise to such
breach of Seller's special warranty of title as a Title Defect prior to
Closing pursuant to Section 11.2, in each case taking into account the
Individual Title Defect Threshold and the Aggregate Deductible. Seller shall
be entitled to offset any amount owed by Seller for breach of its special
warranty of title with respect to any Asset by the amount of any Title
Benefits with respect to such Asset as to which Seller gives Buyer notice
after the Defect Claim Date.

  

  

11.2 Notice of Title Defects; Defect Adjustments.

  

  

(a) Title Defect Notices. Buyer must deliver at least five (5) Business Days
before Closing (the "Defect Claim Date") claim notices to Seller meeting the
requirements of this Section 11.2(a) (collectively the "Title Defect Notices"
and individually a "Title Defect Notice") setting forth any matters which, in
Buyer's reasonable opinion, constitute Title Defects and which Buyer intends
to assert as a Title Defect pursuant to this Section 11.2(a). For all purposes
of this Agreement and notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary (except
as provided in Section 11.1), Buyer shall be deemed to have waived, and Seller
shall have no liability for, any Title Defect which Buyer fails to assert as a
Title Defect by a properly delivered Title Defect Notice received by Seller on
or before the Defect Claim Date; provided, however, that, for purposes of
Seller's special warranty to title under Section 11.1(b), such waiver shall
not apply to any matter that prior to the Defect Claim Date is not reflected
of record in the applicable counties or in the applicable state or federal
records. To be effective, each Title Defect Notice shall be in writing, and
shall include (i) a description of the alleged Title Defect and the Asset, or
portion thereof, affected by such Title Defect (each a "Title Defect
Property"), (ii) the Allocated Value of each Title Defect Property, (iii)
supporting documents reasonably necessary for Seller to verify the existence
of such alleged Title Defect, and (iv) the amount by which Buyer reasonably
believes the Allocated Value of each Title Defect Property is reduced by such
alleged Title Defect and the computations upon which Buyer's belief is based.
Buyer shall promptly upon discovery furnish Seller with written notice of any
Title Benefit which is discovered by any of Buyer's or any of its Affiliate's
employees, title attorneys, landmen or other title examiners while conducting
Buyer's due diligence with respect to the Assets prior to the Defect Claim
Date.

  

  

(b) Title Benefit Notices. Seller shall have the right, but not the
obligation, to deliver to Buyer on or before the Defect Claim Date with
respect to each Title Benefit a notice (a "Title Benefit Notice") including
(i) a description of the alleged Title Benefit and the Asset, or portion
thereof, affected by such alleged Title Benefit (each a "Title Benefit
Property"), and (ii) the amount by which Seller reasonably believes the
Allocated Value of such Title Benefit Property is increased by such alleged
Title Benefit and the computations upon which Seller's belief is based. Seller
shall be deemed to have waived all Title Benefits for which a Title Benefit
Notice has not been delivered on or before the Defect Claim Date.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

26  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) Seller's Right to Cure. Seller shall have the right, but not the
obligation, to attempt, at its sole cost, to cure at any time prior to the
expiration of one hundred and eighty (180) days following Closing (the "Cure
Period"), any Title Defects of which it has timely received a Title Defect
Notice from Buyer. During the period of time from Closing to the expiration of
the Cure Period, Buyer hereby agrees to afford Seller and its officers,
employees, agents and other authorized representatives reasonable access,
during normal business hours, to the Assets and all Records in Buyer's or any
of its Affiliates' possession in order that Seller may attempt to cure any
such Title Defects.

  

  

(d) Remedies for Title Defects. Subject to Seller's continuing right to
dispute the existence of a Title Defect and/or the Title Defect Amount
asserted with respect thereto and subject to the rights of the Parties
pursuant to Section 14.1(c), in the event that any Title Defect timely
asserted by Buyer in accordance with Section 11.2(a) is not waived in writing
by Buyer or cured prior to Closing, Seller shall, at its sole option, elect
to:

  

  

(i) subject to the Individual Title Defect Threshold and the Aggregate
Deductible, reduce the Purchase Price by the Title Defect Amount determined
pursuant to Section 11.2(h) or Section 11.2(k);

  

  

(ii) retain the entirety of the Title Defect Property that is subject to such
Title Defect, together with all associated Assets, in which event the Purchase
Price shall be reduced by an amount equal to the Allocated Value of such Title
Defect Property and such associated Assets; or

  

  

(iii) if applicable, terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 14.1(c).

  

  

(e) Post-Closing Payments/Adjustments.

  

  

(i) In the event that an adjustment for a Title Defect Amount is made to the
Purchase Price and Seller thereafter cures, during the Cure Period, the Title
Defect(s) for which such adjustment was made, then, at Seller's election, (A)
the Final Price reflected in the Final Settlement Statement shall be adjusted
upward by the amount by which the Purchase Price was adjusted on account of
such Title Defect(s) at Closing, or (B) Buyer shall promptly, but in any event
within ten (10) Business Days after such Title Defect(s) has been cured and
Buyer has received written notice from Seller thereof, together with
supporting documentation available to Seller reasonably necessary to verify
such cure of such Title Defect(s), pay to Seller the amount by which the
Purchase Price was adjusted on account of such Title Defect(s).

  

  

(ii) In the event Seller retained the entirety of a Title Defect Property
pursuant to Section 11.2(d) at Closing and Seller thereafter cures, during the
Cure Period, the Title Defect(s) affecting such Title Defect Property, then,
(A) at Seller's election, (x) the Final Price reflected in the Final
Settlement Statement shall be adjusted upward by the Allocated Value of such
Title Defect Property and any associated Assets, or (y) Buyer shall promptly,
but in any event within ten (10) Business Days after such Title Defect(s) has
been cured and Buyer has received written notice from Seller thereof, together
with supporting documentation available to Seller reasonably necessary to
verify such cure of such Title Defect(s), pay to Seller the Allocated Value of
the Title Defect Property, and (B) promptly following receipt of payment,
Seller shall convey the Title Defect Property to Buyer pursuant to an
assignment and bill of sale substantially in the form attached to this
Agreement as Exhibit B.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

27  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(f) Remedies for Title Benefits. With respect to each Title Benefit Property
reported under Section 11.2(b), the Purchase Price shall be increased by an
amount (the "Title Benefit Amount") equal to the increase in the Allocated
Value for such Title Benefit Property caused by such Title Benefit, as
determined pursuant to Section 11.2(i) or Section 11.2(k).

  

  

(g) Exclusive Remedy. Except for Buyer's rights under Seller's special
warranty of title under Section 11.1(b) and Buyer's rights to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 14.1(c), the provisions set forth in Section
11.2(d) shall be the exclusive right and remedy of Buyer with respect to
Seller's failure to have Defensible Title with respect to any Asset or any
other title matter.

  

  

(h) Title Defect Amount. The amount by which the Allocated Value of a Title
Defect Property is reduced as a result of the existence of a Title Defect
shall be the "Title Defect Amount" and shall be determined in accordance with
the following terms and conditions:

  

  

(i) if Buyer and Seller agree on the Title Defect Amount, then that amount
shall be the Title Defect Amount;

  

  

(ii) if the Title Defect is an Encumbrance that is undisputed and liquidated
in amount, then the Title Defect Amount shall be the amount necessary to be
paid to remove the Title Defect from the Title Defect Property;

  

  

(iii) if the Title Defect represents a discrepancy between (A) Seller's Net
Revenue Interest for any Title Defect Property and (B) the Net Revenue
Interest set forth for such Title Defect Property in Exhibit A-1, then the
Title Defect Amount shall be the product of the Allocated Value of such Title
Defect Property multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Net
Revenue Interest decrease and the denominator of which is the Net Revenue
Interest set forth for such Title Defect Property in Exhibit A-1;

  

  

(iv) if the Title Defect represents an obligation or Encumbrance upon or other
defect in title to the Title Defect Property of a type not described above,
then the Title Defect Amount shall be determined by taking into account the
Allocated Value of the Title Defect Property, the portion of the Title Defect
Property affected by the Title Defect, the legal effect of the Title Defect,
the potential economic effect of the Title Defect over the life of the Title
Defect Property, the values placed upon the Title Defect by Buyer and Seller
and such other reasonable factors as are necessary to make a proper
evaluation; provided, however, that if such Title Defect is reasonably capable
of being cured, the Title Defect Amount shall not be greater than the
reasonable cost and expense of curing such Title Defect;

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

28  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(v) the Title Defect Amount with respect to a Title Defect Property shall be
determined without duplication of any costs or losses included in another
Title Defect Amount hereunder; and

  

  

(vi) notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article XI, the
aggregate Title Defect Amounts attributable to the effects of all Title
Defects upon any Title Defect Property shall not exceed the Allocated Value of
such Title Defect Property.

  

  

(i) Title Benefit Amount. The Title Benefit Amount resulting from a Title
Benefit shall be determined in accordance with the following methodology,
terms and conditions:

  

  

(i) if Buyer and Seller agree on the Title Benefit Amount, then that amount
shall be the Title Benefit Amount;

  

  

(ii) if the Title Benefit represents a discrepancy between (A) Seller's Net
Revenue Interest for any Title Benefit Property and (B) the Net Revenue
Interest set forth for such Title Benefit Property in Exhibit A-1, then the
Title Benefit Amount shall be the product of the Allocated Value of such Title
Benefit Property multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Net
Revenue Interest increase and the denominator of which is the Net Revenue
Interest set forth for such Title Benefit Property in Exhibit A-1; and

  

  

(iii) if the Title Benefit is of a type not described above, then the Title
Benefit Amounts shall be determined by taking into account the Allocated Value
of Title Benefit Property, the portion of such Title Benefit Property affected
by such Title Benefit, the legal effect of the Title Benefit, the potential
economic effect of the Title Benefit over the life of such Title Benefit
Property, the values placed upon the Title Benefit by Buyer and Seller and
such other reasonable factors as are necessary to make a proper evaluation.

  

  

(j) Title Deductibles. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, (i) in no
event shall there be any adjustments to the Purchase Price or other remedies
provided by Seller for any individual Title Defect for which the Title Defect
Amount does not exceed $100,000 (the "Individual Title Defect Threshold"); and
(ii) in no event shall there be any adjustments to the Purchase Price or other
remedies provided by Seller for any Title Defect that exceeds the Individual
Title Defect Threshold unless (A) the amount of the sum of (1) the aggregate
Title Defect Amounts of all such Title Defects that exceed the Individual
Title Defect Threshold (but excluding any such Title Defects cured by Seller),
plus (2) the aggregate Remediation Amounts of all Environmental Defects that
exceed the Individual Environmental Threshold (but excluding any Environmental
Defects cured by Seller), exceeds (B) the Aggregate Deductible, after which
point Buyer shall be entitled to adjustments to the Purchase Price or other
applicable remedies available hereunder, but, only with respect to the
aggregate amount of such Title Defect Amounts and Remediation Amounts in
excess of the Aggregate Deductible. For the avoidance of doubt, if Seller
retains any Title Defect Property pursuant to Section 11.2(d)(ii), the Title
Defect Amount related to such Title Defect Property will not be counted
towards the Aggregate Deductible.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

29  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(k) Title Dispute Resolution. Seller and Buyer shall attempt to agree on all
Title Defects, Title Benefits, Title Defect Amounts and Title Benefit Amounts
prior to Closing. If Seller and Buyer are unable to agree by Closing, the
Title Defect Amounts and Title Benefit Amounts in dispute shall be exclusively
and finally resolved pursuant to this Section 11.2(k). There shall be a single
arbitrator, who shall be a title attorney with at least ten (10) years
experience in oil and gas titles involving properties in the regional area in
which the Title Defect Properties are located, as selected by mutual agreement
of Buyer and Seller within fifteen (15) days after the end of the Cure Period,
and absent such agreement, by the Denver, Colorado office of the American
Arbitration Association (the "Title Arbitrator"). The arbitration proceeding
shall be held in Denver, Colorado and shall be conducted in accordance with
the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association, to
the extent such rules do not conflict with the terms of this Section 11.2(k).
The Title Arbitrator's determination shall be made within twenty (20) days
after submission of the matters in dispute and shall be final and binding upon
both Parties, without right of appeal. In making its determination, the Title
Arbitrator shall be bound by the rules set forth in Section 11.2(h) and
Section 11.2(i) and, subject to the foregoing, may consider such other matters
as in the opinion of the Title Arbitrator are necessary to make a proper
determination. The Title Arbitrator, however, may not award the Buyer a
greater Title Defect Amount than the Title Defect Amount claimed by Buyer in
its applicable Title Defect Notice. The Title Arbitrator shall act as an
expert for the limited purpose of determining the specific disputed Title
Defect, Title Benefit, Title Defect Amount and/or Title Benefit Amount
submitted by either Party and may not award damages, interest or penalties to
either Party with respect to any matter. Seller and Buyer shall each bear its
own legal fees and other costs of presenting its case. Each of Seller and
Buyer shall bear one-half of the costs and expenses of the Title Arbitrator.
To the extent that the award of the Title Arbitrator with respect to any Title
Defect Amount or Title Benefit Amount is not taken into account as an
adjustment to the Purchase Price pursuant to Section 3.5 or Section 3.7, then
within ten (10) days after the Title Arbitrator delivers written notice to
Buyer and Seller of his award with respect to a Title Defect Amount or a Title
Benefit Amount and, subject to Section 11.2(j) (i) Buyer shall pay to Seller
the amount, if any, so awarded by the Title Arbitrator to Seller, and (ii)
Seller shall pay to Buyer the amount, if any, so awarded by the Title
Arbitrator to Buyer. Nothing herein shall operate to cause Closing to be
delayed on account of any arbitration conducted pursuant to this Section
11.2(k) and, to the extent any adjustments are not agreed upon by the Parties
as of Closing, the Purchase Price shall not be adjusted therefor at Closing
and subsequent adjustments to the Purchase Price, if any, will be made
pursuant to Section 3.7 or this Section 11.2.

  

  

11.3 Casualty Loss.

  

  

(a) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, from and after the
Effective Time, if Closing occurs, Buyer shall assume all risk of loss with
respect to production of Hydrocarbons through normal depletion (including
watering out of any well, collapsed casing or sand infiltration of any well)
and the depreciation of Personal Property due to ordinary wear and tear, in
each case, with respect to the Assets.

  

  

(b) If, after the date of this Agreement but prior to the Closing Date, any
portion of the Assets is destroyed by fire or other casualty (each, a
"Casualty Loss"), the Closing shall nevertheless occur despite such Casualty
Loss without any adjustment to the Purchase Price, and Seller, at Closing,
shall pay to Buyer all sums paid to Seller by Third Parties by reason of any
Casualty Loss insofar as with respect to the Assets and shall assign, transfer
and set over to Buyer or subrogate Buyer to all of Seller\'s right, title and
interest (if any) in insurance claims, unpaid awards, and other rights against
Third Parties (excluding any Liabilities, other than insurance claims, of or
against any Seller Indemnified Parties) arising out of such Casualty Loss
insofar as with respect to the Assets; provided, however, that Seller shall
reserve and retain (and Buyer shall assign to Seller) all right, title,
interest and claims against Third Parties for the recovery of Seller\'s costs
and expenses incurred prior to Closing in pursuing or asserting any such
insurance claims or other rights against Third Parties to the extent no
adjustment has been made in Seller's favor under Section 3.3 for such costs
and expenses.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

30  

  

 

 

 

  

  

11.4 Preferential Purchase Rights and Consents to Assign.

  

  

(a) With respect to each Preferential Purchase Right set forth in Schedule
4.10, Seller, prior to Closing, shall send to the holder of each such
Preferential Purchase Right a notice in material compliance with the
contractual provisions applicable to such Preferential Purchase Right.

  

  

(i) If, prior to Closing, any holder of a Preferential Purchase Right notifies
Seller that it intends to consummate the purchase of the Asset to which its
Preferential Purchase Right applies or if the time for exercising such
Preferential Purchase Right has not expired, then the Asset subject to such
Preferential Purchase Right shall be excluded from the Assets to be assigned
to Buyer at Closing (but only to the extent of the portion of such Asset
affected by the Preferential Purchase Right), and the Purchase Price shall be
reduced by the Allocated Value of the Asset (or portion thereof) so excluded.
Seller shall be entitled to all proceeds paid by any Person exercising a
Preferential Purchase Right prior to Closing. If such holder of such
Preferential Purchase Right thereafter fails to consummate the purchase of the
Asset (or portion thereof) covered by such Preferential Purchase Right on or
before sixty (60) days following the Closing Date, or the time for exercising
such Preferential Purchase Right expires without exercise by the holder
thereof (A) Seller shall so notify Buyer and (B) Buyer shall purchase, on or
before ten (10) days following receipt of such notice, such Asset (or portion
thereof) that was so excluded from Seller, under the terms of this Agreement
and for a price equal to the amount by which the Purchase Price was reduced at
Closing with respect to such excluded Asset (or portion thereof).

  

  

(ii) All Assets for which any applicable Preferential Purchase Right has been
waived, or as to which the period to exercise the applicable Preferential
Purchase Right has expired, in each case, prior to Closing, shall be sold to
Buyer at Closing pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement.

  

  

(b) With respect to each Consent set forth in Schedule 4.4, Seller, prior to
Closing, shall send to the holder of each such Consent a notice in material
compliance with the contractual provisions applicable to such Consent seeking
such holder's consent to the transactions contemplated hereby.

  

  

(i) If (A) Seller fails to obtain a Consent set forth in Schedule 4.4 prior to
Closing and the failure to obtain such Consent would cause (1) the assignment
of the Assets affected thereby to Buyer to be void or (2) the termination of a
Lease under the express terms thereof or (B) a Consent requested by Seller is
denied in writing, then, in each case, the Asset (or portion thereof) affected
by such un-obtained Consent shall be excluded from the Assets to be assigned
to Buyer at Closing, and the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the Allocated
Value of such Asset (or portion thereof) so excluded. In the event that a
Consent (with respect to an Asset excluded pursuant to this Section11.4(b)(i))
that was not obtained prior to Closing is obtained within sixty (60) days
following Closing, then, within ten (10) days after such Consent is obtained
(x) Buyer shall purchase the Asset (or portion thereof) that was so excluded
as a result of such previously un-obtained Consent and pay to Seller the
amount by which the Purchase Price was reduced at Closing with respect to the
Asset (or portion thereof) so excluded and (y) Seller shall assign to Buyer
the Asset (or portion thereof) so excluded at Closing pursuant to an
instrument in substantially the same form as the Assignment.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

31  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(ii) If Seller fails to obtain a Consent set forth in Schedule 4.4 prior to
Closing (A) and the failure to obtain such Consent would not cause (1) the
assignment of the Asset (or portion thereof) affected thereby to Buyer to be
void or (2) the termination of a Lease under the express terms thereof and (B)
such Consent requested by Seller is not denied in writing by the holder
thereof, then the Asset (or portion thereof) subject to such un-obtained
Consent shall nevertheless be assigned by Seller to Buyer at Closing as part
of the Assets and Buyer shall have no claim against, and Seller shall have no
Liability for, the failure to obtain such Consent.

  

  

(iii) Prior to Closing, Seller and Buyer shall use their commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain all Consents listed on Schedule 4.4; provided,
however, that neither Party shall be required to incur any Liability or pay
any money in order to obtain any such Consent. Subject to the foregoing, Buyer
hereby agrees to provide Seller with any information or documentation that may
be reasonably requested by Seller and/or the Third Party holders of such
Consents in order to facilitate the process of obtaining such Consents.

  

  

ARTICLE XII

  

  

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

  

  

12.1 Notice of Environmental Defects.

  

  

(a) Environmental Defects Notice. Buyer must deliver, at or prior to the
Defect Claim Date, claim notices to Seller meeting the requirements of this
Section 12.1(a) (collectively the "Environmental Defect Notices" and
individually an "Environmental Defect Notice") setting forth any matters
which, in Buyer's reasonable opinion, constitute Environmental Defects and
which Buyer intends to assert as Environmental Defects pursuant to this
Section 12.1. For all purposes of this Agreement, but subject to Buyer's
remedy for a breach of Seller's representation contained in Section 4.14,
Buyer shall be deemed to have waived, and Seller shall have no liability for,
any Environmental Defect which Buyer fails to assert as an Environmental
Defect by a properly delivered Environmental Defect Notice received by Seller
on or before the Defect Claim Date. To be effective, each Environmental Defect
Notice shall be in writing and shall include (i) a description of the matter
constituting the alleged Environmental Condition (including the applicable
Environmental Law violated or implicated thereby) and the Assets affected by
such alleged Environmental Condition, (ii) the Allocated Value of the Assets
(or portions thereof) affected by such alleged Environmental Condition, (iii)
supporting documents reasonably necessary for Seller to verify the existence
of such alleged Environmental Condition, and (iv) a calculation of the
Remediation Amount (itemized in reasonable detail) that Buyer asserts is
attributable to such alleged Environmental Defect. Buyer's calculation of the
Remediation Amount included in the Environmental Defect Notice must describe
in reasonable detail the Remediation proposed for the alleged Environmental
Condition that gives rise to the asserted Environmental Defect and identify
all assumptions used by the Buyer in calculating the Remediation Amount,
including the standards that Buyer asserts must be met to comply with
Environmental Laws. Seller shall have the right, but not the obligation, to
cure any asserted Environmental Defect on or before Closing.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

32  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) Remedies for Environmental Defects. Subject to Seller's continuing right
to dispute the existence of an Environmental Defect and/or the Remediation
Amount asserted with respect thereto, and subject to the rights of the Parties
pursuant to Section 14.1(c), in the event that any Environmental Defect timely
asserted by Buyer in accordance with Section 12.1(a) is not waived in writing
by Buyer or cured during the Cure Period, Seller shall, at its sole option,
elect to:

  

  

(i) subject to the Individual Environmental Threshold and the Aggregate
Deductible, reduce the Purchase Price by the Remediation Amount;

  

  

(ii) assume responsibility for the Remediation of such Environmental Defect;

  

  

(iii) retain the entirety of the Asset that is subject to such Environmental
Defect, together with all associated Assets, in which event the Purchase Price
shall be reduced by an amount equal to the Allocated Value of such Asset and
such associated Assets; or

  

  

(iv) if applicable, terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 14.1(c).

  

  

If Seller elects the option set forth in clause (i) above, and if Closing
occurs, Buyer shall be deemed to have assumed responsibility for all of the
costs and expenses attributable to the Remediation of the Environmental
Condition attributable to such Environmental Defect and all of all Liabilities
with respect thereto and such responsibility of Buyer shall be deemed to
constitute part of the Assumed Obligations hereunder. If Seller elects the
option set forth in clause (ii) above, Seller shall use reasonable efforts to
implement such Remediation in a manner which is consistent with the
requirements of Environmental Laws in a timely fashion for the type of
Remediation that Seller elects to undertake and Buyer, effective as of
Closing, hereby grants to Seller and its representatives, access to the Assets
to conduct such Remediation. Seller will be deemed to have adequately
completed the Remediation required in the immediately preceding sentence (A)
upon receipt of a certificate or approval from the applicable Governmental
Authority that the Remediation has been implemented to the extent necessary to
comply with existing Laws or (B) upon receipt of a certificate from a licensed
professional engineer that the Remediation has been implemented to the extent
necessary to comply with existing Laws.

  

  

(c) Exclusive Remedy. Except for Buyer's remedy for a breach of Seller's
representation contained in Section 4.14 and Buyer's rights to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 14.1(c), the provisions set forth in Section
12.1(b) shall be the exclusive right and remedy of Buyer with respect to any
Environmental Defect with respect to any Asset or other environmental matter.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

33  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(d) Environmental Deductibles. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, (i)
in no event shall there be any adjustments to the Purchase Price or other
remedies provided by Seller for any individual Environmental Defect for which
the Remediation Amount does not exceed $100,000 (the "Individual Environmental
Threshold"); and (ii) in no event shall there be any adjustments to the
Purchase Price or other remedies provided by Seller for any Environmental
Defect for which the Remediation Amount exceeds the Individual Environmental
Threshold unless (A) the amount of the sum of (1) the aggregate Remediation
Amounts of all such Environmental Defects that exceed the Individual
Environmental Threshold (but excluding any Environmental Defects cured by
Seller), plus (2) the aggregate Title Defect Amounts of all Title Defects that
exceed the Individual Title Defect Threshold (but excluding any Title Defects
cured by Seller), exceeds (B) the Aggregate Deductible, after which point
Buyer shall be entitled to adjustments to the Purchase Price or other
applicable remedies available hereunder, but only with respect to the
aggregate amount of such Remediation Amounts and Title Defect Amounts in
excess of the Aggregate Deductible. For the avoidance of doubt, if Seller
retains any Assets pursuant to Section 12.1(b)(iii), the Remediation Amounts
relating to such retained Assets will not be counted towards the Aggregate
Deductible.

  

  

(e) Environmental Dispute Resolution. Seller and Buyer shall attempt to agree
on all Environmental Defects and Remediation Amounts prior to Closing. If
Seller and Buyer are unable to agree by Closing, the Environmental Defects
and/or Remediation Amounts in dispute shall be exclusively and finally
resolved by arbitration pursuant to this Section 12.1(e). There shall be a
single arbitrator, who shall be an environmental attorney with at least ten
(10) years experience in environmental matters involving oil and gas producing
properties in the regional area in which the affected Assets are located, as
selected by mutual agreement of Buyer and Seller within fifteen (15) days
after the Closing Date, and absent such agreement, by the Denver, Colorado
office of the American Arbitration Association (the "Environmental
Arbitrator"). The arbitration proceeding shall be held in Denver, Colorado and
shall be conducted in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the
American Arbitration Association, to the extent such rules do not conflict
with the terms of this Section 12.1. The Environmental Arbitrator's
determination shall be made within twenty (20) days after submission of the
matters in dispute and shall be final and binding upon both Parties, without
right of appeal. In making its determination, the Environmental Arbitrator
shall be bound by the rules set forth in this Section 12.1 and, subject to the
foregoing, may consider such other matters as in the opinion of the
Environmental Arbitrator are necessary or helpful to make a proper
determination. The Environmental Arbitrator, however, may not award Buyer its
share of any greater Remediation Amount than the Remediation Amount claimed by
Buyer in its applicable Environmental Defect Notice. The Environmental
Arbitrator shall act as an expert for the limited purpose of determining the
specific disputed Environmental Defects and/or Remediation Amounts submitted
by either Party and may not award damages, interest or penalties to either
Party with respect to any matter. Seller and Buyer shall each bear its own
legal fees and other costs of presenting its case. Each of Seller and Buyer
shall bear one-half of the costs and expenses of the Environmental Arbitrator.
To the extent that the award of the Environmental Arbitrator with respect to
any Remediation Amount is not taken into account as an adjustment to the
Purchase Price pursuant to Section 3.5 or Section 3.7, then, within ten (10)
days after the Environmental Arbitrator delivers written notice to Buyer and
Seller of his award with respect to any Remediation Amount, and subject to
Section 12.1(d) (i) Buyer shall pay to Seller the amount, if any, so awarded
by the Environmental Arbitrator to Seller, and (ii) Seller shall pay to Buyer
the amount, if any, so awarded by the Environmental Arbitrator to Buyer.
Nothing herein shall operate to cause Closing to be delayed on account of any
arbitration conducted pursuant to this Section 12.1(e), and to the extent any
adjustments are not agreed upon by the Parties as of Closing, the Purchase
Price shall not be adjusted therefor at Closing and subsequent adjustments to
the Purchase Price, if any, will be made pursuant to Section 3.7 or this
Section 12.1(e).

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

34  

  

 

 

 

  

  

12.2 NORM, Wastes and Other Substances. Buyer acknowledges that the Assets
have been used for exploration, development, and production of oil and gas and
that there may be petroleum, produced water, wastes or other substances or
materials located in, on or under the Assets or associated with the Assets.
Equipment and sites included in the Assets may contain asbestos, NORM or other
Hazardous Substances. NORM may affix or attach itself to the inside of wells,
materials and equipment as scale, or in other forms. The wells, materials and
equipment located on the Assets or included in the Assets may contain NORM and
other wastes or Hazardous Substances. NORM containing material and/or other
wastes or Hazardous Substances may have come in contact with various
environmental media, including, water, soils or sediment. Special procedures
may be required for the assessment, remediation, removal, transportation, or
disposal of environmental media, wastes, asbestos, NORM and other Hazardous
Substances from the Assets.

(e) any act or omission by Seller involving or relating to the Excluded

36  

  

 

 

 

  

  

13.3 Indemnities of Buyer. Effective as of Closing, Buyer and its successors
and assigns shall assume, be responsible for, shall pay on a current basis,
and hereby defends, indemnifies, holds harmless and forever releases Seller

from, based upon, related to or associated with:

  

  

(a) any breach by Buyer of any of its representations or warranties contained

(a) Seller shall not have any liability for any indemnification under Section
13.2(a) and Section 13.2(f) of this Agreement (i) for any individual Liability
unless the amount with respect to such Liability exceeds $100,000, and (ii)
until and unless the aggregate amount of all Liabilities for which Claim
Notices are delivered by Buyer exceeds the Indemnity Deductible, and then only
to the extent such Liabilities exceeds the Indemnity Deductible; provided that
the adjustments to the Purchase Price under Section 3.3, Section 3.5, Section
3.6, Section 3.7 or Section 3.8 and any payments in respect thereof shall not
be limited by this Section 13.4(a).

  

  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
Seller shall not be required to indemnify Buyer for aggregate Liabilities in
excess of $34,000,000.00; provided that the adjustments to the Purchase Price
under Section 3.3, Section 3.5, Section 3.6, Section 3.7 or Section 3.8 and
any payments in respect thereof shall not be limited by this Section 13.4(b).

  

  

13.5 Express Negligence. THE DEFENSE, INDEMNIFICATION, HOLD HARMLESS, RELEASE
AND ASSUMED OBLIGATIONS PROVISIONS PROVIDED FOR IN THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE
APPLICABLE WHETHER OR NOT THE LIABILITIES, LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES AND DAMAGES
IN QUESTION AROSE OR RESULTED SOLELY OR IN PART FROM THE SOLE, ACTIVE,
PASSIVE, CONCURRENT OR COMPARATIVE NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER FAULT
OF OR BY ANY INDEMNIFIED PARTY. BUYER AND SELLER ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THIS
STATEMENT COMPLIES WITH THE EXPRESS NEGLIGENCE RULE AND IS CONSPICUOUS.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

37  

  

 

 

 

  

  

13.6 Exclusive Remedy. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, the Parties agree that, from and after Closing, Section 6.6,
Section 10.1(c), Section 11.1(c), Section 13.2 and Section 13.3, contain the
Parties' exclusive remedies against each other with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby, including breaches of the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements of the Parties contained in this
Agreement or in any document or certificate delivered pursuant to this
Agreement. Except as specified in Section 11.1(c) and Section 13.2, effective
as of Closing, Buyer, on its own behalf and on behalf of the Buyer Indemnified
Parties, hereby releases, remises and forever discharges Seller and its
Affiliates and all such Persons' equityholders, partners, members, directors,
officers, employees, agents and representatives from any and all suits, legal
or administrative proceedings, claims, demands, damages, losses, costs,
Liabilities, interest or causes of action whatsoever, in Law or in equity,
known or unknown, which Buyer or the Buyer Indemnified Parties might now or
subsequently may have, based on, relating to or arising out of this Agreement,
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the ownership, use or
operation of any of the Assets prior to Closing or the condition, quality,
status or nature of any of the Assets prior to Closing, including rights to
contribution under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and
Liability Act of 1980, as amended, breaches of statutory or implied
warranties, nuisance or other tort actions, rights to punitive damages, common
Law rights of contribution and rights under insurance maintained by Seller or
any of its Affiliates (except as provided in Section 11.3(b)).

  

  

13.7 Indemnification Procedures. All claims for indemnification under Section
6.6, Section 10.1(c), Section 13.2 and Section 13.3 shall be asserted and
resolved as follows:

  

  

(a) For purposes of Section 6.6, Section 10.1(c) and this Article XIII, the
term "Indemnifying Party" when used in connection with particular Liabilities
shall mean the Party or Parties having an obligation to indemnify another
Party or Parties with respect to such Liabilities pursuant to Section 6.6,
Section 10.1(c) or this Article XIII, and the term "Indemnified Party" when
used in connection with particular Liabilities shall mean the Party or Parties
having the right to be indemnified with respect to such Liabilities by another
Party or Parties pursuant to Section 6.6, Section 10.1(c) or this Article
XIII.

  

  

(b) To make claim for indemnification under Section 6.6, Section 10.1(c),
Section 13.2 and Section 13.3, an Indemnified Party shall notify the
Indemnifying Party of its claim under this Section 13.7, including the
specific details of and specific basis under this Agreement for its claim (the
"Claim Notice"). In the event that the claim for indemnification is based upon
a claim by a Third Party against the Indemnified Party (a "Third Party
Claim"), the Indemnified Party shall provide its Third Party Claim Notice
promptly after the Indemnified Party has actual knowledge of the Third Party
Claim and shall enclose a copy of all papers (if any) served with respect to
the Third Party Claim; provided that the failure of any Indemnified Party to
give notice of a Third Party Claim as provided in this Section 13.7(b) shall
not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations under Section 6.6,
Section 10.1(c), Section 13.2 and Section 13.3 (as applicable) except to the
extent such failure results in insufficient time being available to permit the
Indemnifying Party to effectively defend against the Third Party Claim or
otherwise materially prejudices the Indemnifying Party\'s ability to defend
against the Third Party Claim. In the event that the claim for indemnification
is based upon an inaccuracy or breach of a representation, warranty, covenant
or agreement, the Third Party Claim Notice shall specify the representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement that was inaccurate or breached.

  

  

(c) In the case of a claim for indemnification based upon a Third Party Claim,
the Indemnifying Party shall have thirty (30) days from its receipt of the
Claim Notice to notify the Indemnified Party whether it admits or denies its
liability to defend the Indemnified Party against such Third Party Claim at
the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party. The Indemnified Party is
authorized, prior to and during such thirty (30) day period, to file any
motion, answer or other pleading that it shall deem necessary or appropriate
to protect its interests or those of the Indemnifying Party and that is not
prejudicial to the Indemnifying Party.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

38  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(d) If the Indemnifying Party admits its liability to defend the Indemnified
Party against a Third Party Claim, it shall have the right and obligation to
diligently defend, at its sole cost and expense, the Indemnified Party against
such Third Party Claim. The Indemnifying Party shall have full control of such
defense and proceedings, including any compromise or settlement thereof. If
requested by the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party agrees to cooperate
in contesting any Third Party Claim which the Indemnifying Party elects to
contest. The Indemnified Party may participate in, but not control, any
defense or settlement of any Third Party Claim controlled by the Indemnifying
Party pursuant to this Section 13.7(d). An Indemnifying Party shall not,
without the written consent of the Indemnified Party, (i) settle any Third
Party Claim or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect thereto which
does not include an unconditional written release of the Indemnified Party
from all liability in respect of such Third Party Claim or (ii) settle any
Third Party Claim or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect thereto
in any manner that may materially and adversely affect the Indemnified Party
(other than as a result of money damages covered by the indemnity).

  

  

(e) If the Indemnifying Party does not admit its liability or admits its
liability to defend the Indemnified Party against a Third Party Claim, but
fails to diligently prosecute, indemnify against or settle the Third Party
Claim, then the Indemnified Party shall have the right to defend against the
Third Party Claim at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party, with
counsel of the Indemnified Party's choosing, subject to the right of the
Indemnifying Party to admit its liability and assume the defense of the Third
Party Claim at any time prior to settlement or final determination thereof. If
the Indemnifying Party has not yet admitted its liability to defend the
Indemnified Party against a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall
send written notice to the Indemnifying Party of any proposed settlement and
the Indemnifying Party shall have the option for ten (10) days following
receipt of such notice to (i) admit in writing its liability to indemnify the
Indemnified Party from and against the liability and consent to such
settlement and (ii) if liability is so admitted, reject, in its reasonable
judgment, the proposed settlement, or (iii) deny liability. Any failure to
respond such notice by the Indemnified Party shall be deemed to be an election
under subsection (i) above.

  

  

(f) In the case of a claim for indemnification not based upon a Third Party
Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall have thirty (30) days from its receipt of
the Claim Notice to (i) cure the Liabilities complained of, (ii) admit its
liability for such Liability or (iii) dispute the claim for such Liabilities.
If the Indemnifying Party does not notify the Indemnified Party within such
thirty (30) day period that it has cured the Liabilities or that it disputes
the claim for such Liabilities, the amount of such Liabilities shall
conclusively be deemed a liability of the Indemnifying Party hereunder.

  

  

(g) An Indemnified Party shall use reasonable commercial efforts to pursue,
and to cause its Affiliates to pursue, all insurance claims to which it may be
entitled in connection with any Liabilities for which a claim for
indemnification is made, and the Parties shall cooperate with each other in
pursuing insurance claims with respect to any such Liabilities or any
indemnification obligations from Third Parties with respect to any such
Liabilities. The Indemnifying Party is authorized by the Indemnified Party to
give direction to the insurer under any insurance policy with respect to the
defense of any action, suit, proceeding or claim relating to any liability
giving rise to a claim for indemnification. If the Indemnifying Party makes
any payment on any Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall be
subrogated, to the extent of such payment, to all rights and remedies of the
Indemnified Party to any insurance benefits or other claims of the Indemnified
Party with respect to such Third Party Claim. The Parties acknowledge and
agree that (i) the obligations of the Indemnified Party set forth in this
Section 13.7(g) with respect to any Liabilities for which a claim for
indemnification has been made shall be contingent on the Indemnified Party
receiving a written statement from the Indemnifying Party whereby the
Indemnifying Party admits its liability for such Liability and (ii) neither
Party shall be required to maintain any particular insurance coverage
following the Closing.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

39  

  

 

 

 

  

  

13.8 Survival.

  

  

(a) The representations and warranties of the Parties in Article IV and
Article V (other than the representations and warranties in Sections 4.1, 4.2,
4.16, 5.1, 5.2, 5.9, 5.10 and 5.11), and the covenants and agreements of the
Parties in Sections 6.1 and 9.4, shall survive Closing for a period of twelve
(12) months. The representation and warranty of Seller in Section 11.1(b)
shall terminate as of the expiration of the Survival Period. Subject to the
foregoing and Section 13.8(b), the remainder of this Agreement (including
Sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.6, 4.16, 5.1, 5.2, 5.9, 5.10 and 5.11) shall survive
Closing without time limit. Representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements shall be of no further force and effect after the date of their
expiration, provided that there shall be no termination of any bona fide claim
asserted pursuant to this Agreement with respect to such a representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement prior to its expiration date.

  

  

(b) The indemnities in Section 13.2(a), Section 13.2(b), Section 13.3(a) and
Section 13.3(b) shall terminate as of the expiration date of each respective
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement that is subject to
indemnification, except in each case as to matters for which a specific
written claim for indemnity has been delivered to the Indemnifying Party on or
before such expiration date. Seller's indemnity in Section 13.2(c) shall
survive without time limit and Seller's indemnities in Section 13.2(d),
Section 13.2(e) and Section 13.2(f) shall survive the Closing for a period of
two (2) years. Buyer's indemnities in Section 6.6, Section 10.1(c) and in
Section 13.3(c) shall survive Closing without time limit and shall be deemed
covenants running with the Assets (provided that Buyer and its successors and
assigns shall not be released from any of, and shall remain jointly and
severally liable to the Seller Indemnified Parties for, the obligations and
Liabilities of Buyer under such Sections of this Agreement upon any transfer
or assignment of any Asset).

  

  

13.9 Waiver of Right to Rescission. Seller and Buyer acknowledge that,
following Closing, the payment of money, as limited by the terms of this
Agreement, shall be adequate compensation for breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement contained herein or for any other claim
arising in connection with or with respect to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. As the payment of money shall be adequate compensation,
following Closing, Buyer and Seller waive any right to rescind this Agreement
or any of the transactions contemplated hereby.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

40  

  

 

 

 

  

  

13.10 Insurance, Taxes. The amount of any Liabilities for which any of the
Indemnified Parties is entitled to indemnification under this Agreement or in
connection with or with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall be reduced by any corresponding (a) Tax benefit created or
generated by the incurrence of the Liability or (b) insurance proceeds, from
insurance policies carried by a party realized, or that could reasonably be
expected to be realized by such Party if a claim were properly pursued under
the relevant insurance arrangements.

  

  

13.11 Non-Compensatory Damages. None of the Buyer Indemnified Parties nor
Seller Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to recover from Seller or Buyer,
or their respective Affiliates, any special, indirect, consequential,
punitive, exemplary, remote or speculative damages, including damages for lost
profits of any kind arising under or in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, except to the extent any such Party suffers
such damages to a Third Party, which damages (including costs of defense and
reasonable attorneys' fees incurred in connection with defending against such
damages) shall not be excluded by this provision as to recovery hereunder.
Subject to the preceding sentence, Buyer, on behalf of each of the Buyer
Indemnified Parties, and Seller, on behalf of each of Seller Indemnified
Parties, waive any right to recover any special, indirect, consequential,
punitive, exemplary, remote or speculative damages, including damages for lost
profits of any kind, arising in connection with or with respect to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

  

  

13.12 Cooperation by Buyer - Retained Litigation. Buyer agrees to use
reasonable efforts to cooperate with Seller in connection with Seller's
defense and other actions relating to or arising out of the litigation and
claims set forth in Schedule 13.1. Buyer agrees to make available Buyer's
employees engaged in the operation of the Assets for the purposes of providing
testimony, depositions, information and other related activities relating to
such litigation and claims.

  

  

13.13 Disclaimer of Application of Anti-Indemnity Statutes. The Parties
acknowledge and agree that the provisions of any anti-indemnity statute
relating to oilfield services and associated activities shall not be
applicable to this Agreement and/or the transactions contemplated hereby.

  

  

ARTICLE XIV

  

  

TERMINATION, DEFAULT AND REMEDIES

  

  

14.1 Right of Termination. This Agreement and the transactions contemplated
herein may be terminated at any time prior to Closing:

  

  

(a) by Seller, at Seller's option, if any of the conditions set forth in
Article VIII have not been satisfied on or before the Closing Date and, with
the exception of the condition set forth in Section 8.1 to the extent the
failure to satisfy such condition relates to the representations and
warranties of Buyer set forth in Sections 5.5 and 5.7 and, with the exception
of the condition set forth in Section 8.2 to the extent the failure to satisfy
such condition relates to the covenants of Buyer set forth in Sections 3.1,

this Agreement), such condition remains unsatisfied for a period of five (5)
Business Days after Buyer's receipt of written notice thereof from Seller;

condition is unsatisfied (including any breach by Seller of this Agreement),
such condition remains unsatisfied for a period of ten (10) Business Days

14.2 Effect of Termination; Remedies.

  

  

(a) If the obligation to close the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
is terminated pursuant to any provision of Section 14.1 hereof, then, except
as provided in this Section 14.2 and except for the provisions of Sections
1.1, 10.1(c) through (f), 10.2, 10.3, 13.11, this Section 14.2, Section 14.3
and Article XV (other than Sections 15.2(b), 15.7 and 15.8) and such of the
defined terms set forth on Annex 1 to give context to such sections, this
Agreement shall forthwith become void and the Parties shall have no liability
or obligation hereunder except and to the extent such termination results from
the Willful Breach by a Party of any of its covenants or agreements hereunder
in which case the other Party shall have the right to seek all remedies
available at Law or in equity, including specific performance, for such
Willful Breach; provided that if Seller is entitled to retain the Deposit as
liquidated damages pursuant to Section 14.2(b), then such retention shall
constitute full and complete satisfaction of any and all damages Seller may
have against Buyer.

  

  

(b) If (i) Seller has the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 14.1(a) because of (A) the failure of Buyer to materially perform any
of its obligations hereunder, or (B) the failure of any of Buyer's
representations and warranties hereunder to be true and correct in all
respects as of the date of this Agreement and Closing, and (ii) all conditions
precedent to the obligations of Buyer set forth in Article VII (other than
those actions or deliveries to occur at Closing) have been met or waived by
Buyer, then, in such event, Seller, as Seller's sole remedy for Buyer's breach
of this Agreement or failure or refusal to close or perform any of its
obligations hereunder, may terminate this Agreement and retain the Deposit as
liquidated damages as its sole remedy, and in such case Seller expressly
waives any and all other remedies, legal or equitable, that it otherwise may
have had for Buyer's breach of this Agreement or failure or refusal to close
and Buyer shall have no further liability or obligation hereunder.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

42  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) If Closing does not occur for any reason other than as set forth in
Section 14.2(b), then Buyer shall be entitled to the delivery of the Deposit
upon demand, free of any claims by Seller with respect thereto.

  

  

14.3 Return of Documentation and Confidentiality. Upon termination of this
Agreement, Buyer shall return to Seller all title, engineering, geological and
geophysical data, environmental assessments and/or reports, maps and other
information furnished by Seller to Buyer or prepared by or on behalf of Buyer
in connection with its due diligence investigation of the Assets, in each case
in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement and an officer of Buyer shall
certify same to Seller in writing.

NEGOTIATIONS AND DISCUSSIONS, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OF THE PARTIES
PERTAINING TO THE SUBJECT MATTER HEREOF. THERE ARE NO WARRANTIES,
REPRESENTATIONS OR OTHER AGREEMENTS AMONG THE PARTIES RELATING TO THE SUBJECT
MATTER HEREOF EXCEPT AS SPECIFICALLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND NEITHER
SELLER NOR BUYER SHALL BE BOUND BY OR LIABLE FOR ANY ALLEGED REPRESENTATION,
PROMISE, INDUCEMENT OR STATEMENTS OF INTENTION NOT SO SET FORTH. IN THE EVENT
OF A CONFLICT BETWEEN THE TERMS AND PROVISIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT AND THE TERMS
AND PROVISIONS OF ANY SCHEDULE OR EXHIBIT HERETO, THE TERMS AND PROVISIONS OF
THIS AGREEMENT SHALL GOVERN AND CONTROL; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT THE INCLUSION
IN ANY OF THE SCHEDULES AND EXHIBITS HERETO OF TERMS AND PROVISIONS NOT
ADDRESSED IN THIS AGREEMENT SHALL NOT BE DEEMED A CONFLICT, AND ALL SUCH

15.10 Parties in Interest. The terms and provisions of this Agreement shall be
binding upon and inure to the benefit of Seller and Buyer and their respective
successors and permitted assigns. Notwithstanding anything contained in this
Agreement to the contrary, nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, is
intended to confer on any Person other than the Parties or their successors
and permitted assigns, or the Parties' respective related Indemnified Parties
hereunder any rights, remedies, obligations or liabilities under or by reason
of this Agreement; provided that only a Party and its respective successors
and assigns will have the right to enforce the provisions of this Agreement on
its own behalf or on behalf of any of its related Indemnified Parties (but
shall not be obligated to do so).

  

  

15.11 Amendment. This Agreement may be amended only by an instrument in
writing executed by the Parties hereto against whom enforcement is sought.

  

  

15.12 Waiver; Rights Cumulative. Any of the terms, covenants, representations,
warranties or conditions hereof may be waived only by a written instrument
executed by or on behalf of the Party waiving compliance. No course of dealing
on the part of Seller or Buyer or their respective officers, employees,
agents, or representatives and no failure by Seller or Buyer to exercise any
of its rights under this Agreement shall, in each case, operate as a waiver
thereof or affect in any way the right of such Party at a later time to
enforce the performance of such provision. No waiver by any Party of any
condition, or any breach of any term, covenant, representation or warranty
contained in this Agreement, in any one or more instances, shall be deemed to
be or construed as a further or continuing waiver of any such condition or
breach or a waiver of any other condition or of any breach of any other term,
covenant, representation or warranty. The rights of Seller and Buyer under
this Agreement shall be cumulative and the exercise or partial exercise of any
such right shall not preclude the exercise of any other right.

  

  

15.13 Governing Law; Jurisdiction.

  

  

(a) Except to the extent that the Laws of the State of Oklahoma and/or
Arkansas, as applicable, are mandatorily applicable to the Assignment in
connection with the conveyances of property interests involving real property
located in the State of Oklahoma or Arkansas, as applicable, this Agreement
and any claim, controversy or dispute arising under or related to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or the rights, duties and
relationship of the parties hereto and thereto, shall be governed by and
construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of Texas,
excluding any conflicts of law, rule or principle that might refer
construction of provisions to the Laws of another jurisdiction.

  

  

(b) The Parties agree that the appropriate, exclusive and convenient forum for
any disputes between any of the Parties hereto arising out of this Agreement,
the Transaction Documents or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be in
any state or federal court in Denver, Colorado and each of the Parties hereto
irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction of such courts solely in respect of
any proceeding arising out of or related to this Agreement. The Parties
further agree that the Parties shall not bring suit with respect to any
disputes arising out of this Agreement, the Transaction Documents or the
transactions contemplated hereby in any court or jurisdiction other than the
above specified courts. The Parties further agree, to the extent permitted by
Law, that a final and nonappealable judgment against a Party in any action or
proceeding contemplated above shall be conclusive and may be enforced in any
other jurisdiction within or outside the United States by suit on the
judgment, a certified or exemplified copy of which shall be conclusive
evidence of the fact and amount of such judgment.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

47  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) To the extent that any Party hereto or any of its Affiliates has or
hereafter may acquire any immunity from jurisdiction of any court or from any
legal process (whether through service or notice, attachment prior to
judgment, attachment in aid of execution, execution or otherwise) with respect
to itself or its property, such Party (on its own behalf and on behalf of its
Affiliates) hereby irrevocably (i) waives such immunity in respect of its
obligations with respect to this Agreement and (ii) submits to the personal
jurisdiction of any court described in Section 15.13(b).

  

  

(d) THE PARTIES HERETO AGREE THAT THEY HEREBY KNOWINGLY, VOLUNTARILY AND
INTENTIONALLY IRREVOCABLY WAIVE THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION BASED
HEREON, OR ARISING OUT OF, UNDER, OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, THE
TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY.

  

  

15.14 Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or public
policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any
adverse manner to any Party. Upon such determination that any term or other
provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the Parties
shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the
original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner
to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the
extent possible.

  

  

15.15 Removal of Name. As promptly as practicable, but in any case within
thirty (30) days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall eliminate the names
"Antero Resources", "Antero" and any variants thereof from the Assets and,
except with respect to such grace period for eliminating existing usage, shall
have no right to use any logos, trademarks or trade names belonging to Seller
or any of its Affiliates.

  

  

15.16 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts, and each such counterpart hereof shall be deemed to be an
original instrument, but all of such counterparts shall constitute for all
purposes one agreement. Any signature hereto delivered by a Party by facsimile
