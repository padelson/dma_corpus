 (a) Each Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any Shares described in Sections 2.7(b) and (c) and any Dissenting Shares) shall be converted into the right to receive the Closing Date Per Share Merger Consideration, in cash, without interest, together with any Merger Consideration which may be payable in respect of such Share pursuant to the Escrow Agreement, Section 2.9(h)(i) and Article VIII of this Agreement upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein and therein;

If payment in respect of any Certificate is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name such Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition of payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer, that the signatures on such Certificate or any related stock power shall be properly guaranteed and that the Person requesting such payment shall have established to the reasonable satisfaction of the Acquiror that any transfer and other Taxes required by reason of such payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate have been paid or are not applicable. Until surrendered in accordance with the provisions of this Section 2.9, any Certificate (other than Certificates representing Shares described in Sections 2.7(b) and (c) and any Dissenting Shares) shall be deemed, at any time after the Effective Time, to represent only the right to receive the portion of the Merger Consideration payable with respect thereto, in cash, without interest, as contemplated herein. At least five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Acquiror shall provide to the Company, and the Company shall provide to each holder of an option to acquire Shares and who may be entitled to receive the consideration described in Section 2.7(e), an Option Surrender Agreement. At or after the Closing, as promptly as practicable after delivery of an Option Surrender Agreement (and in any event on the Closing Date if such duly executed Option Surrender Agreement is delivered to the Acquiror at the Closing, and within two (2) Business Days of receipt of such Option Surrender Agreement delivered to the Acquiror at any time following the Closing), the holder of a cancelled option shall be entitled to receive the Option Payment. At the Closing, the Acquiror and the Company shall each pay one-half of the 

     ##### 

  

    

fees and expenses of any Payment Agent appointed by the Acquiror. Any portion
of the Closing Date Merger Consideration attributable to Dissenting Shares
shall be returned to the Acquiror by the Payment Agent within five (5)
Business Days after the holders of such Dissenting Shares shall have
perfected their appraisal rights pursuant to Section 262 of Delaware Law. 

   

 (d) At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and there shall be no further registration of transfers of any shares of capital stock thereafter on the records of the Company. If, after the Effective Time, a Certificate (other than representing Shares described in Sections 2.7(b) and (c)) is presented to the Surviving Corporation, it shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Section 2.9. 

   

 (e) All cash paid upon conversion of the Shares and options in accordance with the terms of this Article II and all cash deposited with the Escrow Agent and the Company pursuant to this Section 2.9 shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Shares and the options to acquire Shares. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates shall cease to have any rights with respect to Shares represented thereby, except as otherwise provided herein or by applicable Law. 

   

 (f) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the Surviving Corporation shall pay or cause to be paid in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the relevant portion of the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.9(c) for Shares represented thereby. 

   

 (g) Not less than three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company will provide to the Acquiror the following: (i) an itemized schedule (the " _Schedule of Expenses_ ") containing (x) a true and complete list of all Transaction Expenses that have been paid (or for which bills have been received) or shall have been paid as of the Closing Date and (y) an itemized good faith estimate of all such additional Transaction Expenses that have been incurred or shall have been incurred as of the Closing Date but are not reflected in clause (x) hereof; and (ii) an itemized schedule (the " _Net Working Capital Amount Schedule_ " and, collectively with the Schedule of Expenses, the " _Closing Schedules_ ") containing a good faith estimate of the Net Working Capital Amount as of the Effective Time (the " _Estimated Net Working Capital Amount_ ") and prepared in the format of the example set forth on _Exhibit E_. Prior to Closing, the Acquiror and the Company shall discuss the estimates set forth in the Closing Schedules and make revisions to such estimates as they mutually agree. Following any such revisions, the final Closing Schedules will be delivered together with a certificate of an authorized officer of the Company certifying the accuracy and completeness of the Closing Schedules. The Schedule of Expenses shall include all fees and expenses of all legal counsel, auditors, financial advisors and other professional advisors for services rendered in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement on or prior to the Closing Date. On or before the Closing Date, the Company shall have paid each Transaction Expense set forth in the Schedule of Expenses, other than the fees and expenses set forth therein that are estimated for services to be performed after the Closing Date or for services performed prior to the Closing Date for which the Company has not yet been billed, which fees and expenses shall be paid by the Surviving Corporation as they are later incurred or billed; _provided_ that the Acquiror shall be 

    ##### 

  

    

indemnified for any such fees and expenses in excess of the amount estimated
therefor in the Schedule of Expenses as provided in Section 8.2(c). 

   

 (h) Within ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, the Acquiror shall prepare and deliver to the Stockholder Representatives a calculation of the Net Working Capital Amount as of the Effective Time (the " _Final Net Working Capital Amount_ ") prepared in accordance with GAAP and on a basis consistent with the Audited Financial Statements and the Net Working Capital Amount Schedule (to the extent prepared in accordance with GAAP) along with reasonable detail and documentation supporting such calculation. 

   

 (i) If, within thirty (30) days following delivery of the Final Net Working Capital Amount, the Stockholder Representatives have not provided the Acquiror with written notice of objection as to the Final Net Working Capital Amount (that shall state the basis of the Stockholder Representatives objection), then the Final Net Working Capital Amount shall be binding and conclusive on the Acquiror, the Stockholder Representatives and the stockholders of the Company. If the Estimated Net Working Capital Amount exceeds the Final Net Working Capital Amount, as finally determined pursuant to this Section 2.9(h) (including, without limitation, the resolution of any notice of objection as set forth in (ii) below), the amount of such excess shall be disbursed to the Acquiror from the Escrow Fund pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement within five (5) Business Days of such final determination. Alternatively, if the Final Net Working Capital Amount, as finally determined pursuant to this Section 2.9(h) (including, without limitation, the resolution of any notice of objection as set forth in (ii) below), exceeds the Estimated Net Working Capital Amount, the Acquiror shall deposit the amount of such excess with the Payment Agent for the benefit of the stockholders and optionholders of the Company within five (5) Business Days of such final determination for prompt distribution to such stockholders and optionholders. 

  

 (ii) If the Stockholder Representatives deliver to the Acquiror a notice of objection to the Final Net Working Capital Amount within thirty (30) days of receipt, and if the Acquiror and the Stockholder Representatives fail to resolve the issues outstanding with respect to the Final Net Working Capital Amount within fifteen (15) days (or such longer period as the Stockholder Representatives and the Acquiror may agree) of delivery of the Stockholder Representatives objection notice, the Stockholder Representatives and the Acquiror shall submit, within thirty (30) days of the delivery of the Stockholder Representatives objection notice (or within fifteen (15) days of the expiration of any longer period as to which the Stockholder Representatives and the Acquiror may agree, as contemplated above), the Final Net Working Capital Amount to a nationally recognized firm of independent certified public accountants with a nationwide audit and accounting practice as Acquiror and the Stockholder Representatives may agree in writing (the " _Independent Accountants_ "), so that such Independent Accountants can determine the Final Net Working Capital Amount in accordance with GAAP and on a basis consistent with the Audited Financial Statements and the Net Working Capital Amount Schedule (to the extent prepared in accordance with GAAP). 

  

 (iii) If the Final Net Working Capital Amount is submitted to the Independent Accountants, (A) the Stockholder Representatives and the Acquiror shall furnish or cause to be furnished to the Independent Accountants such work papers and other documents and information as the Independent Accountants may reasonably request and are available to that 

   ##### 

  

 

party or its agents and shall be afforded the opportunity to present to the
Independent Accountants any material relating to the Final Net Working
Capital Amount and to discuss the Final Net Working Capital Amount with the
Independent Accountants; (B) the determination of the Final Net Working
Capital Amount by the Independent Accountants, as set forth in a notice to be
delivered to both the Stockholder Representatives and the Acquiror within
thirty (30) days of the submission of the Final Net Working Capital Amount to
the Independent Accountants, shall be final, binding and conclusive on the
parties; and (C) the Acquiror, on the one hand, and the stockholders
and optionholders of the Company, on the other hand, will each bear one-half
of the fees and costs of the Independent Accountants for such
determination. 

   

 (i) Following the date that is six (6) months after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates or options to acquire Shares shall be entitled to look to the Acquiror only as a general creditor thereof with respect to any portion of the Merger Consideration payable upon due surrender of their Certificates or options, without interest. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 2.9, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, neither the Acquiror nor the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any holder of a Certificate or option for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. 

   

 Section 2.10 _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Acquiror and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any provision of applicable Tax Law. To the extent that such amounts are so withheld or paid over to or deposited with the relevant Governmental Authority by the Acquiror or the Surviving Corporation, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the applicable Person in respect to which such deduction and withholding was made. 

  

 Section 2.11 _Stockholder Representatives_. 

  

 (a) The parties hereto agree that it is desirable to designate TA Associates Management, L.P. and Lance Dunn as the representatives of the Companys stockholders and optionholders and their attorneys in fact (each a " _Stockholder Representative_ " and collectively, the " _Stockholder Representatives_ "), with full power of substitution to act on behalf of the Companys stockholders and optionholders (only with respect to their interests as stockholders and optionholders under this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement) to the extent and in the manner set forth in this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement but not with respect to any amendments to this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement. The Company has designated the Stockholder Representatives as the representatives of the Companys stockholders and optionholders for purposes of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, and approval of this Agreement and the Merger by such holders shall constitute ratification and approval of such designation on the terms set forth herein. All decisions, actions, consents and instructions by the Stockholder Representatives with respect to this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement (but not with respect to any amendments hereto or thereto) shall be binding upon all of the stockholders and optionholders of the Company with respect to their interests as stockholders and optionholders under this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, and no such stockholder shall have the right to object to, dissent from, protest or otherwise contest the same. The Stockholder 

     ##### 

  

    

Representatives shall act in unanimity with respect to any decision, action,
consent or instruction contemplated by this Agreement and in all

such decision, act, consent or instruction. By way of amplification and not
limitation, as Stockholder Representatives, the Stockholder
Representatives shall be authorized and empowered, as agents of and on behalf
of all stockholders and optionholders of the Company (only with respect to
their interests as stockholders and optionholders) to give and receive

Indemnification Claims, to agree to, negotiate, enter into settlements and
compromises of, and demand arbitration and comply with orders of courts and

the Effective Time any breach or default of the Acquiror or Sub of any
obligation to be performed by it under this Agreement, to receive service of
process on behalf of each stockholder and optionholder of the Company in
connection with any claims against such stockholder or optionholder arising
under or in connection with this Agreement, any document or
instrument provided for hereby (other than Employment Agreements, Non-
Competition Agreements and Non-Solicitation Agreements) or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby or under any Ancillary Agreement, and to
take all other actions that are either (i) necessary or appropriate in
the judgment of the Stockholder Representatives for the accomplishment of the
foregoing or (ii) specifically mandated by the terms of this Agreement.

Company.

Each Stockholder Representative may charge a reasonable fee, not to exceed $50,000 per Stockholder Representative per year, for his or its services subject to the approval of the other Stockholder Representative; _provided_ that all fees and expenses incurred by the Stockholder Representatives in performing his or its duties hereunder (including legal fees and expenses related thereto) and any indemnification in favor of the Stockholder Representatives shall be borne by the stockholders and optionholders of the Company (other than holders of Dissenting Shares) _pro rata_ in accordance with the portion of the Merger Consideration each such stockholder or optionholder would otherwise have been entitled to receive under Section 2.9(c), by virtue of the 

    ##### 

  

    

ownership of outstanding Shares or options immediately prior to the Effective
Time (each such stockholders and optionholders pro rata interest, a " _Pro
Rata Share_ ") in the manner provided in the Escrow Agreement. 

   

 (c) In dealing with this Agreement and any notice, instrument, agreement or document relating thereto, and in exercising or failing to exercise all or any of the powers conferred upon the Stockholder Representatives hereunder or thereunder, (i) the Stockholder Representatives and his or its agents, counsel, accountants and other representatives shall not assume any, and shall not incur any, responsibility whatsoever (in each case, to the extent permitted by applicable Law) to any stockholder or optionholder of the Company, the Acquiror, the Company, Sub or the Surviving Corporation, including, without limitation, by reason of any error in judgment or other act or omission performed or omitted hereunder or in connection with this Agreement or any such other agreement, instrument or document, except to the extent such actions shall have been determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to have constituted willful misconduct or fraud, and (ii) the Stockholder Representatives shall be entitled to rely in good faith on the advice of counsel, public accountants or other independent experts experienced in the matter at issue, and any error in judgment or other act or omission of the Stockholder Representatives pursuant to such advice shall in no event subject the Stockholder Representatives to liability to any stockholder of the Company, the Acquiror, the Company, Sub or the Surviving Corporation. Except in cases where a court of competent jurisdiction has made such a finding, the stockholders and optionholders of the Company shall on a pro rata basis (based on each such stockholders and optionholders Pro Rata Share) indemnify and hold harmless the Stockholder Representatives from and against any and all losses, liabilities, claims, actions, damages and expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees and disbursements, arising out of and in connection with his or its activities as the Stockholder Representatives under this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or otherwise.

 (c) None of the Plans is a multiemployer plan within the meaning of Section 3(37) or 4001(a)(3) of ERISA (a " _Multiemployer Plan_ ") or a single employer pension plan within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(15) of ERISA for which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries could incur liability under Section 4063 or 4064 of ERISA (a " _Multiple Employer Plan_ ").

No Action is pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened with respect to any Plan, other than claims for benefits in the ordinary course, and no fact or event exists that would give rise to any such Action. Each Plan which is intended to be qualified within the meaning of Code Section 401(a) has received a favorable determination letter or opinion letter as to its qualification, such Plan qualifies and has qualified under Section

material cost.

 (i) The Company and its ERISA Affiliates do not maintain any Plan which is a "group health plan," as such term is defined in Section 5000(b)(1) of the Code, that has not been administered and operated in all material respects in compliance with the applicable requirements of Section 601 of ERISA, Section 4980B(b) of the Code and the applicable provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1986. 

   

 (j) None of the employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries resides or performs services outside the United States. 

   

 (k) Except as provided on Schedule 3.10(k) of the Disclosure Schedules, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has or would reasonably be expected to incur any liability with respect to post-employment or post-retirement health, medical or life insurance or benefits, except as required to avoid an excise tax under Code Section 4980B and except as otherwise may be required by applicable Law. 

   

 (l) Except as provided in Sections 2.7(e), neither the execution of this Agreement nor the Merger (whether alone or in connection with any other event(s)) will: 

        ##### 

  

     

 (i) result in severance pay or any increase in severance pay upon any termination of service; or 

  

 (ii) accelerate the time of payment or vesting under, result in any payment or funding (through a grantor trust or otherwise) of compensation or benefits under, or increase any amount payable under any Plan. 

  

 (m) Neither the execution of this Agreement nor the Merger (whether alone or in connection with other events), will result in any payment under any Plan that would not be deductible under Section 280G of the Code. 

   

 (n) Each Plan that constitutes in any part a nonqualified deferred compensation plan within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code has been operated and maintained in operational and documentary compliance with Section 409A of the Code and applicable guidance thereunder. No payment to be made under any Company Employee Program is, or to the knowledge of the Company, will be, subject to the penalties of Section 409A(a)(1) of the Code. 

   

 (o) Except as set forth in Schedule 3.10(o) of the Disclosure Schedules, no fees or charges payable by the Company or any Subsidiary would result from terminating any investment contract related to any Plan that is intended to be a cash or deferred arrangement under Code Section 401(k) other than routine administrative expenses.

 (a) The certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification than are set forth in the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Company, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that would affect adversely the rights thereunder of individuals who, prior to the Effective Time, were directors, officers, employees, fiduciaries or agents of the Company, with respect to acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time, unless such modification shall be required by applicable Law. The certificate of incorporation or other organizational documents of each Subsidiary of the Company shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that would affect adversely the rights thereunder of individuals who, prior to the Effective Time, were directors, officers, employees, fiduciaries or agents of such Subsidiary, with respect to acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time, unless such modification shall be required by applicable Law. 

  

 (b) Prior to the Effective Time, after consultation with the Acquiror, the Company shall obtain directors and officers liability insurance coverage with an extended reporting period endorsement for the Companys and each of its Subsidiarys directors and officers, the form of which shall be delivered by the Company to the Acquiror prior to becoming effective, which shall provide such directors and officers with coverage for six years following the Effective Time in such amount and on such terms as is customary and reasonable for similarly situated companies. The cost of such coverage shall be treated as a Transaction Expense hereunder. The Acquiror shall cause the Surviving Corporation and each of its Subsidiaries to refrain from taking any act that would cause such coverage to cease to remain in full force and effect. 

  

 (c) In the event the Acquiror or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries, successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, to the extent necessary, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the Acquiror, the Surviving Corporation, or any of their respective Subsidiaries assume the obligations set forth in this Section 5.8. 

  

 Section 5.9 _Employment Benefits_.

   ##### 

  

 

Subsidiaries benefit plans, programs or policies; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that nothing herein shall preclude the Acquiror or the Surviving Corporation
from amending or terminating any such benefit after the Effective Time.
Nothing contained in this Agreement, whether express or implied, shall be
treated as an amendment or other modification of any compensation or
benefit plan. This Section shall inure exclusively to the benefit of, be
binding solely upon and be enforceable solely by, the Company, the Acquiror,
the Stockholder Representatives, and each of their respective successors,
permitted assigns, executors and legal representatives, and shall not inure
to the benefit of, be binding upon or be enforceable by any other party to
this Agreement or any other person. Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or
implied, shall be construed to create any third-party beneficiary rights in

alternate payees, dependents or beneficiaries, whether in respect of continued
employment or resumed employment, compensation, employee benefits or
otherwise. 

   

 Section 5.10 _Integration Matters_.

 Section 5.12 _Conflicts and Privilege_. It is acknowledged by each of the parties hereto that the Stockholder Representatives may retain existing special counsel to the Company (" _Counsel_ ") to act as its counsel in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby. The Acquiror and Sub hereby agree that, in the event that a dispute arises after the Closing between the Acquiror and Sub and the Stockholder Representatives, Counsel may represent the Stockholder Representatives in such dispute even though the interests of the Stockholder Representatives may be directly adverse to the Acquiror, Sub, the Company or its Subsidiaries, and even though Counsel may have represented the Company or its Subsidiaries in a matter substantially related to such dispute, or may be handling ongoing matters for the Acquiror, Sub, the Company or its Subsidiaries. Acquiror and Sub further agree that, as to all communications among Counsel, the Company, its Subsidiaries and the Stockholder Representatives that relate in any way to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the attorney or solicitor-client privilege and the expectation of client confidence belongs to the Stockholder Representatives and may be controlled by the Stockholder Representatives and shall not pass to or be claimed by the 

   ##### 

  

 

Acquiror, Sub, the Company or its Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
in the event that a dispute arises between the Acquiror, Sub, the Company or
its Subsidiaries and a third party other than a party to this Agreement after
the Closing, the Company and its Subsidiaries may assert the attorney or

neither the Company nor its Subsidiaries may waive such privilege without the
prior written consent of the Stockholder Representatives.

 Section 5.14 _Access to Information_. From and after the date hereof, except as otherwise required by Law, the Acquiror and its Representatives shall have full access, upon reasonable notice and during normal business hours, to the Company and its Subsidiaries and their Representatives with knowledge of their businesses and to all of their books, records, properties, Contracts and commitments as the Acquiror may reasonably request, _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the Company and its Subsidiaries may, in their sole discretion, limit the Acquirors and its Representatives access to any Competitively Sensitive Information.

 Section 6.2 _Straddle Period_. In the case of any taxable period that includes (but does not end on) the Closing Date (a " _Straddle Period_ "), the amount of any Taxes based on or measured by income or receipts of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for the pre-Closing tax period shall be determined based on an interim closing of the books as of the close of business on the Closing Date and the amount of other Taxes of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for a Straddle Period that relates to the pre-Closing Tax period shall be deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for the entire taxable period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days in the taxable period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of days in such Straddle Period (the " _Pre-Closing Straddle Amount_ "). 

  

 Section 6.3 _Preparation and Filing of Tax Returns_. Acquiror shall timely prepare and file, or shall cause to be prepared and filed, all Tax Returns of the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to any taxable year or period that ends on or before the Closing Date and any taxable year or period beginning before and ending after the Closing Date that are due after the Closing Date (" _Pre-Closing Tax Returns_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that Acquiror shall, or shall cause the Company to (a) file a U.S. federal income Tax Return of the Company for the Companys taxable year ending on the Closing Date pursuant to Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-76(c); (b) allocate all items accruing on the Closing Date to the Companys taxable period ending on the Closing Date pursuant to Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(A)(1) (and not pursuant to the "next day" rule under Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B) or pursuant to the ratable allocation method under Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-76(b)(2)(ii) or 1.1502-76(b)(2)(iii)); (c) not elect to waive any carryback of net operating losses under Section 172(b)(3) of the Code on any Tax Return of the Company filed in respect of a taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date; and (d) deduct the Transaction Expenses (to the extent properly deductible) on the Companys income Tax Returns for the taxable period ending on the Closing Date, unless otherwise required by applicable Tax law.

otherwise required by clause (a) through (d) above or otherwise pursuant to
this Agreement) and shall provide the Stockholder Representatives the right
to review and comment on such Tax Returns no later than thirty (30)
days prior to the due date for filing such Tax Returns. Acquiror shall make
all such changes as are reasonably requested by the Stockholder
Representatives, except to the extent inconsistent with applicable Tax law.
Acquiror shall cause any amounts shown to be due on such Tax Returns to
be timely remitted to the applicable governmental body before such Taxes are
due. 

   

 Section 6.4 _Refunds and Tax Benefits_. Any Tax refunds or credits for overpayment that are received by the Acquiror or the Company and its Subsidiaries in excess of the amounts accrued for such Tax refunds or credits in the Final Net Working Capital Amount to which the Acquiror or the Company and its Subsidiaries become entitled that relate to income Tax periods or portions thereof ending on or before the Closing Date shall be for the account of the stockholders and optionholders of the Company, and the Acquiror shall pay over to the stockholders and optionholders of the Company any such refund or the amount of any such credit within 15 days after receipt or entitlement thereto. If the amount accrued for such Taxes in the Final Net Working Capital Amount exceeds the actual unpaid liability of the Company due in respect of Pre-Closing Tax Returns (such excess the " _Reduced Tax Liability_ "), the amount of the Reduced Tax Liability shall be for the account of the stockholders and optionholders of the Company, and the Acquiror shall pay over to the stockholders and optionholders of the Company any such amount within 15 days after receipt or entitlement thereto. Upon a request from the Stockholder Representatives, Acquiror shall, as soon as is reasonably practicable, cause the Company or its Subsidiaries or affiliates to file an amended Tax return or application for Tax refund in order to obtain a Tax refund that the Company is entitled to pursuant to this Section 6.4, and Acquiror, the Company and their Subsidiaries or affiliates shall execute all other documents, take reasonable additional actions, not take any action the result of which would be to forego the right to any such Tax refund, and otherwise reasonably cooperate as may be necessary for the Acquiror, the Company and their Subsidiaries or affiliates to perfect their rights in and obtain the Tax refunds contemplated by this Section 6.4. 

  

 Section 6.5 _Amended Tax Returns_. None of the Acquiror, Sub, the Company or any of their affiliates shall amend any Tax Returns of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of the Company for any pre-Closing tax period without the prior written consent of the Stockholder Representatives acting together, which consent shall not be unreasonably conditioned, delayed or withheld. 

  

 Section 6.6 _Certain Taxes and Fees_. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other such Taxes, and all conveyance fees, recording charges and other similar transfer fees and charges (including any penalties and interest) incurred in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the stockholders and optionholders when due, and the stockholders and optionholders will, at their own expense, file all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to all such Taxes, fees and charges, and, if required by applicable Law, the Acquiror will, and will cause its Affiliates to, join in the execution of any such Tax Returns and other documentation.

ARTICLE VIII 
 INDEMNIFICATION 

   

 Section 8.1 _Survival_. Except for the representations and warranties set forth in Section 3.15, the representations and warranties of the Company, the Acquiror and Sub contained in this Agreement shall survive the Closing until June 30, 2012 (the " _Expiration Date_ "). The representations and warranties set forth in Section 3.15 and the indemnification obligations under Section 8.2(e) shall survive the Closing until three (3) years following the Closing Date (the " _Tax Matters Expiration Date_ "). All of the covenants in this Agreement shall survive in accordance with their respective terms. 

  

 No party shall have any liability whatsoever with respect to any such representations or warranties unless a claim is made hereunder prior to July 31, 2012, or the twentieth Business Day following the Tax Matters Expiration Date, as applicable, in which case such representation or warranty shall survive as to such claim until such claim has been finally resolved. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, none of the time limitations set forth in this Article VIII shall apply to any action for specific performance, injunctive relief or other equitable remedy. 

  

 Section 8.2 _Indemnification in Favor of the Acquiror_. Subject to the provisions of this Article VIII, prior to the Closing the Company, and after the Closing only the stockholders and optionholders of the Company, pro rata in proportion to their Pro Rata Share, shall save, defend, indemnify and hold harmless the Acquiror, Sub, the Surviving Corporation and their Affiliates, and the respective Representatives, successors and assigns of each of the foregoing (the " _Acquiror Indemnified Parties_ ") from and against any and all losses, damages, liabilities, deficiencies, claims, interest, awards, judgments, penalties, costs and expenses (including attorneys fees, costs and other out-of-pocket expenses incurred in investigating, preparing or defending the foregoing) (collectively, " _Losses_ "), except as provided below, any Losses with respect to Taxes shall be limited to the taxable periods or portions thereof ending on or before the Closing Date, asserted against, incurred, sustained or suffered by any of the foregoing as a result of, arising out of or relating to: 

  

 (a) any breach of any representation or warranty made by the Company contained in this Agreement or any certificate or schedule delivered pursuant hereto; 

  

 (b) any breach of any covenant or agreement by the Company contained in this Agreement or any certificate or schedule delivered pursuant hereto; 

  

 (c) any Transaction Expenses charged to the Acquiror, Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Company that shall not have been, or shall exceed the amount, reflected on the Schedule of Expenses; 

  

 (d) any amount by which the Estimated Net Working Capital Amount exceeds the Final Net Working Capital Amount; 

  

 (e) (i) all Taxes (or the non-payment thereof) of the Company and its Subsidiaries for all taxable periods ending on or before the Closing Date and the portion through the end of the Closing Date for any taxable period that includes (but does not end on) the Closing 

   ##### 

  

 

Date (" _Pre-Closing Tax Period_ "), (ii) any and all Taxes of any member of
an affiliated, consolidated, combined, or unitary group of which the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries (or any predecessor of any of the foregoing) is or
was a member on or prior to the Closing Date, including pursuant to Treasury
Regulation §1.1502-6 or any analogous or similar state, local, or non-U.S.
law or regulation and (iii) any and all Taxes of any person (other than the
Company and its Subsidiaries) imposed on the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries as a transferee or successor, by contract or pursuant to any
law, rule or regulation, which Taxes relate to an event or
transaction occurring before the Closing; _provided, however_ , that in the
case of clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) above, the stockholders and optionholders
of the Company shall be liable only to the extent that such Taxes are in
excess of the amount, if any, reserved for such Taxes (excluding any
reserve for deferred Taxes established to reflect timing differences between
book and Tax income) on the face of the closing balance sheet (rather than in
any notes thereto) and taken into account in determining the Final Net
Working Capital Amount pursuant to Section 2.9(h); 

   

 (f) any payments made in respect of Dissenting Shares in excess of the amounts payable for such shares pursuant to this Agreement; and 

  

 (g) any Action by a stockholder or optionholder of the Company in respect of any breach of fiduciary duty or derivative or other similar claim in respect of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. 

  

 Section 8.3 _Indemnification by the Acquiror_. Subject to the provisions of this Article VIII, the Acquiror (and after the Closing jointly and severally with the Surviving Corporation) shall save, defend, indemnify and hold harmless the stockholders and optionholders of the Company and their Affiliates, and the respective Representatives, successors and assigns of each of the foregoing (the " _Company Indemnified Parties_ "), acting solely through the Stockholder Representatives, from and against any and all Losses asserted against, incurred, sustained or suffered by any of the foregoing as a result of, arising out of or relating to: 

  

 (a) any breach of any representation or warranty made by the Acquiror or Sub contained in this Agreement; and 

  

 (b) any breach of any covenant or agreement by the Acquiror or Sub contained in this Agreement. 

  

 Section 8.4 _Manner of Indemnification_. 

  

 (a) _Escrow Fund_. To provide a fund against which an Acquiror Indemnified Party may assert claims of indemnification under this Article VIII (an " _Acquiror Indemnification Claim_ "), the Escrow Amount shall be deposited into escrow pursuant to the Escrow Agreement in accordance with Section 2.9. The Escrow Fund shall be held and distributed in accordance with this Article VIII and the Escrow Agreement. Each Acquiror Indemnification Claim shall be made only in accordance with this Article VIII and the Escrow Agreement. An Acquiror Indemnified Party shall seek monetary recourse for Acquiror Indemnification Claims solely by offset against the Escrow Fund. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, none of the limitations set forth in this Article VIII shall apply to any action for specific performance, injunctive relief or other equitable remedy. Acquiror, Sub and the 

   ##### 

  

 

Company agree for all tax purposes: (i) the optionholders portion of the
Escrow Fund shall be treated as compensation paid by the Company to the
optionholders if and to the extent any portion of the optionholders portion
of the Escrow Fund is actually distributed to the optionholders, (ii) the
right of the stockholders to the stockholders portion of the Escrow Fund
shall be eligible to be treated as deferred contingent purchase price
eligible for installment sale treatment under Section 453 of the Code and any
corresponding provision of foreign, state or local law, as appropriate; (iii)
Acquiror shall be treated as the owner of the Escrow Fund solely for
tax purposes, and all interest and earnings earned from the investment and
reinvestment of the Escrow Amount, or any portion thereof, shall be allocable
to the Acquiror pursuant to Section 468B(g) of the Code and Proposed Treasury
Regulation Section 1.468B-8; (iv) if and to the extent any amount of the
stockholders portion of the Escrow Fund is actually distributed to the
stockholders, interest may be imputed on such amount, as required by Section
483 or 1274 of the Code; and (v) in no event shall the total amount of the
Escrow Fund paid to the stockholders and optionholders under this Agreement
exceed an amount to be designated by the Stockholder Representatives prior to
the Closing. Clause (v) of the preceding sentence is intended to ensure that
the right of the stockholders to the stockholders portion of the Escrow Fund
is not treated as a contingent payment without a stated maximum selling price
under Section 453 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated
thereunder. Acquiror, Sub and the Company shall file all Tax Returns
consistently with the foregoing. 

   

 (b) _Release From Escrow_. On July 31, 2012, the Escrow Agent shall, subject to the terms set forth in the Escrow Agreement, disburse any portion of the Escrow Fund which exceeds the sum of (i) $5,000,000 and (ii) any amounts on that date reserved against pending claims for indemnifiable Losses. The $5,000,000 required minimum balance in the Escrow Fund after the Expiration Date shall be solely to fund potential Losses from (x) breaches of the representations and warranties set forth in Section 3.15 and (y) indemnification obligations under Section 8.2(e) ((x) and (y) collectively, " _Tax Losses_ "), and shall be disbursed on the twentieth (20th) Business Day after the Tax Matters Expiration Date except to the extent such Escrow Funds are reserved against pending claims for indemnifiable Losses on such date. Such disbursement shall be made to the stockholders and optionholders of the Company (other than holders of any Dissenting Shares) as instructed by the Stockholder Representatives acting together. Payment of any amounts to the Companys stockholders and optionholders shall be made on a pro rata basis (based on each such stockholders and optionholders Pro Rata Share). Notwithstanding anything in this Section 8.4(b) to the contrary, any distribution contemplated in this Section 8.4(b) shall be subject to the stockholders and optionholders obligations to the Stockholder Representatives as set forth in the Escrow Agreement and Section 2.11 hereof. 

  

 (c) _Claims for Indemnification_. For the purposes hereof, an " _Officer s Certificate_" shall mean a certificate signed by an officer of Acquiror and delivered to the Escrow Agent and the Stockholder Representatives: (i) stating that the Acquiror has paid, incurred, sustained or accrued Losses, (ii) specifying in reasonable detail the individual items of Loss included in the amount so stated, the date insofar as practicable each such item was paid, incurred or sustained, and the nature of the misrepresentation, breach of warranty or covenant to which such item is related or the indemnification obligation to which such Losses are related, and (iii) the amount of cash sought to be delivered to the Acquiror (for the benefit of the pertinent Acquiror Indemnified Party) in compensation for such Losses. Upon receipt by the Escrow Agent of an Officers Certificate at any time on or before July 31, 2010, or, in the case of 

   ##### 

  

 

Tax Losses, at any time on or before the twentieth (20th) Business Day after
the Tax Matters Expiration Date, as applicable, the Escrow Agent shall,
subject to the provisions of Section 8.4(d) and (e), deliver to the Acquiror,
as promptly as practicable, an amount of cash from the Escrow Fund equal to
the amount of Losses set forth in such Officers Certificate; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that to the extent an Officers Certificate alleges only the basis
for anticipated Losses, no amount shall be distributed until such Losses are
actually paid, incurred or sustained. 

   

 (d) _Objections to Claims against the Escrow Fund_. At the time of delivery of any Officers Certificate to the Escrow Agent, a duplicate copy of such certificate shall be delivered simultaneously to the Stockholder Representatives, and for a period of thirty (30) days after such delivery, the Escrow Agent shall make no delivery to the Acquiror of any portion of the Escrow Fund pursuant to Section 8.4(c) unless the Escrow Agent shall have received written authorization from the Stockholder Representatives acting together to make such delivery. After the expiration of such thirty (30) day period, the Escrow Agent shall make delivery of amounts stated in the Officers Certificate unless the Stockholder Representatives deliver an objection in writing to the Escrow Agent about the Losses claimed in the Officers Certificate. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no disbursements relating to the working capital adjustment under Section 2.9(h) shall be subject to this Section 8.4(d). 

  

 (e) _Resolution of Conflicts_. 

  

 (i) If the Stockholder Representatives shall object in writing to any claim or claims made in any Officers Certificate to recover Losses from the Escrow Fund in accordance with Section 8.4(d), then the Stockholder Representatives and the Acquiror shall attempt in good faith to agree upon the rights of the respective parties with respect to each of such claims. If the Stockholder Representatives and the Acquiror should so agree, a memorandum setting forth such agreement shall be prepared and signed by the Stockholder Representatives and the Acquiror and shall be furnished to the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely on any such memorandum and make distributions from the Escrow Fund in accordance with the terms thereof. 

  

 (ii) If no such agreement can be reached after good faith negotiation within sixty (60) days after delivery of an Officers Certificate, either the Acquiror or the Stockholder Representatives may pursue any legal remedy available to him or it with respect to the portion of the Escrow Fund in dispute. 

   ##### 

  

  

 Section 8.5 _Third Party Claims_. 

  

 (a) In order for an Acquiror Indemnified Party or a Company Indemnified Party (each, an " _Indemnified Party_ ") to be entitled to any indemnification provided for under this Agreement in respect of, arising out of or involving a Loss or a claim or demand made by any person against the Indemnified Party (a " _Third Party Claim_ "), such Indemnified Party shall deliver notice thereof to the Stockholder Representatives, on behalf of the stockholders and optionholders of the Company, or to the Acquiror, as applicable (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ");  _provided_ , _however_ , that no delay or failure on the part of an Indemnified Party in notifying the Stockholder Representatives or the Acquiror, as the case may be, shall relieve an Indemnifying Party from its obligations hereunder unless the Indemnifying Party is thereby materially prejudiced (and then solely to the extent of such prejudice). 

  

 (b) The Indemnifying Party shall have the right, upon written notice to the Indemnified Party within fifteen (15) days of receipt of notice from the Indemnified Party of the commencement of such Third Party Claim, to assume the defense thereof at the expense of the Indemnifying Party with counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party and reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party. If the Indemnifying Party does not expressly elect to assume the defense of such Third Party Claim within the time period set forth in this Section 8.5(b), the Indemnified Party shall have the sole right to assume the defense of and to settle such Third Party Claim. If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall, at the Indemnifying Partys expense, cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in such defense and make available to the Indemnifying Party all witnesses, pertinent records, materials and information in the Indemnified Partys possession or under the Indemnified Partys control relating thereto as is reasonably required by the Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall not, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), enter into any settlement or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to such Third Party Claim if such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) involves a finding or admission of wrongdoing, (ii) does not include an unconditional written release by the claimant or plaintiff of the Indemnified Party from all liability in respect of such Third Party Claim or (iii) imposes equitable remedies or any obligation on the Indemnified Party other than solely the payment of money damages for which the Indemnified Party will be indemnified hereunder. 

  

 Section 8.6 _Limits on Indemnification_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement: 

  

 (a) An Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any claim for indemnification pursuant to Section 8.2(a) or (b) or Section 8.3, as the case may be, unless and until the aggregate amount of indemnifiable Losses which may be recovered from such Indemnifying Party exceeds $500,000.00, in which case the Indemnifying Party shall be liable for the entire amount of such Losses; provided, however, that this Section 8.6(a) shall not limit or apply to any payments owed by Acquiror under Sections 2.9 or 6.4 hereof. 

  

 (b) No Indemnified Party may make a claim for indemnification under Section 8.2(a) or Section 8.3, as the case may be, for breach by the Indemnifying Party of a 

   ##### 

  

 

particular representation or warranty that occurs or is identified after the
expiration of the survival period thereof specified in Section 8.1. 

   

 (c) For purposes of calculating the amount of Losses incurred by an Indemnified Party for purposes of this Agreement, such amount shall be: (i) reduced by the amount of any insurance benefits and proceeds actually paid to such Indemnified Party, or any Affiliate of any such party, in respect of such Losses net of any deductible amounts; (ii) reduced by the amount of any indemnification, contribution or other similar payment actually recovered by the Indemnified Party from any third party with respect to such Losses; (iii) reduced by any net Tax Benefit realized by the applicable Indemnified Party as a result of such Losses where the " _Tax Benefit_ " equals the reduction in Taxes realized by such Indemnified Party as a result of the payment or accrual of any loss, expense, deduction or Taxes resulting from the event or circumstance giving rise to such Losses, and (iv) increased to take into account any net Tax Cost incurred by the Indemnified Party arising from (x) the receipt of indemnity payments hereunder or (y) the indemnification, contribution or other similar payments actually recovered by the Indemnified Party from any third party with respect to such Losses (in the case of either (x) or (y) grossed up for any income Tax incurred based on such increase), where the " _Tax Cost_ " equals the increase in Taxes realized by such Indemnified Party as a result of the receipt or accrual of such indemnity payments or indemnification, contribution or other similar payments from a third party. 

  

 Section 8.7 _Exclusive Remedy_. The parties agree that from and after the Closing Date, the exclusive remedies of the parties for any Losses based upon, arising out of or otherwise in respect of the matters set forth in this Agreement are the indemnification obligations of the parties set forth in this Article VIII and that the Escrow Fund shall be the sole and exclusive remedy for the Acquiror Indemnification Claims; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed a waiver by any party of any right to specific performance, injunctive relief or other equitable remedy. 

  

 Section 8.8 _Tax Treatment of Indemnity Payments_. Acquiror, Sub, the Company and each Indemnified Party and Indemnifying Party agree to treat any indemnity payment made pursuant to this Article VIII as an adjustment to the Merger Consideration for federal, state, local and foreign income tax purposes unless a contrary treatment is required under applicable Law.

 (d) by either the Company or the Stockholder Representatives, acting together, or the Acquiror, if any Governmental Authority shall have issued an order, decree or ruling or taken any other action restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and such order, decree, ruling or other action shall have become final and nonappealable;  _provided_ , that the Acquiror and Sub (if the Acquiror is so requesting termination) or the Company (if it is so requesting termination), as the case may be, shall have used their best efforts, in accordance with Section 5.6, to have such order, decree, ruling or other action vacated.
