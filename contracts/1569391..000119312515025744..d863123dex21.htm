<U>Schedule 2.1</U> (other than any Service previously terminated pursuant to this Agreement) that was Provided by KCG to Hotspot prior to the Closing and is reasonably required after the Closing to continue to operate Hotspot as operated prior to
the Closing and cannot otherwise be reasonably Provided by BATS without undue burden, BATS may request in writing that KCG Provide a service relating to the operations of Hotspot that is not set forth in <U>Schedule 2.1</U> (an &#147;<U>Additional

reasonably able, shall provide BATS an estimate which includes the &#147;Cost&#148; required to Provide such Additional Service (&#147;<U>Cost</U>&#148; shall be defined as KCG&#146;s fully loaded cost of Providing the applicable Service, including
costs of labor, materials, KCG&#146;s customary allocation of overhead and administrative expenses, and fees and expenses charged by third parties). KCG will cooperate with BATS in good faith in negotiating the scope, terms, base Cost and duration

much in advance as reasonably practicable under the circumstances) and shall use its reasonable best efforts to provide BATS or Hotspot (as applicable) substantially equivalent services and support in accordance with this Agreement, which

conditions its willingness to perform Services, KCG and BATS will cooperate and jointly participate in negotiating with such third party provider. If, during the term of this Agreement, any agreement with a third party provider under which Services
are provided is terminated by such third party provider or not renewed by either party thereto, (i)&nbsp;BATS will use commercially reasonable efforts to secure an agreement with such third party provider to provide such Services, (ii)&nbsp;KCG and
BATS will cooperate and jointly participate in negotiating with such third party provider and (iii)&nbsp;BATS shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain substantially similar services from a different third party provider. In connection

such Services are needed. In addition, in the event BATS determines to make a change in the manner in which the business of Hotspot is operated during the Term that would require Services to be Provided in a different manner (it being understood
that KCG shall not be required to provide Services in such different manner except as contemplated by this <U>Section&nbsp;2.5(c)</U> or as KCG may otherwise consent), BATS may provide notice to KCG and, upon receipt of such notice, KCG will work in
good faith with BATS to determine whether such Services can be so Provided without undue burden and, if so, on what terms. If the parties can agree on terms, such Services shall each be considered a Service for purposes of this Agreement and the
terms of which will be incorporated into <U>Schedule 2.1</U> hereof. It is agreed that (i)&nbsp;KCG being required to utilize additional persons (either employees, independent contractors or service providers) to Provide Services, (ii)&nbsp;a non-de
minimis increase in the time any KCG employee must commit to Providing Services, (iii)&nbsp;the incurrence of any costs that are not reimbursed by BATS, and (iv)&nbsp;requiring the consent under any license of KCG, shall be considered an undue
burden; <U>provided</U>, that, notwithstanding the foregoing, even if a Service would create an undue burden, KCG will reasonably cooperate with BATS in finding a solution that does not include KCG Providing Services and will provide reasonable
transition support for the migration of any Service to BATS or a third party. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the

of BATS or Hotspot after KCG has provided reasonable notice of such nonperformance or wrongful or tortious actions and used commercially reasonable efforts to perform notwithstanding such nonperformance or wrongful or tortious actions. </P>
