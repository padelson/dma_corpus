Estimated Closing Statement and all estimates and calculations contained
therein shall be prepared in accordance with the Accounting Policies and the
terms of this Agreement and shall include reasonable supporting
information and data necessary to support the calculations and estimates
contained therein. Prior to the Closing, Seller shall make its and the
Companys Representatives reasonably available to Purchaser to discuss the
Estimated Closing Statement and related supporting documentation during
normal business hours and so as not to unreasonably interfere with the conduct
of the business of Seller and its Affiliates. No failure by Purchaser to
dispute Sellers calculation of the Estimated Purchase Price prior to Closing
shall be considered agreement with such amount for purposes of calculating the
Final Purchase Price or any component thereof, and any disagreement raised
prior to the Closing over Sellers good-faith estimate of such amount will
not change the timing of the Closing or alter in any way Purchasers
obligation to pay the Estimated Purchase Price at Closing.

such other customary instruments of transfer or assumption, in each case in
form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Seller, as may be reasonably
required to give effect to this Agreement and the Transition Services
Agreement. 

3.3. _Closing Deliveries by Seller_. At the Closing, Seller shall deliver, or

30 days prior to the Closing Date, that satisfies the requirements of
Treasury Regulations Section 1.1445-2(b)(2) and confirms that Seller is not a
"foreign person" as defined in Section 1445 of the Code.

 

3.4. _Purchase Price Adjustment_. (a) As promptly as practicable, but no later
than sixty (60) days, after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall cause to be
prepared and delivered to Seller a consolidated balance sheet of the Company
and the Transferred Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time (the " _Closing
Balance Sheet_ ") and a certificate including a statement (the " _Closing
Statement_ ") setting forth Purchasers calculation of the Purchase Price and
each component thereof. The Closing Balance Sheet and Closing Statement and
all calculations and determinations contained therein shall be prepared in
accordance with the Accounting Policies and the terms of this Agreement and
shall include such schedules and data reasonably necessary to support the
calculations and estimates contained therein. For the avoidance of doubt,
the calculation of the Estimated Purchase Price and the Purchase Price
hereunder shall disregard the effect of the transactions required to occur at
Closing.

 

(b) If Seller disagrees with Purchasers calculation of the Purchase Price set
forth in the Closing Statement, or any component thereof, Seller may, within
thirty (30) days after delivery of the Closing Statement, deliver a notice to
Purchaser disagreeing with such calculation which specifies Sellers
calculation of such amount and, in reasonable detail, Sellers grounds for
such disagreement. Any such notice of disagreement shall specify those items
or amounts as to which Seller disagrees (each, a " _Disputed Item_ "), and
Seller shall be deemed to have agreed with all other items and
amounts contained in the Closing Statement and the calculation of the
Purchase Price contained therein. During such thirty (30) day period,
Purchaser shall make its and the Companys Representatives reasonably
available to Seller to discuss the Closing Statement and related supporting
documentation during normal business hours and so as not to unreasonably
interfere with the conduct of the business of Purchaser and its Affiliates.

 

(c) If a notice of disagreement shall be duly delivered pursuant to _Section
3.4(b)_ , Purchaser and Seller shall, during the fifteen (15) days following
such delivery, use their commercially reasonable efforts to reach agreement on
the Disputed Items in order to determine, as may be required, the amount of
the Purchase Price. If Purchaser and Seller are unable to reach
such agreement during such period, they shall promptly thereafter engage
Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Limited (or such other mutually agreed independent
accountants of nationally recognized standing) promptly to review this
Agreement and the Disputed Items for the purpose of calculating the Purchase
Price. The independent accountants shall be provided reasonable access to the
books, records and other relevant information of the Company, Purchaser,
Seller and their respective Representatives, to the extent necessary to
calculate the Purchase Price. In making such calculation, such independent
accountants shall consider only the Disputed Items, the amount of which for
any Disputed Item shall only be an amount between Purchasers calculations
contained in the Closing Statement and Sellers calculation delivered pursuant
to _Section 3.4(b)_ , or an amount equal to either such calculation. Such
independent accountants shall deliver to Purchaser and Seller, as promptly as
practicable, a report setting forth such

 



-21-  calculation. Such report shall be final and binding upon Purchaser and
Seller. The cost of such review and report shall be borne (i) by Purchaser if
the difference between the Final Purchase Price and Purchasers calculation
of the Purchase Price contained in the Closing Statement is greater than the
difference between Final Purchase Price and Sellers calculation of the
Purchase Price delivered pursuant to _Section 3.4(b)_ , (ii) by Seller if the
first such difference is less than the second such difference and (iii)
otherwise equally by Purchaser and Seller.

 

(d) Purchaser and Seller agree that they will, and agree to cause their
respective independent accountants and, after the Closing, Purchaser will
cause the Company and each Transferred Subsidiary to, cooperate and assist in
the preparation of the Closing Balance Sheet and the calculation of Closing
Net Working Capital and in the conduct of any reviews referred to in this
_Section 3.4_ , including making available to the extent necessary books,
records, work papers and personnel.

(e) If the Estimated Purchase Price exceeds the Final Purchase Price, Seller
shall pay the amount of such excess to Purchaser. If the Final Purchase Price
exceeds the Estimated Purchase Price, Purchaser shall pay the amount of such
excess to Seller. " _Final Purchase Price_ " means the Purchase Price (i) as
shown in the Closing Statement delivered pursuant to _Section 3.4(a)_ , if no
notice of disagreement with respect thereto is duly delivered pursuant to
_Section 3.4(b)_ ; or (ii) if such a notice of disagreement is delivered, as
shown in the Closing Statement with respect to all items other than the
Disputed Items and in the case of the Disputed Items (A) as agreed by
Purchaser and Seller pursuant to _Section 3.4(c)_  or (B) in the absence of
such agreement, as shown in the independent accountants calculation delivered
pursuant to _Section 3.4(c)_. Any payment pursuant to this _Section 3.4_ shall
be made within five (5) Business Days after the Final Purchase Price has been
determined by wire transfer of immediately available funds to one or more
accounts designated by the relevant party or parties.

 

3.5. _Withholding_. Notwithstanding any provision contained herein to the
contrary, Purchaser, the Company or any of their Subsidiaries, as the case
may be, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as it
is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under any provision of applicable Law. If Purchaser, the Company or any of
their Subsidiaries so withholds amounts, such amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of
which the deduction or withholding was made.

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES REGARDING THE COMPANY

 

Except as Previously Disclosed by Seller, Seller represents and warrants to
Purchaser as of the date of this Agreement and as of the Closing Date (or,

the Company or either of the Transferred Subsidiaries are subject or by which

other rights to purchase or subscribe for shares of such Companys capital
stock, other than this Agreement.

 

(b) Each Transferred Subsidiary is duly organized, validly existing and in
good standing under the Laws of its jurisdiction of organization. The Company

purchase or subscribe for such Transferred Subsidiarys equity interests.

 

(c) There are no outstanding or authorized equity appreciation, phantom
equity, profit participation or other similar rights with respect to the
Company or any Transferred Subsidiary. There are no registration rights, and
there is no voting trust, proxy, rights plan, antitakeover plan or other

except for Permitted Encumbrances. Neither the Company nor any of the
Transferred Subsidiaries owns any real property. The assets, properties and

assets, properties and rights that will be necessary to operate immediately
after the Closing the businesses of the Company and the Transferred

Intellectual Property by the Company and the Transferred Subsidiaries, which
matters the parties acknowledge and agree are solely and exclusively

Transferred Subsidiaries are in good operating condition and repair.

Action by or before any Governmental Authority involving the Company or any

4.7. _Permits_. Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate,

register with or obtain or hold any Licenses and Permits from the SEC,
the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, FINRA or any similar
Governmental Authority in the United States or any other jurisdiction in
connection with the current conduct of its business. The Company and the
Transferred Subsidiaries registration as a futures commission merchant with
the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission has expired, and the Company and
the Transferred Subsidiaries have no Liabilities with respect to such
registration or any conduct or regulation related thereto.

 



-26- 4.8. _Employee Benefit Plans; ERISA_. (a) As of the date hereof, a true and
complete list of each material Benefit Plan (which shall include all Company
Benefit Plans) is set forth on _Schedule 4.8(a)_ of Sellers Disclosure
Schedules. Benefit Plans sponsored by Seller or Seller Parent are referred to
as " _Seller Benefit Plans_ " and Benefit Plans sponsored by the Company are
referred to as " _Company Benefit Plans_ ", and the Seller Benefit Plans and
Company Benefit Plans have been separately identified on _Schedule 4.8(a)_
of Sellers Disclosure Schedules. Benefit Plans that cover Company Service
Providers located primarily within the United States are referred to as " _US
Benefit Plans_ " and Benefit Plans that are not US Benefit Plans are referred
to as " _International Benefit Plans_ ", and the US Benefit Plans and
International Benefit Plans have been separately identified on _Schedule
4.8(a)_ of Sellers Disclosure Schedules. Seller has made available to
Purchaser true and complete copies of each Benefit Plan (and, if applicable,
related trust or funding agreements or insurance policies) and all amendments
thereto together with the most recent annual report (Form 5500 including, if
applicable, Schedule B thereto) and tax return (Form 990) prepared in
connection with any such Benefit Plan or trust and the most recent Internal
Revenue Service determination letter or other tax qualification documentation
from a Governmental Authority for any such plan, to the extent applicable.

(b) Each Benefit Plan is and has been operated and maintained in material
compliance with its terms and ERISA, the Code and other applicable Laws. Each
Benefit Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code
has received a favorable determination letter from the IRS or has applied to
the IRS for such favorable determination letter within the applicable
remedial amendment period under Section 401(b) of the Code, and to Sellers
Knowledge, there are no existing circumstances that could reasonably be
expected to adversely affect the qualified status of any such Benefit Plan.
With respect to any Benefit Plan that is subject to ERISA, none of the
Company, the Transferred Subsidiaries or Seller has engaged in a transaction
that, assuming the taxable period of such transaction expired as of the date
of this Agreement, would be reasonably likely to subject any of the Company
or the Transferred Subsidiaries to a tax or penalty imposed by either Section
4975 of the Code or Section 502(i) of ERISA in an amount which would be
material. Each International Benefit Plan if intended to qualify for special
tax treatment, complies in all material respects with the requirements for
such treatment, and if required, to any extent, to be funded, book-reserved or
secured by an insurance policy, is fully funded, book-reserved or secured by
an insurance policy, as applicable, based on reasonable actuarial assumptions
in accordance with applicable accounting principles. From and after the
Closing Date, Purchaser and its Affiliates will receive the full benefit of
any funds, accruals and reserves under the International Benefit Plans that
are Company Benefit Plans.

 

(c) Neither the Company, any of the Transferred Subsidiaries, nor any
corporation or entity that would be deemed a "single employer" with the
Company or any Transferred Subsidiary within the meaning of Section 414(b),
(c), (m), or (o) of the Code or Section 4001 of ERISA, or any of their
respective predecessors, has contributed to, contributes to, has been
required to contribute to, or otherwise participated in or participates in or
in any way

 



-27-  has any Liability, directly or indirectly, with respect to (i) an employee
benefit plan that is or was subject to Section 412, 430 or 4971 of the Code or
Section 302 or Title IV of ERISA, including, without limitation, any
"multiemployer plan" (within the meaning of Sections 3(37) or 4001(a)(3) of
ERISA or Section 414(f) of the Code), (ii) a "multiple employer plan" (as
defined in Section 413 of the Code), (iii) a "multiple employer welfare
arrangement (as defined in Section 3(40) of ERISA), or (iv) a plan maintained
in connection with any trust described in Section 501(c)(9) of the Code.

 

(d) Neither the Company nor any of the Transferred Subsidiaries has any
current or projected liability for, and no Benefit Plan provides or promises
to any Company Service Provider, any post-employment or post-retirement
medical, dental, disability, hospitalization, life or similar benefits
(whether insured or self-insured) other than coverage mandated by applicable
Law. No Company Service Provider whose employment transferred to Seller or
any of its Affiliates by virtue of any Automatic Transfer Regulation has any
right to enhanced early retirement or redundancy benefits by virtue of having
had such rights in connection with their employment prior to such transfer.

(e) As of the date of this Agreement, there is no pending or, to Sellers
Knowledge threatened, Action relating to the Benefit Plans that would be
material to the Company or the Transferred Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

 

(f) Neither the execution of this Agreement nor the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby (either alone or together with any other
event) will (i) entitle any Company Service Provider to any payment or
benefit, including any bonus, retention, retirement or severance pay or any
increase in severance pay (other than severance pay required by applicable
Law), (ii) accelerate the time of or trigger any payment or vesting under any
Benefit Plan or increase the amount payable to any Company Service Provider or
(iii) limit or restrict the right of the Company or any of its Affiliates to
merge, amend or terminate any Company Benefit Plan. Neither the Company nor
any of the Transferred Subsidiaries has any obligation to gross-up, indemnify
or otherwise reimburse any Company Service Provider for any Tax. No Benefit
Plan, individually or collectively, would reasonably be expected to result in
the payment of any amount that would not be deductible under Section 280G of
the Code.

 

4.9. _Material Contracts_. (a) As of the date of this Agreement, _Schedule
4.9(a)_ of Sellers Disclosure Schedules lists each of the following
Contracts of the Company and the Transferred Subsidiaries (collectively, "
_Material Contracts_ "):

material penalty;

representation or warranty whether by Purchaser or its Affiliates.

its reasonable best efforts to (i) take all reasonable acts necessary to cause
the conditions precedent set forth in _Article 8_ to be satisfied, (ii)
obtain all consents, registrations, approvals, waivers, orders, interpretive

necessary consents, approvals or waivers from third parties (including all

necessary to obtain all Required Governmental Approvals. Purchaser and Seller
will provide such assistance,

 



-43-  information and cooperation to each other as is reasonably required to
obtain any Required Governmental Approvals, other third-party consents and any
notices (including Third-Party Consents) and, subject to applicable Law, will
provide each other with the reasonable opportunity to review in advance any
applications, notices or other filings proposed to be made with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby (and will give due consideration to any
comments and suggestions made with respect thereto by the other party). In
connection therewith, each party will notify the other promptly following the
receipt of any comments from any Governmental Authority and of any request by
any Governmental Authority for amendments, supplements or additional
information in respect of any application, notice or other filing with such
Governmental Authority and will supply the other party with copies of all
material correspondence between such party or any of its Representatives, on
the one hand, and any Governmental Authority in connection with obtaining any
Required Governmental Approval, on the other hand; _provided_ that such
disclosure is permitted under applicable Law. Any such provision of
information by one party to the other may be made on a counsel-only basis to
the extent required under applicable Law (including any anti-gun jumping
Laws), and any such materials may be redacted (i) as necessary to comply with
contractual arrangements, (ii) as necessary to address reasonable attorney-
client or other privilege or confidentiality concerns or (iii) as otherwise
necessary to comply with applicable Law. Each party shall consult with
the other in advance of any meeting or conference with any Governmental

and to the extent permitted by such Governmental Authority, give the other
party and/or its counsel the opportunity to attend and participate in such

(c) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of Seller and
Purchaser will, as promptly as practicable, but in no event later than ten
(10) Business Days following the execution and delivery of this Agreement,
file with the FTC and the DOJ the notification and report form required for
the transactions contemplated hereby and any supplemental information
required in connection therewith pursuant to the HSR Act. Each party hereto
represents and warrants that such notification and report form and all such
supplemental information submitted by such party or its ultimate parent, and
any additional supplemental information filed by such party after the date of
the original filing, will be in substantial compliance with the requirements
of the HSR Act. Seller and Purchaser shall each furnish to the other such
necessary information and reasonable assistance as the other may request in
connection with its preparation of any filing or submission that is necessary
under the HSR Act. Seller and Purchaser shall keep each other apprised of the
status of any communications with, and inquiries or requests for additional
information from, the FTC or the DOJ, and shall each use its reasonable best
efforts to comply promptly with any such inquiry or request. Seller
and Purchaser will each use its reasonable best efforts to cause the
expiration or early termination of the waiting period required under the HSR
Act as a condition to the purchase and sale of Shares under this Agreement and
shall use reasonable best efforts to defend against any action of the FTC or
the DOJ to enjoin such purchase and sale and to satisfy any conditions imposed
or to avoid the imposition thereof, by the FTC or DOJ, as applicable.

 

(d) Purchaser and the Company shall cooperate in determining the most
efficient manner to establish an office of Purchaser or the
Company (including a branch,

 



-44-  representative office or other office) in Singapore. Purchaser and the
Company agree to promptly file any applications or notices necessary to
establish such office and to use reasonable best efforts to obtain the
approval of any such applications or notices. If notwithstanding the efforts
of the parties, an office is not established in Singapore at the time of the
Closing, the Closing will proceed; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company
Employees who work in Singapore will not transfer to Purchaser on the Closing
Date, will remain employed by an Affiliate of Seller and will be seconded to
Purchaser or an Affiliate of Purchaser pursuant to a customary secondment
or similar arrangement or otherwise dedicated to provide services to
Purchaser and its Affiliates. If an office is not established prior to
Closing, Purchaser will continue to use reasonable best efforts to establish
an office and upon establishment of such office, the Company Employees
located in Singapore will transfer to Purchaser or an Affiliate of Purchaser.

(e) The parties shall keep each other apprised of the status of matters
relating to completion of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including promptly furnishing the other with copies of any material notices or
other communications received by either party or its Affiliates (as the case
may be) or, to its Knowledge, its Representatives from any Governmental
Authority with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, in
each case to the extent permitted by applicable Law. The parties shall give
prompt notice to each other of any development or combination of developments
that, individually or in the aggregate, is reasonably likely to prevent,
materially delay or materially impair its respective ability to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the failure to
satisfy a condition to the Closing set forth in _Article 8_ ; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that no such notification or other Information provided or
obtained by any party prior to the Closing shall affect the representations,
warranties, covenants or obligations of the parties or the conditions to the
obligations of the parties under this Agreement.

 

7.4. _Pre-Closing Access_. (a) Prior to the earlier of the Closing Date or the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to its terms, subject to applicable
Law, Purchaser shall be entitled, at Purchasers expense, to have such access
to the offices, Representatives, and books, data, files, information, records,
documents, correspondence and other materials of the Company and the
Transferred Subsidiaries as Purchaser may reasonably request. Any such access
pursuant to this _Section 7.4(a)_ shall be conducted or occur at reasonable
times during regular business hours, as approved in advance by Seller and
shall not otherwise unreasonably interfere with business or operations of
Seller and its Subsidiaries; _provided_ that any such access shall be subject
to the terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement and that in no
event shall Purchaser have access to any information that relates solely to
any portion of the business of Seller and its Affiliates that is not being
transferred pursuant to this Agreement; _provided_ _further_ that the auditors
and independent accountants of Seller or any of its Affiliates shall not be
obligated to make any work papers available to any Person unless and until
such Person has entered into reasonable and customary third-party access and
confidentiality agreements in form and substance acceptable to such auditors
or accountants.

(b) The foregoing shall not require Seller or Sellers Affiliates to permit
any inspection, or to disclose any information, that could reasonably be
expected to result in (i) the disclosure of any Trade Secrets or the violation
of any obligations of Seller or Sellers Affiliates 

 



-45-  with respect to confidentiality if Seller shall have used reasonable best
efforts to obtain the consent of such third party to such inspection or
disclosure, (ii) the waiver of any applicable legally recognized privilege or
(iii) the violation of any applicable Law.

7.5. _Post-Closing Access_. (a) Seller and its Affiliates shall have the
right, subject to compliance with all applicable Laws (including privacy
Laws), to retain copies of all books, data, files, information, records,
documents, correspondence and other materials in any media (including, for
the avoidance of doubt, Tax Returns and other information and documents
relating to tax matters) of the Company and each of the Transferred
Subsidiaries (i) relating to information (including employment, medical
and immigration records) regarding the Company Employees or relating to the
Tax Returns of, or that include, the Company or the Transferred Subsidiaries,
(ii) as required by any legal or regulatory authority, including any
applicable Law or regulatory request or (iii) as may be necessary for Seller

Transferred Subsidiaries, on the other hand, that will remain in effect after
the Closing.

(b) After the Closing, Purchaser shall allow (or shall cause its Affiliates
to allow) Seller and its Affiliates, upon reasonable prior notice and during
regular business hours and subject to compliance with all applicable Laws
(including privacy Laws), the right, at Sellers expense, to examine and make
copies of any books, data, files, information, records, documents,
correspondence and other materials of the Company or the Transferred
Subsidiaries for any reasonable, non-competitive business purpose, including
the preparation or examination of Tax Returns, regulatory filings and
financial statements, the conduct of any litigation or the conduct of any
regulatory, contractholder, participant or other dispute resolution
(whether pending or threatened) and the enforcement or discharge of its
indemnification rights or obligations under this Agreement; _provided_ that
the auditors and independent accountants of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates
shall not be obligated to make any work papers available to any Person unless
and until such Person has entered into reasonable and customary access and
confidentiality agreements in form and substance acceptable to such auditors
or accountants. In the event that disclosing information would violate any
obligation of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates with respect to
confidentiality, the parties shall reasonably cooperate so the information
might be made available in a redacted format, or, if such redaction
would result in pertinent information being omitted, Purchaser shall make
such information available if Seller delivers confidentiality undertakings
reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser.

 

(c) After the Closing, Seller shall allow (or shall cause its Affiliates to
allow) Purchaser and its Affiliates, upon reasonable prior notice and during
regular business hours and subject to compliance with all applicable Laws
(including privacy Laws), the right, at Purchasers expense, to examine and
make copies of any books, data, files, information, records,
documents, correspondence and other materials of Seller or its Affiliates
relating to the Company or the Transferred Subsidiaries for any reasonable
non-competitive business purpose, including the preparation or examination of
Tax Returns, regulatory filings and financial statements, the conduct of any
litigation or the conduct of any regulatory, contractholder, participant or
other dispute resolution (whether pending or threatened) and the enforcement
or discharge of its 

 



-46-  indemnification rights or obligations under this Agreement; _provided_ that
the auditors and independent accountants of Seller or any of its Affiliates
shall not be obligated to make any work papers available to any Person unless
and until such Person has entered into reasonable and customary access and
confidentiality agreements in form and substance acceptable to such auditors
or accountants. In the event that disclosing information would violate any
obligation of Seller or any of its Affiliates with respect to confidentiality,
the parties shall reasonably cooperate so the information might be made
available in a redacted format, or, if such redaction would result in
pertinent information being omitted, Seller shall make such information
available if Purchaser delivers confidentiality undertakings reasonably
satisfactory to Seller.

 

(d) Purchaser agrees that, with respect to all original books, data, files,
information, records, documents, correspondence and other materials of the
Company and each of the Transferred Subsidiaries existing as of the Closing
Date, it will (and will cause each of the Company and the Transferred
Subsidiaries and any other Affiliates of Purchaser to) (i) comply in all
material respects with all applicable Laws relating to the preservation and
retention of records, (ii) apply preservation and retention policies that are
no less stringent than those generally applied by Purchaser from time to time
with respect to its other businesses and that are customary for similar
businesses and (iii) maintain such books, data, files, information and other
records for examination and copying by Seller (such copying to be at the
expense of Seller) for six (6) years following the Closing (or for a longer
period if required by applicable Law); _provided_ that after such six-year (or
other) period, Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts to provide
Seller with at least ninety (90) days written notice prior to destroying or
disposing of any such books, data, files, information and other records, at
which time and at the option and expense of Seller, Purchaser shall deliver
such books, data, files, information, records, documents, correspondence and
other materials to Seller.

(e) Seller agrees that, with respect to all original books, data, files,
information, records, documents, correspondence and other materials of Seller
and its Affiliates (other than the Company and the Transferred Subsidiaries)
relating to the Company and any Transferred Subsidiary existing as of the
Closing Date, it will (and will cause each of its Affiliates to) (i) comply
in all material respects with all applicable Laws relating to the preservation
and retention of records, (ii) apply preservation and retention policies that
are no less stringent than those generally applied by Seller from time to
time with respect to its other businesses and that are customary for similar
businesses and (iii) make such books, data, files, information and other
records available for examination and copying by Purchaser (such copying to

7.6. _Employee Benefit Matters_. (a) Through the Coverage Period, Purchaser
shall provide or cause its Affiliates to provide to each Company Employee who
continues

 



-47-  employment with the Company, the Transferred Subsidiaries, Purchaser or any
of the Affiliates of Purchaser following the Closing Date (each, a "
_Continuing Employee_ "), during any period of employment, (i) a base salary
or wage rate, as applicable, at least equal to the base salary or wage rate,
as applicable, provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the
Closing Date, (ii) annual bonus and commission opportunities that are no less
favorable as to opportunity amounts (regardless of the form of payment) than
the annual bonus and commission opportunities provided to such Continuing
Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date, (iii) employee health and
welfare benefits that are substantially comparable, in the aggregate, to the
employee health and welfare benefits provided to the Continuing Employees
immediately prior to the Closing Date and (iv) severance benefits no less
favorable than the greater of (A) the severance benefits provided by Purchaser
to similarly situated employees of Purchaser and (B) the severance benefits
provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date;
_provided_ that any cash severance payments made to a Continuing Employee may
be offset by any contractual right of such Continuing Employee to receive (x)
a payout of guaranteed compensation upon a termination or (y) payment with
respect to post-termination restrictive covenants, it being understood that
any contractual right to receive a payout of guaranteed compensation (which,
for the avoidance of doubt shall be conditioned on such Continuing Employee
executing a release of claims) or any payment with respect to post-termination
restrictive covenants, in each case, shall not offset a Continuing Employees
right to receive severance benefits in the form of healthcare
continuation coverage under this _Section 7.6(a)(iv)_. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, the parties agree to the allocation of
certain specified liabilities as set forth on _Schedule 7.6(a)_ of Sellers
Disclosure Schedule. Immediately following the Coverage Period, the
Continuing Employees who continue to be employed with Purchaser or any of the
Affiliates of Purchaser shall be eligible to participate in benefit plans
comparable to those provided to similarly situated employees of Purchaser and
the Affiliates of Purchaser, as applicable, in the same geography.

(b) Prior to the Closing Date, any Company Employee who is not already
employed by the Company or a Transferred Subsidiary (other than Inactive
Employees) will be transferred to the Company or a Transferred Subsidiary or,
at the request of Purchaser will not be so transferred and instead will be
offered employment, effective as of the Closing, by Purchaser or one of its
Subsidiaries; _provided_ that Purchaser shall, no later than twenty (20)
Business Days after the date hereof, provide written notice to Seller of any
such Company Employee who will be offered employment by Purchaser and shall
not be so transferred pursuant to this _Section 7.6(b)_. Any individual who
is a Company Employee and, as of immediately prior to the Closing, is not
actively employed (an " _Inactive Employee_ ") shall remain an employee of,
or have his or her employment transferred prior to Closing to, Seller Parent
or one of its Subsidiaries other than the Company or the Transferred
Subsidiaries. Subject to Seller notifying Purchaser of an Inactive Employees
return to active employment within 10 Business Days of such return, Purchaser
or one of its Affiliates shall make an offer of employment to such Inactive
Employee; _provided_ that the Inactive Employee returned to active employment
with Seller Parent or one of its Subsidiaries on or prior to the expiration
date of such Inactive Employees eligibility for disability benefits or
approved leave period and within 180 days after Closing. 

 



-48- (c) Purchaser agrees to honor, assume, fulfill and discharge, or to cause the
Company or any Transferred Subsidiary to honor, assume, fulfill and
discharge, all obligations to Company Employees under the Benefit Plans set
forth on _Schedule 7.6(c)_ of Sellers Disclosure Schedules.

 

(d) Effective as of the Closing Date or, for an Inactive Employee, the date
the Inactive Employees employment transfers to Purchaser or one of its
Affiliates pursuant to _Section 7.6(b)_ (such date, the " _Transfer Date_ "),
the Company Employees and their applicable dependents shall cease to be
covered by any applicable Seller Benefit Plans and shall cease to accrue
benefits under any such Seller Benefit Plans. From and after the Closing Date
or as applicable, the Transfer Date, each Continuing Employee shall receive
credit for all service with the Company or any of its Affiliates to the
extent recognized by Seller prior to the Closing for purposes of eligibility,
vesting, level of benefit and benefit accrual (other than benefit accrual
under a defined benefit pension plan) under employee benefit plans sponsored
or maintained by Purchaser or its Affiliates (" _Purchaser Benefit Plans_ ")
in which such Continuing Employee is eligible to participate; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that such service shall not be recognized to the extent that such
recognition would result in any duplication of benefits. Subject to the terms
of the applicable Purchaser Benefit Plan, Purchaser or its Affiliates, as
applicable, shall use reasonable best efforts to (i) cause each Continuing
Employee to be immediately eligible to participate in any Purchaser Benefit
Plan to the extent coverage under such Purchaser Benefit Plan is replacing
comparable coverage under a Benefit Plan in which such Continuing Employee
participated immediately prior to the Closing Date or as applicable, the
Transfer Date, (ii) waive all limitations as to pre-existing and at-work
conditions, if any, with respect to participation and coverage requirements
applicable to each Continuing Employee under Purchaser Benefit Plans that
are welfare benefit plans and (iii) provide credit to each Continuing
Employee for any co-payments and deductibles paid by such employees under the
Seller Benefit Plans for the plan year during which the Closing Date occurs
for the purpose of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out of
pocket requirements applicable to each Continuing Employee and his or her
covered dependents for the applicable plan year under a Purchaser Benefit Plan
to the extent coverage under such Purchaser Benefit Plan is replacing
comparable coverage under a Benefit Plan in which such Continuing Employee
participated immediately prior to the Closing Date, or as applicable, the
Transfer Date.

 

(e) If Purchaser maintains a defined contribution plan that includes a
qualified cash or deferred arrangement within the meaning of Section 401(k)
of the Code, (the " _Purchaser 401(k) Plan_ "), Purchaser shall permit each
Continuing Employee participating in the Seller Benefit Plan that is a defined
contribution plan with a qualified cash or deferred arrangement within the
meaning of Section 401(k) of the Code (the " _Seller 401(k) Plan_ ") to
effect, and Purchaser agrees to cause the Purchaser 401(k) Plan to accept, in
accordance with applicable Law and subject to the provisions of the Purchaser
401(k) Plan, a "direct rollover" (within the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of
the Code) of his or her account balances (including earnings thereon through
the date of transfer and promissory notes evidencing all outstanding loans)
under the Seller 401(k) Plan if such rollover to the Purchaser 401(k) Plan is

unaffiliated third party and shall use reasonable best efforts to complete

-51- (c) The parties acknowledge that the covenants set forth in this _Section
7.7_ are an essential element of this Agreement. The parties acknowledge that
this _Section 7.7_ constitutes an independent covenant that shall not be
affected by performance or nonperformance of any other provision of this
Agreement. If any covenant contained in this _Section 7.7_ is found to be
invalid, void or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction by a final
determination of a court or any other Governmental Authority of competent
jurisdiction, Seller and Purchaser agree that: (i) such determination shall
not affect the validity or enforceability of (A) the offending term or
provision in any other situation or in any other jurisdiction or (B) the
remaining terms and provisions of this  _Section 7.7_ in any situation in
any jurisdiction; and (ii) the offending term or provision shall be reformed
rather than voided and the court or Governmental Authority making such
determination shall have the power to reduce the scope, duration or
geographical area of any invalid or unenforceable term or provision, to delete
specific words or phrases, or to replace any invalid or enforceable term or
provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and
that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or
unenforceable provision, in order to render the restrictive covenants set
forth in this _Section 7.7_ enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law.

 

(d) The parties hereby acknowledge and agree that irreparable damage would
occur if this _Section 7.7_ were not performed in accordance with its
specific terms and that any breach of this _Section 7.7_ would not be
adequately compensated by monetary damages alone. Accordingly, in addition to
any other right or remedy to which such party may be entitled, at law or in
equity or under this Agreement, such party shall be entitled to enforce this
_Section 7.7_ by a decree of specific performance and to temporary,
preliminary and permanent injunctive relief to prevent breaches or threatened
breaches of this _Section 7.7_, without posting any bond or other
undertaking.

(e) For the avoidance of doubt, none of the restrictions imposed by
applicable subsections of this _Section 7.7_ shall apply to any Person that
is an Affiliate of Seller or Seller Parent if such Person ceases to be an
Affiliate of Seller and Seller Parent.

 

7.8. _Insurance_. (a) Seller shall (i) keep, or cause to be kept, all
insurance policies in effect relating to the Company and the Transferred
Subsidiaries as of the date hereof or suitable replacements therefor (with
terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are substantially
similar in all material respects to the existing policies or otherwise
consistent with the market practice of businesses of a similar size and
type), in full force and effect through the close of business on the Closing
Date, and (ii) use commercially reasonable efforts to protect the rights of
the insured Persons under such insurance policies or replacements in all
material respects, including by causing said insured Persons to (A) pay or
otherwise satisfy or have satisfied any unpaid premiums when due with respect
to any period ending at or prior to the Closing, (B) provide any reasonably
required notices (including renewal notices or, if applicable, other
documentation reasonably required to continue in full force and effect such
insurance policies) to the issuers thereof, and (C) act reasonably in respect
of any decision whether to submit and pursue claims on a timely basis under
such insurance policies.

 



-52- (b) Purchaser and its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Company
and the Transferred Subsidiaries) will not have access to, and shall not be
permitted to make any claims under, any of Sellers or any of its Affiliates
insurance policies and programs with respect to any events or circumstances,
including events or circumstances relating to the business of the Company and
the Transferred Subsidiaries that occurred or existed prior to the Closing.

 

7.9. _Transition Services Agreement_. Seller and Purchaser shall use their
respective reasonable best efforts to promptly negotiate in good faith and
finalize the complete terms and conditions of the Transition Services
Agreement within thirty (30) days of the date of this Agreement. The parties
shall execute and deliver the Transition Services Agreement to one another on
the Closing Date.

7.10. _Further Assurances_. On and after the Closing Date, Seller (as
reasonably requested from time to time by Purchaser) and Purchaser (as
reasonably requested from time to time by Seller) shall take all reasonably
appropriate action and execute any additional documents, instruments or
conveyances of any kind (not containing additional representations
and warranties) which may be reasonably necessary to carry out any of the
provisions of this Agreement.

7.11. _Confidentiality_. The Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in full
force and effect until the Closing. After the Closing, each party shall hold,
and shall cause their respective directors, officers, employees, agents,
consultants and advisors to hold, in strict confidence, except to the extent
necessary to discharge obligations pursuant to _Section 7.3_ or unless
compelled to disclose by judicial or administrative process or, based on the
advice of its counsel, by other requirements of applicable Law or the
applicable requirements of any regulatory agency or relevant stock exchange,
all non-public records, books, contracts, instruments, computer data and other
data and information (collectively, " _Information_ ") concerning the other
party or its Affiliates (or, if required under a contract with a third party,
such third party) furnished to it by such other party or its representatives
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or, in the
case of Information relating to the Company or any Transferred Subsidiary,
known to Seller or its Affiliates through Sellers ownership of the Company
(except to the extent that such information can be shown to have been (i)
previously known by such party on a non-confidential basis, (ii) in the
public domain through no fault of such party or (iii) later lawfully acquired
from other sources by the party to which it was furnished), and neither Seller
nor Purchaser shall release or disclose such Information to any other person,
except its auditors, attorneys, financial advisors, bankers, other consultants
and advisors with a duty of confidentiality and, to the extent permitted
above, any Governmental Authority. To the extent permitted by applicable Law,
each party will notify the other party promptly upon becoming aware that any
of the Information has been disclosed to or obtained by a third party
(otherwise than as permitted by this _Section 7.11_ ).

 



-53- 7.12. _Publicity; Notices_. Until the Closing Date, the parties hereto shall
coordinate with each other as soon as practicable in advance as to (a) the
form and content of any external communication, including any communication
intended for dissemination or to reach, or reasonably expected to be
disseminated or to reach, members of the public regarding the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and (b) the form and content of any
communication from Purchaser to any Continuing Employee other than individual
agreements. Neither party shall, or shall permit its Affiliates to,
disseminate any such communication without adequate advance notice and the
prior consent of the other, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed, except that nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent the
parties hereto from making any and all public disclosures legally required to
comply with any applicable securities laws or regulations, rules of a national
securities exchange to which the parties are subject, or requests of
Governmental Authorities; _provided_  that, to the extent possible under the
circumstances, the party making such disclosure consults with the other party,
and considers in good faith the views of the other party, before doing so;
_provided_ , _further_ , that the restrictions in this _Section 7.12_ shall
not apply to any disclosure contained in Seller Parents periodic reports
filed with the SEC.

 

7.13. _Director Indemnification; Exculpation_. (a) All rights to
indemnification for and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Closing now existing in favor of any current or
former director or officer of the Company or the Transferred Subsidiaries (or
any of their respective predecessor entities) or any Person who becomes prior
to the Closing a director or officer of the Company or the Transferred
Subsidiaries (each, an " _Indemnified Director_ ") as provided in the
Constituent Documents of each such Person, or in any indemnification agreement
set forth on  _Schedule 7.13_ of Sellers Disclosure Schedules between such
Indemnified Director and such Person (in each case, as in effect on the date
of this Agreement), shall survive the Closing and shall continue in full force
and effect in accordance with their respective terms for a period of six (6)
years from the Closing; _provided_ , _however_ , that all rights to
indemnification in respect of any Action asserted or made prior to the Closing
or within such six-year period shall continue until the final disposition of
such Action.

(b) Purchaser shall ensure that from and after the Closing until the sixth
(6th) anniversary thereof, the Constituent Documents of the Company and the
Transferred Subsidiaries shall contain provisions no less favorable with
respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of
Indemnified Directors than are presently set forth in such Constituent
Documents, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise
modified in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of
any such individuals. From and after the Closing, Purchaser shall cause the
Company or the applicable Transferred Subsidiary to, to the same and fullest
extent a Delaware corporation is permitted to indemnify its officers,
directors or employees by applicable Law, indemnify, defend and hold
harmless, and provide advancement of expenses to, each Indemnified Director
against all reasonable losses, claims, damages, costs, expenses, liabilities
or judgments or amounts that are paid in settlement of or in connection with
any claim based in whole or in part on or arising in whole or in part out of
the fact that such person is or was a director, officer or employee of the
Company or either of the Transferred Subsidiaries, and pertaining to any
matter existing or occurring, or any acts or omissions occurring, at or prior
to the Closing Date, whether asserted or claimed prior to, or at or

 



-54-  after, the Closing Date (including matters, acts or omissions occurring in
connection with the approval of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby). At its election, Purchaser shall control
and assume the defense and settlement of any Action in which an Indemnified
Director seeks indemnification or advancement of expenses pursuant to this
_Section 7.13_ (except for any Action that seeks material non-monetary,
equitable or injunctive relief or alleges violation of criminal law or any
Action by any Governmental Authority in which the Indemnified Director is a
named defendant).

 

(c) The provisions of this _Section 7.13_ shall survive the Closing and are
intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each
Indemnified Director and his or her heirs and are in addition to, and not in
substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any
such person may have from the Company or either of the Transferred
Subsidiaries or any other person by contract or otherwise except as expressly
provided in this Agreement. The obligations of Purchaser and Seller under this
_Section 7.13_ shall not be terminated or modified in a manner so as to
adversely affect any Indemnified Director or any other person entitled to the
benefit of this _Section 7.13_ without the prior written consent of the
affected Indemnified Director.

 

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the rights to indemnification and
advancement of expenses provided for in this _Section 7.13_ shall not apply
to, and each Indemnified Director waives such rights with respect to, matters
or claims arising from claims made by any Purchaser Indemnified Parties
pursuant to this Agreement.

 

7.14. _Release of Guarantees_.

 

(a) Purchaser shall reasonably cooperate with Seller prior to the Closing Date
in Sellers efforts to terminate as of the Closing, all guarantees or
commitments by Seller or its Affiliates (other than the Company and the
Transferred Subsidiaries) set forth on _Schedule 7.14(a)_ of Sellers
Disclosure Schedules of specified obligations of the Company or either of
the Transferred Subsidiaries under any agreements to which the Company or
either of the Transferred Subsidiaries is a party (the " _Seller Performance
Guarantees_ "), including if requested by the relevant beneficiary of such
Seller Performance Guarantee following discussions between such beneficiary
and Purchaser, by offering guarantees, support or other security arrangements
reasonably acceptable to the relevant beneficiary of such Seller Performance
Guarantee (including bank or other third-party guarantees, letters of credit
or insurance) or taking such other actions as Purchaser and such beneficiary
may mutually agree on. Purchaser shall not take any action to cause any Seller
Performance Guarantees (and, so long as any Seller Performance Guarantee
remains in effect, obligations thereunder) to be renewed, extended, expanded
or amended after the Closing.

 

(b) If any Seller Performance Guarantees are not terminated as of the Closing
other than through any failure to take action by Seller or its Affiliates
(the " _Continuing Seller Performance Guarantees_ "), Purchaser shall (i) use
its reasonable best efforts to procure that the Continuing Seller Performance
Guarantees be terminated as promptly as practicable after the Closing on
terms reasonably acceptable to the parties to this Agreement, (ii) defend,
indemnify

 



-55-  and hold harmless Seller and its Affiliates against and from, and reimburse
Seller and its Affiliates for any reasonable losses incurred to the extent
relating to or arising under the Continuing Seller Performance Guarantees
following the Closing and (iii) procure that such documents, as are reasonably
requested by Seller or its Affiliates and in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to Purchaser, be executed by Purchaser to further evidence the
obligations set forth in clauses (i) and (ii) of this _Section 7.14(b)_.

(c) Prior to the Closing, Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain and deliver to Purchaser terminations and/or releases with respect to
all Indebtedness of the Company and the Transferred Subsidiaries to the extent
reasonably requested by Purchaser, in each case, in customary and
commercially reasonable form, subject in each case to the Closing.

7.15. _Trademark Matters_. (a) Except as specifically provided in this
_Section 7.15_, Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that none of Purchaser or
its Affiliates is purchasing, acquiring, receiving a license to or otherwise
obtaining any right, title or interest in, to or under any Intellectual
Property owned or licensed by Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than the
Company and the Transferred Subsidiaries), including in or to the Seller
Trademarks.

 

(b) Within thirty (30) days following the Closing Date, Purchaser shall cause
each of Company and its Affiliates (which, as of and after the Closing, shall
include the Company and the Transferred Subsidiaries) to make all filings
necessary to (i) change its corporate name to a name that does not contain any
Seller Trademarks, and (ii) withdraw all its fictitious name filings and
"doing business as" filings for any name that contains any Seller Trademarks.
Purchaser shall provide Seller with any additional information, documents and
materials that Seller may reasonably request to evidence the
filings described in clauses (i) and (ii).

(c) Purchaser shall, and shall cause its Affiliates (which, as of and after
the Closing, shall include the Company and the Transferred Subsidiaries) to
cease and discontinue all uses of the Seller Trademarks; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Company and the Transferred Subsidiaries may, during the
ninety (90) day period immediately after the Closing, continue to use the
Seller Trademarks on signage, stationery, forms, and marketing and
informational materials, to the extent such items exist and are in the
possession of the Company or its Affiliates as of the Closing, in the same
manner as used by the Company and the Transferred Subsidiaries as of Closing.
For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as
restricting or limiting Purchaser or any of its Affiliates from using or
referencing any Seller Trademarks in a manner that would constitute "fair
use" under applicable Law if such use were made by a third party (including,
for the avoidance of doubt, in any materials or documents to indicate Sellers
or any Sellers Affiliates historic or factual relationship to the Company
and the Transferred Subsidiaries in a manner that would constitute "fair use"
under applicable Law if such use were made by a third party).

 

(d) Purchaser hereby irrevocably and unconditionally covenants, and will cause
its Subsidiaries (which, as of and after the Closing, shall include the
Company and the

 



-56-  Transferred Subsidiaries) and its and their respective successors and
assigns to covenant, not to (i) represent to any third party that it has, in
any jurisdiction, any ownership rights in or to the Seller Trademarks or any
other rights in the Seller Trademarks other than the specific rights conferred
in this Agreement; or (ii) adopt, use, register or attempt to register in any
jurisdiction any of the Seller Trademarks or instruct others to do any of the
foregoing.

(e) From and after the Closing Date, neither Seller nor any of its
Subsidiaries shall use, or license or permit any third party to use, (i) any
Trademarks included in the Owned Intellectual Property, or (ii) any Trademarks
consisting of "KCG," "Knight" or "GETCO" used together with any
Trademarks included in the Owned Intellectual Property (collectively, "
_Combined Marks_ ") (other than the domain names listed on _Schedule 7.15(g)_
of Sellers Disclosure Schedules, but only for the sole purpose of redirecting
such domain names as contemplated by _Section 7.15(g)_ below), and Seller
shall promptly cancel any registered trademarks for the Combined Marks owned
by Seller or any of its Subsidiaries, including KCG HOTSPOT (registration
number 4594145).

 

(f) Prior to the Closing Date, Seller Parent shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates to, assign and transfer all right, title and interest of Seller
Parent and its Affiliates in, to and under the websites and domain names
listed on _Schedule 7.15(f)_ of Sellers Disclosure Schedules (including all
goodwill associated therewith and all content contained therein) to the
Company. 

(g) During the twelve (12) month period immediately following the Closing
Date, Seller Parent shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, redirect each
of the domain names listed on _Schedule 7.15(g)_ of Sellers Disclosure
Schedules, which domain names are being retained by Seller, to such IP address
or such other domain name as Purchaser may reasonably instruct from time to
time (it being understood that such IP address or such other domain name shall
be reasonably related to the business of the Company and the Transferred
Subsidiaries).

 

7.16. _Transition Plan_. Between the date of this Agreement and the Closing
Date, Seller and Purchaser shall, in accordance with mutually acceptable
guidelines and procedures and in all events in accordance with applicable Law,
internal policies of Purchaser, Seller Parent and its Subsidiaries and the
Transition Services Agreement: (a) designate certain Persons (including, in
the case of Persons designated by Seller, representatives of the Company) to
serve as members of one or more (as agreed by Seller and Purchaser) transition
teams with representatives of the other party and cause such Persons to devote
a reasonable amount of time to discussing transition matters, including
periodic meetings to discuss planning and implementation of transition plans,
and (b) reasonably cooperate with the other party to assist in the formulation
of a transition plan in furtherance of the transactions contemplated by the
Transition Services Agreement; _provided_ that Seller and its Affiliates
(including the Company and the Transferred Subsidiaries) shall not be required
to disclose to Purchaser or any of its Affiliates any Trade Secrets and any
other confidential information owned or held by Seller or any of its
Affiliates (including, prior to Closing, the Company and the Transferred
Subsidiaries); _provided_ , _further_ , that implementation of such
transition plan shall commence only following the Closing Date. In furtherance
of the foregoing, Seller Parent shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to,
promptly after the Closing Date, transfer and deliver to the Purchaser (or
otherwise make 

 



-57-  available for Purchaser to copy) all data (including all production
databases, electronic trading records, emails, customer records, Salesforce
data, file shares and electronic documentation (including the Wiki))
primarily used or held for use in, or otherwise necessary for, the businesses
of the Company and the Transferred Subsidiaries; but (i) solely to the extent
that such data is in the possession or control of Seller Parent or any of its
Affiliates (other than the Company or any Transferred Subsidiaries) and (ii)
excluding any accounting and tax records (including Tax returns and related
work pages) and other records to the extent they contain information relating
to the businesses of Seller or its Affiliates (other than accounting and tax
records and other records relating solely to the Company and the Transferred
Subsidiaries). For the avoidance of doubt, Seller may retain such data or
copies thereof to the extent necessary to provide Services (as defined in the
Transition Services Agreement) under the Transition Services Agreement or as
otherwise contemplated by the Transition Services Agreement.

 

7.17. _Intercompany Items_. (a) Except as contemplated by the Transition
Services Agreement or otherwise Previously Disclosed on  _Schedule 7.17_ of
Sellers Disclosure Schedules, Seller shall take, or cause to be taken, all
such actions necessary so that the Intercompany Payables and the Intercompany
Receivables as of the Closing Date shall have been settled or paid in full in
cash (and, to the extent any Intercompany Payables or Intercompany Receivables
are not paid on or prior to Closing, all such unpaid amounts shall be deemed
cancelled effective as of the Closing). At least five (5) Business Days
prior to the Closing, Seller shall prepare and deliver to Purchaser a
statement setting out in reasonable detail the calculation of all such
intercompany account balances based upon the latest available financial
information as of such date and, to the extent requested by Purchaser,
provide Purchaser with supporting documentation to verify the underlying
intercompany charges and transactions. All such intercompany account balances
shall be paid in full in cash prior to the Closing.

 

(b) In addition, Seller shall cause all other agreements, contracts,
arrangements and commitments between or among the Company or any of
the Transferred Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and Seller or any of its
Affiliates (but excluding Company and the Transferred Subsidiaries), on the
other hand, to be terminated effective as of the Closing Date without
continuing liability or obligation of any kind of the Company or any of the
Transferred Subsidiaries, on the one hand, or Seller and its Affiliates (other
than the Company or the Transferred Subsidiaries), on the other hand (other
than any agreement, contract, arrangement or commitment set forth on
_Schedule 7.17_ of Sellers Disclosure Schedules, which shall remain in effect
after the Closing in accordance with its terms), and Seller shall deliver
written evidence of each such termination to Purchaser at or prior to the
Closing.

7.18. _Financing Cooperation_. Prior to Closing, Seller shall use its
reasonable best efforts to, and shall cause its Affiliates and its and their
Representatives to use their reasonable best efforts to reasonably cooperate
in connection with Purchasers arrangement of any debt financing for the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement as may be reasonably requested by
Purchaser at Purchasers sole expense, including (a) participation in a
reasonable number of meetings, presentations, drafting sessions, due diligence
sessions and road shows (it being understood that no participation by any
director of Seller or its Affiliates or any officer of Seller or its
Affiliates (other than officers of the Company and the Transferred
Subsidiaries) shall

 



-58-  be required in any such meetings, presentations, due diligence sessions,
drafting sessions and sessions with prospective lenders in connection with the
Purchaser Financing), (b) as promptly as reasonably practicable, furnishing
Purchaser, its Affiliates and its financing sources (subject to the financing
sources being bound by confidentiality agreements in accordance with customary
market practice) with the financial information required by clause (g) of
Exhibit C of the Financing Commitment as in effect on the date hereof (the "
_Financing Commitment Required Information_ ") and such other information
regarding the Company and the Transferred Subsidiaries customarily included
in information memoranda and other syndication materials for revolving and
term loan facilities but excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any _pro
forma_ financial statements, including providing consolidated
financial statements for the Company and the Transferred Subsidiaries as of
and for the year ended December 31, 2014 no later than February 15, 2015, (c)
reasonably cooperating with the marketing efforts of Purchaser and its
financing sources for any debt to be raised to complete the transactions
contemplated hereby, (d) assisting with the preparation of customary
materials, including information memoranda and packages, lender and investor
presentations, rating agency presentations, and similar documents and
materials, in connection with the financing, (e) facilitating the pledging of
collateral in connection with the Purchaser Financing (which shall only be
effective at or after Closing) and (f) the execution and delivery of any
commitment letters, pledge and security documents, other definitive financing
documents, or other requested certificates of documents in connection with the
Purchaser Financing. None of Seller, its Affiliates or its or
their Representatives shall have any liability or obligation under any
agreement or any document related to Purchasers financing or be required to
take any action in violation or conflict with any applicable Laws, and
Purchaser shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Seller and its
Affiliates, and their respective Representatives, from and against any and all
Losses suffered or incurred by them (including attorneys and other fees and
expenses as incurred) in connection with the performance of its obligations
under this _Section 7.18_ or in connection with the arrangement of the
Purchaser Financing except in the event such Losses arose out of or resulted
from the willful misconduct of any such persons or historical information
relating to the Company or the Transferred Subsidiaries provided in writing by
or on behalf of Seller, the Company or the Transferred Subsidiaries for use in
the Purchaser Financing offering materials, and this indemnification
shall survive termination of this Agreement. Purchaser shall promptly, upon
request by Seller, reimburse Seller for all costs and expenses (including
attorneys fees) incurred by Seller or its Affiliates (including the
documented out-of-pocket Company and the Transferred Subsidiaries) in
connection with the cooperation contemplated by this _Section 7.18_. For the
avoidance of doubt, (x) nothing in this _Section 7.18_ shall require any
cooperation to the extent that it would unreasonably interfere in any
material respect with the business or operations of Seller or its Affiliates
(including the Company and the Transferred Subsidiaries), (y) none of Seller
or its Affiliates (including the Company and the Transferred Subsidiaries)
shall be required to pay any commitment or other similar fee or incur any
other liability or obligation in connection with the Purchaser Financing and
(z) none of Seller or their respective Affiliates (including the Company and
the Transferred Subsidiaries) shall be required to execute or deliver any
document, including any agreement, instrument, guaranty, warranty, indemnity
or certificate, that is not contingent upon the Closing or that would be
effective prior to Closing. All non-public information identified as such
regarding Seller and its Affiliates provided to Purchaser, its Affiliates or
its

 



-59-  Representatives pursuant to this _Section 7.18_ shall be kept confidential
by them in accordance with _Section 7.11_, except for disclosure to potential
lenders or investors as required in connection with the Purchaser Financing
subject to customary confidentiality provisions. For the avoidance of doubt,
Purchasers obtaining of any debt financing shall not be a condition to the
Closing.

 

7.19. _Maintenance of Financing._ (a) Purchaser shall use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain the Purchaser Financing on the terms and conditions
described in the Financing Commitment and, if applicable, any definitive
agreement relating to the Purchaser Financing as promptly as practicable,
including using its reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in effect
the Financing Commitment on the terms and conditions (including the flex
provisions) contained therein, (ii) enter into definitive agreements with
respect thereto on the terms and conditions (including the flex provisions)
contemplated by the Financing Commitment or on other terms that would not (A)
reduce the aggregate amount of the Purchaser Financing (including by changing
the amount of fees to be paid or original issue discount of the Purchaser
Financing) or (B) impose new or additional conditions, or otherwise amend,
modify or expand any conditions, to the receipt of the Purchaser Financing, in
each case in a manner that could reasonably be expected to impair Purchasers
ability to perform its obligations under this Agreement and the Transition
Services Agreement in any material respect, (iii) satisfy on a timely basis
all conditions applicable to Purchaser in such definitive agreements that are
within its control, and (iv) comply with its obligations under the Financing
Commitment and the definitive agreements with respect thereto. Purchaser shall
use its reasonable best efforts to cause the lenders and the other persons
providing such Purchaser Financing to fund the Purchaser Financing required
to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Transition Services Agreement on the Closing Date. In the event any portion of
the Purchaser Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and
conditions (including the flex portions) contemplated in the Financing
Commitment or the definitive agreements with respect thereto, Purchaser shall
promptly notify Seller and, as promptly as practicable following the
occurrence of such event, use its reasonable best efforts to obtain
alternative financing from the same or alternative sources on terms and
conditions not materially less favorable, taken as a whole, to Purchaser
(taking into account the flex provisions as set forth in the
Financing Commitment), in an amount sufficient to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Transition Services Agreement as
promptly as possible. Any such alternative financing shall constitute
Purchaser Financing and any commitment received by Purchaser in connection
with such alternative financing shall constitute a Financing Commitment.

(b) Purchaser shall not agree to any amendments or modifications to, or grant
any waivers of, any condition or other material provision under the Financing
Commitment or the definitive agreements with respect thereto without the
consent of Seller if such amendments, modifications or waivers, in each case
that could reasonably be expected to impair the Purchasers ability to perform
its obligations under this Agreement and the Transition Services Agreement in
any material respect. Purchaser shall provide Seller notice of any such
amendment promptly and, upon Sellers written request, Purchaser shall provide
Seller with a copy thereof.

 



-60- (c) Purchaser shall provide to Seller copies of all executed definitive
documents related to the Purchaser Financing. Purchaser shall give Seller
prompt notice: (i) of any material breach or default (in the case of a
material breach or default by a party other than Purchaser and its Affiliates,
to Purchasers Knowledge) in respect of the Purchaser Financing and (ii) of
the receipt by Purchaser of any notice or other communication from any party
to the Financing Commitment with respect to any material breach, default,
termination or repudiation by any party to any Financing Commitment or any
definitive document related to the Purchaser Financing or any provisions of
the Financing Commitment or any definitive document related to the Purchaser
Financing.

 

7.20. _Resignations_. At or prior to the Closing Date, Seller will deliver to
Purchaser the resignations of all officers and directors of the Company and
each Transferred Subsidiary who are not Company Employees from their positions
with the Company or such Transferred Subsidiary effective as of the Closing
Date.

-62- ARTICLE 9

 

TAX MATTERS

9.1. _Tax Covenants_. (a) _Seller s Liability for Taxes_. Seller shall be
liable for and indemnify Purchaser Indemnified Parties for (i) all Taxes
imposed on the Company or the Transferred Subsidiaries or for which the
Company or the Transferred Subsidiaries are otherwise liable for any Pre-
Closing Tax Period, (ii) all Taxes of any person other than the Company or the
Transferred Subsidiaries for which the Company or the Transferred Subsidiaries
are liable (A) under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 or any similar
provision of state, local or foreign Law as a result of being or having been
before the Closing a member of an affiliated, consolidated, combined or
unitary group or (B) as a result of being or having been before the Closing a
party to any Tax Sharing Agreement, (iii) any Losses that are incurred as a
result of a breach of any representation or warranty contained in _Section
4.14_ , and (iv) any Losses that are incurred as a result of a breach of any
covenant of the Company or Seller contained in _Section 7.1_ and _Section
7.2(i)_ or this _Article 9_ ; _provided_ , _however_ , that Seller shall have
no liability for any Taxes or Losses described in clauses (i) through (iv) to
the extent that (x) such Taxes or Losses were reflected as a liability in the
calculation of Closing Net Working Capital or (y) in the case of any Taxes
described in clause (iii), such Taxes or Losses relate to any Post-Closing
Tax Period, other than any Taxes or Losses resulting from a breach of the
representations and warranties of _Sections 4.14(e)_ , _(h)_ , _(j)_ and
_(l)_. Seller shall pay to Purchaser the Taxes for which Seller is liable
pursuant to this _Section 9.1(a)_ but which are payable with Tax Returns to
be filed by Purchaser pursuant to _Section 9.1(e)_ within ten (10)
days prior to the due date for the filing of such Tax Returns, except as
otherwise provided by this _Article 9_.

(b) _Tax Refunds_. Seller shall be entitled to any refund in the form of cash
received by the Company or a Transferred Subsidiary or direct credits against
Taxes otherwise payable by the Company or a Transferred Subsidiary with
respect to Taxes of the Company or a Transferred Subsidiary for any Pre-
Closing Tax Period (other than any such refund that was reflected in the
calculation of Closing Net Working Capital and, for the avoidance of doubt,
Purchaser, the Company or their Subsidiaries shall not be required to pay or
cause to be paid to Seller pursuant to this _Section 9.1(b)_ any refund or
credit to the extent such refund or credit reduced other amounts with respect
to which Seller would have been obligated to pay to a Purchaser Indemnified
Party pursuant to _Section 9.1(a)_ but for such refund or credit). After
receipt by Purchaser, the Company or any of their Subsidiaries of any such Tax
refund, or after the filing of a Tax Return on which the Taxes payable
for which Purchaser, the Company or any of their Subsidiaries would otherwise
be liable is reduced as a result of such Tax credit to which Seller is
entitled, Purchaser or the Company shall, or shall cause the applicable
Subsidiary to, deliver and pay over, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds, such Tax refunds to Seller. At the request of Seller,
Purchaser will, and will cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to, execute
such documents and take any other reasonable actions as may be necessary for
Purchaser, the Company and their Subsidiaries to obtain Tax refunds for which
any such Person is eligible and to which Seller is entitled pursuant to this
_Section 9.1(b)_ and Seller shall reimburse Purchaser, the Company and their
Subsidiaries for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection
therewith. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any such

 



-63-  Tax refunds shall be for the account of Purchaser, the Company and their
Subsidiaries to the extent that such Tax refund is attributable to the
carryback from any Post-Closing Tax Period of items of loss, deductions or
other Tax items of the Purchaser, the Company and their Subsidiaries.

(c) _Purchaser s Liability for Taxes_. Purchaser shall be liable for and
indemnify Seller for the Taxes of the Company and the Transferred Subsidiaries
for any Post-Closing Tax Period. For the avoidance of doubt, Purchaser shall
be entitled to any refund of Taxes of the Company received for such periods.

(d) _Taxes for Short Taxable Year._ For purposes of paragraphs (a) and (c) of
this  _Section 9.1_, whenever it is necessary to determine the liability for
Taxes (other than Transfer Taxes) of the Company or the Transferred
Subsidiaries for a Straddle Period, the portion of such Tax related to the
portion of such Tax period ending on and including the Closing Date (i) in
the case of any Taxes other than (A) gross receipts, sales or use Taxes and
(B) Taxes based upon or related to income, shall be deemed to be the amount of
such Tax for the entire Tax period _multiplied_ by a fraction the numerator
of which is the number of days in the Tax period ending on and including the
Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of days in the entire
Tax period, and (ii) in the case of any Tax based upon or related to income
and any gross receipts, sales or use Tax, shall equal the portion of such Tax
that would have been payable if the relevant Tax period ended on and included
the Closing Date. All determinations necessary to give effect to the
allocation set forth in the foregoing sentence shall be made in a manner
consistent with prior practice of the Company or the Transferred Subsidiaries.

 

(e) _Tax Returns_.

 

(i) Seller shall file or cause to be filed when due (including all applicable
extensions of the time to pay) all Tax Returns that are required to be filed
by or with respect to the Company and the Transferred Subsidiaries on or
before the Closing Date and shall pay any Taxes due in respect of such Tax
Returns, and Purchaser shall file or cause to be filed when due all
Tax Returns that are required to be filed by or with respect to the Company
and the Transferred Subsidiaries after the Closing Date (other than income Tax
Returns with respect to periods for which a consolidated, unitary or combined
income Tax Return of Seller includes the operations of the Company and the
Transferred Subsidiaries, which shall be filed by Seller) and shall pay any
Taxes due in respect of such Tax Returns (it being understood that Seller
shall be obligated to reimburse and indemnify Purchaser with respect to the
Taxes described in _Section 9.1(a)(i)_).

(ii) Any Tax Return of the Company or either of the Transferred Subsidiaries
(for the avoidance of doubt, other than a consolidated, unitary or combined
income Tax Return of Seller) which is to be prepared by one party but which
(A) could reasonably be expected to result in an indemnity obligation of the
other party under _Section 9.1(a)_ or _Section 9.1(c)_ or (B) relates to a
Straddle

 



-64-  Period, shall be provided to the other party for its review, reasonable
comment, and consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld) at least
thirty (30) days prior to filing.

 

(f) _Treatment of Payments for Tax Purposes._ Seller, Purchaser, the Company
and the Transferred Subsidiaries shall treat any and all payments under this
_Article 9_ and _Section 10.2_ as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for Tax
purposes unless they are required to treat such payments otherwise by
applicable Law.

 

(g) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the provisions of
this _Section 9.1_ , and not the provisions of _Article 10_ shall govern
indemnity claims with respect to Losses that relate to Taxes; _provided,
however_ , that, _Section 10.1_ shall apply for purposes of _Section
9.1(a)(iii)_ and _Section 10.4_ (other than  _Section 10.4(a)_ or _10.4(b)_
) shall apply to indemnity claims with respect to Losses that relate to Taxes
_mutatis mutandis_.

 

9.2. _Contest Provisions_. (a) Each party agrees to give prompt notice to the
other party of any claim for Taxes or the commencement of any suit, action or
proceeding (including Tax audits) (a " _Tax Claim_ ") in respect of which
indemnity may be sought under _Section 9.1(a)_ or _9.1(c_ ) (specifying with
reasonable detail the basis therefor). No failure or delay in providing
notice hereunder shall relieve either party of its obligations hereunder,
except to the extent it is actually prejudiced by such delay or failure.

 

(b) Other than with respect to a Tax Claim in respect of Taxes relating to a
Straddle Period that is governed by  _Section 9.2(c)_, the Indemnifying
Person may, at its own expense, (i) participate in any Tax Claim and (ii) with
respect to any Tax Claim that relates solely to indemnified Taxes where Seller
is the Indemnifying Person or solely to indemnified Taxes where Purchaser is
the Indemnifying Person, as the case may be, assume the defense of any such
Tax Claim; provided that in the event that the Tax Indemnifying Party assumes
the defense of a Tax Claim pursuant to clause (ii) of this paragraph, (A) the
Tax Indemnified Party shall have the right (but not the duty) to participate
in the defense thereof and to employ counsel, at its own expense (which, for
the avoidance of doubt, the costs of such voluntary participation will not
give rise to any indemnity under _Section 9.1(a)_ or _9.1(b_ )), separate
from the counsel employed by the Tax Indemnifying Party, (B) the Tax
Indemnifying Party shall keep the Tax Indemnified Party reasonably informed
regarding the status of such Tax Claim and consult with the Tax Indemnified
Party upon the Tax Indemnified Partys reasonable request for such
consultation with respect to such Tax Claim, and (C) the Tax
Indemnifying Party shall not, without the Tax Indemnified Partys consent,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, agree to any
settlement of such Tax Claim. Whether or not the Tax Indemnifying Party
chooses to defend or prosecute any claim, all of the parties hereto shall
cooperate in the defense or prosecution thereof and the Tax Indemnified Party
shall not settle or make payment on account of any Tax Claim in respect of
which indemnity may be sought without the consent of the Tax Indemnifying
Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

 



-65- (c) With respect to a Tax Claim in respect of Taxes relating to a Straddle
Period, Purchaser and Seller shall, in good faith, jointly control the
defense of such Tax Claim with respect to any item that relates to both a Pre-
Closing Tax Period and a Post-Closing Tax Period; provided, however, that (i)
control over any claims with respect to any item that relates solely to a
Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be governed by the provisions of this _Section
9.2(c)_ and (ii) Purchaser shall control any claims with respect to an item
that relates solely to a Post-Closing Tax Period.

(d) To the extent that there is an inconsistency between this _Section 9.2_
and _Section 10.3_, the provisions of this _Section 9.2_ shall govern.

9.3. _Tax Sharing Payments_. (a)(i) (A) Within thirty (30) days after each of
the first (1st) three (3) anniversaries of the Closing Date, Purchaser shall
pay to Seller an amount equal to the Target Pre-Option Annual Tax Sharing
Amount.

 

(B) Within ninety (90) days after the filing of the Tax Return for the
Purchaser Consolidated Group with respect to a Pre-Option Taxable Year,
Purchaser shall provide a written statement to Seller setting forth the amount
of True-Up Tax Benefit Amount with respect to such Pre-Option Taxable Year. If
the True-Up Tax Benefit Amount with respect to such Pre-Option Taxable Year
is greater than zero (0), within fourteen (14) days of providing Seller with
the written statement, Purchaser shall pay to Seller an amount equal to such
True-Up Tax Benefit Amount _multiplied_ by the Tax Benefits Sharing Percentage
with respect to such Pre-Option Taxable Year. If the True-Up Tax Benefit
Amount with respect to such Pre-Option Taxable Year is less than zero (0),
within fourteen (14) days after Purchaser provides Seller with the written
statement from Purchaser, Seller shall pay to Purchaser an amount equal to
the absolute value of such True-Up Tax Benefit Amount _multiplied_ by the Tax
Benefits Sharing Percentage with respect to such Pre-Option Taxable Year.

 

(C) Within five (5) days after the day on which a payment is made pursuant to
clause (i)(B) or clause (ii) of this  _Section 9.3(a)_ with respect to a
Post-Closing Taxable Year (such Post-Closing Taxable Year, the " _Payment
Year_ "), if (I) the aggregate amount of the Allocable Target Pre-Option
Period Tax Sharing Amounts with respect to (x) all Pre-Option Taxable Years
prior to the Payment Year and (y) if the Payment Year is a Pre-Option Taxable
Year, the Payment Year (the Pre-Option Taxable Years described in (x) and (y)
together, the " _Catch-Up Years_ ") is greater than (II) the Tax Sharing
Payment previously made with respect to the Catch-Up Years (the difference
between the amount described in (I) and (II), the " _Catch-Up Amount_ "),
Purchaser shall pay to Seller an amount equal to the difference, if any, of (
_u_ ) the Transaction Structure Tax Benefits with respect to the Catch-Up
Years and ( _v_ ) the Tax Sharing Payments previously made with respect to the
Catch-Up Years;  _provided_ that Purchaser shall only be required to make
payments pursuant to this clause (C) until the aggregate amount paid to Seller
pursuant to this clause (C) is equal to the Catch-Up Amount; _provided_
_further_ that if Purchaser becomes obligated hereunder to make the Tax
Sharing Option Payment, Purchaser shall not be required thereafter to make any
payment pursuant to this clause (C).

 



-66-  (ii) Within ninety (90) days after the filing of the Tax Return for the
Purchaser Consolidated Group with respect to a Post-Option Taxable Year,
Purchaser shall pay to Seller an amount equal to the applicable Tax Benefits
Sharing Percentage of the Transaction Structure Tax Benefits with respect to
such Post-Option Taxable Year, as reflected on such Tax Return.

 

(iii) If, following the filing of an amended Tax Return or a Final
Determination, the Transaction Structure Tax Benefits for a Post-Closing
Taxable Year is increased, subsequent Tax Sharing Payments shall be increased
by an amount equal to (x) the applicable Tax Benefits Sharing Percentage of
the Transaction Structure Tax Benefits with respect to such Post-Closing
Taxable Year, as reflected on such amended Tax Return or as adjusted pursuant
to such Final Determination, _minus_ (y) the Tax Sharing Payment made with
respect to such Post-Closing Taxable Year; _provided_ , _however_ , that if,
at the time of the increase described in this clause (iii), Purchaser has
previously paid an amount to Seller in respect of a Catch-Up Amount
attributable to a Pre-Option Taxable Year, Purchaser shall not be required to
make a payment to Seller pursuant to this clause (iii) until Purchaser has
retained a cumulative amount otherwise payable pursuant to this clause (iii)
with respect to such Pre-Option Taxable Year, such that, after taking into
account the amounts retained by Purchaser pursuant to this proviso and the
amounts paid to Seller in respect of Catch-Up Amounts pursuant to clause
(i)(C) of _Section 9.3(a)_, Seller has received no more than its Tax Benefits
Sharing Percentage of the Transaction Structure Tax Benefits for the relevant
Pre-Option Taxable Year.

(iv) If, following the filing of an amended Tax Return or a Final
Determination, the Transaction Structure Tax Benefits for a Post-Closing
Taxable Year is decreased, subsequent Tax Sharing Payments shall be decreased
by an amount equal to (x) the Tax Sharing Payment made with respect to such
Post-Closing Taxable Year, _minus_ (y) the applicable Tax Benefits Sharing
Percentage of the Transaction Structure Tax Benefits with respect to such
Post-Closing Taxable Year, as reflected on such amended Tax Return or as
adjusted pursuant to such Final Determination (" _Excess Payment_ ");
_provided_ that if the aggregate amount of subsequent Tax Sharing Payments as
of the fifteenth (15th) anniversary of the Closing Date is less than such
Excess Payment, then, no later than fourteen (14) days after Purchaser
provides Seller with notice of such amount, Seller shall make a payment to
Purchaser in an amount equal to the difference between such Excess Payment and
the total amount that was subtracted from subsequent Tax Sharing Payments; 
_provided_ _further_ that if an amended Tax Return is filed, or a Final
Determination occurs, after the last Tax Sharing Payment is made by Purchaser
pursuant to clause (i) or (ii) of _Section 9.3(a)_ , and as a result there is
an Excess Payment, Seller shall make a payment to Purchaser in an amount equal
to such Excess Payment no later than fourteen (14) days after Purchaser
provides Seller with notice of such Excess Payment. If an adjustment is made
pursuant to this clause (iv) reducing the Transaction Structure Tax Benefits
with respect to any Post-Closing Taxable Year and a Catch-Up Amount was
previously made pursuant to clause (i)(C) of _Section 9.3(a)_ ,
notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller shall make a payment to Purchaser equal
to the difference between ( _p_ ) the aggregate amount of Tax Sharing Payments
previously made and ( _q_ ) the aggregate amount of Tax Sharing Payments that
would have been made pursuant to this _Section 9.3(a)_ had the adjustment
pursuant to clause (iv) of this _Section 9.3(a)_ been reflected in the
originally filed Tax Return of the Purchaser Consolidated Group, no later than
fourteen (14) days after Purchaser provides Seller with a written notice.

 



-67- (b) Seller shall have the right, exercisable upon written notice to Purchaser,
within thirty (30) days after the third (3rd) anniversary of the Closing
Date, to require Purchaser to make a one-time cash payment to Seller equal to
the Tax Sharing Option Payment Amount, which payment shall be made by
Purchaser by the last day of the calendar month following Purchasers receipt
of such written notice (such payment, the " _Tax Sharing Option Payment_ ");
_provided_ , however, that if a Tax Sharing Acceleration Event occurs, Seller
shall be deemed to have delivered such written notice to Purchaser and the
Tax Sharing Option Payment shall immediately become due and payable. In the
event that Seller fails to deliver such a notice, Purchaser shall have the
right to provide Seller with a written notice, within fourteen (14) days
after the expiration of the period during which Seller is entitled to deliver
a written notice, that Purchaser elects to make the Tax Sharing Option
Payment. If Purchaser becomes obligated hereunder to make the Tax Sharing
Option Payment, Purchaser shall not have any obligations under clause (ii) of
_Section 9.3(a)_ with respect to any Post-Option Taxable Year and no
adjustment to the Tax Sharing Payment that would otherwise be required under
clause (iii) or (iv) of _Section 9.3(a)_ shall be required to be made by
either party.

(c) All payments pursuant to this  _Section 9.3(a)_ (other than amounts
treated as interest for U.S. federal income tax purposes) will be treated as
subsequent purchase price adjustments that give rise to further Transaction
Structure Tax Benefits in the year of payment and, as a result, shall be
reflected in the calculation of Transaction Structure Tax Benefits for the
current and subsequent Post-Closing Taxable Years. For the avoidance of doubt,
any basis adjustment (or any amount treated as interest for U.S.
federal, state or local income tax purposes) as a result of the Tax Sharing
Option Payment shall not be reflected in any Transaction Structure Tax
Benefits for any period or result in any payment obligation under this
_Section 9.3_.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if the Trigger
Event has occurred, Purchaser shall have no obligation to make any payment
pursuant to this Section 9.3 other than the Tax Sharing Option Payment.

(e) In the event that any payment required to be made by Purchaser or Seller
under this _Section 9.3_ is made after the date on which such payment is
required to be made under this _Section 9.3_ , interest will accrue on such
amount from (but not including) the due date of the payment pursuant to this
_Section 9.3_ to (and including) the date such payment is actually made at the
rate equal to ten percent (10%), compounded on a daily basis.

 

(f) During any portion of the Measurement Period that occurs after the Closing
Date, Purchaser shall operate the business of Hotspot FX in commercially
reasonable fashion, and shall not permit the Company or any Transferred
Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly take any action that is intended to
artificially decrease the notional amounts traded on Hotspot FX.

 

(g) During any portion of the Measurement Period that occurs prior to the
Closing Date, without limiting Sellers obligations to operate the business
of Hotspot FX in the ordinary course of business pursuant to _Section 7.2_ and
otherwise in accordance with the terms of Article _7_ , Seller shall not, and
shall not permit the Company or any Transferred Subsidiary to, directly or
indirectly take any action that is principally intended to artificially
increase the notional amounts traded on Hotspot FX.

 



-68- (h) (i) No later than forty-five (45) days prior to the due date (taking into
account extensions) of the U.S. federal income Tax Return of the Purchaser
Consolidated Group with respect to a Post-Closing Taxable Year, Purchaser
shall provide Seller a copy of the portions of the draft of such Tax Return
that could reasonably be expected to impact the amount of the Transaction
Structure Tax Benefits with respect to such Post-Closing Taxable Year for
Sellers review and comment. No later than fifteen (15) days thereafter,
Seller shall provide Purchaser with any comments that Seller may have with
respect to such Tax Return, which comments Purchaser shall consider in good
faith. For the avoidance of doubt, Purchaser shall retain the ultimate
discretion as to the preparation and filing of such Tax Return. 

(ii) In the event that Purchaser becomes aware of a fact that could reasonably
be expected to give rise to an adjustment under _Section 9.3(a)(iii)_ or
_Section 9.3(a)(iv)_ , Purchaser shall promptly notify Seller of such facts,
shall keep Seller reasonably informed as to developments relating to such
matter, consult with Seller in good faith with respect to such matter
and consider in good faith any comments made by Seller in connection
therewith. For the avoidance of doubt, Purchaser shall retain the ultimate
discretion with respect to the matter potentially giving rise to an adjustment
under _Section 9.3(a)(iii)_ or _Section 9.3(a)(iv)_ , including the decision
to settle a tax audit or other controversy or file an amended Tax Return.

 

(iii) Purchaser shall have no further obligations, and Seller shall have no
further rights, under this _Section 9.3(h)_ after the date on which Purchaser
makes the Tax Sharing Option Payment.

9.4. _Termination of Tax Allocation Agreements_. Any tax allocation or
sharing agreement or arrangement, whether or not written, that may have been
entered into by Seller or any of its Affiliates on the one hand, and the
Company or the Transferred Subsidiaries, on the other hand, shall be
terminated as to the Company and the Transferred Subsidiaries as of the
Closing Date, and no payments which are owed by or to the Company and the
Transferred Subsidiaries pursuant thereto shall be made thereunder. From and
after the Closing Date, this Agreement shall be the sole Tax allocation or
sharing agreement or arrangement relating to the Company or the Transferred
Subsidiaries for all Pre-Closing Tax Periods.

 

9.5. _C_ _ooperation_. Seller and Purchaser shall cooperate in good faith, and
shall cause their respective Affiliates, officers, employees, agents,
auditors and Representatives to cooperate in good faith, in connection with
(i) the preparation and filing of all Tax Returns relating to the Company and
the Transferred Subsidiaries, (ii) the determination of Seller, Purchaser or
their respective Affiliates, as the case may be, of any liability for any
Taxes relating to the Company or the Transferred Subsidiaries, (iii) any
audit, dispute or other examination or assessment by any Tax Authority with
respect to such Taxes, or (iv) any judicial or administrative proceeding
relating to liability for such Taxes. Purchaser and Seller agree to use
commercially reasonable efforts to retain or cause to be retained all books
and records with respect to Taxes relating to the Company and the Transferred
Subsidiaries until the applicable

 



-69-  period for assessment under applicable Law (giving effect to all extensions
or waivers) has expired, and to use commercially reasonable efforts to abide
by or cause the abidance with all record retention agreements entered into
with any Tax Authority. Purchaser and Seller shall cooperate with each other
in the conduct of any audit or other proceedings involving the Company or the
Transferred Subsidiaries for any Tax purposes and each shall execute and
deliver such powers of attorney and other documents as are necessary to carry
out the intent of this _Section 9.5_.

 

9.6. _Transfer Taxes_. All excise, sales, use, value added, transfer
(including real property transfer), stamp, documentary, filing, recordation
and other similar taxes, together with any interest, additions or penalties
with respect thereto and any interest in respect of such additions or
penalties, resulting directly from the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (the " _Transfer Taxes_ "), shall be equally apportioned between
the Seller, on the one hand, and Purchaser, on the other hand. Notwithstanding
_Section 9.1(e)_, which shall not apply to Tax Returns relating to Transfer
Taxes, any Tax Returns that must be filed in connection with Transfer Taxes
shall be prepared and filed when due by such party as required by applicable
Law and, if required by applicable Law, the other party shall join in the
execution of any such Tax Returns.

the provisions of this _Article 9_ shall survive for the full period of all
applicable statutes of limitations (giving effect to any waiver, mitigation or
extension thereof).

 

ARTICLE 10

SURVIVAL; INDEMNIFICATION

10.1. _Survival_. All of the representations and warranties of Seller and
Purchaser contained in this Agreement shall survive the Closing until the
second (2nd) anniversary of the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the representations and warranties contained in _Section 4.1_ , _Section 4.3_
, _Section 4.4_ , _Section 4.14_ , _Section 5.1_ , _Section 5.2_ , _Section
5.4_ , _Section 5.5_ , _Section 6.1_ , _Section 6.3_, _Section 6.4_ ,
_Section 6.6_ and _Section 6.9_ (collectively, the "
_Fundamental Representations_ ") shall survive until the expiration of the
applicable statute of limitations thereof, except that the representations and
warranties in _Section 4.14_ shall survive until thirty (30) days following
the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations thereof; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that the representations and warranties in _Section 4.15(b)_ and,
solely with respect to Intellectual Property, _Section 4.5_ , shall be limited
to Sellers Knowledge during the period between the first (1st) anniversary
of the Closing Date and the second (2nd) anniversary of the Closing Date.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any bona fide notice given prior to such
applicable expiration date claiming an alleged breach of any representation
or warranty under this Agreement shall without further action extend the
survival period for the representation or warranty alleged to have been
breached as applied to the circumstances set forth in such notice until
immediately after the final resolution of the matter. All covenants and other
agreements contained in this Agreement that by their terms contemplate
performance after the Closing Date shall survive the Closing in accordance
with their terms, and breaches of all covenants and other agreements contained
in this Agreement shall survive indefinitely or until the latest date
permitted by Law.

 



-70- 10.2. _Indemnification_. (a) Subject to the limitations contained in this
_Article 10_ , Seller agrees to indemnify Purchaser, its Affiliates
(including the Company and the Transferred Subsidiaries after the Closing
Date) and their respective Representatives (collectively, the " _Purchaser
Indemnified Parties_ ") for all Losses actually incurred or sustained by any
of them or to which any of them may become subject arising out of or relating
to (i) any breach of or inaccuracy in the representations or warranties of
Seller contained in this Agreement (in all cases, other than the
representation and warranty made in the first sentence of _Section 4.12_,
without giving effect to any materiality, Company Material Adverse Effect or
similar qualifications thereto), (ii) any breach of any covenant or agreement
of Seller contained in this Agreement, (iii) service providers of Seller,
Seller Parent or any of their respective Affiliates who are not Company
Employees and Seller Benefit Plans that are not listed on _Schedule 7.6(c)_
of Sellers Disclosure Schedules (it being understood that nothing in this
_Section 10.2(a)(iii)_ shall be construed as restricting or limiting the
obligations of Purchaser or one of its Affiliates to Continuing Employees
under  _Section 7.6_ of this Agreement) and (iv) the matters listed on
_Schedule 10.2(a)(iv)_ of Sellers Disclosure Schedules.

 

(b) Subject to the limitations contained in this _Article 10_ , Purchaser
agrees to indemnify Seller, its Affiliates and their
respective Representatives (collectively, the " _Seller Indemnified Parties_
") for all Losses actually incurred or sustained by any of them or to which
any of them may become subject resulting from or arising out of or relating to
(i) any breach of or inaccuracy in the representations or warranties of
Purchaser contained in this Agreement (in all cases without giving effect to
any materiality, Purchaser Material Adverse Effect or similar qualifications
thereto) or (ii) any breach of any covenant or agreement of Purchaser
contained in this Agreement.

10.3. _Claims for Indemnification_. (a) _Notice of Claim_. Any Person who is
claiming indemnification pursuant to the provisions of _Section 10.2_ (the "
_Indemnified Person_ ") shall deliver prompt written notification in
accordance with _Section 12.1_ to the Person to provide indemnification under
this Agreement (the " _Indemnifying Person_ ") of each such claim for
indemnification by specifying in reasonable detail the material facts known to
such Indemnified Person constituting the basis for, and the amount (if known)
of (including the basis of calculation of such amount), the claim asserted (a
" _Claim Notice_ "). Such written notice shall be accompanied by a copy of all
papers served, if any, relating to the claim. Failure of the Indemnified
Person to give such notice promptly after becoming aware of such claim or to
give such notice in such form shall not relieve the Indemnifying Person from
its obligations under this Agreement except to the extent that
the Indemnifying Person is actually prejudiced by such failure.

 



-71- (b) _Defense and Settlement of Third-Party Claims_. To the extent a claim
for indemnification results from a Third-Party Claim:

(i) The Indemnifying Person shall have thirty (30) days (or such lesser
number of days set forth in the Claim Notice as may be required by court
proceedings in the event of a litigated matter) after receipt of the Claim
Notice (the " _Notice Period_ ") to notify the Indemnified Person that it
desires to assume the defense of the Indemnified Person against such Third-
Party Claim. In the event that the Indemnifying Person notifies the
Indemnified Person within the Notice Period that it desires to defend the
Indemnified Person against a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Person shall
have the right to defend the Indemnified Person by appropriate proceedings and
shall have the sole power to direct and control such defense at its expense;
_provided_ that the Indemnifying Person shall not have the right to assume,
direct or control the defense of the Indemnified Person if the Third-Party
Claim seeks material non-monetary, equitable or injunctive relief or alleges
violation of criminal law or if the Indemnifying Person has failed or is
failing to prosecute or defend the Third-Party Claim. Once the Indemnifying
Person has duly assumed the defense of such Third-Party Claim, the Indemnified
Person shall have the right, but not the obligation, to participate in any
such defense and to employ separate counsel of its choosing. The Indemnified
Person shall participate in any such defense at its expense (which expense
shall not constitute a Loss from and after the date the Indemnifying Person
has validly assumed the defense of such claim) unless the Indemnifying Person
and the Indemnified Person are both named parties to the proceedings or the
Indemnified Person shall have reasonably concluded, based on the written
advice of counsel, that representation of both parties by the same counsel
would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing material interests
between them. The Indemnifying Person shall not, without the prior written
consent of the Indemnified Person, settle, compromise or offer to settle
or compromise any Third-Party Claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such
prior written consent of the Indemnified Person shall be required to any
proposed settlement that involves only the payment of money by the
Indemnifying Person, includes as an unconditional term thereof the granting
by the person asserting such claim or bringing such action of an unconditional
release from liability to all Indemnified Persons with respect to such claim
and does not include any admission of culpability by the Indemnified Persons.

(ii) If the Indemnifying Person is not permitted to or elects not to defend
the Indemnified Person against such Third-Party Claim, whether by not giving
the Indemnified Person timely notice of its desire to so defend or otherwise,
the Indemnified Person shall have the right but not the obligation to assume
its own defense;  _it_ _being_ _understood_ that the Indemnified Persons
right to indemnification for a Third-Party Claim shall not be adversely
affected by assuming the defense of such Third-Party Claim. The Indemnified
Person shall not (A) settle a Third-Party Claim or (B) make an external
communication

 



-72-  intended for dissemination or to reach members of the public regarding the
settlement of a Third-Party Claim, in each case without the consent of the
Indemnifying Person (which shall not be unreasonably withheld) and, if
applicable in the case of clause (A), its respective insurer.

(iii) Each party shall cooperate with the other in order to ensure the proper
and adequate defense of any such Third-Party Claim, including by providing
reasonable access to each others relevant business records, other documents
and employees and by using its reasonable efforts to, and causing the
Indemnified Person and its Affiliates to use their reasonable efforts to, (A)
preserve all material evidence relevant to the claim, (B) allow the
Indemnifying Person and its advisors to investigate the fact, matter, event
or circumstance alleged to give rise to such claim and whether and to what
extent any amount is payable in respect of such claim, and (C) disclose to the
Indemnifying Person and its Representatives all material of which it is aware
which relates to the claim and provide, and procure that its Affiliates
provide, all such information and assistance, including access to premises and
personnel, and the right to examine and copy or photograph any assets,
accounts, documents and records, as the Indemnifying Person or its
Representatives may reasonably request, subject to the Indemnifying Person and
its advisers agreeing in such form as the Indemnified Person may reasonably
require to keep all such information confidential and to use it only for the
purpose of investigating and defending the claim in question. The Indemnified
Person agrees to make its employees reasonably available to participate in the
defense of any Third-Party Claim at the Indemnifying Persons reasonable
expense.

(c) _Direct Claims_. If an Indemnified Person delivers a Claim Notice with
respect to any claim that does not result from a Third-Party Claim, both the
Indemnified Person and the Indemnifying Person shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cooperate and arrive at a mutually acceptable resolution
of such claim within the next thirty (30) days. If a mutually acceptable
resolution cannot be reached between the Indemnified Person and the
Indemnifying Person within such thirty (30) day period, the parties may
thereupon proceed to pursue any and all available remedies at law.

10.4. _Indemnification Limitations_.

 

(a) _Indemnification of Purchaser_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, with respect to claims for indemnification pursuant to
_Section 10.2(a)(i)_ (other than with respect to any Fundamental
Representations): (i) Seller shall not be liable to the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties for Losses under _Section 10.2(a)(i)_ until the aggregate amount of
Losses (excluding any De Minimis Losses), exceeds the Indemnity Threshold
Amount, after which the Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to
receive the amount of any such Losses in excess of the Indemnity Threshold
Amount; (ii) the aggregate amount of Losses for which the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to receive any payment from Seller or
Sellers Affiliates shall not exceed the Indemnity Cap; and (iii) no

 



-73-  payment for any Loss under _Section 10.2(a)(i)_ shall be made on account of
De Minimis Losses; _provided_ that under each of clauses (i), (ii) and (iii)
of this _Section 10.4(a)_ , the amount of any Loss shall be calculated in
accordance with the other provisions of this _Section 10.4_.

(b)  _Indemnification of Seller_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, with respect to claims for indemnification pursuant to
_Section 10.2(b)(i)_ (other than with respect to any Fundamental
Representations): (i) Purchaser shall not be liable to the Seller Indemnified
Parties for Losses under _Section 10.2(b)(i)_ until the aggregate amount of
Losses, excluding any De Minimis Losses (as calculated in accordance with
this  _Section 10.4(b)_), with respect to such matters exceeds the Indemnity
Threshold Amount, after which the Seller Indemnified Parties shall be entitled
to receive the amount of any such Losses in excess of the Indemnity Threshold
Amount; (ii) the aggregate amount of Losses under _Section 10.2(b)(i)_ for
which the Seller Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to receive any payment
from Purchaser shall not exceed the Indemnity Cap; and (iii) no payment for
any Loss shall be made on account of De Minimis Losses; _provided_ that in
each case (i), (ii) and (iii), the amount of any Loss shall be calculated in
accordance with the other provisions of this _Section 10.4_.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no Person
shall be liable under this _Article 10_ for any consequential, special,
exemplary or punitive damages, except (i) to the extent awarded in a Final
Determination in connection with a Third-Party Claim, or (ii) for any
consequential damages or losses that are reasonably foreseeable.

 

(d) Each Indemnified Person shall be obligated in connection with any claim
for indemnification under this _Article 10_ to use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain any insurance proceeds available to such Indemnified Person
with regard to the applicable claims. The amount of any Losses sustained by
the Purchaser Indemnified Parties or the Seller Indemnified Parties shall be
reduced by (i) any amount received by the Purchaser Indemnified Parties or the
Seller Indemnified Parties, as the case may be, with respect to such Losses
under any insurance coverage (net of any reasonable costs in connection
with such recovery) or from any other party alleged to be responsible
therefor ( _it_ _being_ _understood_ that, subject to _Section 10.4(f)_ ,
nothing in this _Section 10.4(d)_ shall require any Purchaser Indemnified
Party or any Seller Indemnified Party to pursue any Action against any such
other party alleged to be responsible) and (ii) any net Tax benefit actually
realized by the Purchaser Indemnified Parties or the Seller Indemnified
Parties, as the case may be, with respect to such Losses through a reduction
in Taxes otherwise due. The amount of any Losses sustained by the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties or the Seller Indemnified Parties shall be increased by
the amount of any Tax imposed on the receipt of any indemnity payment with
respect to any such Losses.

(e) Subject to the other provisions of this _Article 10_ , each
Indemnified Person shall act in good faith regarding the conduct of any
proceedings or the taking of any action for which indemnification may be
sought.

 

(f) Each Indemnified Person shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
mitigate any Loss that is subject to indemnification pursuant to  _Section
10.4(a)_ or _(b)_. In the event an Indemnified Person fails to use its
commercially reasonable efforts to so mitigate a Loss, the Indemnifying Person
shall have no liability for any portion of such Loss that reasonably would
have been avoided had the Indemnified Person made such efforts.

 



-74- (g) If the Indemnified Person receives any payment from an Indemnifying Person
in respect of any Losses pursuant to this _Article 10_ and the Indemnified
Person could have recovered all or a part of such Loss from a third party
based on the underlying claim asserted against the Indemnifying Person, the
Indemnified Person shall assign such of its rights to proceed against such
third party as are necessary to permit the Indemnifying Person to recover from
such third party the amount of such payment.

 

(h) If an Indemnified Person recovers an amount from a third party or actually
realizes any net Tax benefit, in each case, in respect of any Loss that is
the subject of indemnification under this Agreement after all or a portion of
such Loss has been paid by an Indemnifying Person pursuant to this _Article
10_ , the Indemnified Person shall promptly remit to the Indemnifying
Person the excess (if any) of (i) the amount paid by the Indemnifying Person
in respect of such Loss, _plus_ the amount received from third parties in
respect thereof, _plus_ the amount of any net Tax benefit actually realized in
respect thereof, _minus_ (ii) the amount of the Loss.

10.5. _Survival of Indemnity_. The obligation of Purchaser and Seller
to indemnify under this _Article 10_ as to claims covered by _Sections
10.2(a)(i)_ and _10.2(b)(i_ ), as applicable, shall expire on the second
anniversary of the Closing Date, and shall not apply to any claims pursuant to
_Sections 10.2(a)(i)_ and _10.2(b)(i)_ made after such date, except that the
obligation of Purchaser and Seller to indemnify with respect to (i) claims for
indemnity pursuant to _Sections 10.2(a)(i)_ and _10.2(b)(i_ ) made in writing
by Seller Indemnified Parties and Purchaser Indemnified Parties, as
applicable, within such two-year period shall continue until final resolution
of such claims and (ii) the Fundamental Representations shall continue until
the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations (or such longer
period specified with respect to representations and warranties in _Section
4.14_ ).

 

10.6. _Exclusive Remedy_. Except in the case of fraud or the failure of
Purchaser to make a Tax Sharing Payment and without limiting the right of the
parties to specific performance pursuant to _Section 12.11_ , or as otherwise
provided in this Agreement, the parties hereto acknowledge and agree that
should the Closing occur, the indemnities provided for in this Agreement
shall be the sole and exclusive remedies of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties
and the Seller Indemnified Parties for any Losses sustained, incurred or
suffered relating to or arising out of this Agreement.

 

10.7. _Payments_. The Indemnifying Person shall pay to the Indemnified Person,
by wire transfer of immediately available funds, the amount of any Loss for
which the Indemnifying Person is liable under this Agreement no later than
three (3) Business Days following any Final Determination with respect to such
Loss finding the Indemnifying Persons liability therefor.

the Closing:

(a) By mutual written consent of Purchaser and Seller;

(b) By Purchaser or Seller upon written notice to the other party if the
Closing shall not have occurred on or before the Outside Date, unless the
failure of the Closing to occur by such date arises out of, or results from, a
material breach by the party seeking to terminate this Agreement of any
representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or obligation of such party
under this Agreement;

(c) By Purchaser or Seller upon written notice to the other party if (i) any
Governmental Authority that must grant a Required Governmental Approval has

(ii) any statute, rule, regulation, executive order, ruling, judgment, order,
injunction or decree of any Governmental Authority is in effect (which, as
applicable, is final and non-appealable) that permanently prohibits or
prevents the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, unless, in
either case, such denial of approval or issuance of such executive
order, ruling, judgment, order, injunction or decree arises out of, or
results from, a material breach by the party seeking to terminate this
Agreement of any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or obligation
of such party under this Agreement; 

(d) By Purchaser, upon written notice to Seller, if Seller has breached its
representations, warranties, covenants, agreements or obligations under this
Agreement and such breach, individually or in the aggregate, would result in
the failure of a condition set forth in _Section 8.2_, and such breach has
not been or cannot be cured within thirty (30) days following written
notification thereof or, by its nature, cannot be cured prior to the Outside
Date; _provided_ _further_ that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant
to this _Section 11.1(d)_ shall not be available to Purchaser if Purchaser
is currently in material breach of its representations, warranties, covenants,
agreements or obligations under this Agreement; or

 

(e) By Seller, upon written notice to Purchaser, if Purchaser has breached its
representations, warranties, covenants, agreements or obligations under this
Agreement and such breach, individually or in the aggregate, would result in

been or cannot be cured within thirty (30) days following written
notification thereof or, by its nature, cannot be cured prior to the Outside
Date; _provided_ that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this

liability of any nature whatsoever under this Agreement, or in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby, except that (i) the provisions of
this _Section 11.2_, _Section 7.11_ and _Article 12_ shall survive such
termination and (ii) nothing in this Agreement will relieve any party from
liability for any pre-termination willful or intentional breach by such party
of the terms and provisions of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that
notwithstanding the termination of this Agreement pursuant to this _Section
11.2_ , the Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in full force and effect in
accordance with its terms.

and performance of this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State
of New York without giving effect to any conflict of laws provision or rule
(whether of the State of New York or any other jurisdiction) that would cause

of New York. Each party hereto agrees that it shall bring any action or
proceeding in respect of any claim arising out of or related to this Agreement
or the transactions contained in or contemplated by this Agreement and the
Transition Services Agreement, exclusively in the United States District
Court for the Southern District of New York or any New York State court
located in the Borough of Manhattan in New York City, as well as all courts
from which an appeal may be taken or other review sought from the aforesaid

execution and delivery of this Agreement may be effected by facsimile or any
other electronic means such as ".pdf" or ".tiff" files.

 



-78- 12.4. _Entire Agreement_. All Exhibits (attached hereto and as executed) and
Schedules hereto shall be deemed to be incorporated into and made part of
this Agreement. Except as set forth on _Schedule 12.4_ of Sellers Disclosure
Schedules, this Agreement, together with the Exhibits (attached hereto and as
executed) and Schedules hereto, and the Confidentiality Agreement and the
Transition Services Agreement, contain the entire agreement and understanding
among the parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement (and
supersede any prior agreements, arrangements or understandings among the
parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement) and there are no
agreements, representations, or warranties which are not set forth in this
Agreement.

 

12.5. _Amendment; Waiver_. Any provision of this Agreement may be amended or
waived if, and only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and signed, in
the case of an amendment, by Seller and Purchaser, or in the case of a waiver,
by the party against whom the waiver is to be effective. No failure or delay
by any party in exercising any right, power or privilege under this Agreement
shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise
thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any
other right, power or privilege. The rights and remedies in this Agreement
provided shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies
provided by law except as otherwise specifically provided in _Article 10_.

 

12.6. _Binding Effect; Assignment; Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement

assign any or all of its rights under this Agreement to any of its
Controlled Affiliates, to its or its Controlled Affiliates lenders as
collateral security or, after the Closing, to any Person, in each case,
without Sellers consent but with prior notice to Seller; _provided_ that no
such assignment by Purchaser shall (i) relieve Purchaser of its obligations
under this Agreement, (ii) enlarge or alter any obligation of any other party
hereto due to Purchaser or its assignees or (iii) be permitted if such
assignment would prevent, impair or delay the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby. Nothing in this Agreement, express or
implied, is intended to confer upon any Person other than Purchaser, Seller,
the Indemnified Persons, the Indemnified Directors and their respective
successors, legal representatives and permitted assigns, any rights or
remedies under or by reason of this Agreement; _provided_ that the Commitment
Parties shall be third party beneficiaries of, and entitled to enforce,
_Sections 12.2_ , _12.5_ , _12.6_ , _12.10_ and 12.12, and none of such
sections shall be amended, modified or supplemented in a manner that is
adverse in any respect to a Commitment Party without the prior written consent
of such Commitment Party.

12.7. _Severability_. If any provision or any portion of any provision of this
Agreement shall be held invalid or unenforceable, the remaining portion of
such provision and

 



-79-  the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall not be affected thereby. If
any provisions of this Agreement or the application thereof to any person or
entity or any circumstance, is found by a court or other Governmental
Authority of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, (a) a
suitable and equitable provision shall be substituted therefor in order to
carry out, so far as may be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of
such invalid or unenforceable provision and (b) the remainder of this
Agreement and the application of such provision to other persons, entities or
circumstances shall not be affected by such invalidity or unenforceability,
nor shall such invalidity or unenforceability affect the validity or

EXHIBIT 1

 

TRANSITION SERVICES AGREEMENT

 

This TRANSITION SERVICES AGREEMENT (this " _Agreement_ "), is entered into as
of  , 2015, by and between Knight Capital Group, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (" _KCG_ "), and BATS Global Markets, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (" _BATS_ ", and together with KCG, the " _Parties_ ").

RECITALS

 

WHEREAS, KCG has entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement dated as of
January 27, 2015 (the " _SPA_ ") with BATS, whereby, subject to the
conditions set forth in the SPA, KCG agrees to sell to BATS and BATS agrees to
purchase from KCG all of the issued and outstanding equity interests of
Hotspot FX Holdings, Inc. (" _Hotspot_ "); and

 

WHEREAS, KCG currently provides certain operational, administrative, and other
services to Hotspot, and BATS has requested KCG to continue to provide such
services following the Closing (as such term is defined in the SPA) (the "
_Effective Date_ ");

WHEREAS, it is the intention of the Parties to effect the migration of
Services (as defined below) from KCG to BATS as promptly as reasonably
practicable;

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants, agreements and
promises herein contained and other good and valuable consideration, the
receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the Parties hereby
agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

 

DEFINITIONS

 

Section 1.1 _Definitions_. For the purposes of this Agreement, unless the
context clearly requires otherwise, the following terms shall have the
following meanings. Any term not otherwise defined herein shall have the mean
ascribed in the SPA.

 

" _Personnel_ " means the employees, officers, agents, independent contractors
and consultants of (a) a Party, (b) the Affiliates (as such term is defined
in the SPA) of such Party and (c) in case of KCG, any third parties engaged by
KCG or its Affiliates to Provide the Services.

 

" _Provide_ " or " _Provision_ " means provide or cause to be provided by any
Affiliates or third parties. ARTICLE II

 

SERVICES

 

Section 2.1 _Services_. During the Term of this Agreement, and subject to the
terms and conditions hereof, KCG shall Provide to BATS or Hotspot, as
applicable, the services set forth on _Schedule 2.1_ attached hereto (the "
_Services_ "), unless terminated in accordance with _Section 7.2(c)_.

 

Section 2.2 _Additional Services_. From time to time, to the extent BATS
becomes aware of any additional Service not described in  _Schedule 2.1_
(other than any Service previously terminated pursuant to this Agreement) that
was Provided by KCG to Hotspot prior to the Closing and is reasonably required
after the Closing to continue to operate Hotspot as operated prior to the
Closing and cannot otherwise be reasonably Provided by BATS without undue
burden, BATS may request in writing that KCG Provide a service relating to the
operations of Hotspot that is not set forth in _Schedule 2.1_ (an "
_Additional Service_ "). Such request shall include a description of such
Additional Service and the associated business requirements. KCG will
consider, in its reasonable discretion, whether it is capable of providing
such Additional Service and if reasonably able, shall provide BATS an
estimate which includes the "Cost" required to Provide such Additional Service
(" _Cost_ " shall be defined as KCGs fully loaded cost of Providing the
applicable Service, including costs of labor, materials, KCGs customary
allocation of overhead and administrative expenses, and fees and expenses
charged by third parties). KCG will cooperate with BATS in good faith in
negotiating the scope, terms, base Cost and duration of all such Additional
Services. Upon agreement between the Parties, the terms relating to such
Additional Services will be set forth in a writing referencing this Agreement
and executed by the Parties and such Additional Services shall thereafter be
deemed to constitute "Services" hereunder, and the content of such separate
writing shall be deemed to be incorporated into _Schedule 2.1_ hereof.

 

Section 2.3 _Replacement Services_. If (i) KCG is unable to Provide any
Service that is otherwise required to be provided pursuant to this Agreement
for any reason outside of its control or (ii) KCG is excused from Providing
any Service by reason of _Section 2.5(b)_, KCG shall provide notice thereof
to BATS at least sixty (60) days in advance (or as much in advance as
reasonably practicable under the circumstances) and shall use its reasonable
best efforts to provide BATS or Hotspot (as applicable) substantially
equivalent services and support in accordance with this Agreement,
which replacement services and support (to the extent acceptable to BATS in
its reasonable discretion) shall be considered a Service for purposes of this
Agreement and the terms of which will be incorporated into _Schedule 2.1_
hereof.

 

Section 2.4 _Service Coordinators_. KCG and BATS shall each nominate an
employee to act as the primary contact person with respect to the Provision
of the Services (each, a " _Service Coordinator_ "). Unless otherwise agreed
upon by the Parties, all communications relating to this Agreement and to the
Services Provided hereunder shall be directed to the Service Coordinators.

Section 2.5 _Standard of Performance_. (a) KCG shall use reasonable efforts to
Provide Services hereunder in a manner consistent with recent practice prior
to the Effective Date.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, KCG
shall not be obligated to Provide any Services to the extent the provision of
such Service would violate (i) any agreement or license with a third party and
set forth on Schedule 2.5(b)(i) to this Agreement   to which KCG or its Affiliates are subject as of the date of this Agreement,
and any extension or renewal of those agreements or licenses or (ii)
applicable Law. With respect to Services that KCG has Provided through a
third party provider, KCG shall use reasonable efforts to cause such third
party provider to perform such Services in accordance with the contract with
the applicable KCG entity; _provided_ that KCG shall not be obligated to
incur any cost or expense, in connection with obtaining such approvals,
agreements, permits consents, waivers and licenses, except as set forth on
_Schedule 2.5(b)_ to this Agreement. To the extent a third party provider
refuses or conditions its willingness to perform Services, KCG and BATS will
cooperate and jointly participate in negotiating with such third party
provider. If, during the term of this Agreement, any agreement with a third
party provider under which Services are provided is terminated by such third
party provider or not renewed by either party thereto, (i) BATS will use
commercially reasonable efforts to secure an agreement with such third party
provider to provide such Services, (ii) KCG and BATS will cooperate and
jointly participate in negotiating with such third party provider and (iii)
BATS shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain substantially similar
services from a different third party provider. In connection with the
foregoing, KCG will use commercially reasonable efforts to minimize any
service disruption, including by providing BATS with prompt advance notice of
any such termination or non-renewal to the extent practicable.

 

(c) BATS agrees to give KCG reasonably prompt notice of any change in the
manner the business of Hotspot is conducted or Services Provided that would
reasonably be expected to have an adverse effect on KCGs Provision of
Services hereunder. KCG will work in good faith with BATS to determine if the
Services can still be provided, and if so, what, if any, changes in the terms
of such Services are needed. In addition, in the event BATS determines to
make a change in the manner in which the business of Hotspot is operated
during the Term that would require Services to be Provided in a different
manner (it being understood that KCG shall not be required to provide
Services in such different manner except as contemplated by this _Section
2.5(c)_ or as KCG may otherwise consent), BATS may provide notice to KCG and,
upon receipt of such notice, KCG will work in good faith with BATS to
determine whether such Services can be so Provided without undue burden and,
if so, on what terms. If the parties can agree on terms, such Services shall
each be considered a Service for purposes of this Agreement and the terms of
which will be incorporated into _Schedule 2.1_ hereof. It is agreed that (i)
KCG being required to utilize additional persons (either employees,
independent contractors or service providers) to Provide Services, (ii) a non-
de minimis increase in the time any KCG employee must commit to Providing
Services, (iii) the incurrence of any costs that are not reimbursed by BATS,
and (iv) requiring the consent under any license of KCG, shall be considered
an undue burden; _provided_ , that, notwithstanding the foregoing, even if a
Service would create an undue burden, KCG will reasonably cooperate with BATS
in finding a solution that does not include KCG Providing Services and will
provide reasonable transition support for the migration of any Service to
BATS or a third party.

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the
nonperformance of KCG or its Affiliates under this Agreement shall be excused
if such nonperformance results from BATS or Hotspots failure to perform its
obligations under this Agreement or from wrongful or tortious actions of BATS
or Hotspot after KCG has provided reasonable notice of such nonperformance or
wrongful or tortious actions and used commercially reasonable efforts to
perform notwithstanding such nonperformance or wrongful or tortious actions. Section 2.6 _Consent and Approvals_. KCG represents and warrants to BATS that
the execution, delivery and performance by KCG of this Agreement does not and
will not (a) violate any provision of the Constituent Documents of KCG, (b)
other than with respect to the agreements or licenses set forth on Schedule
2.5(b)(i) to this Agreement, result in a breach of or default, or give rise
to any right of termination, cancellation or acceleration of any right or
obligation of KCG or any of its Affiliates or to a loss of any benefit to
which KCG or its Affiliates is entitled, under any Contract, or any judgment
or decree to which any assets of KCG or any of its Affiliates are subject or
by which KCG or any of its Affiliates is bound, except for such breaches or
defaults that would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to be material to the Provision of any Services hereunder or (c)
violate any material Law binding upon KCG, except for such violations that
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to be
material to the Provision of any Services hereunder.

ARTICLE III

 

PAYMENT

Section 3.1  _Service Fees_. The fees that shall be due in respect of the
Services and payable by BATS in accordance with the terms hereof, (the "
_Service Fees_ ") are set forth on _Schedule 2.1_.

 

Section 3.2 _Billing and Payment Terms_. KCG shall invoice BATS for Services
on a monthly basis for all Services that KCG Provided during the preceding
month. Each such invoice shall be payable within thirty (30) days after BATS
receipt of the invoice. Payment of all such invoices shall be made in U.S.
dollars by wire or ACH transfer to such accounts as designated by KCG.

(b) If BATS in good faith disputes any invoice or portion of an invoice by
providing written notice to KCG of such dispute prior to the due date, it may
withhold the disputed portion of such payment until such dispute is resolved.
If BATS disputes any charges hereunder, the Parties shall work together in
good faith to resolve such dispute. All undisputed charges shall be paid when
otherwise due. If the resolution of such a dispute is that BATS owes an amount
of money to KCG, BATS shall pay such amount within fifteen (15) days following
resolution of the dispute.

 

(c) Neither BATS nor Hotspot shall have any right of set off or other similar
rights with respect to amounts owed under this Agreement or any other amounts
claimed to be owed by or to BATS or its Affiliates arising out of the SPA
(other than amounts that are due and payable pursuant to _Section 3.4_ of the
SPA or are otherwise due and payable after a Final Determination pursuant to
the SPA).

Section 3.3 _Records; Inspection and Audit Rights_. During the Term and for
twelve (12) months thereafter, KCG agrees to maintain accurate records
regarding its compliance with the terms of this Agreement, including
substantiating the charges for any Service Provided hereunder. Upon no less
than thirty (30) days prior written notice from BATS, KCG shall make
available to an independent auditing firm (which will not be the independent
auditor of KCG or  BATS) (the " _Auditor_ ") reasonable access to such records. Such access
shall be provided during KCGs regular business hours and any review shall be
conducted in a manner that shall not unreasonably interfere with KCGs normal
operations. In no event shall BATS be permitted to request such an audit more
than once in any twelve (12) month period or with respect to a calendar
quarter in which the aggregate Service Fees payable by BATS are less than
$50,000. All information disclosed to the Auditor shall constitute the
Confidential Information of KCG, and, if so requested by KCG, the Auditor
shall be required to enter into a reasonable and customary nondisclosure
agreement with KCG. The Auditor shall not be permitted to disclose to BATS any
such information other than its determination that an overcharge or
undercharge may have occurred, and in what amount. In the event that either
KCG disagrees with an overcharge found by the Auditor, KCG may, within thirty
(30) days, deliver a notice to BATS and the Auditor disagreeing with the
overcharge and providing evidence of its calculation of the Servicing Fees
owed by BATS and its grounds for disagreement. During the fifteen (15) day
period following the delivery of notice by KCG, the Auditor shall consider the
evidence provided by KCG. Any determination by the Auditor following such
fifteen (15) day period of an overcharge, and the amount of such overcharge,
shall be final and binding upon KCG. All costs and expenses of such audit
shall be borne by BATS unless such audit reveals any overcharge in excess of
$10,000, in which case all costs and expenses of such audit shall be borne by
KCG. Any amounts found pursuant to this _Section 3.3_ to have been overpaid
by BATS shall be refunded within fifteen (15) days following the confirmation
thereof by the audit above.

 

ARTICLE IV

_ACCESS AND SECURITY_

Section 4.1 _Security Level; Additional Security Measures_.

 

(a) KCG shall at all times during the Term maintain a level of physical and
electronic security (including data security and data privacy) in its
Provision of the Services that it Provides, consistent with that of market
practice for similar businesses and sufficient to at the least comply with
applicable Law, and shall use commercially reasonable efforts promptly address
any new security related issues, including compliance with applicable Law
related to security and issues related to new technologies or threats.

(b) KCG may take physical or information security measures that affect the
manner in which Services are Provided, provided that the substance and overall
delivery of any affected Services are not materially and adversely effected
and otherwise complies with this Agreement; and KCG will give BATS
reasonable, prior notice of any such physical or information security measures
that are material.

 

Section 4.2 _Security Breaches_. In the event that a security breach that
relates to the Services, or an attempted security breach that relates to the
Services and is deemed in good faith not to be immaterial, is discovered by
either Party, such Party shall promptly notify the other Party of such event.
KCG and BATS shall, subject to any applicable Law, cooperate with each other
regarding the timing and manner of (a) notification to their respective
customers, potential customers, employees and/or agents concerning a breach or
potential breach of security and (b) disclosures to appropriate
Governmental Entities as required by applicable Law regarding such security
breach or attempted security breach. Section 4.3 _Systems Security_.

 

(a) If either Party, or its Personnel or clients, will be given access to the
other Partys computer systems or software (" _Systems_ ") in connection with
the Provision of the Services, the accessing Party, its Personnel, or its
clients, as the case may be, shall comply with all of such other Partys
written system security policies, procedures and requirements (as amended
from time to time, the " _Security Regulations_ "), and will not tamper with,
compromise or circumvent any security or audit measures employed by such other
Party.

 

(b) Each Party shall use reasonable best efforts to ensure that only those of
its Personnel and its clients who are specifically authorized to have access
to the Systems of the other Party gain such access, and to prevent
unauthorized access, use, destruction, alteration or loss of information
contained therein, including notifying its Personnel and its clients regarding
the restrictions set forth in this Agreement and establishing appropriate
policies designed to effectively enforce such restrictions.

(c) If, at any time, either Party determines that (i) a Party, its Personnel
or its clients has sought to circumvent, or has circumvented, the Security
Regulations, (ii) that any unauthorized Personnel or clients of a Party has
accessed its Systems or (iii) that a Party, any of its Personnel or any of
its clients has engaged in activities that may lead or have led to the
unauthorized access, use, destruction, alteration or loss of data, information
or software, (in each of clauses (i), (ii), and (iii) of this Section, the
Party referred to therein being the " _Non-Harmed Party_ "), the Non-Harmed
Party shall, upon receipt of notification from the harmed Party or its
otherwise becoming aware of such matter, immediately suspend its Personnels
or clients access to the Systems until such time that the Parties may
reasonably agree to restore such access.

 

(d) Each of KCG, BATS and their respective Personnel and clients, shall access
and use only those Systems, and only such data and information within such
Systems to which it has been granted the right to access and use. Any Party
shall have the right to deny the Personnel and clients of the other Party
access to such Partys Systems, after prior written notice, in the event the
Party reasonably believes that such Personnel or clients pose a security
concern.

(e) All user identification numbers and passwords of a Party disclosed to the
other Party, and any information obtained from the use of such disclosing
Partys Systems, shall be deemed Confidential Information of the disclosing
Party.

 

ARTICLE V

 

 _CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION AND PROPRIETARY INFORMATION_

 

Section 5.1 _Confidential Information_.

 

(a) " _Confidential Information_ " means all information (whether in written,
electronic or oral form) disclosed by either Party (the " _Disclosing Party_
") to the other Party (the " _Receiving Party_ ") under the terms and for
purposes of this Agreement (including information disclosed in  the course of negotiation of this Agreement and the terms of this Agreement)
that is not generally known to the public and that is designated as
confidential or otherwise should reasonably be understood as confidential
given the nature and circumstances of its disclosure, except for (i)
information that is or becomes publicly available (other than through
disclosure by the Receiving Party or its Affiliates), from and after the
date of public availability; (ii) information rightfully disclosed to the
Receiving Party by a third party not bound by any confidentiality agreement
with the Disclosing Party; (iii) information developed by the Receiving Party
independent of any of the Disclosing Partys Confidential Information; or
(iv) information that is rightfully in the possession of the Receiving Party
and not subject to any duty of confidentiality as of the Effective Date.

 

(b) The Receiving Party shall not, and shall cause its respective Affiliates
and each of its and its Affiliates directors, partners, officers, managers,
members, personnel, accountants, counsel and other advisers, and other
representatives (" _Representatives_ ") not to, disclose to any other person
or use, except for purposes of this Agreement (and only in accordance with
applicable Law), any information that is Confidential Information of the
Disclosing Party; provided, however, that the Receiving Party may disclose
such Confidential Information, to the extent permitted by any applicable
Law (i) to its Representatives solely on a reasonable need to know basis in
connection with the performance of the Receiving Partys obligations or rights
under this Agreement, so long as such Representatives are under an obligation
to maintain the information as confidential in accordance with _Section
5.1(d)_, (ii) in any report, statement, testimony or other submission to any
Governmental Authority having jurisdiction over the Receiving Party to the
extent required by applicable Law or (iii) in order to comply with any
applicable Law applicable to the Receiving Party, or in response to any
summons, subpoena or other legal process or formal or informal investigative
demand issued to the Receiving Party in the course of any litigation,
investigation or administrative proceeding.

(c) In the event that the Receiving Party or any of its Representatives
becomes legally compelled by deposition, interrogatory, request for documents,
subpoena, civil investigative demand or similar judicial or administrative
process to disclose any of the Disclosing Partys Confidential Information,
the Receiving Party shall, unless prohibited by law, Provide the Disclosing
Party with prompt prior written notice of such requirement, and, shall
exercise reasonable efforts to cooperate with the Disclosing Party (at the
Disclosing Partys expense) in any reasonable efforts by the Disclosing Party
to obtain a protective order or similar remedy to such Confidential
Information, as the case may be, not to be disclosed, including interposing
all available objections thereto, such as objections based on settlement
privilege. In the event that such protective order or other similar remedy is
not obtained, the Receiving Party shall furnish only that portion of the
Confidential Information that has been legally compelled, and shall cooperate
with the Disclosing Party (at the Disclosing Partys expense) in any
reasonable efforts by the Disclosing Party to obtain assurance that
confidential treatment will be accorded such disclosed Confidential
Information.

 

(d) The Receiving Party shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, protect
the Disclosing Partys Confidential Information by using the same degree of
care, but no less than a reasonable degree of care, to prevent the
unauthorized disclosure of such as the Receiving Party uses to protect its own
confidential information of a like nature. (e) The Receiving Party shall cause its Representatives to agree to be bound
by the same restrictions on use and disclosure of the Disclosing Partys
Confidential Information, as bind the Receiving Party under this Agreement in
advance of the disclosure of any such Confidential Information to such
Representatives.

the proscribed "Termination Notice Period" set forth for the respective
Service on _Schedule 2.1_. Such notice  must specify the Service or Services to be terminated, and the effective
date of such termination. Any such terminated Service shall, on the effective
date of such termination, be deemed deleted from _Schedule 2.1_ , KCG shall
have no further obligation to Provide such Service, and BATS shall have no
further obligation to continue to use or pay for such Service. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, this Agreement may be terminated at any time by BATS upon
thirty (30) days prior written notice to KCG.

(b) _Termination for Material Breach_. If a Party materially breaches this
Agreement, the other Party may terminate this Agreement or any or all Services
affected by such material breach unless, within thirty (30) days of written
notice thereof, such breaching Party (i) cures such material breach to the
reasonable satisfaction of the other Party (if such material breach is subject
to cure) and (ii) demonstrates, to the other Partys reasonable satisfaction,
that such breaching Party has enacted remedial measures designed to
prevent the breach from occurring again.

(c) _Termination for Completion of Services_. This Agreement may be terminated
in writing by both Parties in the event that the Parties agree BATS no longer
requires the Provision of Services.

(d) _Other Termination by KCG or BATS_. This Agreement, or any Service
Provided hereunder, as applicable, may be terminated by either Party upon
written notice to the other Party, if the other Party makes a general
assignment for the benefit of creditors or becomes insolvent, or a receiver
is appointed for, or a court approves reorganization or arrangement
proceedings on, such Party.

Section 7.3 _Effects of Termination_. Upon termination of this Agreement for
any reason:

(a) The obligations of KCG to Provide the Services hereunder
shall immediately cease, and BATS and its Affiliates shall stop using,
directly or indirectly, such Services. BATS shall only be liable for such
costs incurred in connection with the Services prior to the date of such
termination.

 

(b) Subject to any applicable Law, upon request, each Party shall, and shall
cause its Affiliates to, return to the other Party or destroy (and certify to
the destruction of), all of the other Partys and its Affiliates Confidential
Information and proprietary information, and all tangible personal property
and books, records or files provided by such other Party or its Affiliates
and used in connection with the Provision of Services that are in their
possession as of the termination date. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Receiving Party shall not be required to return or destroy any Confidential
Information that it is required to retain to comply with record-keeping
requirements for legal or regulatory purposes, provided that such Confidential
Information is kept confidential in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement. The return and/or destruction of the Confidential Information
shall not relieve Receiving Party from compliance with other terms and
conditions of this Agreement.

(c) The following provisions shall survive the termination of this Agreement:
_Section 3.2_, _Section 3.3_, _ARTICLE V_ , _ARTICLE VI_, this _Section
7.3_ and _ARTICLE VIII_. ARTICLE VIII

Agreement.

Section 8.3 _Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction_. The execution,
interpretation, and performance of this Agreement shall be governed by the
laws of the State of New York without giving effect to any conflict of laws
provision or rule (whether of the State of New York or any
other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the law of any other

bring any action or proceeding in respect of any claim arising out of or
related to this Agreement exclusively in the United States District Court for
the Southern District of New York or any New York State court located in the
Borough of Manhattan in New York City, as well as all courts from which an
appeal may be taken or other review sought from the aforesaid course
(collectively, the " _Chosen Courts_ "), and solely in connection with claims
arising under this Agreement or the transactions that are the subject of this
Agreement: 1. irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Chosen
Courts, 2. waives any objection to laying venue in any such action or
proceeding in the Chosen Courts, 3. waives any objection that the Chosen
Courts are an inconvenient forum or do not have jurisdiction over any party
hereto and 4. agrees that service of process upon such party in any such
action or proceeding shall be effective if notice is given in accordance with
_Section 8.2_.

 

Section 8.4 _Integration_. This Agreement, together with the SPA, constitutes
the entire agreement and understanding of the Parties hereto with respect to
the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements and
understandings relating to such subject matter.

 

Section 8.5 _Waivers and Consents; Amendments_. Any provision of this
Agreement may be amended or waived if, and only if, such amendment or waiver
is in writing and signed, in the case of an amendment, by KCG and BATS, or in
the case of a waiver, by the party against whom the waiver is to be effective.
No failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, power or privilege
under this Agreement shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or
partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, power or privilege.

 

Section 8.6 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement shall be held
to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, such illegality, invalidity or
unenforceability shall attach only to such provision and shall not in any
manner affect or render illegal, invalid or unenforceable any other provision
of this Agreement unless the effect thereof would be to alter materially the
effect of this Agreement, and this Agreement (if not so altered) shall be
carried out as if any such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision were
not contained herein.

 

Section 8.7 _Successors and Assigns; No Third Party Beneficiaries_. No Party
may assign its rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior
written consent of the other Party, except that either Party may assign this
Agreement in full to a successor to its business in connection with a merger
or sale of all or substantially all its assets relating to the subject matter
hereof or in the event of a corporate restructuring or consolidation. Any
assignment made in violation of this section shall be wholly void and invalid,
the assignee shall acquire no rights whatsoever, and the non-assigning
party shall not recognize, nor shall it be required to recognize, the
assignment. Subject to the terms of this _Section 8.7_, this Agreement and
all its provisions shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the
Parties and their respective permitted successors and assigns. Nothing in
this Agreement, whether express or implied, shall confer on any person or
entity, other than the Parties or their Affiliates, any rights, remedies or
liabilities.

 

Section 8.8 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION,   PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE)
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY OR THE ACTIONS OF EITHER PARTY IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION,
PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT OF THIS AGREEMENT.

Section 8.9 _Expenses_. Except as stated herein, each Party hereto shall bear
its own expenses incident to the preparation, negotiation, execution and
delivery of this Agreement and the performance of its obligations hereunder;
provided, however, that nothing in this  _Section 8.9_ shall relieve any
Party hereto of any liability resulting from such Partys breach of this
Agreement.

 

Section 8.10 _Counterparts; Facsimiles_. This Agreement may be executed
simultaneously in any number of counterparts, each of which when so executed
and delivered shall be taken to be an original; but such counterparts shall
together constitute but one and the same document. The execution and delivery
of this Agreement may be effected by facsimile or any other electronic
means such as ".pdf" or ".tiff" files.

Section 8.11 _Employee Matters_. All employees and representatives of KCG or
its Affiliates providing Services under this Agreement shall be deemed for
purposes of all compensation and employee benefits to be employees or
representatives solely of KCG or its Affiliates (as applicable) and not to be
employees or representatives of BATS or Hotspot. In performing their
respective duties hereunder, all such employees and representatives of KCG or
its Affiliates shall be under the direction, control and supervision of KCG or
its Affiliates (as applicable), subject to the reasonable directions of BATS,
and such entity shall have the sole right to exercise all authority with
respect to the employment (including termination of employment), assignment
and compensation of such employees and representatives. KCG and its
Affiliates shall have responsibility for compliance with all applicable Law
relating to the employer/employee relationship between KCG and its Affiliates
and their respective employees providing Services, including, but not limited
to, federal, state and/or local laws on hours of labor, wages, workers
compensation, taxes, unemployment compensation, insurance and social security
benefits.

 

Section 8.12 _Relationship of the Parties_. Each Party and its Affiliates
shall be acting as an independent contractor in performing under this
Agreement, and shall not be considered or deemed to be an agent, employee,
joint venturer or partner of the other Party or any of its Affiliates. Each
Party and its Affiliates shall, at all times, maintain complete control over
its Personnel and operations, and shall have sole responsibility for
staffing, instructing and compensating its Personnel. Neither Party (nor its
Affiliates) shall have, or shall represent that it has, any power, right or
authority to bind the other Party (or its Affiliates) to any obligation or
liability, to assume or create any obligation or liability or transact any
business in the name or on behalf of the other Party (or its Affiliates), or
make any promises or representations on behalf of the other Party (or its
Affiliates), unless agreed to in writing.

Section 8.13 _Force Majeure_. No Party shall be liable for any failure or
performance to the extent attributable to acts, events or causes (including
war, riot, rebellion, civil disturbances, terrorist actions or attacks, flood,
storm, fire and earthquake or other conditions or events of   nature, or any act of a Governmental Authority) beyond its control to
prevent in whole or in part performance by such Party under this Agreement.
Each Party agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to minimize the
effect of any such, act, event or cause.
