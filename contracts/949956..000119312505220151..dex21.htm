1 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual covenants and
agreements herein contained, and intending to be legally bound hereby,

ARTICLE 1



THE MERGER



1.1 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, and in accordance with the DGCL, at the Effective Time, Merger
Sub shall be merged with and into the Company, the separate corporate
existence of Merger Sub shall cease and the Company, as the surviving
corporation of the Merger (sometimes referred to herein as the " _Surviving
Corporation_ "), shall succeed to and assume all the rights and obligations of
Merger Sub in accordance with the DGCL.



1.2 _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place
at the offices of Morgan, Lewis and Bockius LLP, One Market Street, San
Francisco, California, at 10:00 a.m., Pacific Time, on a date to be specified
by the Parties which shall be no later than two Business Days after
satisfaction (or written waiver as provided herein) of the conditions set
forth in Article 6 (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or written waiver
of such conditions), unless another time, date or place is agreed to in
writing by the Parties. The date upon which the Closing occurs is herein
referred to as the " _Closing Date_." Simultaneously with, or as soon as
reasonably practicable following, the Closing (but in any case on the Closing
Date), the Company as the surviving corporation shall file the certificate of
merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") with the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware as provided in Section 251(c) of the DGCL. The Merger shall
become effective at such time as the Certificate of Merger is so filed or at
such later time as is agreed to by the Parties and set forth in the
Certificate of Merger, if different, which time is hereinafter referred to as
the " _Effective Time_."



1.3 _Effects of the Merger_.



(a) At and after the Effective Time, the Merger shall have the effects
specified in the DGCL.



(b) At the Effective Time, subject to Section 5.7(a), the Certificate of
Incorporation of the Company as the Surviving Corporation shall be amended
and restated to read the same as the Certificate of Incorporation of Merger
Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that Article
I of the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall read
as follows: "The name of this corporation is Verity, Inc." As so amended and
restated, the Certificate of Incorporation of the Company shall be the
Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until amended
thereafter in accordance with applicable Law.



(c) At the Effective Time, subject to Section 5.7(a), the Bylaws of the
Company as the Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated to read the
same as the Bylaws of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time (except that all  



 

2  references to Merger Sub in the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall be
changed to refer to Verity, Inc.), until amended thereafter in accordance
with applicable Law.



(d) At the Effective Time, the directors and officers of Merger Sub
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors and officers of
the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office until their respective death,
permanent disability, resignation or removal or until their respective
successors are duly elected and qualified, all in accordance with the
Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation and
applicable Law.



1.4 _Further Assurances_. If, at any time after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall consider or be advised that any deeds, bills of
sale, assignments or assurances or any other acts or things are necessary,
desirable or proper (a) to vest, perfect or confirm, of record or otherwise,
in the Surviving Corporation its right, title and interest in, to or under
any of the rights, privileges, powers, franchises, properties or assets of
either of Merger Sub or the Company, or (b) otherwise to carry out the
purposes of this Agreement, the Surviving Corporation and its proper officers
and directors or their designees shall be authorized to execute and deliver,
in the name and on behalf of either of Merger Sub or the Company, all such
deeds, bills of sale, assignments and assurances and to do, in the name and on
behalf of either of Merger Sub or the Company, all such other acts and things
as may be necessary, desirable or proper to vest, perfect or confirm the
Surviving Corporations right, title and interest in, to and under any of the
rights, privileges, powers, franchises, properties or assets of either of
Merger Sub or the Company and otherwise to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement.



ARTICLE 2



EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK OF THE

COMPANY AND MERGER SUB; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES



2.1 _Effect on Capital Stock_. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any further action on the part of the holder of any shares
of capital stock of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or any other Person:



(a) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock_. Each share of common stock, par value
$0.001 per share, of the Company (" _Company Common Stock_ ") that is owned by
the Company (as treasury stock) or any wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be cancelled and
shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange
therefor.



(b) _Conversion of Merger Sub Common Stock_. Each issued and outstanding share
of common stock of Merger Sub shall be converted into one fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.



(c) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Subject to Section 2.1(d), each
issued and outstanding share of Company Common Stock (other than shares to be
cancelled in accordance with Section 2.1(a)) shall be converted, as of the
Effective Time, into the right to receive $13.50 per share, in cash (the "
_Per Share Amount_ "). At the Effective Time, all such shares of Company
Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be  



 

3  cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate
representing any such shares shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive the consideration to which such holder
is entitled pursuant to this Section 2.1(c). Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the Per Share Amount shall be adjusted to reflect fully the effect of any
stock split, reverse split, reclassification, stock dividend (including any
dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Company Common Stock),
reorganization, recapitalization or other like change with respect to Company
Common Stock occurring (or having a record date) after the date of this
Agreement and prior to the Effective Time.



(d) _Dissenting Shares_.



(i) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, shares of
Company Common Stock that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time and that are held by stockholders of the Company who have demanded and
perfected appraisal rights for such shares in accordance with Section 262 of
the DGCL (collectively, the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted
into or represent the right to receive the Per Share Amount. Such
stockholders shall be entitled to receive payment of the appraised value of
such shares of Company Common Stock held by them in accordance with Section
262 of the DGCL, unless and until such stockholders fail to perfect or
effectively withdraw or otherwise lose their appraisal rights under Section
262 of the DGCL. All shares of Company Common Stock held by Company
stockholders who shall have failed to perfect or who shall have effectively
withdrawn or lost their right to appraisal of such shares under Section 262
of the DGCL shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted into and to have
become exchangeable for, as of the Effective Time, the right to receive the
Per Share Amount in cash, without any interest thereon (subject to any
applicable withholding taxes), upon the surrender or transfer, in the manner
provided in Section 2.2(b), of the corresponding Certificate.



(ii) The Company shall give Parent (A) prompt notice of any demands for
appraisal received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands, and any other
related instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company
and (B) the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings
with respect to demands for appraisal under the DGCL. The Company shall not,
except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect
to any demands for appraisal or offer to settle or settle any such demands.



 

4 (e) _Options_. At the Effective Time, all Options outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time with an exercise price at or below $15.00 per
share of Company Common Stock (an " _Lower Priced Option_ ") shall be assumed
by Parent in accordance with, and to the extent provided in, Section 5.8. At
the Effective Time, all Options outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time with an exercise price in excess of $15.00 per share of Company
Common Stock (a " _Higher Priced Option_ ") shall not be assumed by Parent and
shall accordingly be cancelled with no cash or other consideration to be paid
to the holders of such cancelled Options. Outstanding rights to purchase
shares of Company Common Stock under the ESPP shall be exercised on the
earlier of (i) March 31, 2006 and (ii) the day immediately prior to the
Effective Time, and the plan shall terminate in accordance with Section 4.3.



2.2 _Exchange of Certificates_.



(a) _Paying Representative_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall
designate a bank or trust company of recognized standing that is reasonably
acceptable to the Company to act as paying agent (the " _Paying
Representative_ "). By not later than three Business Days after the Effective
Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with the
Paying Representative the amount of cash payable pursuant to Section 2.1(c)
as of the Effective Time in respect of the Company Common Stock (other than
shares to be cancelled in accordance with Section 2.1(a)) (such cash, together
with any dividends or distributions with respect thereto, being hereinafter
referred to as the " _Payment Fund_ "). The Paying Representative shall make
the cash payments provided for in the preceding sentence out of the Payment
Fund. The Payment Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. Any portion
of the Payment Fund that has not been distributed pursuant to Section 2.2(b)
on or prior to the date which is one year after the Effective Time shall be
turned over to Parent, and any former holders of Certificates who have not
theretofore complied with this Article 2 shall thereafter look to Parent for
payment of the consideration payable pursuant to Section 2.1(c) with respect
thereto; _provided, however,_ that any and all interest earned at any time on
the Payment Fund shall inure to the benefit of, and belong to, Parent.



(b) _Exchange Procedure_. Promptly following the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall cause the Paying Representative to mail to each holder of
record of a certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock whose
shares were converted into the right to receive the Per Share Amount (the "
_Certificates_ "), (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates
held by such Person shall pass, only upon the proper delivery of
the Certificates, to the Paying Representative and shall be in a form and
have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii)
instructions as specified by the Paying Representative or Parent for use in
effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the consideration
to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.1(c). Subject to
Section 2.2(h), upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying
Representative or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by
Parent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and executed,
and such other customary documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying
Representative, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive
in exchange therefor, and the Paying Representative shall promptly distribute
to such holder, the amount of cash into which the shares of Company Common
Stock theretofore represented by such Certificate shall have been
converted pursuant to Section 2.1(c), and the  



 

5  Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. In the event of a
transfer of ownership of shares of Company Common Stock that is not registered
in the transfer records of the Company, payment may be made to a Person other
than the Person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered, if
such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for
transfer and the Person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or
other Taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the
registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of
Parent that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this Section 2.2(b), each Certificate shall be deemed at any
time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such
surrender, with respect to each share of Company Common Stock represented by
such Certificate, the Per Share Amount, without interest. No interest will be
paid or will accrue on the cash payable upon the surrender of any Certificate.



(c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. All cash paid upon
the surrender of Certificates in accordance with the terms of this Article 2
shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock theretofore represented by
such Certificates. At the close of business on the day of the Effective Time,
the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no
further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving
Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Representative for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as
provided in this Article 2\.



(d) _No Liability_. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the Paying
Representative shall be liable to any Person in respect of any cash delivered
to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law. 



(e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact
by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and,
if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in such
reasonable amount as Parent may direct as indemnity against any claim that may
be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Representative
will pay to the holder of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the
consideration to which such holder is entitled with respect to such
Certificate pursuant to Section 2.1(c).



(f) _Withholding Rights_. Parent shall deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to Section 2.1(c) of this Agreement
to any holder of Company Common Stock such amounts as it is required to deduct
and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder, or any provisions of any other Tax Law. To the extent
that amounts are so deducted and withheld by Parent, such deducted and
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the holder of the Company Common Stock in respect to which such
deduction and withholding were made by Parent.



(g) _Contingent Option Exercises_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement or the Stock Plans, the Company shall be permitted to take
such actions as it may  



 

6  deem necessary or appropriate to permit the exercise of all vested Options
on a cashless basis contingent upon the Closing, including the contingent
exercise of any Options that would vest on an accelerated basis upon the
Closing. With respect to each current or former employee of the Company or its
Subsidiaries who exercises one or more Options on such a cashless basis, the
Company shall at the time of such exercise collect, either in the form of
cash or through the withholding of a portion of the shares of Company Common
Stock otherwise issuable upon such exercise, all federal, state and local
income, employment and other payroll withholding taxes at the applicable
rates and shall pay such withholding taxes to the appropriate taxing
authorities promptly when due. The holders of Options exercised on the
foregoing basis shall be entitled to receive, promptly following the Effective
Time, cash in respect of each share of Company Common Stock issued in
connection with such cashless exercise, net of any shares withheld to satisfy
the applicable withholding taxes, in an amount equal to the excess, if any, of
(i) the Per Share Amount, over (ii) the exercise price per share of Company
Common Stock at which such Option was exercisable immediately prior to the
Effective Time.



(h) _Treatment of Unvested Shares_. Notwithstanding the payment provisions of
Section 2.2(b), any consideration payable with respect to shares of Company
Common Stock that were acquired under the Stock Plans and were, at the
Effective Time, unvested and subject to the Companys right to repurchase any
of those shares which remain unvested at the time of the individuals
termination of service, shall be held in escrow by Parent. Such consideration
shall vest in accordance with the same vesting schedule applicable to the
shares of Company Common Stock to which the payment relates. Within ten (10)
Business Days following the end of each calendar quarter, Parent shall
distribute any such consideration held in escrow that has vested during the
preceding quarter, subject to the collection of all applicable withholding
Taxes. Notwithstanding the right to receive such consideration under Section
2.2(b) or the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.2(h), in the event of the
individuals termination of service prior to the time such individual would
have fully vested in the shares of Company Common Stock that were converted
into such consideration held in escrow in accordance with the foregoing
provisions of this Section 2.2(h), then no such consideration shall be paid
with respect to any such shares that would have been unvested at the time of
such termination (the " _Unvested Shares_ "), and Parent shall instead pay
such individual optionee the lesser of (i) the aggregate exercise price paid
for those particular Unvested Shares and (ii) the consideration payable with
respect to such Unvested Shares. The Company shall require any individual who
exercises an Option for unvested shares, or otherwise acquires unvested shares
under any of the Stock Plans, prior to Closing to execute an agreement, in
form and substance satisfactory to Parent, to reflect the foregoing provisions
relating to the payment due upon termination of service.



ARTICLE 3



REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES



3.1 _Representations and Warranties of the Company_. The Company represents
and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub that, except as set forth in
the written disclosure schedule prepared by the Company which is dated as of
the date of this Agreement and arranged in sections corresponding to the
numbered and lettered sections contained in this Section 3.1 and is being
concurrently delivered to Parent in connection herewith (the " _Disclosure
Schedule_ "; _provided, however,_ that disclosure in any section of the
Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to  



 

7  have been set forth in all other applicable sections of the Disclosure
Schedule where the applicability of such disclosure to such other sections
is reasonably apparent notwithstanding the omission of any cross-reference to
such other section in the Disclosure Schedule; _provided, further,_ that the
mere listing of the name of a Contract, the parties thereto and the date
thereof shall not make the applicability of such disclosure "reasonably
apparent" for purposes of the immediately preceding proviso unless such
listing contains other descriptive language making the applicability of such
disclosure reasonably apparent): 



(a) _Organization, Standing and Corporate Power_.



(i) Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is a corporation or other legal
entity duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of
the jurisdiction in which it is organized and has the requisite corporate or
other power, as the case may be, and authority to carry on its business as
now being conducted. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is duly
qualified or licensed to do business and is in good standing in each
jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or the ownership or leasing
of its properties or operations makes such qualification or licensing
necessary, other than (A) in any jurisdiction that does not recognize the
concept of good standing, and (B) in such jurisdictions where the failure to
be so qualified or licensed or to be in good standing would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.



(ii) The Company has delivered or Made Available to Parent, prior to the
execution of this Agreement, copies of (i) its Certificate of Incorporation
and Bylaws, in each case as amended to the date of this Agreement, and (ii)
all the existing written consents and approved written minutes of the meetings
of its stockholders, its Board of Directors and each committee of its Board
of Directors with respect to the Company held between June 1, 2003 and the
date of this Agreement.



(b) _Subsidiaries_. Section 3.1(b) of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth a
list of the Subsidiaries of the Company. All the outstanding shares of
capital stock of, or other equity or voting interests in, each such Subsidiary
have been validly issued and are fully paid and nonassessable and are owned by
the Company or a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, free and clear of
all mortgages, pledges, assessments, adverse claims, liens, charges, security
interests and other encumbrances of any kind or nature whatsoever
(collectively, " _Liens_ "), except for Permitted Liens. Except for the
capital stock of, or other equity or voting interests in, those Subsidiaries
listed in Section 3.1(b) of the Disclosure Schedule, and except for marketable
securities and Eligible Investments, the Company does not own, directly or
indirectly, any capital stock of, or other equity or voting interests in, any
other Person. The Company has delivered or Made Available to Parent with
respect to each Subsidiary complete and correct copies of the Certificate of
Incorporation and Bylaws (or other similar organizational documents) of such
Subsidiary, in each case as amended to the date of this Agreement.



(c) _Capital Structure_.



(i) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 200,000,000 shares
of Company Common Stock and 1,999,995 shares of preferred stock, par value
$0.001 per share (" _Company Preferred Stock_ "). Of the 1,999,995 shares of
Company  



 

8  Preferred Stock that are authorized for issuance, 500,000 shares have been
designated as Series A Preferred Stock and have been reserved for issuance
under the Companys Rights Agreement, dated as of September 18, 1996, between
the Company and First National Bank of Boston, as amended on July 23, 1999
(the " _Rights Agreement_ "). As of November 2, 2005, (A) 35,847,912 shares

as to require such qualification, except for those jurisdictions where (i) the
concept of qualification to do business or good standing is not recognized,

contemplated hereby or thereby.

material benefit under, or result in the creation of any Lien (other than

contemplated by this Agreement or either of the Financing Agreements.



(iv) No consent, approval, Order or authorization of, or registration,
declaration or filing with, or notice to, any Governmental Entity is required

plc for the admission to trading of such shares on the London Stock Exchange
plcs market for listed securities, and (F) such other consents, approvals,

prevent or materially impede or delay the consummation of the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, nor is there any Order of

the Companys investment banking, legal or accounting firms or other advisors
or consultants) relating to a Third Party Proposal or (v) release any Person
from, or waive any provision of, any confidentiality or standstill agreement
to which it is a party in connection with any Third Party Proposal. " _Third
Party Proposal_ " means any proposal or offer (including any proposal or offer
to the stockholders of the Company) with respect to a proposed or potential
Acquisition Transaction from a Person other than Parent or its Affiliates or
their respective Representatives (in their capacities as such). " _Acquisition
Transaction_ " means: (A) any sale, lease or other disposition, direct or
indirect (and however structured), of any business or assets of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries (which business or assets represent 15% or more of
the consolidated assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole); (B) any tender offer (including a self-tender offer) or exchange
offer that, if consummated, would result in a Person (other than Parent or its
Affiliates) acquiring beneficial ownership of 15% or more of the outstanding
Company Common Stock; (C) a merger, consolidation, share exchange,
business combination, reorganization, joint venture, recapitalization,
liquidation, dissolution or other similar transaction involving the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries (which Subsidiaries represent 15% or more of the

in each such case in this clause (C) which would result in a Person (other
than Parent or its Affiliates) acquiring beneficial ownership of (i) 15% or
more of the outstanding Company Common Stock or (ii) 15% or more of the
consolidated assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries; or (D) the issuance,
sale or other disposition, direct or indirect (and however structured), of
securities (or securities or other rights convertible into, or exercisable or

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Board of
Directors of the Company may furnish information to, enter into discussions
or negotiations with and cooperate in or facilitate any effort or attempt to
make, implement or accept a Third Party Proposal from, a Person (or a
Representative of a Person) who has made a written bona fide Third Party
Proposal not solicited in violation of Section 4.2(a) if, and only if, the
Board of Directors of the Company has (i) determined (after receiving the
advice of a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) that such
Third Party Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a
Superior Proposal, (ii) determined (after receiving the advice of the
Companys outside legal counsel) that, in light of such Third Party Proposal,
the failure to take such actions would be reasonably likely to result in a
breach of its fiduciary obligations to the Company or the Companys
stockholders under applicable Law, (iii) provided written notice to Parent of
its intent to furnish information or enter into discussions or negotiations
with such Person at least 24 hours prior to taking any such action and (iv)
obtained from such Person an executed confidentiality agreement containing
terms relating to confidentiality that are no less favorable to the Company
than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement. The Company shall
furnish contemporaneously to Parent all nonpublic information provided to the
Person who has made the Third Party Proposal to the extent that such
information has not been previously  



 

39  provided to Parent and shall keep Parent reasonably informed as to the
status of any discussions with the Person that made the Third Party Proposal
and its Representatives regarding such Third Party Proposal. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, no information may be furnished and no discussions may be
entered into in connection with any Third Party Proposal that has resulted,
directly or indirectly, from a breach of Section 4.2(a) or Section 4.2(e). "
_Superior Proposal_ " means a written bona fide Third Party Proposal not
solicited in violation of Section 4.2(a) pursuant to which a Person (or its
stockholders) would own, if consummated, at least 75% of the outstanding
capital stock of the Company (or of the surviving entity in a merger or the
direct or indirect parent of the surviving entity in a merger) or at least 75%
of all the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole on
terms that the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith
(after receiving the advice of a financial advisor of nationally recognized
reputation) to be more favorable to the Companys stockholders from a
financial point of view than the terms of the Merger, and taking into account
the terms and conditions of the Third Party Proposal, including any break-up
fees, expense reimbursement provisions and conditions to consummation.
In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in this Section
4.2(b), the Company shall promptly, but in no event later than 24 hours after
any officer or director of the Company becomes aware that any Third Party
Proposal has been received by the Company, or any inquiry or request for
information that the Company believes would reasonably be expected to lead to
a Third Party Proposal has been received by the Company, advise Parent in
writing of (i) any such Third Party Proposal, (ii) any inquiry or request for
information that the Company reasonably believes could lead to a Third Party
Proposal, and (iii) the terms and conditions of any such Third Party Proposal,
request or inquiry and the identity of the Person making the Third Party
Proposal, inquiry or request. The Company shall keep Parent informed in all
material respects on a timely basis of any material change in the status of,
or any material modification or material amendment to, any Third Party
Proposal. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
Board of Directors of the Company may provide any nonpublic information
relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to, and engage in
substantive discussions with, any of its Representatives relating to any
Third Party Proposal (other than, except as otherwise expressly permitted by
this Section 4.2, any individual Representative who, to the Knowledge of the
Company, has a direct or indirect material interest in such Third Party
Proposal other than as a result of being a Representative or security holder
of the Company).



(c) Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent the Board of Directors of the
Company from withholding, withdrawing, amending, modifying or changing its
recommendation in favor of the Company Stockholder Approval (such
recommendation being referred as the " _Company Board Recommendation_ ") and,
in the case of a tender or exchange offer by a Person other than Parent and
its Affiliates made directly to the Companys stockholders, recommending that
the Companys stockholders accept the tender or exchange offer (each, a "
_Change of Company Recommendation_ ") if, prior to the Company
Stockholders Meeting, the Board of Directors of the Company determines in
good faith (after receiving the advice of its outside legal counsel) that the
failure of the Board of Directors to effect a Change of Company Recommendation
would be reasonably likely to result in a breach of its fiduciary obligations
to the Companys stockholders under applicable Law.



(d) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or its
Board of Directors from taking and disclosing to the Companys stockholders a
position  



 

40  contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act;
provided that the Company shall not take a position that effects, or
otherwise make any public statement that constitutes, a Change of Company
Recommendation unless specifically permitted pursuant to the terms of Section
4.2(c).



(e) The Company (i) shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and
Representatives to, cease existing discussions or negotiations with any
Persons with respect to a Third Party Proposal made by such Person as of the
date of this Agreement, and (ii) shall instruct any third party in possession
of confidential information about the Company that was furnished by or on
behalf of the Company with respect to any Third Party Proposal within the
twelve months prior to the date of this Agreement to return or destroy all
such information unless such third party (and its Representatives) has already
been so instructed, subject to the terms of any existing confidentiality or
nondisclosure agreement between the Company and such third party.



4.3 _ESPP_. All purchase rights under the ESPP outstanding on the earlier of
(a) March 31, 2006 and (b) the day immediately prior to the Effective Time
(such earlier date, the " _ESPP Purchase Date_ "), shall automatically be
exercised, in accordance with the terms of the ESPP and resolutions of the
Board relating thereto, on the ESPP Purchase Date, and the shares of Company
Common Stock purchased under those exercised rights shall at the Effective
Time be cancelled and converted into the right to receive the consideration
payable pursuant to Section 2.1(c). No further purchase rights shall be
granted or exercised under the ESPP thereafter.



4.4 _Rights Agreement_. Except as provided in this Agreement, the Company
shall not (i) amend, modify or waive any provision of the Rights Agreement or
(ii) take any action to redeem the Rights or render the Rights inapplicable to
any transaction. 



4.5 _Employee Benefit Matters_.



(a) Unless Parent delivers written notice to the Company no later than five
Business Days prior to the Effective Time providing otherwise, the Company
shall take all action necessary to terminate, or cause to be terminated,
before the Effective Time, any Benefit Plan that is a 401(k) plan or other
defined contribution retirement plan.



(b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall
provide the employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries who remain employed
after the Effective Time (" _Continuing Employees_ ") with substantially
similar types and levels of ERISA Benefit Plans as those provided to
similarly situated employees of Parent. With regard to any Equity Benefit Plan
and any ERISA Benefit Plan for which service with Parent or any affiliate of
Parent is relevant for purposes of eligibility to participate and vesting,
including applicability of minimum waiting periods for participation, but not
for benefit accrual or accrual rates, Parent shall treat and cause its Equity
Benefit Plans and ERISA Benefit Plan to treat the service of the Continuing
Employees with the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company prior to the
Effective Time as service rendered to Parent or any affiliate of Parent for
purposes of eligibility to participate and vesting, including applicability
of minimum waiting periods for participation, but not for benefit accrual or
accrual rates. Promptly following the date of this Agreement, the Company
shall deliver to Parent a true and correct schedule setting forth such service
for each employee of the Company. Parent shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to ensure that no  



 

41  Continuing Employee, nor any eligible dependents of a Continuing Employee
who, at the Effective Time, are participating in the Company group health
plans, shall be excluded from Parents group health plans, or limited in
coverage thereunder, by reason of any waiting period restriction or pre-
existing condition limitation. Parent shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to ensure that Continuing Employees are given credit for amounts paid
under a Benefit Plan during the plan year that includes the Effective Time for
purposes of applying deductibles, co-payments, and out-of-pocket maximums, as
though such amounts had been paid in accordance with the terms and conditions
of a similar Benefit Plan maintained by Parent for the plan year in which the
Effective Time occurs. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall not be
required to provide any coverage, benefits, or credit that is not permitted
under the terms of Parents Equity Benefit Plans and ERISA Benefit Plans.



ARTICLE 5

Board Actions_.



(a) As promptly as practicable, but using its commercially reasonable efforts
to do so within seven days following the date of this Agreement, the Company
shall prepare and file with the SEC the Proxy Statement. Parent agrees to

thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC with respect thereto, the
Company (i) shall provide Parent with a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment on such document or response, (ii) shall consider the reasonable

or at the time of the Company Stockholders Meeting, or at the time of any
amendment or supplement thereof, contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading; _provided, however,_
that no representation is made by the Company with respect to statements made
in the Proxy Statement based on information supplied by Parent or Merger Sub
in writing expressly for inclusion in the Proxy Statement. The Proxy Statement
will comply as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the
Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.



(d) The Company may retain an agent, on terms or conditions reasonably
acceptable to Parent, for the purpose of soliciting proxies on behalf of the
Company for the Company Stockholders Meeting; _provided, however,_ that in the
event of termination of this Agreement (other than a termination pursuant to

may be payable), any and all fees and expenses of such agent shall be
reimbursed to the Company by Parent within five days of a written request by
the Company for reimbursement.

Effective Time authorizing the disposition by the Company Insiders of their
shares of Company Common Stock for cash and the disposition of their
outstanding Options, in each case pursuant to the transactions contemplated
hereby, for purposes of qualifying those dispositions for the exemption
provided pursuant to Rule 16b-3(e) under the Exchange Act. For purposes of
this Agreement, " _Company Insiders_ " means those officers and directors of
the Company who are subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of
the Exchange Act.



5.2 _Parent General Meeting; Other Actions_.



(a) Subject to any applicable Laws and regulations, Parent shall promptly
prepare and use its commercially reasonable efforts to post, as soon as
practicable following the date of this Agreement, the UK Prospectus. The
Company agrees to provide Parent with such cooperation in connection with the
preparation of the UK Prospectus as may be reasonably requested in writing by
Parent. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to accomplish the foregoing within seven
days following the date of this Agreement, and Parent agrees that it will:



(i) consult with the Company in a reasonably timely manner as to the form and
content of the UK Prospectus;



 

43 (ii) use its commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that in each case the
relevant draft(s) or redraft(s) of the UK Prospectus shall be provided as

the Company or the Merger on the draft(s) and redraft(s) referred to in

incorporate a unanimous recommendation from Parents Directors to Parents
shareholders to vote in favor of the shareholder resolutions necessary to
effect the Merger.



(c) Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent the Parent Directors from
withdrawing or modifying or proposing to withdraw or modify
their recommendation in favor the Parent Shareholder Approval (a " _Change of
Parent Recommendation_ ") if, in the exercise of their fiduciary obligations
(as determined in good faith by the Parent Directors) the failure to take such
actions would be reasonably likely to result in a breach of the Parent
Directors fiduciary obligations.



(d) If Parent is required to issue any supplementary prospectus pursuant to
section 87G of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (the "
_Supplementary Prospectus_ "), Parent shall notify the Company as soon as
reasonably practicable of such requirement and shall:



(i) consult with the Company as to the form and content of all the
documentation relating to the supplementary prospectus relating to
the Merger;



(ii) use its commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that in each case the
relevant draft(s) or redraft(s) of the Supplementary Prospectus shall be
provided as soon as practicable to the Company so that the Company and its
advisors can review and comment upon the relevant draft(s) and redraft(s) to
the extent related to the Company or the Merger; and



(iii) consider the reasonable comments of Company and its advisors related to
the Company or the Merger on the draft(s) and redraft(s) referred to in
Section 5.2(d)(ii).



(e) Parent agrees that none of the information included or incorporated by
reference in the UK Prospectus or any Supplementary Prospectus will (except to
the extent revised or superseded by amendments or supplements contemplated
hereby), at the date the UK Prospectus or any Supplementary Prospectus is
filed with the United Kingdoms Financial Services Authority or mailed to
Parents shareholders or at the time of the Parent General Meeting, contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the  



 

44  circumstances under which they are made, not misleading; _provided,
however,_ that no representation is made by Parent with respect to statements
made in the UK Prospectus or any Supplementary Prospectus based on
information supplied by the Company in writing expressly for inclusion in the
UK Prospectus or any Supplementary Prospectus. The UK Prospectus and any
Supplementary Prospectus will comply as to form in all material respects with
the requirements of the Prospectus Rules and the Listing Rules of the United
Kingdom Listing Authority made pursuant to the Financial Services and Markets
Act.



5.3 _Access to Information; Confidentiality; Cooperation with Financing_.



(a) During the Pre-Closing Period, the Company shall provide, and shall cause
its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives, to provide, to Parent
and to the Representatives of Parent, reasonable access during normal business
hours without undue disruption of their respective businesses, to all their
respective properties, books, contracts, commitments, personnel and records
(to the extent reasonably available) and, during such period, the Company
shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, promptly deliver or make
available to Parent (i) a copy of each report, schedule, form, statement and
other document filed by it, or correspondence or other written communications
received by it, from a Governmental Entity during such period pursuant to the
requirements of federal or state securities Laws and (ii) all other
information concerning its business, properties and personnel as Parent may
reasonably request; _provided, however,_ that the Company shall not be
required to permit any access, or to deliver or make available to Parent any
information, to the extent that in the reasonable judgment of the Company,
such action would (a) result in the disclosure of any trade secrets of third
parties, (b) violate any contractual obligation of the Company with respect
to confidentiality, (c) jeopardize protections afforded the Company under the
attorney-client privilege or the attorney work product doctrine, or (d)
violate any Law. Parent will hold, and will cause its respective officers,
employees, attorneys, accountants and other representatives to hold, any
nonpublic information in accordance with the terms of that certain letter
agreement dated October 3, 2005 (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ").



(b) During the Pre-Closing Period, the Company shall provide, and shall cause
its Subsidiaries and their respective officers, employees, representatives and
advisors, including legal and accounting, to provide, to Parent and to the
officers, employees, attorneys, accountants and other representatives of
Parent, all cooperation that may be reasonably requested by Parent in
connection with Parents financing of the consideration payable pursuant to
Section 2.1(c), including (i) participation in meetings, presentations, road
shows, due diligence sessions and sessions with rating agencies, and (ii)
assisting with the preparation of materials for rating agency presentations,
offering documents, private placement memoranda, prospectuses and similar
documents required in connection with Parents financing of the consideration
payable pursuant to Section 2.1(c); _provided, however,_ that nothing herein
shall require such cooperation to the extent it would interfere unreasonably
with the business or operations of the Company or its Subsidiaries or
otherwise result in any significant interference with the prompt and timely
discharge by such employees of their normal duties.



 

45 5.4 _Regulatory Approvals; Further Actions_.



(a) Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall promptly apply for, and
use commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the
other Parties in doing, all things that are necessary or advisable
to consummate and make effective the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including (i) the use of commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the conditions in Article 6 to be satisfied, (ii)
the obtaining of all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents and

or proceeding by, any Governmental Entity, (iii) the obtaining of all
necessary consents, approvals or waivers from third parties and (iv) the
execution and delivery of any additional instruments necessary to consummate
the transactions contemplated by, and to fully carry out the purposes of, this
Agreement.



(b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of Parent and the
Company shall, as promptly as practicable and before the expiration of any
relevant legal deadline file with the United States Federal Trade Commission
(the " _FTC_ ") and the United States Department of Justice (the " _DOJ_ "),
the notification and report form required for the transactions contemplated
hereby and any supplemental information requested in connection therewith
pursuant to the HSR Act, which forms shall specifically request early
termination of the waiting period prescribed by the HSR Act. Each of
the Company and Parent shall furnish to each others counsel such necessary
information and reasonable assistance as the other may request in connection
with its preparation of any filing or submission that may be necessary under
the HSR Act. 



(c) Each of Parent and the Company shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain promptly any clearance required under the HSR Act for the
consummation of the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby. Each of
Parent and the Company shall keep the other apprised of the status of any
communications with, and any inquiries or requests for additional information
from, the FTC and the DOJ and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
comply promptly with any such inquiry or request. No Party hereto shall
independently participate in any meeting or discussion with any Governmental
Entity in respect of any filings, applications, investigations, or other
inquiry without giving the other Parties hereto prior notice of the meeting
and, to the extent permitted by the relevant Governmental Entity, the
opportunity to attend and participate (which shall be limited to outside
antitrust counsel only). Parent will consult with the Company in connection
with the preparation of all written presentations, memoranda, briefs,
arguments, opinions, proposals, or other written submissions to any Government
Entity that are prepared in connection with obtaining the clearance required
under the HSR Act for the consummation of the Merger and the
transactions contemplated hereby. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) if the
taking of the particular action would have (or would reasonably be expected to
have) a material adverse effect on the business, condition (financial or
otherwise) or results of operations of the Surviving Corporation or Parent,
after the Merger, Parent shall not be required to (A) consent to the
divestiture, license or other disposition or holding separate (through the
establishment of a trust or otherwise) of any of its or its Affiliates
assets or any assets of the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries
or (B) consent to any other structural or conduct remedy or enter into any
settlement or agree to any Order regarding antitrust matters respecting the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) Parent and  



 

46  its Affiliates shall have no obligation to contest, in an administrative
proceeding or in court, any ruling, Order or other action of any Governmental
Entity or any other Person respecting the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.



(d) Parent and the Company shall instruct their respective counsel to
cooperate with each other and use commercially reasonable efforts
to facilitate and expedite the identification and resolution of any issues
arising under the HSR Act and the expiration of the applicable HSR Act waiting
period at the earliest practicable date. Such commercially reasonable efforts
and cooperation include counsels undertaking (i) to keep each other
appropriately informed of communications from and to personnel of the
reviewing Governmental Entity and (ii) to confer with each other regarding
appropriate contacts with and response to personnel of any Governmental
Entity.



5.5  _Takeover Statutes_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, in no event shall the approval of the Merger and this Agreement by
the Board of Directors of the Company under Section 203 of the DGCL be
withdrawn, revoked or modified by the Board of Directors of the Company. If
any Takeover Statute is or may become applicable to the Merger or any of the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, each Party and their
respective Board of Directors shall use reasonable efforts to promptly grant
such approvals and take such lawful actions as are necessary so that the
Merger and such other transactions may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement, and otherwise use
reasonable efforts to take such lawful actions to eliminate or minimize the
effects of such statute, and any regulations promulgated thereunder, on such
transactions.



5.6 _Public Announcements_. Unless otherwise required by applicable Law,
Parent and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand,
shall, to the extent practicable, consult with each other before issuing, and
give each other a reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon, any press
release or other public statements with respect to this Agreement, the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated hereby; _provided, however,_ that the
Company need not consult with Parent in connection with any press release or
public statement to be issued or made with respect to any Third Party
Proposal or with respect to any withholding, withdrawal, amendment,
modification or change of the Company Board Recommendation. The Parties agree
that the initial press release to be issued with respect to the entering into
of this Agreement shall be in a form mutually agreeable to the Parties.



5.7  _Directors  and Officers Insurance and Indemnification_.



(a) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall (and
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) fulfill and honor in all
respects all rights to indemnification, advancement of litigation expenses
and limitation of personal liability or exculpation existing in favor of the
current and former directors, officers and employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries under the provisions existing on the date of this Agreement in
the Companys Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws or the organizational
documents of any of the Companys Subsidiaries, or in any other
indemnification agreements between such individuals and either the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, that are in effect prior to the date of this
Agreement, and all such provisions shall, with respect to any matter existing
or occurring at or  



 

47  prior to the Effective Time (including the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement), survive the Effective Time.



(b) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) cause
to be maintained in effect the current policies of directors and officers
and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by the Company ( _provided_ that
the Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor policies of at least the
same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions that are no less
advantageous to former officers and directors of the Company) only
with respect to claims arising from facts existing or events which occurred
at or before the Effective Time; _provided, however,_ that in no event shall
the Surviving Corporation be required to expend pursuant to this Section
5.7(b) more than an aggregate amount as set forth on Schedule 5.7(b), which
amount equals 250% of the current aggregate annual premiums paid by the
Company for such insurance, and if the amount of the aggregate annual premiums
necessary to maintain or procure such insurance coverage exceeds such maximum
amount, the Surviving Corporation during such six-year period shall maintain
or procure as much coverage as possible for aggregate annual premiums not to
exceed such maximum amount. In lieu of the foregoing, Parent shall be
entitled to purchase a tail policy providing at least the same coverage and
amounts and containing terms and conditions that are no less advantageous to
former officers and directors of the Company as the current policies
of directors and officers and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by
the Company, covering the period of six years after the Effective Time.



(c) The provisions of this Section 5.7 are intended to be for the benefit of,
and will be enforceable by, each indemnified party, his or her heirs and his
or her representatives, and are in addition to, and not in substitution for,
any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such Person may
have by contract or otherwise.



5.8 _Stock Plans_.



(a) At the Effective Time, each Lower Priced Option outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (whether or not then vested or exercisable) shall
be assumed by Parent in accordance with the following provisions:



(i) Each such Lower Priced Option so assumed by Parent under this Agreement
(an " _Assumed Option_ ") shall continue to have, and be subject to, the same
terms and conditions (including the terms and conditions set forth in the
Stock Plan under which it was granted and the applicable stock option
agreement) as are in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, except
that (i) such Assumed Option shall be exercisable for that number of whole
Parent Ordinary Shares equal to the product of the number of shares of Company
Common Stock that were issuable upon exercise of such Option immediately
prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Option Exchange Ratio and
rounded down to the nearest whole number of Parent Ordinary Shares, and (ii)
the per share exercise price for the Parent Ordinary Shares issuable upon
exercise of such Assumed Option will be equal to the quotient determined by
dividing the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock at which such
Assumed Option was exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time by
the Option Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole cent. Except as
set forth in Section 5.8 of the Disclosure Schedule, neither the Merger nor
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will terminate  



 

48  any of the outstanding Lower Priced Options under the Stock Plans which are
to be assumed hereunder or accelerate the exercisability or vesting of
those Options or the Parent Ordinary Shares which will be subject to those
Assumed Options upon Parents assumption of the Lower Priced Options in the
Merger. It is the intention of the Parties that the Options assumed by Parent
hereunder qualify, to the maximum extent permissible, following the Effective
Time as "incentive stock options" as defined in Section 422 of the Code to the
extent those Assumed Options qualified as incentive stock options prior to the
Effective Time. 



(ii) None of the Higher Priced Options outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be assumed by Parent. Accordingly, each such Higher
Priced Option, whether or not then vested or exercisable, shall automatically
terminate at the Effective Time without any required action of the Company or
any Subsidiary or any required consent or approval of the holder of the
terminated Option and without any cash or other consideration payable to the
holder of the cancelled Option in connection with the cancellation of that
Option (subject to any right of the holder of such Option to exercise such
Option prior to the Effective Time), and the holder shall thereupon cease to
have any further right to acquire any shares of Company Common Stock (and
shall not obtain any right to acquire any Parent Ordinary Shares) under such
terminated Option.



(b) For purposes of this Agreement, (i) _"Option Exchange Ratio_ " shall be
equal to the quotient obtained by dividing the Per Share Amount by the Parent
Fair Market Value, and (ii) _"Parent Fair Market Value_ " means the volume
weighted average selling price per share of Parent Ordinary Shares as quoted
on the London Stock Exchange on the last trading day preceding the Closing
Date (as converted to U.S. Dollars at the Currency Exchange Rate as quoted in
the New York edition of _The Wall Street Journal_ on the Effective Time).



(c) For so long as Parent Ordinary Shares are listed for trading on the London
Stock Exchange or any other listing exchange, Parent shall cause all Parent
Ordinary Shares issued with respect to each Option so assumed to be admitted
to the Official List of the United Kingdom Listing Authority and to trading on
the London Stock Exchange or such other listing exchange prior to or
upon issuance of any such Parent Ordinary Shares.



5.9  _Notification of Certain Matters_.



(a) During the Pre-Closing Period, the Company shall give prompt notice to
Parent of (i) any fact, event or circumstance occurring after the date of this
Agreement that, individually or in the aggregate, (A) has caused or would
reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company, or
(B) would cause or constitute a material breach of any of the Companys
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement, (ii) any written notice (or other communication to any officer of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries) from any third party alleging that the
consent of such third party is or may be required in connection with the
Merger, (iii) any written notice (or other communication of which any officer
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries becomes aware) from any Governmental
Entity in connection with the Merger, or (iv) the pendency or existence of any
fact, event or circumstance that, if pending or in existence on the date of
this Agreement, would have been required to have been disclosed pursuant to
Section 3.1(h); _provided, however,_ that (x) the delivery of any notice
pursuant to this Section 5.9(a) shall not limit or otherwise affect any  



 

49  remedies available to Parent or prevent or cure any misrepresentations,
breach of warranty or breach of covenant, and (y) the delivery of any
notice pursuant to this Section 5.9(a) shall not be deemed to amend or
supplement the Disclosure Schedule or constitute an exception to any
representation or warranty of the Company; _provided, further,_ that the
failure to deliver any notice pursuant to this Section 5.9(b) shall not be
considered in determining whether the condition set forth in Section 6.2(b)
has been satisfied (and consequently whether Parent may terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(c)). 



(b) During the Pre-Closing Period, Parent shall give prompt notice to the
Company of (i) any fact, event or circumstance occurring after the date of
this Agreement that, individually or in the aggregate, would cause or
constitute a material breach of any of Parents or Merger Subs
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement, (ii) any written notice (or other communication of which any
officer of Parent becomes aware) from any third party alleging that the
consent of such third party is or may be required in connection with the
Merger, or (iii) any written notice (or other communication to any officer of
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries) from any Governmental Entity in connection
with the Merger or the transactions contemplated by the Financing Agreements;
_provided, however,_ that (x) the delivery of any notice pursuant to this
Section 5.9(b) shall not limit or otherwise affect any remedies available to
the Company or prevent or cure any misrepresentations, breach of warranty or
breach of covenant, and (y) the delivery of any notice pursuant to this
Section 5.9(b) shall not be deemed to constitute an exception to any
representation or warranty of Parent or Merger Sub; _provided, further,_ that
the failure to deliver any notice pursuant to this Section 5.9(b) shall not be
considered in determining whether the condition set forth in Section 6.3(b)
has been satisfied (and consequently whether the Company may terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(e)).



5.10 _Operations of Merger Sub_. During the Pre-Closing Period, Merger Sub
shall not, and Parent shall not permit Merger Sub to, engage in any other
business activities other than in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby and the obtaining of financing for the consideration
payable pursuant to Section 2.1(c).



5.11 _Financing Agreements_. Without the prior written consent of the Company,
which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed in situations where the
matter for which consent is sought would not reasonably be expected to
preclude or materially impede the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, Parent shall not terminate the Underwriting
Agreement or amend or modify any term of the Underwriting Agreement or agree
to or permit any termination of the Underwriting Agreement or any amendment
or modification to any term of the Underwriting Agreement, waive any provision
or remedy under the Underwriting Agreement, or fail to enforce any of its
rights or remedies under the Underwriting Agreement. Without the prior
written consent of the Company, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed in situations where the matter for which consent is sought would not
reasonably be expected to preclude or materially impede the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Parent shall not terminate
the Loan Agreement or amend or modify any term of the Loan Agreement or agree
to or permit any termination of the Loan Agreement or any amendment or
modification to any material term of the Loan Agreement, waive any material
provision or material remedy under the Loan Agreement, or fail to enforce any
of its material rights or material remedies under the Loan Agreement if any
such action or failure to take action  



 

50  would preclude or materially impede the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Parent shall keep the Company informed in
all material respects on a timely basis of any material modification or
material amendment to either of the Financing Agreements. Parent shall notify
the Company promptly (and in any event within two Business Days) of Parent
having Knowledge of (i) any inaccuracy in any representation or warranty in
the Financing Agreements of Parent or any other party to the Financing
Agreements, (ii) any breach of any covenant or agreement in either of the
Financing Agreements by Parent or any other party to either of the Financing
Agreements, (iii) the expiration, termination, modification or amendment of
the Financing Agreements, (iv) the existence of any fact, event or
circumstance that, individually or in the aggregate with all other facts,
events or circumstances, has had or would reasonably be expected to have an
adverse effect on Parents ability to obtain the financing contemplated by the
Financing Agreements, and (v) any proposal by any party to a Financing
Agreement to terminate, modify or amend such Financing Agreement in any
material respect. Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i) satisfy
all funding conditions set forth in the Financing Agreements, (ii)
consummate the financings contemplated by the Financing Agreements, including
by complying with all reasonable requests or requirements of the other parties
to the Financing Agreements, (iii) perform all of its obligations under the

(a) by mutual written consent of Parent and the Company duly authorized by
each of their respective Boards of Directors;



(b) by either Parent or the Company:



(i) if the Merger shall not have been consummated by April 15, 2006;

7.1(b)(i) and the right to extend the End Date under this Section 7.1(b)(i)

set forth in Section 6.1(d) not to be satisfied shall be in effect and shall

Material Breach);



 

54 (d) by Parent if (a) any director or officer of the Company shall have

representations or warranties of Parent or Merger Sub shall have become
inaccurate and in each case is incapable of being cured, or has not been
cured, within 20 days after the Companys giving written notice to Parent of
such breach or inaccuracy, which breach or inaccuracy would give rise to the

Company Material Breach);

assets or operations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and is based
upon a breach by the Company of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement made in this Agreement.

further approval by the shareholders of Parent without the further approval of
such shareholders. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument

waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on

this Agreement shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to,
any subsequent or other failure to comply. The failure or delay of any Party
to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall
not constitute a waiver of such rights.

the masculine as well as to the feminine and neuter genders of such term. Any
agreement, instrument or statute defined or referred to herein or in any

instrument or statute as from time to time amended, modified or supplemented,
including (in the case of agreements or instruments) by waiver or consent and

signed by each of the Parties and delivered to the other Parties.



8.6 _Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement
(including the documents and instruments referred to herein) and the
Confidentiality Agreement (i) constitute the entire agreement, and supersede
all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the
Parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and (ii) except
for the provisions of Article 2, and Section 5.7, are not intended to confer
upon any Person other

the foregoing, (a) Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge that the Company has not

laws thereof.



8.8 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by
operation of Law or otherwise by any Party without the prior written consent
of the other Parties. Any assignment in violation of the preceding sentence

8.9 _Consent to Jurisdiction_. Each of the Parties hereto irrevocably and
unconditionally submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of either (a) the Court
of Chancery of the State of Delaware or (b) any Federal court of the United
States of America sitting in the State of Delaware, for the purposes of any
suit, action or other proceeding arising out of this Agreement or any
transaction contemplated hereby (and each agrees that no such action, suit or
proceeding relating to this Agreement shall be brought by it or any of its
Affiliates except in such courts). Each of the Parties further agrees that, to
the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, service of any process,
summons, notice or document by U.S. registered mail to such Partys
respective address set forth above shall be effective service of process for
any action, suit or proceeding in Delaware with respect to any matters to
which it has submitted to jurisdiction as set forth above in the
immediately preceding sentence. Each of the Parties irrevocably and
unconditionally waives (and agrees not to plead or claim) any objection to the
laying of venue of any action, suit or proceeding arising out of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby in (a) any Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware or (b) any Federal court of the United
States of America sitting in the State of Delaware, or that any such action,
suit or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an
inconvenient forum.



8.10 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. Each Party hereby waives, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law, any right it may have to a trial by jury in

that no representative, agent or attorney of any other Party has represented,
expressly or otherwise, that such Party would not, in the event of any action,
suit or proceeding, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver and (ii)
acknowledges that it and the other  



 

64  Parties have been induced to enter into this Agreement, by, among other
things, the mutual waiver and certifications in this Section 8.10.

the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is
accordingly agreed that the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement, this being in addition to any
other remedy in any Delaware State court or any Federal court of the United
States of America sitting in the State of Delaware to which they are entitled
at law or in equity.



8.12 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid
or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect the
validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions hereof or
the validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in any
other situation or in any other jurisdiction.

Surviving Corporation duly performs, satisfies and discharges on a
timely basis each of the covenants, obligations and liabilities of Merger Sub
