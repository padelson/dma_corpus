until such director\'s or officer\'s successor is duly elected or appointed
and qualified, or until such director\'s or officer\'s earlier death,

of incorporation and bylaws.



2.2 Conversion of Shares.



(a) At the Effective Time, each share of Merger Sub Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, be converted into and
thereafter evidence in the aggregate one (1) fully paid and nonassessable
share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Surviving Company.
Each share of Merger Sub Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time, when converted in accordance with this Section 2.2(a),
shall no longer be outstanding, shall automatically be canceled and shall
cease to exist.

(b) At the Effective Time, each Common Share issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Dissenting Shares) shall,
by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder
thereof, be converted into and thereafter 

evidence the right to receive, without interest, the Per Share Price and a

Consideration Amount, if any, in accordance with such definition (and sections
referenced therein), upon delivery of the Transmittal Documents in accordance
with Section 2.5. Each Common Share issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time, when converted in accordance with this Section 2.2(b),

interest, the Per Share Price in respect of each such Common Share and a
contingent right to receive the applicable portion of the Additional

demanded such holder\'s right to appraisal for such shares in accordance with
Section 262 of the DGCL (and who has neither effectively withdrawn nor lost
his, her or its right to such appraisal) ("Dissenting Shares"), shall not be
converted pursuant to Section 2.2(b) hereof into the right to receive the Per
Share Price or a contingent right to receive the applicable portion of the
Additional Consideration Amount, if any, in accordance with the definition
thereof (and sections referenced therein) and the holder thereof shall be
entitled only to such rights as are granted by the DGCL. If, after the
Effective Time, such holder fails to perfect or withdraws or otherwise loses
his, her or its right to appraisal, such Dissenting Shares shall be treated as
if they had been converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive
the Per Share Price and a contingent right to receive the applicable portion

definition thereof (and sections referenced therein), to which such holder
would have been entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(b), without interest thereon,

not, except with the prior written consent of the Company (such consent not to
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), make any payment with
respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands. Parent
acknowledges that the Company shall be permitted (in its sole discretion) to
negotiate, settle or otherwise enforce rights with respect to any appraisal
demand so long as (a) in any such case, none of Parent, the Company or any

related thereto at or after the Closing and (b) in the case of any such
settlement, (i) the Company pays the entire amount and all related fees, costs
and expenses thereof prior to the Closing, (ii) such settlement does not
contain an admission of wrongdoing on the part of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary, (iii) such settlement provides for the full and unconditional
release of the Company in a reasonable form in connection with the underlying
demand and (iv) the Company consults with Parent prior to such settlement and
provides notice of such settlement to Parent.

(a) At the Effective Time, each warrant to purchase Common Shares (a

whether then exercisable or vested, shall, by virtue of the Merger and without
any action on the part of the holder thereof, be deemed to be exercised and
converted into the right of the holder thereof to receive, as soon as
reasonably practicable after the Effective Time and upon delivery of the
Transmittal Documents in accordance with Section 2.5, an amount in cash,

number of Common Shares subject to such Warrant(s) immediately prior to the
Effective Time and a contingent right to receive the applicable portion of the
Additional Consideration Amount, if any, in accordance with the definition
thereof (and sections referenced therein). Each Warrant outstanding

Trust Company, LLC, shall no longer be outstanding, shall automatically be
canceled and shall cease to exist. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Section 2.4(a) or elsewhere in this Agreement, the right of each holder
of Warrants to receive payment of any portion of the Escrow Amounts and the
Equityholder Representative Expense Fund Amount in respect of such holder\'s
Warrants shall be a contingent right to receive any such payment in accordance
with, and subject to, the applicable terms and provisions of this Agreement,
including Section 2.7, Section 2.16, Section 2.17 and Section 6.12, and the
Escrow Agreement, in each case as applicable.

Appreciation Agreement issued under a Company Stock Plan (each, a "Stock
Appreciation Right") that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time, whether vested or unvested, or exercised but unsettled, except with
respect to any Specified SAR Liability, shall be converted into the right of
the holder thereof to receive, as soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time, an amount in cash, without interest, equal to (i) the absolute
amount, if any, by which the Per Share Price exceeds the per share base price
of such Stock Appreciation Right (taking into account all applicable dividend
adjustments) multiplied by (ii) the number of Common Shares subject to such
Stock Appreciation Right immediately prior to the Effective Time and a
contingent right to receive the applicable portion of the Additional
Consideration Amount, if any, in accordance with the definition thereof (and
sections referenced therein). Each Stock Appreciation Right outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, when converted in accordance with
this Section 2.4(b), shall no longer be outstanding, shall automatically be
canceled and shall cease to exist. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Section 2.4(b) or elsewhere in this Agreement, the right of each holder
of Stock 

Appreciation Rights to receive payment of any portion of the Escrow Amounts

holder\'s Stock Appreciation Rights shall be a contingent right to receive any

provisions of this Agreement, including Section 2.7, Section 2.16, Section
2.17 and Section 6.12, and the Escrow Agreement, in each case as applicable.
For purposes of this Section 2.4(b) and Section 2.5, except in connection with
a Specified SAR Liability, a Stock Appreciation Right that has been exercised
but which remains unsettled as of immediately prior to the Effective Time

Time; and



(iii) to the Surviving Company, on behalf of and for further distribution to

event less than one (1) Business Day, prior to the Closing Date, the Company
shall prepare and deliver to Parent good faith estimates and reasonably
detailed computations of Company Cash and Cash Equivalents; provided, however,
that such amount will be reduced by the aggregate amount of Cash and Cash
Equivalents paid by the Company or any Company Subsidiary pursuant to Section
2.12(a) ("Estimated Company Cash and Cash Equivalents"), the Tax Benefit
Amount ("Estimated Tax Benefit Amount"), Company Working Capital ("Estimated
Company Working Capital"), Company Fees and Expenses that will remain unpaid
immediately prior to the Effective Time ("Estimated Company Fees and
Expenses"), Indebtedness for Borrowed Money of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries that will remain unpaid immediately prior to the Effective Time;
provided, however, that such amount will be reduced by the aggregate amount of
Indebtedness for Borrowed Money paid by the Company or any Company Subsidiary
pursuant to Section 2.12(a) ("Estimated Indebtedness for Borrowed Money") and
Current Income Taxes that will remain unpaid immediately prior to the
Effective Time ("Estimated Current Income Taxes"), each calculated in
accordance with their respective definition herein, and, to the extent
applicable, the Accounting Principles. The computations of the Estimated
Adjustment Items calculated in accordance with this Section 2.7(a), absent
manifest mathematical error, shall be conclusive for purposes of determining
the Adjustment Items to be included in the calculation of the Closing Date
Merger Consideration payable at the Closing, but shall be subject to
adjustment after the Closing pursuant to this Section 2.7.



(b)Post-Closing Determination. Within the later of (i) ninety (90) calendar
days after the Closing Date and, if applicable, (ii) within five (5) Business
Days of the final determination of the Specified SAR Liability pursuant to the
applicable award agreement referred to in Section 1.1(b) of the Disclosure
Schedule, Parent shall prepare and deliver to the Equityholder Representative
good faith determinations and reasonably detailed computations of the
Adjustment Items, each calculated in accordance with their respective
definition herein, and, to the extent applicable, the Accounting Principles.
From the date of delivery of such computations by Parent until the Adjustment
Items are finally determined pursuant to this Section 2.7(b), Parent shall
make available to the Equityholder Representative, at reasonable times during
normal business hours and with reasonable advance notice, all records, work
papers and appropriate personnel used in preparing the computations of the
Adjustment Items or necessary to understand a component of the computation
thereof, in each case solely for purposes of Equityholder Representative\'s
review of Parent\'s computations of the Adjustment Items. If the Equityholder
Representative disagrees with the computation of the Adjustment Items as
calculated by Parent, the Equityholder Representative may, within thirty (30)
calendar days after receipt of such calculations in accordance with this
Section 2.7(b), deliver a notice (an "Objection Notice") on behalf of the
Equityholders to Parent providing reasonable detail of the reasons for such
disagreement and setting forth the Equityholder Representative\'s calculation
of the Adjustment Items in dispute to the extent then known. The Objection
Notice shall specify all Adjustment Items and amounts thereof as to which the
Equityholder 

Representative disagrees, and the Equityholder Representative, on behalf of
the Equityholders, shall be deemed to have agreed with all other Adjustment
Items and amounts thereof as determined by Parent and such Adjustment Items
and amounts shall be deemed to be finally determined and shall be final,
conclusive and binding on the parties hereto and the Equityholders. If the
Equityholder Representative does not deliver an Objection Notice within such
thirty (30) calendar day period, then the Adjustment Items as determined by
Parent shall be deemed to be finally determined and shall be final, conclusive
and binding on the parties hereto and the Equityholders. If the Equityholder
Representative delivers an Objection Notice to Parent within such thirty (30)
calendar day period, the Equityholder Representative and Parent shall use
their respective commercially reasonable efforts and shall reasonably
cooperate in good faith to resolve any disagreement as to the computation of
the Adjustment Items in dispute as soon as practicable, but if they cannot
reach a final resolution within thirty (30) calendar days after Parent has
received the Objection Notice, Parent and the Equityholder Representative on
behalf of the Equityholders shall, at the election of either party, jointly
retain RSM US LLP or, if agreed to by Parent and the Equityholder
Representative, a nationally recognized accounting firm of comparable stature
acceptable to both the Equityholder Representative and Parent (the "Accounting
Firm"). Parent and the Equityholder Representative shall direct the Accounting
Firm to render a determination within thirty (30) calendar days after its
retention and Parent and the Equityholder Representative and their respective
agents shall reasonably cooperate in good faith with the Accounting Firm
during its engagement. The Accounting Firm shall consider only those items and
amounts set forth in the Objection Notice that Parent and the Equityholder
Representative are unable to resolve. In resolving any disputed item, the
Accounting Firm may not assign a value to any item greater than the greatest
value for such item claimed by either party or less than the smallest value
for such item claimed by either party. In rendering its determination, the
Accounting Firm shall act as an expert and not as an arbitrator. The
Accounting Firm\'s determination shall be based solely on (i) the definitions
of the Adjustment Items set forth in this Agreement, (ii) the Accounting
Principles and (iii) written materials submitted by the Equityholder
Representative and Parent (or by in-person telephonic conferences if mutually
agreed by Parent, the Equityholder Representative and the Accounting Firm) and
not by independent review. The determination of the disputed Adjustment Items
by the Accounting Firm shall be conclusive and binding upon the parties hereto
and the Equityholders. Parent, on the one hand, and the Equityholder
Representative, on the other hand, shall bear the costs and expenses of the
Accounting Firm based on the percentage which the portion of the contested
amount not awarded to each party bears to the amount actually contested by or
on behalf of such party, as determined by the Accounting Firm. By way of
example and not by way of limitation, if the Equityholder Representative seeks
a $700,000 aggregate upward adjustment pursuant to this Section 2.7(b) and the
Accounting Firm determines that there shall be a $400,000 upward adjustment
thereto, then the Equityholder Representative shall be responsible for three-
sevenths (3/7th) of the fees and expenses and Parent shall be responsible for
four-sevenths (4/7th) of the fees and expenses. The Adjustment Items as
finally determined pursuant to this Section 2.7(b), are referred to herein as
the "Final Company Cash and Cash Equivalents," "Final Tax Benefit Amount,"
"Final Company Working Capital," "Final Company Fees and Expenses," "Final
Indebtedness for Borrowed Money" and "Final Income Taxes," respectively.







(c)Payment From Adjustments.



(i)Payment by Parent and the Surviving Company. If the Final Adjustment Amount
exceeds the Estimated Adjustment Amount, Parent shall, within two (2) Business
Days after the determination thereof, pay (or cause to be paid) by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to the (A) Paying Agent, for further
distribution to the Stockholders and the holders of Warrants and (B) Surviving
Company, for further distribution to the holders of Stock Appreciation Rights,
an aggregate amount equal to the difference between the Final Adjustment
Amount and the Estimated Adjustment Amount, and the Purchase Price Adjustment
Escrow Fund (including any interest earned thereon except to the extent
specified in the Escrow Agreement) shall be promptly distributed to the (A)
Paying Agent, for further distribution to the Stockholders and the holders of
Warrants and (B) Surviving Company, for further distribution to the holders of
Stock Appreciation Rights, in accordance herewith and with the Escrow
Agreement, with each Equityholder receiving his, her or its pro rata amount
thereof, equal to (x) such Equityholder\'s Applicable Percentage as set forth
on Final Schedule I multiplied by (y) the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow
Fund (including any interest earned thereon except to the extent specified in
the Escrow Agreement).



(ii)Payment to Parent. If the Final Adjustment Amount is less than the
Estimated Adjustment Amount (the amount of such deficit being the "Deficit
Adjustment"), the amount of such difference, if less than or equal to the
Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Fund (including any interest earned thereon),
shall be paid to Parent by withdrawal of such amount from the Purchase Price
Adjustment Escrow Fund, and the remainder, if any, of the Purchase Price
Adjustment Escrow Fund shall be immediately distributed to the (A) Paying
Agent, for further distribution to the Stockholders and the holders of
Warrants and (B) Surviving Company, for further distribution to the holders of
Stock Appreciation Rights, with each Equityholder receiving his, her or its
pro rata amount thereof, equal to (A) such Equityholder\'s Applicable
Percentage as set forth on Final Schedule I multiplied by (B) the Purchase
Price Adjustment Escrow Fund (including any interest earned thereon), in each
case, in accordance herewith and with the Escrow Agreement. If the Deficit
Adjustment is greater than the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Fund, the
Parent Parties shall be entitled only to the amount then in the Purchase Price
Adjustment Escrow Fund and no further amount. The Purchase Price Adjustment

for, and the amount therein shall serve as the limit of, the Deficit
Adjustment (other than any claim for actual and intentional fraud relating to
the estimates delivered by the Company pursuant to Section 2.7(a)).



(d)Adjustment to Merger Consideration for Tax Purposes. The post-Closing
adjustments set forth in this Section 2.7 and any payments pursuant to Section

applicable, the wire transfer instructions for such Person. All Company Fees
and Expenses that remain unpaid immediately prior to the Effective Time and
which have been deducted from Closing Date Merger Consideration shall be paid

Escrow Account") with the Escrow Agent, pursuant to the Escrow Agreement. The
Escrow Agent shall hold the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Fund and all
interest and other amounts earned thereon in escrow pursuant to the Escrow
Agreement. The amount so withheld from each Equityholder shall be equal to (a)
the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Amount multiplied by (b) such
Equityholder\'s Applicable Percentage as set forth on Final Schedule I. The
Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Fund shall be distributed in accordance with
Sections 2.7(c)(i) and (ii) and the terms of the Escrow Agreement.

from each Equityholder shall be equal to (i) the Equityholder 

Representative Expense Fund Amount multiplied by (ii) such Equityholder\'s
Applicable Percentage as set forth on Final Schedule I. The Equityholder

successor Equityholder Representative as provided herein), and the applicable
portion of the Equityholder Representative Expense Fund Amount that the
Equityholder Representative determines, in its reasonable discretion, may be

discretion, to round any individual amounts up or down by up to $0.01.



2.12Repayment of Indebtedness for Borrowed Money.



(a)The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to use Free Cash in excess of

case, in accordance with the requirements and conditions of such payoff letter
and (iv) cause all agreements and arrangements (other than those that, by
their terms, survive termination) with respect to any Indebtedness for
Borrowed Money of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to be terminated
and to cause all guarantees and Liens in respect thereof to be terminated or
released, in each case, in accordance with the requirements and conditions of
such payoff letter. The Company shall take all necessary action reasonably
requested by Parent in writing prior to the Closing that is necessary to
facilitate Parent effecting the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.12(b).



2.13 Transfer Taxes. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,
registration and other similar transaction Taxes and fees (including any
penalties and interest), if any, imposed 

solely and directly by reason of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement ("Transfer Taxes") shall be borne entirely by Parent and shall be
paid by the Surviving Company when due, and the Surviving Company will, at its
own expense, file all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with
respect to all such Transfer Taxes, and, if required by applicable Law, the
Equityholder Representative, on behalf of the Equityholders, will join in the
timely execution and timely filing of any such Tax Returns and other

2.14 FIRPTA. The Company shall deliver to Parent a certificate, dated as of
the Closing Date, in form and substance consistent with the requirements of
Treasury Regulations Section 1.897-2(h) and 1.1445-2(c)(3), certifying that
equity interests in the Company are not "United States real property
interests," within the meaning of Section 897 of the Code (a "FIRPTA
Certificate"); provided, that if the Company is unable to or does not deliver
the certificate described in the preceding sentence, the Company shall be
considered to have complied with its obligations under this Section 2.14 and
Parent, the Surviving Company and the Paying Agent shall be permitted to
withhold from the Gross Merger Consideration payable to any Equityholder who
does not provide a duly completed United States Internal Revenue Service Form
W-9, an amount equal to the amount of Taxes required to be withheld under
Section 1445.



2.15Withholding. Except for (i) applicable employee withholding Taxes, (ii)
U.S. federal income backup withholding Tax as a result of an Equityholder
failing to provide a duly completed United States Internal Revenue Service
Form W-9 or W-8, or (iii) any withholding Taxes required under Section 1445
that are required to be withheld from payments to any Equityholder not
providing a United States Internal Revenue Service Form W-9 if the Company
does not provide a FIRPTA Certificate, to the knowledge of the parties, after
obtaining advice of qualified counsel, there is no requirement that any Taxes
are required to be withheld by any Party, the Surviving Company or the Paying
Agent under this Agreement, as of the date hereof. To the extent that Parent
becomes aware of any such requirement (other than withholding described in
clauses (i)-(iii) of the preceding sentence) it will notify the Company of
such requirements as soon as reasonably possible, and in any event at least
fifteen (15) Business Days prior to the Closing Date and provide a reasonable
opportunity for the Company or applicable Equityholder to provide forms or
evidence that would exempt such amounts from withholding. Parent, the
Surviving Company (including through its payroll system) and the Paying Agent
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Gross Merger Consideration
such amounts described in clauses (i)-(iii) of the first sentence of this
Section 2.15, and any amounts required to be deducted and withheld from the
Gross Merger Consideration as a result of any change in Laws after the date
hereof, in each case, which Parent and the Company reasonably agree are
required to be deducted and withheld with respect to payments hereunder. Any
amounts withheld and paid over to the applicable Governmental Entity pursuant
to the preceding sentence will be treated for all purposes of this Agreement
as having been made to the Person in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made.



2.16Tax Escrow.

has not been satisfied, the Tax Escrow Amount shall be withheld from the
Closing Date Merger Consideration otherwise payable in respect of the Common

Appreciation Rights and deposited by Parent into a separate account (the "Tax
Escrow Account") with the Escrow Agent, pursuant to the Escrow Agreement. The
Escrow Agent shall hold the Tax Escrow Fund and all interest and other amounts
earned thereon in escrow pursuant to the Escrow Agreement. The amount so
withheld from each Equityholder shall be equal to (i) the Tax Escrow Amount
multiplied by (ii) such Equityholder\'s Applicable Percentage as set forth on
Final Schedule I. The Tax Escrow Fund shall be distributed in accordance with
this Section 2.16 and the terms of the Escrow Agreement.



(b)Each of the parties hereto has determined that all the parties hereto share
certain common interests in defending against the Pending Tax Claims. The
Company shall, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries to, use commercially
reasonable efforts to satisfy in full the Specified Tax Liability Condition
prior to Closing. The Company, at its sole expense (and any such expenses
shall in no case be included in the definition of Specified Tax Liabilities),
shall control (in its sole discretion) the defense, negotiation, compromise,
and settlement of the Pending Tax Claims prior to the Closing, subject to the
other requirements of this Section 2.16; provided, that Parent\'s prior
written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned)
shall be required prior to the Company or any Company Subsidiary abandoning,
compromising, settling or otherwise satisfying the Pending Tax Claims prior to
Closing if the Specified Tax Liability Condition will not be satisfied prior
to Closing. The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide
regular updates to Parent on the status of the Pending Tax Claims as well as
promptly provide copies of all emails, correspondence or other documentation
received from, or provided to, the IRS or any Governmental Entity in
connection with the Pending Tax Claims.



(c)Following the Closing, Parent and the Surviving Company shall provide to
the Equityholder Representative prompt written notice of any written or oral
communications from the IRS or any Governmental Entity related to the
Specified Tax Liabilities; provided that any written communication relating
both to the Specified Tax Liabilities and other Tax liabilities may be
appropriately redacted to the extent relating solely to the other Tax
liabilities when provided to the Equityholder Representative. Following the
Closing, with respect to any audit, examination, contest, litigation or other
judicial, administrative or arbitral action, suit, hearing or proceeding
before the IRS, any division or bureau thereof, or any other Governmental
Entity, in each case solely with respect to the Specified Tax Liabilities
involving any of Company, Surviving Company or any Company Subsidiary or
preparation and filing of any amended state income Tax Returns solely related
to the Specified Tax Liabilities (each a "Tax Proceeding"), the Equityholder
Representative shall have the exclusive right to control, settle, resolve or
otherwise satisfy or dispose of any such Tax Proceeding for a period of one
(1) year following the Closing Date; provided, that the Equityholder
Representative shall use commercially reasonable efforts to promptly settle,
resolve or otherwise satisfy or dispose of any such Tax Proceeding; provided,
further, that the consent of Parent shall be required (not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed) for any settlement, resolution or other
satisfaction of a Tax Proceeding to the extent the amount of such settlement,
resolution, satisfaction or disposition plus the actual amount or reasonably
expected amount to settle, resolve, satisfy or dispose of all other Tax
Proceedings exceeds or reasonably would exceed the Tax Escrow Amount.
Beginning one year and one day after the Closing Date, Parent and the Company
shall have the exclusive right to control, settle, resolve or otherwise or
dispose of any Tax Proceeding. 



(d)Following the Closing, promptly after any Pending Tax Claim has been
settled, resolved or otherwise satisfied pursuant to this Section 2.16, Parent
and the Equityholder Representative shall deliver a joint written instruction
to the Escrow Agent, in the form required by the Escrow Agreement, instructing
the Escrow Agent (i) to release from the Tax Escrow Account to the Surviving
Company or any Company Subsidiary an amount equal to the lesser of (A) the
Specified Tax Liabilities due and owing by the Surviving Company or any
Company Subsidiary as a result of the resolution of the Pending Tax Claim and
(B) the amount remaining in the Tax Escrow Account and (ii) to release from
the Tax Escrow Account an amount equal to the excess, if any, of (A) the
applicable Pending Tax Claim Escrow Amount (including a pro rata portion of
any interest earned thereon except to the extent specified in the Escrow
Agreement) over (B) the amount described in clause (i)(A) of this sentence,
which shall be promptly distributed to the (I) Paying Agent, for further
distribution to the Stockholders and the holders of Warrants and (II)
Surviving Company, for further distribution to the holders of Stock
Appreciation Rights, in accordance herewith and with the Escrow Agreement,
with each Equityholder receiving his, her or its pro rata amount thereof,
equal to (x) such Equityholder\'s Applicable Percentage as set forth on Final
Schedule I multiplied by (y) the aggregate amount being released for the
benefit of the Equityholders pursuant to this Section; provided that, and
notwithstanding the above, the amount to be released pursuant to clause (ii)
with respect to a Pending Tax Claim for federal Taxes shall be no greater than
the amount that will result in the remaining balance in the Tax Escrow Account
to equal $1,000,000 following release of such clause (ii) amount. Following
the earlier of (i) the settlement, resolution or other satisfaction of all
Pending Tax Claims and (ii) the two (2) year anniversary of the Closing Date,
and after any payments described in the first sentence of this Section 2.16(d)
have been made, Parent and the Equityholder Representative shall deliver a
joint written instruction to the Escrow Agent, in the form required by the
Escrow Agreement, instructing the Escrow Agent to release any remaining funds
from the Tax Escrow Account which shall be promptly distributed to the (I)
Paying Agent, for further distribution to the Stockholders and the holders of
Warrants and (II) Surviving Company, for further distribution to the holders
of Stock Appreciation Rights, in accordance herewith and with the Escrow
Agreement, with each Equityholder receiving his, her or its pro rata amount
thereof, equal to (x) such Equityholder\'s Applicable Percentage as set forth
on Final Schedule I multiplied by (y) the amount then remaining in the Tax
Escrow Account



(e)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, if the Specified
Tax Liability Condition has been satisfied in full on or prior to the Closing
Date, (i) the Tax Escrow Amount shall not be withheld from the Closing Date
Merger Consideration and instead shall be paid to the Equityholders in
accordance with this Agreement and (ii) the parties hereto shall promptly
amend the form of Escrow Agreement attached hereto to reflect the deletion of
the Tax Escrow Account.



2.17FCC Repack Reimbursement Amount. If, after the Closing, Parent or the
Surviving Company (or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates)
receives any of the FCC Repack Reimbursement Amount, Parent shall, within five
(5) Business Days of the end of the fiscal quarter such amount was received,
(a) pay (or cause the Surviving Company to pay) by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the Paying Agent, for further distribution to
the Stockholders and the holders of Warrants, an amount equal to the portion
of such FCC 

Repack Reimbursement Amount that would enable the Paying Agent to distribute
to each such Equityholder his, her or its pro rata amount thereof equal to (i)
such Equityholder\'s Applicable Percentage as set forth on Final Schedule I
multiplied by (ii) such FCC Repack Reimbursement Amount and (b) cause the
Surviving Company to distribute the remaining portion of such FCC Repack
Reimbursement Amount to the holders of Stock Appreciation Rights in each case
in an amount equal to (i) such Equityholder\'s Applicable Percentage as set

contributed to or required to be contributed to by the Company or any Company
Subsidiary or by any trade or business, whether or not incorporated (an "ERISA
Affiliate"), that together with the Company or any Company Subsidiary would be
deemed a "single employer" within the meaning of Section 4001 of the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder ("ERISA"), for the benefit of any employee
or former employee of the Company or any Company Subsidiary (individually, a
"Plan" and, collectively, the "Plans"). No ERISA Affiliate sponsors or
maintains a Plan.



(b) With respect to each of the Plans, the Company has heretofore made
available to the Parent true and complete copies of each of the following
documents, to the extent applicable: (i) each Plan (including all amendments
thereto); (ii) the most recent annual report, if required under ERISA; (iii)

satisfy would not reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in
the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect, and no condition exists that
presents a risk to the Company, any Company Subsidiary or any ERISA Affiliate
of incurring a liability under Title IV of ERISA other than conditions that
would not reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. Each Plan intended to be "qualified"
within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code (a "Qualified Plan") has
received a favorable determination letter or opinion letter from the Internal
Revenue Service as to its qualification and, to the Knowledge of the Company,
no event has occurred that could reasonably be expected to result in
disqualification of such Plan.



(d) Each Plan has been operated and administered in accordance with its terms
and applicable Law in all respects, including ERISA, the Code and other
applicable Laws relating to Taxes, except where failure to do so would not
reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect.



(e) Except as set forth in Section 4.9(e) of the Disclosure Schedule or as
required by applicable Law, no Plan provides benefits, including death or
medical benefits

directors or contractors of the Company or any Company Subsidiary beyond their
retirement or other termination of service other than as required by
applicable Law.



(f)Except as set forth in Section 4.9(f) of the Disclosure Schedule, neither
the performance by the Company of this Agreement nor the consummation of the

any other event) will (i) entitle any current or former director, officer,
contractor or employee of the Company or any ERISA Affiliate to severance pay,
retention pay, unemployment compensation or any other payment (whether during
or after employment) or (ii) accelerate the time of payment or vesting, or
increase the amount of compensation due any such director, officer, contractor
or employee. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is a party to any
agreement, contract or arrangement that would result, separately or in the
aggregate, in the payment of any "excess parachute payments" within the
meaning of Section 280G of the Code, result in the excise tax imposed by
Section 4999 of the Code, or result in a requirement to pay a Tax gross-up or
similar make-whole payment to any officer, employee, director or contractor.



(g)All reports and disclosures relating to each Plan required to be filed with
or furnished to any Governmental Entity (including the Internal Revenue
Service, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation and the Department of
Labor), Plan participants or beneficiaries have been filed or furnished in all

other proceeding (other than those relating to routine claims for benefits) is
pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened in writing with
respect to any Plan or any fiduciary or service provider thereof. All payments
and/or contributions required to have been made with respect to all Plans
either have been made in full and on a timely basis or have been accrued in
accordance with the terms of the applicable Plan and applicable Law.



(i) Except as set forth in Section 4.9(i) of the Disclosure Schedule, no Plan
that is a "welfare plan" within the meaning of Section 3(1) of ERISA is a
self-insured arrangement, and, with respect to each such Plan that is funded
in whole or in part through an insurance policy, the Company does not have any
liability in the nature of retroactive rate adjustment, loss-sharing
arrangement or other actual or contingent liability arising wholly or
partially out of events occurring on or before the date of this Agreement or
is reasonably expected to have such liability with respect to periods through
the Closing.



(j) Except as contemplated by this Agreement, neither the Company nor any of
its ERISA Affiliates has announced its intention to modify or terminate any
Qualified Plan or adopt any arrangement or plan which, once established, would
come within the definition of a Qualified Plan. Each asset held under each
Qualified Plan may be liquidated or terminated without the imposition of any
redemption fee, surrender charge or comparable liability.



(k) Except as could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
Effect, the Company, each ERISA Affiliate and each Plan that is a "group
health plan" as defined in Section 733(a)(1) of ERISA (each, a "Health Plan")

in all material respects with the Patient Protection Affordable Care Act, Pub.
L. No. 111-148 ("ACA"), the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of

and (ii) has been in compliance in all material respects with all Health Care
Reform Laws since March 23, 2010, in the case of each of clauses (i) and (ii),
to the extent the Health Care Reform Laws are applicable thereto. Neither the
Company nor any ERISA Affiliate or Health Plan has incurred (and to the
Knowledge of the Company, nothing has occurred, and no condition or
circumstance exists, that could reasonably be expected to subject the Company,
any ERISA Affiliate or any Health Plan to) any penalty or excise Tax under
Sections 4980D, 4980H or 4980I of the Code or any other provision of the
Health Care Reform Laws.



(l)Except as could not be reasonably be expected to result in a Material
Adverse Effect, the Company has not engaged in any "prohibited transaction,"
as defined in Section 4975 of the Code or ERISA Section 406 with respect to
the Plans, and, to the Knowledge of the Company, all "fiduciaries," as defined
in Section 3(21) of ERISA, with respect to the Plans, have complied with the
requirements of Section 404 of ERISA. The Company has in effect fiduciary
liability insurance covering each fiduciary of the Plans.



(m) Except as would not result in any material liability to the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries (taken as a whole), each individual who renders
services to the Company or any Company Subsidiary and who is classified by the
Company or any Company Subsidiary as having the status of an independent
contractor or consultant is and has at all times been properly characterized
as such for Tax withholding purposes, federal income Tax purposes and Plan
eligibility purposes.



(n)(i) Each Plan that is a "nonqualified deferred compensation plan" (as
defined in Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code), including each award thereunder,
has been operated since such Plan\'s inception in good faith compliance with
the applicable provisions of Section 409A of the Code and the Treasury

"Section 409A") and has been since such Plan\'s inception, in documentary
compliance with the applicable provisions of Section 409A; (ii) the Company
(A) has not been required to report to any Governmental Entity any corrections
made or Taxes due as a result of a failure to comply with Section 409A and (B)
does not have any indemnity or gross-up obligation for any Taxes or interest
imposed or accelerated under Section 409A; (iii) nothing has occurred, whether
by action or failure to act, or is reasonably expected or intended to occur,
that would subject an individual having rights under any such Plan to
accelerated Tax as a result of Section 409A or a Tax imposed under Section
409A; and (iv) except as would not be material to the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries (taken as a whole), any arrangement that is intended to meet the
short-term deferral requirements of Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(4)
so meets such requirements.



(o)Except as set forth in Section 4.9(o) of the Disclosure Schedule, no
changes to any Plans have been made, nor are changed contemplated, due to
disruptions caused by the COVID-19 Pandemic or COVID-19 Measures.



(p) As of the date hereof, neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has

be paid by any Parent Party related to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Parent acknowledges and agrees that its obligations under this
Agreement are not subject to any conditions regarding Parent\'s, its
Affiliates\' or any other Person\'s ability to obtain financing or funding for
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. Parent has delivered
to the Company true, correct, and complete copies of (a) the fully executed
commitment letter from Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc. (the "Lender") and
the related fee letters referred to therein, which may be redacted for
provisions related to fees and other economic terms so long as no redaction
covers terms that would adversely affect the conditionality, availability or
termination of the Debt Financing (as hereinafter defined) (such commitment
letter and fee letters, as amended, modified, supplemented, extended, or
replaced from time to time in compliance with this Agreement, the "Debt
Commitment Letters"), pursuant to which the Lender has committed, subject only
to the terms and conditions set forth therein, to provide debt financing to
the Parent Parties for the purpose of consummating the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement in the aggregate amounts set forth therein (the
"Debt Financing") and (b) the definitive securities purchase agreement dated
as of the date hereof between EWS and Berkshire Hathaway, Inc. (the "Investor"
and such definitive agreement, the "Investor Agreement," and together with the
Debt Commitment Letters, the "Commitment Letters/Agreement"), pursuant to
which the Investor has committed to invest in EWS through the purchase of
preferred shares and warrants from EWS, subject only to the terms and
conditions set forth therein, for the purpose of consummating the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement in the aggregate amount set forth therein (the
"Investor Financing," and together with the Debt Financing, the "Financing").
As of the date hereof, the Commitment Letters/Agreement (i) are in full force
and effect without amendment or modification (and no amendment or modification
is contemplated as of the date hereof) or any breach or default (and no other
event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would
constitute a breach or default) by Parent or, to the Knowledge of Parent, any
other party thereto; (ii) are, in the form so delivered, the valid, binding
and enforceable obligations of Parent and, to the Knowledge of Parent, each
other party thereto, except as such enforceability may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting
creditors\' rights generally and by general equitable principles; (iii)
include all material terms relating to the Debt Financing and the Investor
Financing; and (iv) have not been withdrawn, terminated or rescinded in any
respect. All commitment or other fees required to be paid thereunder have been
paid or will be paid in full when due. Except as set forth in the Commitment
Letters/Agreement, there are no side letters or other agreements, contracts or
arrangements relating to, or other conditions or contingencies to, the
consummation of the Debt Financing or the Investor Financing, and as of the
date hereof each of the Parent Parties have no reason to believe that (A) any
term or condition to the Commitment Letters/Agreement will not be satisfied or
waived on a timely basis on or prior to 

the Closing Date or (B) the Debt Financing and the Investor Financing will not
be consummated on or prior to the Closing Date.



5.7Solvency. As of the Effective Time, after giving effect to all of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the payment of the
Gross Merger Consideration, any repayment or refinancing of indebtedness
contemplated in this Agreement and payment of all related fees and expenses,
and assuming for these purposes (a) the satisfaction of the conditions set
forth in Sections 7.1 and 7.2 and (b) the accuracy in all material respects of
the Company\'s representations and warranties contained in Article IV, each
Parent Party (including the Surviving Company) will be Solvent. For the
purposes of this Section 5.7, the term "Solvent" when used with respect to any
Person, means that, as of any date of determination, (i) the "fair saleable
value" of the assets of such Person, on a consolidated basis, will, as of such
date, exceed (A) the value of all "liabilities of such Person, including
contingent and other liabilities," on a consolidated basis, as of such date,
as such quoted terms are generally determined in accordance with applicable
federal laws governing determinations of the insolvency of debtors, and (B)
the amount that will be required to pay the probable liabilities of such
Person on its existing debts (including contingent liabilities) as such debts
become absolute and matured, (ii) such Person, on a consolidated basis, will
not have, as of such date, unreasonably small capital for the operation of the
businesses in which it is engaged or proposed to be engaged following such
date and (iii) such Person, on a consolidated basis, will be able to pay its
liabilities, including contingent and other liabilities, as they mature.



5.8Ownership; Operations of Merger Sub. The authorized capital stock of Merger
Sub consists solely of 1,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per
share, all of which are validly issued and outstanding. All of the issued and
outstanding capital stock of Merger Sub is, and immediately prior to the
Effective Time will be, directly owned by Parent. Parent, as sole stockholder
of Merger Sub, will adopt this Agreement immediately following its execution.
All of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Parent is, and at the
Effective Time will be, directly owned by EWS. The EWS Common Voting Shares
are the only class of equity of EWS entitled to vote on the EWS Shareholder
Approval. No Person other than the holders of the EWS Common Voting Shares is
entitled to vote on the EWS Shareholder Approval. Merger Sub has not (a)
engaged in any business activities or conducted any operations other than in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and pursuant to the
Ancillary Agreements or (b) incurred any liabilities other than in connection
with its formation and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.



5.9 Legal Requirements and Consents. There is no Consent of, or any filing or
registration with, any Governmental Entity that will be required to be
obtained or made by any Parent Party to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement that it will not be
able to obtain or make, or that it may obtain only after substantial delay, or
any requirement of any Governmental Entity that it will be unable to satisfy
in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. Subject to
appropriate divestitures required by the FCC Rules set forth in Section 5.9 of
the Parent Disclosure Schedules (as such Section 5.9 of the Parent Disclosure
Schedules may, from time to time prior to the Closing, be supplemented or
amended by the Parent Parties to properly reflect matters arising after the
date hereof that (a) are required by a Governmental Entity or (b) are required
by any agreement between Parent and any prospective buyer in respect of any
divestiture 

(provided, that, with respect to the preceding clause (b), subject to Parent
receiving the written consent of the Company (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed if any such supplement or
amendment is not adverse to the Company)) the "FCC Divestitures"), each Parent
Party is legally, financially and otherwise qualified to acquire the Company
and to control and operate the Company Stations under the Communications Act
and the FCC Rules, including the provisions relating to media ownership and
attribution, foreign ownership and control and character qualifications, and
there are no facts or circumstances that would, under the Communications Act
and the FCC Rules and the existing procedures of the FCC, disqualify any
Parent Party as the owner and operator of the Company Stations or as the
transferee of control of the Company and the FCC Licenses. No waiver of or
exemption from any provision of the Communications Act, the FCC Rules or
policies of the FCC is necessary for the FCC Consent to be obtained; and there
are no facts or circumstances related to any Parent Party that might
reasonably be expected to (i) result in the FCC\'s refusal to grant the FCC
Consent or otherwise disqualify any Parent Party, (ii) materially delay or
impede obtaining the FCC Consent or (iii) cause the FCC to impose a material
condition or conditions on its granting of the FCC Consent.



5.10Inspection; No Other Representations. Each Parent Party is an informed and
sophisticated purchaser, and has engaged advisors, experienced in the
evaluation and purchase of companies such as the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries as contemplated hereunder and pursuant to the Ancillary
Agreements. The Parent Parties have undertaken such investigation, have had an
opportunity to request and have been provided with access to management of the
Company and such documents, information, facilities, equipment, contracts and
other assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries as they have deemed adequate
and sufficient to enable them to make an informed decision with respect to the
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. In making its
decision to enter into this Agreement and consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby, each Parent Party has relied solely on its own
investigation, analysis and evaluation of the Company and its Subsidiaries and
the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in Article IV. The
Parent Parties represent and warrant that they are entering into this
Agreement and will consummate the transactions contemplated hereby without
reliance upon any express or implied representations or warranties of any
nature, whether in writing, orally or otherwise, made by or on behalf of or
imputed to the Company, the Company Subsidiaries or any of their respective
officers, directors, managers, members, stockholders, Affiliates, employees or
representatives, except as expressly set forth in Article IV. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, each Parent Party acknowledges and agrees
(for itself and on behalf of its Affiliates and representatives) that (a)

executed and delivered by the Equityholders in accordance with this
Agreement), none of the Company, the Company Subsidiaries or any of their
respective officers, directors, managers, members stockholders, Affiliates,
employees or representatives makes or has made or is authorized or has been
authorized to make any representation or warranty, express or implied, at law
or in equity, in respect of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries, the

the Company Subsidiaries, including, without limitation, with respect to (i)
their financial condition, business, operations, results of operations,
properties, assets, liabilities or prospects, (ii) their merchantability or
fitness for any particular purpose or (iii) the accuracy and completeness of

this Section, the EWS Family Shareholders) of future revenues, future results
of operations (or any component thereof), future cash flows or future
financial condition (or any component thereof) of the Company and the Company

Subsidiaries or any of their respective officers, directors, managers, members
stockholders, Affiliates, employees or representatives will have or be subject
to any liability or indemnification obligations to any Parent Party or any of
their respective Affiliates (including for purposes of this Section, the EWS
Family Shareholders) or representatives or to any other Person resulting from
the distribution or use of, any information relating to the Company or any
Company Subsidiary, including any information, documents or material made
available to any Parent Party or any of their respective Affiliates (including

out" discussions, responses to questions or requests submitted by or on behalf
of any Parent Party or any of their respective Affiliates (including for
purposes of this Section, the EWS Family Shareholders) or representatives or

contemplated by this Agreement. Any estimate, projection, prediction, data,

respective Affiliates (including for purposes of this Section 5.10, the EWS
Family Shareholders) or representatives, including any materials or

Agreement).

(collectively, the "Parent Representatives") reasonable access at reasonable
times to (and the right to inspect, as applicable) the officers, employees,
accountants, agents, properties, offices, facilities, books and records, and
contracts of the Company and each Company Subsidiary and furnish promptly to
Parent and the Parent Representatives such information (including, in the case

financial condition, properties, contracts, records and personnel of the
Company and each Company Subsidiary (including financial, marketing, operating
and other data and information) as may be reasonably requested, from time to
time, by Parent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may limit the
access provided for in this Section 6.3 the extent such access, as reasonably
determined by the Company in light of the COVID-19 Pandemic or any COVID-19
Measures, could jeopardize the health and safety of any of the employees or
other representatives of the Company or any Company Subsidiary.



(b)Parent shall have the right to perform reasonable non-intrusive Phase I
environmental investigations, assessments and compliance audits of any Owned
Realty or Leased Realty (in the case of Leased Realty, solely to the extent
the Company or any Company Subsidiary owns or is responsible for a generator
or fuel tank on such Leased Realty and subject to receipt of any required
landlord consent), but shall not have the right to perform any intrusive or
evasive sampling, testing or assessments, including any type of activities
commonly referred to as a Phase II environmental investigation.



(c)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Parent shall (i)
provide the Company with reasonable advance notice of any request for access
pursuant to this Section 6.3, (ii) not contact any customer, supplier or
employee of the Company or of any Company Subsidiary without the Company\'s
prior consent thereto in writing and (iii) avoid any undue disruption to the
business operations of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 6.3, this
Section 6.3 shall not apply with respect to any information or access the
disclosure of which the Company reasonably determines (based on the advice of
counsel, including the Company\'s internal counsel, and after consultation
with Parent and its counsel) would cause the Company to waive any attorney-
client privilege or breach any duty of confidentiality owed to any Person
under any agreement to which the Company is a party (provided that, in either
case, the 

Company and Parent shall reasonably cooperate in seeking alternative means
(including through entering into a common interest agreement or such other
means to allow disclosure but not waive attorney-client privilege) whereby
such information will be disclosed to Parent without violating any such
agreement or waiving such attorney-client privilege).



6.4Confidentiality. From the date hereof until the Closing Date, each of the
Company and Parent shall continue to comply with all of their respective
obligations under the Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of November 6, 2019,
by and between the Company and EWS (the "Confidentiality Agreement");
provided, that pursuant to Section 18 of the Confidentiality Agreement, the
Company and EWS hereby agree to extend the expiration date of the
Confidentiality Agreement by one (1) year from the date provided in Section 21
thereof.



6.5Continuation of Indemnification. Parent and the Company agree that after
the Closing, the Surviving Company shall continue to indemnify and hold
harmless, to the fullest extent now provided in the applicable Organizational
Documents of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and permitted by
applicable Law, each of the Company\'s and the Company Subsidiaries\' present
and former directors, managers, officers, employees and agents, in each case
in their capacities as such, from and against all damages, costs and expenses
actually incurred or suffered in connection with any threatened or pending
action, suit or proceeding at law or in equity by any Person or any
arbitration or administrative or other proceeding relating to the business of
the Company or its Subsidiaries or the status of such individual as a
director, officer, employee or agent at or prior to the Closing. The Surviving
Company shall retain or include in its certificate of incorporation and bylaws
and the comparable Organizational Documents of its Subsidiaries any
indemnification provision or provisions, including provisions respecting the
advancement of expenses, in effect as of the date hereof for the benefit of
the Company\'s and the Company Subsidiaries\' officers, directors, managers,
employees and agents, and shall not thereafter amend the same (except to the
extent that such amendment preserves, increases or broadens the
indemnification or other rights theretofore available to such officers,
directors, managers, employees and agents). If the Surviving Company merges
into, consolidates with or transfers all or substantially all of its assets to
another Person, then and in each such case, the Surviving Company shall make
proper provision so that the surviving or resulting corporation or the
transferee in such transaction shall assume the obligations of the Surviving
Company under this Section 6.5. The obligations set forth in this Section 6.5
shall continue for a period of six (6) years following the Closing, and shall
continue in effect thereafter with respect to any action, suit or proceeding
commenced prior to the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Closing Date, and are
intended to benefit each director, officer, agent or employee who has held
such capacity on or prior to the Closing Date and is either a party to an
indemnification agreement with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or now
or hereafter is entitled to indemnification or advancement of expenses
pursuant to any provisions contained in the Organizational Documents of the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries as of the date hereof.



6.6Continuation of Insurance. At or prior to the Closing, the Company shall
purchase one or more "tail" policies (collectively, the "DandO Tail Policy")
providing directors\' and officers\' liability insurance coverage, for the
benefit of those Persons who are covered by the Company\'s and the Company
Subsidiaries\' directors\' and officers\' liability insurance policies as of
the date hereof, or at the Closing, for a claims period of six (6) years
following the Closing 

with respect to matters occurring prior to the Closing, that is at least equal
to the coverage provided under the Company\'s or the Company Subsidiaries\'
current directors\' and officers\' liability insurance policies. Nothing in
this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall release, waive
or impair any rights to directors\' and officers\' insurance claims under any
policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the Company and any of
its Subsidiaries or any of their respective directors or officers, it being
understood and agreed that the indemnification provided for in this Section
6.6 is not prior to or in substitution for any such claims under such
policies.



6.7Employee Matters.



(a)At least five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company will
deliver to Parent an updated list of the employees of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary containing the information set forth in clauses (i) through
(ix) of Section 6.7(j) as of a then-recent date. During the period beginning
on the Closing Date and ending on the first (1st) anniversary of the Closing
Date (the "Continuation Period"), Parent shall provide each employee of the
Company who is employed as of immediately prior to the Closing Date (the
"Company Employees"), in each case while the Company Employee is employed by
the Company during the Continuation Period, (i) a base salary (or hourly base
wage rate) that is at least equal to the base salary (or hourly base wage
rate) provided to the Company Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date,
(ii) incentive compensation opportunities, through 2021, that are no less
favorable in the aggregate, on average, for the years 2018 through 2020, than
such incentive compensation opportunities provided to the Company Employee for
such three years and (iii) employee health, welfare, retirement and fringe
benefits and perquisites that are no less favorable in the aggregate than the
employee health, welfare, retirement and fringe benefits and perquisites
provided by Parent to its similarly situated employees. The Company Employees
shall be permitted to enroll in and participate, as of the Closing Date, in
the health and welfare, retirement, and fringe benefit plans of Parent (each,
a "Parent Plan") according to the eligibility and coverage rules of each such
Parent Plan, subject to Section 6.7(c) below.



(b)Parent shall provide severance payments and benefits to any Company
Employee whose employment with Parent or the Company terminates during the
Continuation Period consistent with the Scripps "Severance Practice" set forth
in Section 6.7(b) of the Disclosure Schedule.



(c)Parent shall provide each Company Employee with full credit for such
Company Employee\'s service with the Company (including any predecessors
thereto to the extent that this information is provided to Parent by the
Company before Closing) prior to the Closing Date for all purposes, including
for purposes of eligibility, vesting, benefit accruals and determination of
the level of benefits (including for purposes of paid time off, severance and
retirement benefits) under any Parent Plan in which such Company Employee is
eligible to participate following the Closing Date; provided, that such
service shall not be recognized to the extent that such recognition would
result in a duplication of benefits. With respect to each Parent Plan that is
a health or welfare plan, Parent shall (i) waive any limitation on health and
welfare coverage of such Company Employees due to pre-existing conditions,
waiting periods, active employment requirements and requirements to show
evidence of good health and (ii) credit each such Company Employee with all
deductible payments, co-payments and co- 

insurance paid by such Company Employee under any Plan prior to the Closing
Date during the year in which the Closing Date occurs for the purpose of
determining the extent to which any such Company Employee has satisfied any
applicable deductible and whether such Company Employee has reached the out-
of-pocket maximum for such year.



(d)The Company shall take all actions necessary to terminate the Company\'s
tax-qualified defined contribution retirement plan (the "Company 401(k)
Plan"), or cause such plan to be terminated, effective as of no later than the
day immediately preceding the Closing Date, and contingent upon the occurrence
of the Closing, and provide that participants in the Company 401(k) Plan shall
become fully vested in any unvested portion of their Company 401(k) Plan
accounts as of the date such plan is terminated. Parent shall designate a tax-
qualified defined contribution retirement plan with a cash or deferred
arrangement that is sponsored by the Parent or one of its Subsidiaries (the
"Parent 401(k) Plan") that will cover Company Employees effective as of the
Closing Date. In connection with the termination of the Company 401(k) Plan,
Parent shall cause the Parent 401(k) Plan to accept from the Company 401(k)
Plan the "direct rollover" of the account balance (including the in-kind
rollover of promissory notes evidencing all outstanding loans) of each Company
Employee who participated in the Company 401(k) Plan as of the date such plan
is terminated and who elects such direct rollover in accordance with the terms
of the Company 401(k) Plan and the Code.



(e)Parent shall permit the Company Employees to participate in the Parent\'s
paid time off (PTO) plan and holiday policy according to the eligibility rules
of each immediately as of the Closing Date. Parent shall recognize, as of the
Closing Date, all accrued but unused PTO of each Company Employee and shall
permit the Company Employees to use such carried over accrued, but unused PTO
in accordance with the PTO policy of Parent. Three (3) Business Days prior to
the Closing Date, the Company shall deliver Section 6.7(e) of the Disclosure
Schedule to Parent, which shall set forth the accrued but unused PTO time
projected to be carried over to Parent\'s PTO plan.



(f)Prior to the Closing Date, Parent and the Company agree to cooperate as
reasonably necessary to determine the appropriate method for transitioning
payroll to Parent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to the Closing Date,
the Company shall exercise commercially reasonable efforts to cause its
current payroll service provider to agree or acknowledge in writing that it
will file all payroll Tax Returns, pay, and withhold all applicable income and
employment Tax withholding, issue all IRS Form W-2\'s, and otherwise assume
responsibility for all related federal, state, and local Tax filing issues for
all periods of time prior to the Closing Date.



(g)Prior to the Closing Date, the Company may establish and implement a
retention bonus program for certain employees of the Company consistent with
Section 6.7(g) of the Disclosure Schedule (such terms, the "Retention Bonus
Program", and such retention bonuses in the aggregate, the "Retention
Bonuses").



(h)Parent and the Company agree to cooperate as reasonably necessary to
implement the provisions of this Section 6.7 and agree to provide each other
with such records and information as may be necessary and appropriate to carry
out their respective obligations under this Section 6.7, including, without
limitation, to permit and implement, prior to the 

Closing Date, open enrollment for the Company Employees for participation in
the Parent Plans as contemplated by Section 6.7(a) and to otherwise avoid gaps
in coverage.



(i)With respect to each applicable Company Employee hired after the date
hereof, prior to the Closing the Company will collect and maintain, in all
material respects, Form I-9 (Employment Eligibility Verification Form) and all
other records, documents or other papers which are required to be retained
with the Form I-9 by the Company or any Company Subsidiary pursuant to the
Immigration Laws.



(j)The Company will make available to Parent a true and complete list of all
employees of the Company or any Company Subsidiary as of a date no later than
ten (10) Business Days after the date hereof, including their (i) job titles;
(ii) dates of hire; (iii) current rates of compensation; (iv) 2019 and 2020
bonus and commission opportunities and payments; (v) work locations; (vi)
employment statuses (i.e., active, disabled or on authorized leave and the
reason therefor); (vii) accrued but unused vacation and sick leave; (viii)
services credited for purposes of vesting and eligibility to participate in
the Plans; and (ix) whether full-time, part-time or per-diem.



(k)Nothing in this Section 6.7 shall be treated as an amendment, establishment
or termination of, or undertaking to amend, establish or terminate, any Plan
or any other benefit or compensation plan, program, policy, contract,
agreement or arrangement. The provisions of this Section 6.7 are solely for
the benefit of the respective parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this
Section 6.7, express or implied, shall confer upon any Company Employee, or
legal representative or beneficiary thereof or any other Person, any rights or
remedies, including any right to employment or service or continued employment
or service for any specified period, or compensation or benefits of any nature
or kind whatsoever under this Agreement or a right of any employee or
beneficiary of such Company Employee or other Person under a Plan that such
Company Employee or beneficiary or other Person would not otherwise have under
the terms of that Plan.



(l)Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall determine whether Section 280G
of the Code is or would become applicable to any payment(s) to be made to any
Company Employee by reason of any plan, arrangement, grant or agreement
between such Company Employee and the Company or any Company Subsidiary, or by
reason of any plan, arrangement, grant, or arrangement with the Company or any
Company Subsidiary (which is required to be aggregated with any such payments
made by the Company or any Company Subsidiary, for purposes of Section 280G of
the Code) or pursuant to arrangements proposed by Parent in writing (which
shall be disclosed to the Company at least ten (10) Business Days prior to
Closing). In the event Section 280G of the Code is or becomes applicable to
any such payment(s), then, prior to the Closing, the Company shall seek, and
the Key Company Stockholder shall give, the stockholder approval contemplated
under Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and obtain the exemption from the
application of Section 280G of the Code to any "excess parachute payments".
The Company shall provide copies of all solicitation, proxy, and communication
materials to obtains such stockholder approval at least three (3) Business
Days prior to such solicitation of stockholder approval.



6.8RandW Insurance Policy. As of the date hereof, Parent has entered into a buy-
side representations and warranties insurance policy (the "RandW Insurance
Policy") and has delivered to the Company a true and complete copy thereof.
Parent shall not (and shall cause its Subsidiaries and Affiliates not to)
amend or modify in any material respect, or otherwise novate, assign, waive or
terminate, any waiver of subrogation or do anything that would otherwise cause
any right or obligation set forth in the RandW Insurance Policy not to have full
force and effect and be materially adverse to the Equityholders, without the
prior written consent of the Equityholder Representative; provided that each
of the Parent Parties agrees that any absence of coverage under the RandW
Insurance Policy for any reason, including due to exclusions from coverage
thereunder or the failure of the RandW Insurance Policy to be in full force and
effect for any reason, will not expand, alter, amend, change or otherwise
affect the Equityholders\' liability under this Agreement. The cost of the RandW
Insurance Policy shall be borne entirely by Parent.



6.9Appropriate Action; Consents; Filings.



(a)Each party agrees to reasonably cooperate with each other in determining
whether any filings are required to be made with any Governmental Entity in
connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement or any Ancillary
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby and agrees to make as promptly as practicable any such filing that may
be required with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
any Ancillary Agreement under any applicable antitrust, competition, foreign
investment or trade regulation Law, and to promptly supply any additional

cause each of the Company Subsidiaries to, use their respective reasonable

herein, the Company and the Parent Parties agree that the foregoing shall not
impose any obligations with respect to any divestitures on the Company and any
divestiture 

obligations shall be solely the obligations of the Parent Parties; provided,
further, however, that the immediately preceding proviso shall not apply to
the Company\'s obligations in Section 6.9(h) or any information or document

Parties shall reasonably cooperate with each other in connection with the
making of all such filings, including (but subject to applicable Laws relating
to the exchange of information) providing copies of all such documents to the
non-filing party and its advisors prior to filing and furnishing all
information required for any application or other filing to be made pursuant
to the rules and regulations of any applicable Law in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements.



(c)In furtherance of the foregoing and not in limitation of Section 6.9(b), to
the extent not filed prior to the date hereof, the Parent Parties and the
Company shall reasonably cooperate with each other and shall use their
respective reasonable best efforts to (i) file required Notification and

notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Company and
Parent Parties agree, subject to the Company\'s obligations in Section 6.9(h),
any divestiture obligations set forth in this Section 6.9(c) shall be solely
the obligations of the Parent Parties; provided, further, however, that the
immediately preceding proviso shall not apply to any information or document
request from any Governmental Entity directed to the Company or any Company
Subsidiary in respect of any Company Station to be divested with respect to
any information or documentation in the possession or control of the Company
that has not been provided to Parent or that the Governmental Entity will not
accept from Parent. The Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall each request
early termination of the waiting period with respect to the Merger under the
HSR Act. The Company and the Parent Parties shall respond as promptly as
practicable to all requests or inquiries received from any Governmental Entity
for additional documentation or information; provided, however,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Company and the
Parent Parties agree any information or documentation relating to any
divestiture obligations set forth in this Section 6.9(c) shall be solely the
obligations of the Parent Parties; provided, further, however, that the
immediately preceding provision shall not apply to the Company\'s obligations
in Section 6.9(h) or any information or document request from any Governmental

or any of the Ancillary Agreements, in furtherance of and without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, it is expressly understood and agreed that each
of the 

Parent Parties shall promptly take any and all steps not prohibited by
applicable Law to (A) avoid the entry of, or to have vacated, lifted, reversed
or overturned any order that would restrain, prevent or delay the Closing on
or before the Closing Date, including defending (with sufficient time for
resolution in advance of the Closing Date) through litigation on the merits
any claim asserted in any court with respect to the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement by the FTC, the DOJ, the FCC or
any other applicable Governmental Entity or any private party under any
Regulatory Law or any other applicable Law and (B) avoid or eliminate each and
every impediment under any applicable Law that is designed to prohibit,
restrict or regulate actions having the purpose or effect of monopolization or
restraint of trade and obtain all consents under applicable Law (including the
Communications Act and FCC Rules) that may be required by any Governmental
Entity including the FTC, DOJ and FCC so as to enable the Closing to occur as
soon as possible (and in any event no later than the Closing Date), including
(1) as promptly as practicable, proposing, negotiating, committing to and
effecting, by consent decree, hold separate order, or otherwise, the sale,
divestiture or disposition of the FCC Divestitures and any such other
businesses, product lines or assets of any Parent Party, the Company and/or
any Company Subsidiary and (2) otherwise taking or committing to take actions
that after the Closing would limit Parent\'s and/or its Affiliates\',
including the Company\'s and the Company Subsidiaries\', freedom of action
with respect to, or its or their ability to operate and/or retain, one or more
of the businesses, product lines or assets of any Parent Party, the Company
and/or any Company Subsidiary; provided, however, that any action contemplated
by clauses (1) and (2) above is conditioned upon the consummation of the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and
provided, further, however, (i) with respect to any divestitures required by
the FCC (but not with respect to any divestitures required by the DOJ, which
are instead subject to clause (ii) below), that Parent\'s obligations pursuant
to this Section 6.9(c) are subject to the prospective buyer(s) under any such
sale, divestiture or disposition contemplated hereby being permitted by the
FCC to enter into with Parent or any Affiliate thereof (which shall include,
for purposes of this proviso, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries as of
or after the Closing) a network affiliation agreement providing for, among
other things, the carriage of ION programming or other programming distributed
by Parent or any Affiliate thereof in the form set forth on Exhibit F hereto,
with such changes or modifications as may be requested by the FCC that are not
materially adverse to EWS and its Subsidiaries (taken as a whole) (subject to
Section 6.9(c) of the Disclosure Schedule, collectively, the "Network
Affiliation Agreements") and (ii) with respect to any divestitures required by
the DOJ, that Parent\'s obligations pursuant to this Section 6.9(c) are
subject to (A) Parent not being required to divest a number of television
broadcast stations affiliated with the ABC, NBC, CBS and/or Fox television
networks that, in the aggregate, are material to EWS and its Subsidiaries
(taken as a whole); (B) any such divestitures not being material and adverse
to the Company\'s and its Subsidiaries\' (taken as a whole) ability to provide
programming at a national level (including the sale and retention of
advertising revenue for such programming) to the Company Stations subject to
the FCC Divestitures; and (C) Parent not being required to divest one or more
Katz national digital network(s) (which term, for the avoidance of doubt,
shall exclude any television broadcast stations). Parent and Merger Sub agree
that, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, except as
contemplated by this Agreement, they shall not, and shall cause their
Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly, without the prior written consent
of the Company, take or cause to be taken any action, including (w) any action
with respect to any actions or filings that would be required to be made
pursuant to the HSR Act (or any other Competition Law), the

transaction with another Person, (y) restructuring, reorganizing or completely
or partially liquidating or (z) making any loan, advance or capital
contribution to, or investment in, any other Person, that would reasonably be
expected to materially delay, impair or prevent the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or propose, announce an
intention, enter into any agreement or otherwise make a commitment to take any
such action.



(d)Prior to the Closing, neither the Company nor Parent nor any of their
respective Affiliates nor any of their respective representatives or advisors
shall have any material contact or communication or any meeting with any
Governmental Entity in connection with any of the transactions contemplated
hereby or pursuant to any Ancillary Agreement, without the prior written
consent (not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) and
participation of the Company or Parent, as applicable. Subject to applicable
legal limitations and instructions of any Governmental Entity, the parties to
this Agreement shall: (i) provide each other with copies of all written
correspondence, filings or communications between them or any of their
representatives, on the one hand, and any Governmental Entity or members of
such agency\'s staff, on the other hand, with respect to this Agreement, any
of the Ancillary Agreements and the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby; and (ii) to the extent reasonably practicable, prior to submitting
any substantive and material written communication to any Governmental Entity,
permit the other party and its counsel a reasonable opportunity (but in no
event longer than three (3) calendar days) to review in advance, and consider
in good faith the views of the other party provided in a timely manner, in
connection with any such communication; provided, however, that materials may
be redacted as necessary to (A) comply with contractual arrangements and (B)
address reasonable attorney-client or other privilege or confidentiality
concerns.



(e)The Company and Parent acknowledge that, to the extent reasonably necessary
to expedite the grant by the FCC of any application for renewal of any FCC
License with respect to any Company Station and thereby to facilitate the
grant of the FCC Consent with respect to such Company Station, each of the
Company, Parent and their applicable Subsidiaries shall be permitted to enter
into tolling agreements with the FCC to extend the statute of limitations for
the FCC to determine or impose a forfeiture penalty against such Company
Station in connection with (i) any pending complaints that such Company
Station aired programming that contained obscene, indecent or profane material
or (ii) any other enforcement matters against such Company Station with
respect to which the FCC may permit the Company or Parent (or any of their
respective Subsidiaries) to enter into a tolling agreement.



(f)The Company Station Licenses of the Company Stations expire on the dates
corresponding thereto as set forth on Schedule IV. The Company or its
applicable Subsidiary shall prosecute each application for renewal of any
Company Station License (a "Renewal Application") that is pending on the date
hereof, and shall timely file and prosecute any Renewal Application that is
required to be filed prior to or on the Closing Date. To avoid disruption or
delay in the processing of the FCC Application, Parent and Merger Sub agree,
as part of the FCC Application, to request that the FCC apply its policy
permitting the transfer of control of FCC Licenses in transactions involving
multiple stations to proceed, notwithstanding 

the pendency of one or more Renewal Applications (the "FCC Renewal Policy").
Parent and Merger Sub shall make such representations and agree to such
undertakings as are required to be made to invoke the FCC Renewal Policy,
including undertakings to assume, as between the parties and the FCC, the
position of the applicant before the FCC with respect to any pending Renewal
Application and to assume the corresponding regulatory risks relating to any
such Renewal Application. The Parent Parties acknowledge that, to the extent
reasonably necessary to expedite grant by the FCC of any Renewal Application
and thereby to facilitate grant of the FCC Application, the Company and/or its
Subsidiaries, without regard to the application of the FCC Renewal Policy,
shall be permitted to enter into tolling, assignment and assumption or similar
agreements with the FCC to extend the statute of limitations for the FCC to
determine or impose a forfeiture penalty against any of the Company Stations
in connection with (i) any pending complaints that the Company Stations aired
programming that contained obscene, indecent or profane material or (ii) any
other enforcement matters against the Company Stations with respect to which
the FCC may permit the Company and/or its Subsidiaries to enter into tolling,
assignment and assumption or similar agreements, and, if and to the extent
required by the FCC, Parent and Merger Sub agree to become a party to and to
execute such agreements.



(g)If the Closing shall not have occurred for any reason within the original
effective periods of the FCC Consent, and neither party shall have terminated
this Agreement pursuant to the terms hereof, the Company and Parent shall use
their reasonable best efforts to obtain one or more extensions of the
effective period of the FCC Consent to permit consummation of the transactions
hereunder. Upon receipt of the FCC Consent, the Company and Parent shall use
their respective reasonable best efforts to maintain in effect the FCC Consent
to permit consummation of the transactions hereunder. No extension of the FCC
Consent shall limit the right of the Company and Parent to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to the terms hereof.



(h)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Company and
the Parent Parties agree that nothing set forth in this Section 6.9 shall
impose any obligations with respect to any divestitures on the Company and any
divestiture obligations set forth in Section 6.9(c) shall be solely the
obligations of the Parent Parties; provided, however, that the Company shall
file (but shall not be responsible for the content, or any other aspect, of)
any FCC Applications for the FCC Divestitures substantially as directed by the
Parent Parties as a result of the Parent Parties\' determination that the
filing of such FCC Applications by the Company are necessary for the Parent
Parties to comply with its divestiture obligations set forth in this Section
6.9 (solely with respect to any Company Station to be divested).



6.10Public Announcements. The initial press release with respect to this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be a release mutually
agreed to by the Company and Parent. Thereafter from the date hereof until the
Closing Date, none of the Company, the Equityholder Representative or the
Parent Parties shall, and the parties shall cause their respective Affiliates
(including, with respect to the Parent Parties, the EWS Family Shareholders)
not to, issue or file any report, statement, press release or announcement or
otherwise make or file any public statement regarding this Agreement, any
Ancillary Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby without
the prior written consent of the Company and Parent (which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), unless otherwise required
by applicable Law or the rules or regulations of any 

applicable United States securities exchange or other Governmental Entity to
which the relevant party is subject or submits, in which case such party shall
advise the other parties hereto and discuss, and reasonably cooperate in good
faith with respect to, the contents before issuing or filing any such report,
statement, press release, other announcement or other public statement. In
addition, except as otherwise required by Law or the rules or regulations of
any applicable United States securities exchange or other Governmental Entity
to which the relevant party is subject or submits (in which case such party
shall advise the other parties hereto and discuss, and reasonably cooperate in
good faith with respect to, the contents before issuing or filing any report,
statement, press release, announcement or other public statement), no press
release, report, statement, announcement or other public statement shall state
the amount of any consideration payable hereunder or thereunder or any other
material terms set forth in this Agreement or in any of the Ancillary
Agreements without the prior written consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) of Parent and the Company (if
prior to Closing) or, if after the Closing, Parent and the Equityholder
Representative.



6.11Access to Records. For a period of six (6) years following the Closing
Date, the Parent Parties shall maintain all books and records of the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries relating to periods ending on or prior to the
Closing Date (provided, that Parent may destroy or otherwise dispose of any
such books and records during such six-year period if it first offers the
surrender thereof to the Equityholder Representative and the Equityholder
Representative does not take possession of them within a reasonable period of
time following such offer) and, subject to any restrictions imposed by
applicable Law or from time to time in good faith upon advice of counsel
respecting the provision of privileged communications or competitively
sensitive information and any applicable confidentiality agreement with any
Person, shall make them available to the Equityholder Representative (for the
purpose of examining and copying at the Equityholder Representative\'s sole
cost) upon reasonable advance notice for a reasonable business purpose and
during normal business hours; provided, that such inspection and copying shall
be conducted in a manner that will not unreasonably disrupt the normal course
of the respective businesses of Parent, the Surviving Company and their
Affiliates.



6.12Appointment of Equityholder Representative.



(a)Each Equityholder, by virtue of his, her or its approval of this Agreement
and of the Merger and by virtue of his, her or its execution of a Letter of
Transmittal (and/or other document(s) delivered pursuant to Section 2.4 or
Section 2.5) and acceptance of any portion of the Gross Merger Consideration,
shall, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law be deemed to have
agreed to hereby irrevocably designate Equityholder Representative as his, her
or its agent and attorney-in-fact and as the Equityholder Representative in
order to efficiently administer (i) the determination of the Final Adjustment

relating to the distribution of any amounts payable or distributable to the
Equityholders or Parent under this Agreement and/or any Ancillary Agreement,
(iv) give and receive all notices required to be given or received by the

or contingent Equityholder expenses and obligations under this Agreement
and/or any Ancillary Agreement and (x) take any and all other actions to be

and/or any Ancillary Agreement. The Equityholder Representative shall be
entitled to retain counsel and accountants and to incur such costs and
expenses (including court costs and reasonable attorneys\' fees and expenses)
as the Equityholder Representative deems in its sole discretion to be
necessary or appropriate in connection with the performance of its obligations
under this Agreement and under any Ancillary Agreement. All such costs and
expenses incurred by the Equityholder Representative shall be borne by each
Equityholder on a pro rata basis based on his, her or its respective
Applicable Percentage as set forth on Final Schedule I. No bond shall be
required of the Equityholder Representative.



(c)In the event that the Equityholder Representative is dissolved, becomes
unable to perform its responsibilities hereunder or resigns from such
position, Equityholders holding, prior to the Effective Time, a majority of
the aggregate Applicable Percentage, as set forth on Final Schedule I (the
"Majority Holders"), shall promptly select another representative to fill such
vacancy and such substituted representative shall be deemed to be the
Equityholder Representative for all purposes of this Agreement and each of the
Ancillary Agreements effective upon the later of the date indicated in the
consent of the Majority Holders or the date such notice is received by Parent
(provided, that until such notice is received, the Parent Parties shall be
entitled to rely on the decisions and actions of the prior Equityholder
Representative); provided, however, in no event shall the Equityholder
Representative dissolve or resign without the Majority Holders having first
appointed a new Equityholder Representative.



(d)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement (including in
Section 9.9), following the Closing, the Parent Parties shall be entitled to
deal exclusively with the Equityholder Representative on all matters relating
to this Agreement, including any dispute, and shall be entitled to rely
conclusively (without further evidence of any kind whatsoever) on any document
executed or purported to be executed on behalf of any Equityholder by the
Equityholder Representative, and on any other decision or action taken or
purported to be taken on behalf of any Equityholder by the Equityholder
Representative, as being fully binding upon such Person. All decisions and
actions by the Equityholder Representative, including any agreement between
the Equityholder Representative and Parent or the Surviving Company relating
to (x) the determination of the Final Adjustment Amount and distributions from
the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Account or (y) distributions from the Tax
Escrow Account, shall (i) constitute a decision of the Equityholders and (ii)
be final, 

binding and conclusive upon all of the Equityholders, in each case, to the
fullest extent permitted by Law, and no Equityholder shall have the right to
object, dissent, protest or otherwise contest the same.



(e)The Equityholder Representative shall have the right, at its sole
discretion, to withdraw from the Equityholder Representative Expense Fund,
prior to any distribution to the applicable Equityholders therefrom, (i) the
Equityholder Representative\'s expenses incurred in serving in such capacity,
and any costs and expenses incurred by the Equityholder Representative
pursuant to this Section 6.12 ("Charges") and (ii) Damages for which the
Equityholder Representative is entitled to be indemnified pursuant to Section
6.12(g). If the Equityholder Representative Expense Fund is insufficient to
satisfy the Charges or Damages, as applicable, then the Equityholder
Representative may recover such Charges or Damages, as applicable, from any
proceeds of the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Fund or the Tax Escrow Fund
that are distributable to the Paying Agent and the Surviving Company (for
further distribution to the Equityholders) pursuant to Section 2.7(c), Section
2.16 or Section 2.17, as applicable, prior to the distribution thereof to the
Paying Agent and the Surviving Company (for further distribution to the
Equityholders) pursuant to Section 2.7(c), Section 2.16 or Section 2.17, as
applicable. If the proceeds of the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Fund or
the Tax Escrow Fund that are distributable to the Paying Agent and the
Surviving Company (for further distribution to the Equityholders) pursuant to
Section 2.7(c), Section 2.16 or Section 2.17, as applicable, are also
insufficient to satisfy the Charges or Damages, as applicable, then all such
Charges or Damages, as applicable, shall be borne by each Equityholder on a
pro rata basis based on his, her or its respective Applicable Percentage as
set forth on Final Schedule I.



(f)The Equityholder Representative shall have no duty, fiduciary or otherwise,
to the Equityholders, and for the avoidance of doubt, shall have no duty to
consider the individual circumstances of any Equityholder. The Equityholder
Representative shall incur no liability to the Equityholders with respect to
any action taken or omitted to be taken by the Equityholder Representative in
reliance upon any notice, direction, instruction, consent, statement or other
documents believed by the Equityholder Representative to be genuinely and duly
authorized, nor for any other action or inaction, except in the event of the
Equityholder Representative\'s willful misconduct or gross negligence. Without
limiting the foregoing, the Equityholder Representative may, in all questions
arising under this Agreement, any Ancillary Agreement or any other agreement
in connection with this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement, rely on the
advice of counsel, and the Equityholder Representative shall not be liable to
the Equityholders for any action taken or omitted to be taken in good faith by
the Equityholder Representative based on such advice. The Equityholder
Representative is authorized by the Equityholders to incur expenses reasonably
necessary or appropriate on behalf of the Equityholders in acting hereunder or
pursuant to any Ancillary Agreement, including expenses of legal counsel. The
parties hereto understand and agree that the Equityholder Representative is
acting solely on behalf of and as attorney-in-fact and agent for the
Equityholders and not in its personal capacity, and in no event shall the
Equityholder Representative be personally liable to the Equityholders
hereunder or pursuant to any Ancillary Agreement, except in the event of the
Equityholder Representative\'s willful misconduct or gross negligence.



(g)Each Equityholder, by virtue of his, her or its approval of this Agreement
and of the Merger, execution of a Letter of Transmittal (and/or other
document(s) delivered pursuant to Section 2.4 or Section 2.5), as applicable,
and acceptance of any portion of the Gross Merger Consideration, shall
indemnify the Equityholder Representative for such Equityholder\'s respective
pro rata amount, based on his, her or its respective Applicable Percentage as
set forth on Final Schedule I, of any and all Damages that may at any time be
imposed on, incurred by or asserted against the Equityholder Representative in
any way relating to or arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or
administration of the Equityholder Representative\'s duties under this
Agreement and/or any Ancillary Agreement, and/or any documents contemplated by
or referred to herein or therein, and/or the transactions contemplated hereby
or thereby, and/or the enforcement of any of the terms hereof or thereof;
provided, however, that no Equityholder shall be liable for any such Damages
to the extent they arise from the Equityholder Representative\'s gross
negligence or willful misconduct.



(h)All notices or other communications required to be made or delivered by
Parent to the Equityholders shall be made to the Equityholder Representative
for the benefit of the Equityholders and any notices so made shall discharge
in full all notice requirements of Parent to the Equityholders with respect
thereto. All notices or other communications required to be made or delivered
by any Equityholders to Parent shall be made by the Equityholder
Representative for the benefit of such Equityholders and any notices so made
shall discharge in full all notice requirements of such Equityholders to
Parent with respect thereto. The agreements in this Section 6.12 shall survive
termination of this Agreement and of the Ancillary Agreements.



(i)The provisions of this Section 6.12, including the power of attorney
granted hereby, are independent and severable, are irrevocable and coupled
with an interest and shall not be terminated by any act of any one or more of
the Equityholders, or by operation of Law.



6.13No Solicitation. From the date hereof until the Closing, the Company, the
Company Subsidiaries and the Key Company Stockholder shall not, and shall not
permit any of their respective Affiliates, directors, officers, investment
bankers or agents to, directly or indirectly, (a) solicit, initiate,
encourage, entertain, consider or accept any inquiries, proposals or offers
from any Person (other than the Parent Parties and Parent Representatives) or
(b) discuss, negotiate or communicate with, provide any information to, or

communications with any Person conducted heretofore with respect to any of the
foregoing. The Company shall notify Parent promptly if any such proposal or
offer is made and shall, in any such notice to Parent, indicate in reasonable
detail the identity of the Person making such proposal or offer. The 

Company agrees not to, and to cause the Company Subsidiaries not to, without
the prior written consent of Parent, release any Person from, or waive any

ARTICLE VIII



TERMINATION



8.1Termination. This Agreement may be terminated by giving written notice at
any time prior to the Closing as follows:



(a)by mutual consent of Parent and the Company;



(b)by either Parent or the Company, if there shall be any order, judgment,
decision, decree, injunction, ruling, writ or assessment of any Governmental
Entity of competent jurisdiction which is final and nonappealable preventing
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby for any reason other
than the failure of the party seeking to terminate this Agreement to comply
with any covenant or agreement of such party set forth herein.



(c)by Parent or the Company, at any time after twelve (12) months after the
date of this Agreement (such date or such later date, if any, as is provided
in the proviso to this Section 8.1(c), the "Outside Date"), if the
transactions contemplated hereby to occur at the Closing shall not have been
consummated for any reason other than the failure of the party seeking to
terminate this Agreement to comply with any covenant or agreement of such
party set forth herein; provided, however, that in the event the condition set
forth in Section 7.1(b) shall not have been satisfied on or before the Outside
Date but all of the other conditions set forth in Article VII have been
satisfied (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Closing), either the Company or Parent may extend the Outside
Date, on one or more occasions, by notice delivered to the other parties,
until a date no later than the 18-month anniversary of the date of this
Agreement, in which case the Outside Date shall be deemed for all purposes to
be the latest of any such dates.



(d)by Parent, if the Company shall have breached or violated any of its
representations, warranties or covenants set forth in this Agreement in a
manner that would prevent the satisfaction of the conditions to the Closing
set forth in Section 7.2(a) or Section 7.2(b), and such breach or violation
shall not have been cured within thirty (30) calendar days after written
notice thereof has been given by Parent to the Company;



(e)by the Company, if any Parent Party shall have breached or violated any of
its representations, warranties or covenants set forth in this Agreement in a
manner that would prevent the satisfaction of the conditions to the Closing
set forth in Section 7.3(a) or Section 7.3(b), and such breach or violation
shall not have been cured within thirty (30) calendar days after notice
thereof has been given by the Company to Parent;



(f)by Parent, if within 24 hours following the execution and delivery of this
Agreement by all of the parties hereto, the Company shall not have delivered
to Parent a copy of the executed Written Consent; provided, that Parent may
not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(f) more than 48
hours following the execution and delivery of this Agreement by all of the
parties hereto; or



(g)by the Company, (i) if, within thirty (30) calendar days of the date of
this Agreement, the EWS Shareholder Approval shall not have been obtained at
the EWS Family Shareholder Meeting and evidence thereof delivered to the
Company pursuant to Section 6.15; provided, that the Company may not terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(g)(i) more than 48 hours following

EWS Family Shareholder Meeting described in clause (g)(i) above, the EWS
Shareholder Approval shall not have been obtained at the EWS Shareholder
Meeting and evidence thereof delivered to the Company pursuant to Section
6.15; provided, that the Company may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to
this Section 8.1(g)(ii) more than 48 hours following such date.



8.2Effect of Termination.



(a)In the event of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1,
this Agreement shall forthwith become null and void, there shall be no
liability on the part of Parent, the Company, the Equityholder Representative
or any of their respective partners, officers, directors, managers,
Subsidiaries, Affiliates or Associates to any other party and all rights and
obligations of any party hereto shall cease, except that (i) nothing herein
shall relieve any party hereto from liability for any breach of this Agreement
or the Confidentiality Agreement or for Fraud and (ii) Section 6.12, Section
8.2 and Article IX hereof shall survive any such termination of this
Agreement.



(b)



(i)In the event that this Agreement is validly terminated by the Company or
Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(c) (if at such time there is a failure of the
condition set forth in Section 7.1(b) to be satisfied) where (A) there has
been an Assumed Change in Law and (B) the FCC Consent has not been obtained,
then Parent shall, if the Company so elects by written notice to Parent within
twenty (20) calendar days following the Company\'s delivery or 

receipt, as applicable, of the termination notice, within five (5) Business
Days following its receipt of any such written election notice from the
Company and the documentation referred to in the definition of "Parent Fees
and Expenses Termination Fee," pay (or cause to be paid) by wire transfer of
immediately available funds, to an account designated by the Company, the
Parent Fees and Expenses Termination Fee; provided, however, that no Parent
Termination Fee shall be owed pursuant to this Section 8.2(b)(i) if the Parent
Parties have established that the FCC has not directly or indirectly
identified to any Parent Party or any of their respective representatives any
issues, conditions or concerns to be addressed or resolved that would require
changes, modifications or amendments to the Network Affiliation Agreement form
attached hereto (other than if the FCC indicates they are satisfied with the
form attached hereto) in order to facilitate FCC action on the FCC
Applications or to obtain the FCC Consent.



(ii) In the event that this Agreement is validly terminated by the Company or
Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(c) (if at such time there is a failure of the
condition set forth in Section 7.1(b) to be satisfied) where (A) there has not
been an Assumed Change in Law and (B) the FCC Consent has not been obtained,
then Parent shall, if the Company so elects by written notice to Parent within
twenty (20) calendar days following the Company\'s delivery or receipt, as
applicable, of the termination notice, within five (5) Business Days of its
receipt of any such written election notice from the Company, pay (or cause to
be paid) by wire transfer of immediately available funds, to an account
designated by the Company, the Parent Full Termination Fee; provided, however,
that no Parent Termination Fee shall be owed pursuant to this Section
8.2(b)(ii) if the Parent Parties have established that the FCC has not
directly or indirectly identified to any Parent Party or any of their
respective representatives any issues, conditions or concerns to be addressed
or resolved that would require changes, modifications or amendments to the
Network Affiliation Agreement form attached hereto (other than if the FCC
indicates they are satisfied with the form attached hereto) in order to
facilitate FCC action on the FCC Applications or to obtain the FCC Consent.



(iii)In the event that this Agreement is validly terminated by the Company or
Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(c) (if at such time there is a failure of the
condition set forth in Section 7.1(b) to be satisfied) where the DOJ has
required (A) divestitures of a number of television broadcast stations
affiliated with the ABC, NBC, CBS and/or Fox television networks that, in the
aggregate, are material to EWS and its Subsidiaries (taken as a whole); (B)
divestitures that are material and adverse to the Company\'s and its
Subsidiaries\' (taken as a whole) ability to provide programming at a national
level (including the sale and retention of advertising revenue for such
programming) to the Company Stations subject to the FCC Divestitures; or (C)
divestiture of one or more Katz national digital network(s) (which term, for
the avoidance of doubt, shall exclude any television broadcast stations),
then, in any case, if the Company so elects by written notice to Parent within
twenty (20) calendar days following the Company\'s delivery or receipt, as
applicable, of the termination notice, Parent shall, within five (5) Business
Days of its receipt of any such written election notice from the Company, pay
(or cause to be paid) by wire transfer of immediately available funds, to an
account designated by the Company, the Parent Full Termination Fee.



(c)Parent and the Company acknowledge that the agreements contained in this
Section 8.2 are an integral part of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the
parties hereto would not enter into this 

Agreement; accordingly, if Parent fails to promptly pay or cause to be paid
any amount due pursuant to Section 8.2(b), and, in order to obtain such
payment, the Company commences a suit that results in a judgment against
Parent for the amount set forth in Section 8.2(b) or any portion thereof,
Parent shall pay or cause to be paid to the Company its reasonable out-of-
pocket costs and expenses (including attorneys\' fees) in connection with such
suit, together with interest on the amount of the applicable Parent
Termination Fee at the prime lending rate as published in The Wall Street
Journal, in effect on the date such payment is required to be made.



(d)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the parties
hereto expressly acknowledge and agree that (i) nothing in this Section 8.2
shall limit the right of the parties hereto to specific performance of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 9.11; provided that in no case shall the Company
be entitled to receive both a grant of specific performance, on the one hand,
and the payment of the applicable Parent Termination Fee, on the other hand,
(ii) except as set forth in clause (iii) below, (A) nothing in this Section
8.2 shall relieve any Parent Party from any liability for any breach of this
Agreement and (B) each Parent Party waives any argument that a Parent
Termination Fee establishes the maximum amount of damages in the event of any
breach of this Agreement and (iii) solely where a Parent Termination Fee has
been paid to the Company pursuant to Section 8.2(b) and irrespective of
whether there has been any breach of this Agreement by any Parent Party, (A)
the Company\'s receipt of a Parent Termination Fee pursuant to Section 8.2(b)
shall be the sole and exclusive remedy (whether at law, in equity, in
contract, in tort or otherwise) of the Company and any other Person against
Parent Parties and the Debt Financing Sources, (B) in no case shall the
Company be entitled to receive both the Parent Full Termination Fee and the
Parent Fees and Expenses Termination Fee, (C) the applicable Parent
Termination Fee shall only be paid once and in no case shall the Company be
entitled to receive a Parent Termination Fee under more than one subsection of
Section 8.2(b) and (D) in the event of a termination of this Agreement that
would give rise to Parent\'s obligation to pay the Company a Parent
Termination Fee under either Section 8.2(b)(i) or Section 8.2(b)(iii), the
Company shall only be entitled to receive the Parent Termination Fee payable
under Section 8.2(b)(i).

(a)None of the representations, warranties and covenants in this Agreement or

9.3Amendment. This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto at any time
prior to the Closing; provided, however, that this Agreement may not be
amended except by an instrument signed by the Company, the Parent Parties and
the Equityholder Representative. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, none of the Financing Provisions may be amended, modified, altered or
waived in a manner materially adverse to the Debt Financing Sources without
the prior consent of the Debt Financing Sources.



9.4Waiver. At any time prior to the Closing, Parent, on the one hand, and the
Company (or, after the Closing, the Equityholder Representative), on the other
hand, may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or
other acts of the other party or parties hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracies in
the representations and warranties of the other party or parties contained
herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) waive compliance
by the other party or parties with any of the agreements or conditions
contained herein. Any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set
forth in a written instrument signed by the party or parties to be bound
thereby.



9.5Headings. The headings and captions contained in this Agreement are for
reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement.



9.6Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement, or any
portion thereof, is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any
rule of law or public policy, all other terms and provisions of this
Agreement, or the remaining portion thereof, shall nevertheless remain in full
force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the
transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially
adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any such term or other
provision, or any portion thereof, is invalid, illegal or incapable of being
enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this
Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as
possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the transactions contemplated
hereby are consummated to the fullest extent possible.



9.7Entire Agreement. This Agreement (together with the Exhibits and Schedules
attached hereto and the Disclosure Schedule), the Confidentiality Agreement,
the Ancillary Agreements and any other agreement executed by any of the Parent
Parties and the Company on the date hereof constitute the entire agreement of
the parties hereto and supersede all prior agreements and undertakings, both
written and oral, between or among the parties, or any of them, with respect
to the subject matter hereof.



9.8Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations hereunder shall be assigned, directly or indirectly, by any party
hereto without the prior written consent of the other parties hereto.



9.9Parties in Interest. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely
to the benefit of each party hereto and its respective successors and
permitted assigns. Other than the provisions of (a) after the Closing,
Sections 6.5 and 6.6 to the extent they apply to current or former directors,
managers, officers, employees and agents of the Company or the Company
Subsidiaries, (b) after the Closing, Article II to the extent it applies to
the Equityholders\' respective rights to receive Closing Date Merger
Consideration (but subject to Section 6.12 and Section 2.3) and (c) after the
Closing, Section 9.17 to the extent it applies to Skadden or Baker and Hostetler
LLP, no provision of this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or
shall confer upon any other person any right, benefit or remedy of any nature
whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Debt Financing Sources shall be third-party beneficiaries of
each of the Financing Provisions (it being understood and agreed that the
provisions of such Sections will be enforceable by the Debt Financing
Sources). In addition, the Parent Parties acknowledge the right of the Company
and the Equityholder Representative, on behalf of the Equityholders, to pursue
Damages suffered by its Equityholders as a group in the event of any Parent
Party\'s failure to consummate the Merger in breach of this Agreement.



9.10Failure or Delay Not Waiver; Remedies Cumulative. No failure or delay on
the part of any party hereto in the exercise of any right hereunder shall
impair such right or be construed to be a waiver of, or acquiescence in, any
breach of any representation, warranty or agreement herein, nor shall any
single or partial exercise of any such right preclude other or 

further exercise thereof or of any other right. All rights and remedies
existing under this Agreement are cumulative to, and not exclusive of, any
rights or remedies otherwise available.



9.11Specific Performance. Each party hereto acknowledges that money damages
would be both incalculable and an insufficient remedy for any breach of this
Agreement by such party and that any such breach would cause the other parties
irreparable harm. Accordingly, each party hereto also agrees that, in the
event of any breach or threatened breach of the provisions of this Agreement
by such party, the other parties shall be entitled to equitable relief without
the requirement of proof of actual damages or the posting a bond or other
security, including in the form of injunctions and orders for specific
performance. Any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party will
be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred
hereby, or by law or equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party of
any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy. Nothing
contained in this Section 9.11 shall require any party to institute any
proceeding for (or limit any party\'s right to institute any proceeding for)
specific performance under this Section 9.11 before exercising any termination
right under Article VIII (and pursuing damages after such termination to the
extent permitted by this Agreement) nor shall the commencement of any action
pursuant to this Section 9.11 or anything contained in this Section 9.11
restrict or limit any party\'s right to terminate this Agreement in accordance
with the terms of Article VIII or pursue any other remedies under this
Agreement that may be available then or thereafter. Each party hereby agrees
not to raise any objections to the availability of the equitable remedy of
specific performance to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of
this Agreement by any party, and to specifically enforce the terms and
provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or
to enforce compliance with, the respective covenants and obligations of the
parties under this Agreement.



9.12Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial.



(a)This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, its
rules of conflict of laws notwithstanding. Each party hereby agrees and
consents to be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery
of the State of Delaware in and for New Castle County, or if the Court of
Chancery lacks jurisdiction over such dispute, in any state or federal court
having jurisdiction over the matter situated in New Castle County, Delaware,
in any suit, action or proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or
based on any matter arising out of or in connection with, this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby. Each party hereby irrevocably consents
to the service of any and all process in any such suit, action or proceeding
by the delivery of such process to such party at the address and in the manner
provided in Section 9.2 hereof. Each of the parties hereto irrevocably and
unconditionally waives any objection to the laying of venue of any action,
suit or proceeding arising out of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware in and
for New Castle County, or if the Court of Chancery lacks jurisdiction over
such dispute, in any state or federal court having jurisdiction over the
matter situated in New Castle County, Delaware, and hereby further irrevocably
and unconditionally waives and agrees not to plead or claim in any such court
that any such action, suit or proceeding brought in any such court has been
brought in an inconvenient forum.



(b)Notwithstanding the foregoing in Section 9.12(a), each of the parties
agrees that it will not bring or support any suit, action or proceeding of any
kind or description, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in
tort or otherwise, against any of the Debt Financing Sources in any way
relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby,
including any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the Debt
Financing or the performance of the transactions related thereto, in any forum
other than the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York, or,
if under applicable Law exclusive jurisdiction is vested in the Federal
courts, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York
located in the County of New York (and appellate courts thereof), and makes
the agreements, waivers and consents set forth in Section 9.12(a) mutatis
mutandis but with respect to the courts specified in this Section 9.12(b).



(c)EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES,
AND THEREFORE EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY
RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION
DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, OR THE
BREACH, TERMINATION OR VALIDITY OF THIS AGREEMENT, OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (i)
NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (ii) EACH SUCH PARTY
UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (iii) EACH
SUCH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND (iv) EACH SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN
INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL
WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 9.12(C).



9.13Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts, including by means of facsimile or by e-mail delivery of a
".pdf" format data file, each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an
original copy of this Agreement and all of which taken together shall
constitute one and the same agreement.

means "including, without limitation" and "including, but not limited to," and
(ii) the word "or" is not exclusive, unless the context otherwise requires.
(b) Unless the context requires otherwise, words using the singular or plural
number also include the plural or singular number, respectively, the use of

incorporated in and made a part of this Agreement as if set forth in full
herein. (d) Any capitalized terms used in any exhibit or Schedule but not
otherwise defined therein, shall have the meaning as defined in this
Agreement. (e) When a reference is made in this Agreement to a section,

amended from time to time and to any rules or regulations promulgated

and warranties contained in this Agreement that are made as of a specific date
or dates, references to any statute shall be deemed to refer to such statute,
as amended, and to any rules or regulations promulgated thereunder, in each
case, as of such date or dates. (h) All references in this Agreement to

(i)Each of the Parent Parties further agrees, on behalf of itself and, after
the Closing, on behalf of the Surviving Company and its Affiliates, that (A)
all communications in any form or format whatsoever that occurred prior to the
Closing between or among Skadden, on the one hand, and the Company or any of
its directors, officers, employees or other representatives, on the other
hand, and (B) all communications in any form or format whatsoever that
occurred prior to or following the Closing between or among Skadden, on the
one hand, and any Seller Party or any of such Seller Party\'s directors,
officers, employees or other representatives, on the other hand, in each case
that relate in any way to the negotiation, documentation and consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any 

dispute arising under this Agreement (collectively, including any files or
other materials that contain such information, the "Seller Party Privileged
Communications") shall be deemed to be attorney-client privileged and that the
Seller Party Privileged Communications and the expectation of client
confidence relating thereto belong solely to the Seller Parties, shall be
controlled by the Equityholder Representative on behalf of the other Seller
Parties and shall not pass to or be claimed by any Parent Party, the Surviving
Company or any of their Affiliates, or any insurance carrier providing the RandW
Insurance Policy.



(ii)(A) All communications in any form or format whatsoever that occurred
prior to or following the Closing between or among Baker and Hostetler LLP, on
the one hand, and any Parent Party or any of such Parent Party\'s directors,
officers, employees or other representatives, on the other hand, and (B) all
communications in any form or format whatsoever that occurred following the
Closing between or among Baker and Hostetler LLP, on the one hand, and the
Surviving Company or any of its directors, officers, employees or other
representatives, on the other hand, in each case that relate in any way to the
negotiation, documentation and consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement or any dispute arising under this Agreement (collectively,
including any files or other materials that contain such information, the
"Parent Party Privileged Communications") shall be deemed to be attorney-
client privileged and the Parent Party Privileged Communications and the
expectation of client confidence relating thereto belong solely to the Parent
Parties, shall be controlled by the Parent on behalf of the other Parent
Parties and the Surviving Company and shall not pass to or be claimed by any
Seller Party or any of their post-Closing Affiliates.



(e)Exclusions for Third-Party Claims and Legally Required Disclosure.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a dispute arises between any
Parent Party or the Surviving Company or any of their respective Affiliates,
on the one hand, and a third-party other than a Seller Party, on the other
hand, a Parent Party or the Surviving Company may assert the attorney-client
privilege to prevent the disclosure of the Seller Party Privileged
Communications to such third-party; provided, however, that none of the Parent
Parties or the Surviving Company or any of their respective Affiliates may
waive such privilege without the prior written consent of the Equityholder
Representative. In the event that a Parent Party or the Surviving Company or
any of their respective Affiliates is legally required by governmental order
or otherwise to access or obtain a copy of all or a portion of the Seller
Party Privileged Communications, Parent shall promptly (and, in any event,
within five (5) Business Days), to the extent not legally prohibited, notify
the Equityholder Representative in writing (including by making specific
reference to this Section) so that the Equityholder Representative can seek a
protective order at its sole cost and expense and the Parent Parties agree to,
and to cause the Surviving Company to, use all commercially reasonable efforts
to assist therewith.



(f) No Duty to Disclose Privileged Communications. To the extent that any
Seller Party Privileged Communications maintained by Skadden constitute
property of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, only the Seller
Parties shall hold such property rights and Skadden shall have no duty to
reveal or disclose any such Seller Party Privileged Communications by reason
of any attorney-client relationship between Skadden, on the one hand, and the
Parent Parties or the Surviving Company or any of their Affiliates, on the
other hand. To the extent that any Parent Party Privileged Communications
maintained by Baker and Hostetler LLP constitute property of any Parent Party or
any Subsidiary thereof, only the Parent 

Parties shall hold such property rights and Baker and Hostetler LLP shall have
no duty to reveal or disclose any such Parent Party Privileged Communications
by reason of any attorney-client relationship between Baker and Hostetler LLP,
on the one hand, and any of the Seller Parties or any Affiliate thereof, on
the other hand.



(g)Prohibition on Access to or Use of Privileged Communications. Each of the
Parent Parties agrees that it will not, and that it will cause the Surviving
Company and its Affiliates, and its and their respective employees, directors,
officers, agents and representatives not to, (i) access or use the Seller
Party Privileged Communications, including by way of review of any electronic
data, communications or other information, or by seeking to have any Seller
Party waive the attorney-client or other privilege, or by otherwise asserting
that a Parent Party, the Surviving Company or any of their respective
Affiliates has the right to waive the attorney-client or other privilege or
(ii) seek to obtain the Seller Party Privileged Communications from Skadden or
any Seller Parties. Each of the Seller Parties agrees that it will not, and
that it will cause its Affiliates, and its and their respective employees,
directors, officers, agents and representatives not to, seek to obtain the
Parent Party Privileged Communications from Baker and Hostetler LLP or any
Parent Parties.



(h)Consent to Baker and Hostetler Future Representation. The parties acknowledge
that Baker and Hostetler LLP has represented the Parent Parties in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The parties hereby
consent to the representation by Baker and Hostetler LLP of the Parent Parties
or any of their Affiliates (including, following the Closing, the Surviving
Company and the Company Subsidiaries) in any future matter, including any
post-Closing dispute concerning this Agreement or any of the other Ancillary
Agreements.



9.18 Non-Recourse Against Debt Financing Sources; Waiver of Certain Claims.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
parties hereby agree that, subject to the rights of any Parent Party under the
Commitment Letters/Agreement and any definitive agreements entered into in
connection with the Debt Financing or any Alternative Financing, (a) no Debt
Financing Source shall have any liability to the Company, the Equityholder
Representative, the Equityholders or any of their respective Affiliates or any
other Person relating to or arising out of the Merger, this Agreement, any of
the Ancillary Agreements or the Debt Financing or any Alternative Financing,
or any transactions contemplated by, or document related to, the foregoing
(including any willful breach thereof, or the failure of the transactions
contemplated hereby to be consummated), whether at law or equity, in contract
or in tort or otherwise, and (b) none of the Company, the Equityholder
Representative, the Equityholders or any of their respective Affiliates shall
have any rights or claims whatsoever against any of the Debt Financing Sources
under this Agreement, any of the Ancillary Agreements or in connection with
the Debt Financing or any Alternative Financing, or otherwise in respect of
the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by any of the
foregoing, whether at law or equity, in contract or in tort, or otherwise.
Each of the Company, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates, and the
Equityholder Representative, on behalf of itself and the Equityholders, hereby
agrees that none of the Debt Financing Sources shall have any liability or
obligations to the Company, the Equityholder Representative, the Equityholders
or any of their respective Affiliates relating to this Agreement, any of the
Ancillary Agreements or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby
(including with respect to the Debt 

Financing or any Alternative Financing). Each of the Company, on behalf of
itself and its Affiliates, and the Equityholder Representative, on behalf of
itself and the Equityholders, hereby waives any and all claims and causes of
action (whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) against
the Debt Financing Sources that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to
this Agreement, any of the Ancillary Agreements, any debt financing commitment
or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby (including the Debt
Financing or any Alternative Financing). This Section 9.18 shall, with respect
to the matters referenced herein, supersede any provision of this Agreement to
the contrary and is intended to benefit and may be enforced by the Debt
Financing Sources and shall be binding on all successors and assigns of the
Company and the Equityholder Representative.
