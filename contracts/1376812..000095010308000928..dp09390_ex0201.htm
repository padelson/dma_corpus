ARTICLE 2

 

The Merger

 

 

Section 2.01. The Merger. (a) At the Effective Time, Merger Subsidiary
shall be merged with and into the Company in accordance with Delaware Law,
whereupon the separate existence of Merger Subsidiary shall cease, and the
Company shall be the surviving corporation (the "Surviving Corporation").

 

 

(b) The closing of the Merger (the "Closing") shall take place at the
offices of Davis Polk and Wardwell, 450 Lexington Avenue, New York, New York
10017 at 10:00 A.M., three Business Days after the date on which the last of
the conditions set forth in Article 9 shall have been satisfied or waived
(other than those conditions that (i) by their nature are to be satisfied at
Closing and (ii) will

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

17  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be satisfied at Closing), or on such other date, time and place as the
Company and Parent may mutually agree (the "Closing Date"). On the Closing
Date the Company and Merger Subsidiary shall file a certificate of merger
with the Delaware Secretary of State and make all other filings or recordings
required by Delaware Law in connection with the Merger. The Merger shall
become effective at such time (the "Effective Time") as the certificate of
merger is duly filed with the Delaware Secretary of State (or at such later
time as may be specified in the certificate of merger by agreement of the
parties).

 

 

(c) From and after the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger shall be as
provided in this Agreement and the applicable provisions of Delaware Law.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, at the Effective Time, all
of the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and
Merger Subsidiary shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all of the
debts, liabilities, obligations and duties of the Company and Merger
Subsidiary shall become the debts, liabilities, obligations and duties of the
Surviving Corporation.

 

 

Section 2.02. Conversion of Shares. At the Effective Time:

 

 

(a) except as otherwise provided in Section 2.02(b) and Section 2.09, and
subject to Section 2.04(b), each share of Company Stock (including Company
Restricted Stock and shares of Company Stock issued upon conversion of the
Company Convertible Debt Notes) outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into the right to receive the Net Per Share
Number of shares of Parent Stock (together with the cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Parent Stock as specified below, the
"Merger Consideration"); provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing, the
parties acknowledge and agree that the Escrow Shares shall be deducted from
the Parent Stock deliverable to each Designated Stockholder based on that
Designated Stockholder's Pro Rata Share of the Escrow Shares as set forth in
Section 2.08 and such Escrow Shares shall be deliverable to such Designated
Stockholders only as provided in the Escrow Agreement.

 

 

(b) each share of Company Stock held by the Company as treasury stock shall
be canceled, and no payment shall be made with respect thereto; and

 

 

(c) each share of common stock of Merger Subsidiary outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one share of
common stock of the Surviving Corporation with the same rights, powers and
privileges as the shares so converted and shall constitute the only
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

 

 

Section 2.03. Surrender and Payment. (a) Parent shall act as agent or prior
to the Effective Time Parent shall appoint an agent (Parent or such agent,
as applicable, the "Exchange Agent") for the purpose of exchanging for the
Merger Consideration certificates representing shares of Company Stock,
including Company Restricted Stock (the "Certificates"). Parent shall make
available to

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Exchange Agent, as needed, the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect
of the Certificates. Promptly after the Effective Time (but not later
than ten Business Days after the Closing), Parent shall send, or shall cause
the Exchange Agent to send, to each holder of shares of Company Stock at
the Effective Time, a letter of transmittal and instructions (which shall
specify that the delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall
pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent)
for use in such exchange.

 

 

(b) Each holder of shares of Company Stock that have been converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration shall be entitled to receive, upon
surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together with a properly
completed letter of transmittal, the Merger Consideration in respect of the
Company Stock represented by such Certificate, but subject to Section 2.08.
The shares of Parent Stock constituting part of such Merger Consideration,
at Parent's option, shall be in uncertificated book-entry form;
provided that, except with respect to shares then held in the Escrow Account,
if such shares of Parent Stock are in uncertificated book-entry form, upon
request by the Stockholder Representative or any Stockholder, Parent shall
provide to such Person a certificate of Parent's transfer agent of the
registration of such shares of Parent Stock in the name of the
applicable Stockholder. Until so surrendered or transferred, as the case may
be, each such Certificate shall represent after the Effective Time for all
purposes only the right to receive such Merger Consideration.

 

 

(c) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person
other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate, is
registered, it shall be a condition to such payment that (i) such Certificate
shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer
and (ii) the Person requesting such payment shall pay to the Exchange Agent
any transfer or other taxes required as a result of such payment to a Person
other than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the
reasonable satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid or
is not payable.

 

 

(d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of
transfers of shares of Company Stock. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation, they shall be
canceled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration provided for, and in
accordance with the procedures set forth, in this Article 2.

 

 

(e) Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Exchange
Agent pursuant to Section 2.03(a) that remains unclaimed by the holders of
shares of Company Stock twelve months after the Effective Time shall be
returned to Parent, upon demand, and any such holder who has not exchanged
shares of Company Stock for the Merger Consideration in accordance with this
Section 2.03 prior to that time shall thereafter look only to Parent for
payment of the Merger Consideration, and any dividends and distributions with
respect 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

19  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

thereto, in respect of such shares without any interest thereon.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall not be liable to any holder of
shares of Company Stock for any amounts paid to a public official pursuant to
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws. Any amounts remaining
unclaimed by holders of shares of Company Stock two years after the Effective
Time (or such earlier date, immediately prior to such time when the amounts
would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Authority)
shall become, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, the property of
Parent free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously
entitled thereto.

 

 

(f) No dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Stock
constituting part of the Merger Consideration, and no cash payment in lieu of
fractional shares as provided in Section 2.05, shall be paid to the holder of
any Certificates not surrendered until such Certificates are surrendered as
provided in this Section. Following such surrender, there shall be paid,
without interest, to the Person in whose name the shares of Parent Stock have
been registered, at the time of such surrender or transfer, the amount of any
cash payable in lieu of fractional shares to which such Person is entitled
pursuant to Section 2.05 and the amount of all dividends or other
distributions, if any, with a record date after the Effective Time previously
paid or payable on the date of such surrender with respect to such shares of
Parent Stock; provided that all dividends and distributions with respect to
the Escrow Shares shall be held in the Escrow Account together with the
associated Escrow Shares.

 

 

Section 2.04. Certain Adjustments.

 

 

(a) If, during the period between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of capital stock of the
Company (except for the issuance of the shares of Company Stock on conversion
of the Company Convertible Debt Notes) or Parent shall occur, including by
reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split or combination,
exchange or readjustment of shares, the Merger Consideration shall be
appropriately adjusted; provided that no adjustment to the Merger
Consideration shall be made for any change in the outstanding shares of
capital stock of Parent that results from (i) any exercise of options to
purchase shares of Parent Stock granted under Parent's stock option or
compensation plans or arrangements, which plans or arrangements have been
disclosed in the Parent SEC Documents, and any issuance of shares pursuant to
any such plans or arrangements or (ii) any bona fide issuance of shares in
which Parent receives fair value (as determined in good faith by Parent's
Board of Directors) for such shares.

 

 

(b) Subject to any adjustments required by Section 2.04(a), Parent shall not
be obligated to issue in excess of 11,901,729 shares of Parent Stock (less
(i) a number of shares, if any, equal to the Excess Transaction Expenses
Deduction Amount divided by the Market Value as calculated for purposes of
determining the Net Per Share Number and (ii) any fractional shares to the
extent provided in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

20  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section 2.05) as Merger Consideration (including, for the avoidance of doubt,
the Escrow Shares).

 

 

Section 2.05. Fractional Shares. No fractional shares of Parent Stock shall
be issued in the Merger. All fractional shares of Parent Stock that a holder
of shares of Company Stock would otherwise be entitled to receive as a result
of the Merger shall be aggregated and if a fractional share results from
such aggregation, such holder shall be entitled to receive, in lieu thereof,
an amount in cash without interest determined by multiplying the closing sale
price of a share of Parent Stock on the New York Stock Exchange on the
trading day immediately preceding the Effective Time by the fraction of a
share of Parent Stock to which such holder would otherwise have
been entitled.

 

 

Section 2.06. Withholding Rights.

 

 

(a) Each of the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall be entitled to deduct
and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant
to this Article 2 such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under any provision of federal, state,
local or foreign tax law. Any withheld amounts shall be timely remitted to
the appropriate Taxing Authority and a receipt therefor shall be delivered to
the Stockholder Representative. If the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as
the case may be, so withholds amounts, such amounts shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the
shares of Company Stock in respect of which the Surviving Corporation or
Parent, as the case may be, made such deduction and withholding.

 

 

(b) Without limiting the generality of Section 2.06(a), Parent shall be
entitled to treat the Company as a United States Real Property Holding
Corporation, as defined in Section 897 of the Code. Accordingly, Parent shall
be entitled to deduct and withhold from payments to each Stockholder pursuant
to Section 1445 of the Code, unless such Stockholder provides certification
of non-foreign status or other evidence of exemption from 1445 withholding
(in the forms attached hereto as Exhibit 2.06(b)).

 

 

Section 2.07. Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond,
in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct, as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate the Exchange Agent will issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of
the shares of Company Stock or Company Restricted Stock represented by such
Certificate, as contemplated by this Article 2.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section 2.08. Escrow Account.

 

 

(a) The Company agrees that at the Closing a number of shares of Parent Stock
equal to 10% of the aggregate number of shares of Parent Stock to be issued
to the Stockholders in the Merger pursuant to Section 2.02 (the
"Escrow Shares") shall (in lieu of being delivered to the
Designated Stockholders, and with the portion of such Escrow Shares
attributable to each Designated Stockholder being such Designated
Stockholder's Pro Rata Share) be delivered by Parent to the Escrow Agent for
deposit into a separate account (the "Escrow Account") in accordance with
the terms of the Escrow Agreement. The Escrow Shares deposited with the
Escrow Agent shall be applied by the Escrow Agent in accordance with the
terms of the Escrow Agreement to pay amounts (if any) owing under Article 11
(with such Escrow Shares valued at Market Value in accordance with the
definition thereof), with all remaining property in the Escrow Account to be
distributed to the Designated Stockholders in accordance with Section
2.08(b). For the purposes of the definition of "Escrow Shares", any dividends
or distributions paid on an Escrow Share and the interest earned thereon
shall also be deemed to be part of such "Escrow Share". For the purposes of
this Agreement, "Escrow Property" means, at any given time, the Escrow Shares
and any other funds or property contained in the Escrow Account at
such time.

 

 

(b) On the first Business Day after the first anniversary of the Closing
Date, an amount of Escrow Property equal to (x) the amount of Escrow Property
remaining in the Escrow Account at such time less (y) such amount of Escrow
Property with an aggregate value (calculated, to the extent any Escrow Shares
are held in the Escrow Account, based on the Market Value of such Escrow
Shares at such time) equal to the aggregate amount of bona fide claims for
indemnification submitted in good faith and outstanding at such time (plus
applicable interest on such claims), shall be released from the Escrow
Account for distribution to the Persons who were Designated
Stockholders immediately prior to the Effective Time in accordance with their
Pro Rata Shares. Any remaining Escrow Property in the Escrow Account at
the time all such claims for indemnification are resolved shall be released

Dissenting Shares in accordance with the provisions of such Section 262
unless and until any such holder fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or
loses its rights to appraisal and payment under Delaware Law. If, after the
Effective Time, any such holder fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or
loses such right, such Dissenting Shares will thereupon be treated as if they
had been converted into and have become exchangeable for, at the Effective
Time, the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without any interest
thereon, and the Surviving Corporation shall remain liable for payment of the
Merger Consideration for such shares, subject to Section 2.08. At the
Effective Time, any holder of Dissenting Shares shall cease to have any
rights with respect thereto, except the rights provided in Section 262 of

nature, Section 4.16 of the Company Disclosure Schedule contains a correct
and complete list identifying each "employee benefit plan," as defined in
Section 3(3) of ERISA, and, whether or not subject to ERISA, each employment,

respect to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has any liability.
Copies (which copies are correct and complete in all material respects) of
such plans (and, if applicable, related trust or funding agreements or
insurance policies) and all amendments thereto, most recent summary plan
descriptions and written interpretations thereof have been furnished to or
made available to Parent together with the most recent annual report (Form
5500 including, if applicable, Schedule B thereto) and tax return (Form 990)
prepared in connection with any such plan or trust. Such plans (disregarding
the exception for those of a de minimis nature) are referred to collectively
herein as the "Company Employee Plans."

 

 

(b) No Company Employee Plan is subject to Title IV of ERISA (other than a
"multiemployer plan," as defined below).

 

 

(c) With respect to any multiemployer plan, as defined in Section 3(37) of
ERISA (a "Multiemployer Plan"), to which the Company, its Subsidiaries or
any of their ERISA Affiliates has any liability or contributes (or has at any
time contributed or had an obligation to contribute): (i) none of the
Company, its Subsidiaries or any of their ERISA Affiliates has incurred any
withdrawal liability under Title IV of ERISA that remains unsatisfied or
would be subject to such

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

34  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

liability if, as of the Closing Date, the Company, its Subsidiaries or any of
their ERISA Affiliates were to engage in a complete withdrawal (as defined in
Section 4203 of ERISA) or partial withdrawal (as defined in Section 4205 of
ERISA) from any such multiemployer plan; and (ii) to the knowledge of the
Company, no such multiemployer plan is in reorganization or insolvent (as

(d) Each Company Employee Plan which is intended to be qualified
under Section 401(a) of the Code has received a favorable determination
letter, or has pending or has time remaining in which to file under the
applicable remedial amendment period, an application for such determination
from the Internal Revenue Service, and the Company is not aware of any reason
why any such determination letter would not be issued. Each Company
Employee Plan has been maintained in material compliance with its terms and
with the requirements prescribed by any and all statutes, orders, rules and
regulations, including ERISA and the Code, which are applicable to such
Company Employee Plan. No material events have occurred with respect to any
Company Employee Plan that would result in payment or assessment by or
against the Company of any material excise taxes under Sections 4972, 4975,
4976, 4977, 4979, 4980B, 4980D, 4980E or 5000 of the Code.

 

 

(e) The consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will
not (either alone or together with any other event) entitle any employee or
independent contractor of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to severance
pay or accelerate the time of payment or vesting (except as otherwise may be
required under Section 411(d)(3) of the Code) or trigger any payment of
funding (through a grantor trust or otherwise) of compensation or benefits
under, increase the amount payable or trigger any other material obligation
pursuant to, any Company Employee Plan. There is no contract, plan or
arrangement (written or otherwise) covering any current or former director,
officer, employee or independent contractor of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries that, individually or collectively, would entitle any such
individual to any severance or other payment solely as a result of the
transactions contemplated hereby, or would give rise to the payment of any
amount that would not be deductible pursuant to the terms of Section 280G or
162(m) of the Code. Section 4.16(e) of the Company Disclosure Schedule lists
(i) all the agreements, arrangements and other instruments which give rise to
an obligation to make or set aside amounts payable to or on behalf of the
officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries as a result of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and/or any subsequent employment termination
(whether by the Company or the officer), true and complete copies of which
have been previously provided to Parent and (ii) the maximum aggregate
amounts so payable to each such individual as a result of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and/or any subsequent employment termination
(whether by the Company or the officer).

retirement health, medical, disability or life insurance benefits for
retired, former or current employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries
except as required to avoid excise tax under Section 4980B of the Code.

 

 

(g) There has been no amendment to, written interpretation or announcement
(whether or not written) by the Company or any of its Affiliates relating to,
or change in employee participation or coverage under, any Company Employee
Plan which would increase materially the expense of maintaining such Company
Employee Plan above the level of the expense incurred in respect thereof for
the fiscal year ended December 31, 2007.

 

 

(h) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or subject
to, or is currently negotiating in connection with entering into, any
collective bargaining agreement or other contract or understanding with a
labor union or organization.

 

 

(i) All contributions and payments accrued under each Company Employee Plan,
determined in accordance with prior funding and accrual practices, as
adjusted to include proportional accruals for the period ending as of the
date hereof, have been discharged and paid on or prior to the date hereof
except to the extent set forth in the Company Balance Sheet.

 

 

(j) There is no action, suit, investigation, audit or proceeding pending
against or involving or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened against
or involving, any Company Employee Plan before any Governmental Authority.

 

 

(k) No Company Employee Plan is maintained outside the jurisdiction of the
United States or covers any employee residing or working outside the
United States.

 

 

(l) No current or former director, officer, employee or independent
contractor of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries will become entitled to
any bonus, retirement, severance, job security or similar benefit or enhanced
such benefit (including acceleration of vesting or exercise of an incentive
award) as a result of the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

 

(m) The Company Balance Sheet fairly and accurately reflects as of the date
thereof all liabilities and obligations related to any black lung disease
claims and benefits arising under any state or federal law, claims and
benefits arising under any state workers' compensation laws, and post-
retirement health or pension claims and benefits.

36  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Subsidiaries with base annual salaries equal to or in excess of $100,000

Closing to reflect any terminations and new hires) and (ii) the wage rates
for non-salaried employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries (by

Section 4.18. Labor Matters. The Company and its Subsidiaries are not
engaged in any material respect in any unfair labor practice which would
reasonably be expected to be, individually or in the aggregate, material.
There is no unfair labor practice charge or material grievance arising out of
a collective bargaining agreement, other current labor agreement with any
labor union or organization, or other material grievance proceeding against
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pending, or, to the knowledge of the
Company, threatened. Since two years prior to the date of this Agreement
there has been no unfair labor practice charge or complaint filed against the

any similar state agency responsible for the prevention of unlawful
employment practices. There is no strike or lockout or material slowdown,
work stoppage or other labor dispute pending, or to the knowledge of the
Company, threatened against, involving or otherwise materially affecting the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Since two years prior to the date of
this Agreement, any and all reductions of workforce have been carried out in
all material respects in accordance with all Applicable Law.

other licenses or authorizations should be revoked, i.e., "permit blocked."

forth in 30 C.F.R. Section 773.5 (2000).

proceeding pending against, or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened

56  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any Subsidiary may be liable or any of their respective properties before any
court or arbitrator or before or by any Governmental Authority, (i) that if
determined adversely to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, would reasonably
be expected to be, individually or in the aggregate, material or (ii) that in

definition of "Tax" is currently payable by either Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries, regardless of whether such Tax is imposed on Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries or will become payable as a consequence of consummating the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and (ii)
neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has entered into any agreement or
arrangement with any Taxing Authority with regard to the Tax liability of
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries affecting any Tax period for which the
applicable statute of limitations, after giving effect to extensions or
waivers, has not expired.

taken or agreed to take any action or is aware of any fact or circumstance
that would prevent the Merger from qualifying as a 368 Reorganization. None

fail to be in compliance with, and none of the foregoing will violate any of
the terms and conditions, or other provisions, of the Tax Separation
Agreement (the "TSA"), dated as of October 22, 2007, by and between Parent
and Peabody Energy Corporation and will not give rise to any indemnity
obligation on the part of Parent or the Surviving Corporation under Section
4.3 of the TSA.

 

 

Section 5.17. Employee Benefit Plans.

 

 

(a) No Parent Employee Plan is subject to Title IV of ERISA (other than a

any time contributed or had an obligation to contribute): (i) none of
Parent, its Subsidiaries or any of their ERISA Affiliates has incurred any
withdrawal liability under Title IV of ERISA that remains unsatisfied or
would be subject to such liability if, as of the Closing Date, Parent, its
Subsidiaries or any of their ERISA Affiliates were to engage in a complete
withdrawal (as defined in Section 4203 of ERISA) or partial withdrawal (as
defined in Section 4205 of ERISA)

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

58  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from any such multiemployer plan; and (ii) to the knowledge of Parent, no

determination letter would not be issued. Each Parent Employee Plan has been
maintained in material compliance with its terms and with the requirements
prescribed by any and all statutes, orders, rules and regulations, including
ERISA and the Code, which are applicable to such Parent Employee Plan. No
material events have occurred with respect to any Parent Employee Plan that
would result in payment or assessment by or against Parent of any material
excise taxes under Sections 4972, 4975, 4976, 4977, 4979, 4980B, 4980D, 4980E

independent contractor of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to severance pay
or accelerate the time of payment or vesting (except as otherwise may be
required under Section 411(d)(3) of the Code) or trigger any payment of
funding (through a grantor trust or otherwise) of compensation or benefits
under, increase the amount payable or trigger any other material obligation
pursuant to, any Parent Employee Plan. There is no contract, plan or
arrangement (written or otherwise) covering any current or former director,
officer, employee or independent contractor of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries that, individually or collectively, would entitle any such
individual to any severance or other payment solely as a result of the
transactions contemplated hereby, or would give rise to the payment of any
amount that would not be deductible pursuant to the terms of Section 280G or
162(m) of the Code.

its Subsidiaries pending, or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened. Since
two years prior to the date of this Agreement there has been no unfair labor

or to the knowledge of Parent, pending or threatened, before (A) the National
Labor Relations Board or any similar state agency, or (B) the Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission or any similar state agency responsible for
the prevention of unlawful employment practices. There is no strike or
lockout or material slowdown, work stoppage or other labor dispute pending,
or to the knowledge of Parent, threatened against, involving or otherwise
materially affecting Parent or any of its Subsidiaries. Since two years prior

expected to result in liability to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries.

arbitrator or Governmental Authority under any Environmental Law regarding
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or any property or assets currently or
formerly owned, operated or used by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, in any
such case that would interfere with the respective ability of Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries to continue to

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

60  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

operate their respective assets and conduct their respective businesses as

Materials in violation of Environmental Law or in a manner that would
reasonably be expected to result in liability under Environmental Laws or
Environmental Permits, and, to the knowledge of Parent, no other Person has

refuse to renew or reissue any such Environmental Permit upon its expiration.

 

 

(h) Each of the material applications for Environmental Permits in the name
of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries has been made in accordance with
Applicable Laws. Parent or one of its Subsidiaries will, on any grant of any
of such applications, hold legal or beneficial title to the interest in each
such application. Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has

Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby from Section 203 of

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

61  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Delaware Law, and, accordingly, neither such Section nor any other
antitakeover or similar statute or regulation applies or purports to apply to
any such transactions. No other "control share acquisition," "fair
price," "moratorium" or other antitakeover laws enacted under U.S. state or
federal laws apply to this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby.

 

 

(b) By amendment in the form attached as Exhibit 5.20(b), Parent has taken
all action necessary to render the rights issued pursuant to the terms of the
Rights Agreement (the "Rights Agreement") dated as of October 22, 2007 by

agent, inapplicable to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby, including the Merger and the Parent Stock Issuance.

 

 

Section 5.21. Material Contracts; Affiliate Transactions. Neither Parent nor
any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or bound by any contract, arrangement,
commitment or understanding as of the date hereof that is a "material
contract" (as such term is defined in Item 601(b)(10) of Regulation S-K of
the 1933 Act) or other instrument that is required to filed as an exhibit to
the Parent SEC Documents pursuant to Item 601(b)(2), (4) or (9) of Regulation
S-K of the 1933 Act, that, in any such case, has not been filed or
incorporated by reference in the Parent SEC Documents (each, a
"Parent Material Contract"). Each Parent Material Contract is, to Parent's
knowledge, a valid and binding agreement of the parties thereto (other than
Parent and its Subsidiaries), and, to Parent's knowledge, is in full
force and effect and in all material respects enforceable against such other
parties, in accordance with its terms (except to the extent that
enforceability may be limited by (i) applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws from time
to time in effect affecting generally the enforcement of creditors' rights
and remedies and (ii) general principles of equity, whether in a proceeding
at law or in equity) and prior to the date hereof neither Parent nor any of
its Subsidiaries has received any written notice to terminate, in whole or
material part, any of the same. None of Parent, any of its Subsidiaries or,
to the knowledge of Parent, any other party thereto is in default or breach
in any material respect under the material terms of any such Parent Material
Contract, and, to the knowledge of Parent, no event or circumstance has
occurred that, with notice or lapse of time or both, is reasonably likely to
constitute any event of default thereunder that would be reasonably expected
to result in the termination of such Parent Material Contract. True and
complete copies of each Parent Material Contract (including all modifications
and amendments thereto) have been made available to the Company prior to the
date hereof. Parent has no knowledge that any current officer, director
or Affiliate of Parent is a party to any material agreement, contract,
commitment or transaction with Parent or its Subsidiaries or has any material
interest in any material property used by Parent or its Subsidiaries that
would be required to be disclosed in a Parent SEC Document under Item 404 of
Regulation S-K under the 1933 Act that has not been so disclosed.

for sale or sold by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries infringes,
misappropriates or otherwise violates any Intellectual Property Rights of any
Person; (v) the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement will not alter, encumber, impair or extinguish any
Intellectual Property Right of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries; and (vi)
Parent and its Subsidiaries have taken reasonable steps to maintain the
confidentiality of all material Trade Secrets owned, used or held for use by
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries and no such Trade Secrets have been
disclosed other than to employees, representatives and agents of Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries all of whom are bound by written confidentiality
agreements.

 

 

Section 5.24. Licenses and Permits. "Parent Permits" means all licenses,
mining leases, mining authorities, franchises, permits, certificates,
approvals or other similar authorizations issued to Parent and its
Subsidiaries by any Governmental Authority, including those relating to the
Identified Mining Laws but not including any other Environmental Permits. The
Parent Permits are in all material respects sufficient permits to conduct the
business of Parent and its Subsidiaries as currently conducted. The Parent
Permits are in all material respects valid and in full force and effect,
neither Parent nor any Subsidiary of Parent is in material default under, and
no condition exists that with notice or lapse of time or both would
constitute a material default under, any of the Parent Permits. Neither
Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has received written notice that the
Person issuing or authorizing any such Permit intends to terminate or will
refuse to renew or reissue any such Permit upon its expiration. Parent and
its Subsidiaries have complied with the terms and conditions of the Parent
Permits in all material respects.

Section 5.25. Absence of Certain Business Practices. Neither Parent nor any
of its Subsidiaries, nor any of their respective officers, directors,
employees or agents, nor any Person acting on behalf of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries, has, directly or indirectly, within the past two years given or
agreed to give any gift or similar benefit to any customer, supplier,
governmental employee or other Person who is or may be in a position to help
or hinder the respective business of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (or
assist Parent or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with any actual or
proposed transaction) that (a) might subject Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries to any material damage or material penalty assessed by any
Governmental Authority, (b) if not given in the past might have had a
material adverse effect, (c) if not continued in the future, might have a
material adverse effect or (d) might subject Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries to suit by any Governmental Authority.

 

 

Section 5.26. Financing. Parent has provided the Company with a true and
complete copy of an executed commitment letter, including the attachments
thereto (such commitment letter, with all such attachments and the fee letter
related thereto entered into concurrently therewith, the "Parent Financing
Commitment Letter") from the ArcLight Funds confirming such parties'
commitment to provide Parent with financing of up to $150,000,000 to be used
by Parent for the purposes set forth in the Parent Financing
Commitment Letter (the "Parent Financing"). The commitments and obligations
to consummate the Parent Financing set forth in the Parent Financing
Commitment Letter are subject to no conditions or other contingencies other
than those set forth in the Parent Financing Commitment Letter. Assuming the
Parent Financing Commitment Letter is a legal, valid and binding obligation
of the ArcLight Funds, the Parent Financing Commitment Letter is in full
force and effect and is the legal, valid and binding obligation of Parent. To
the knowledge of Parent, the Parent Financing Commitment Letter is the legal,
valid and binding obligation of the other parties thereto. As of the date
hereof, the Parent Financing Commitment Letter has not been amended or
modified in any respect. No event has occurred which, with or without notice,
lapse of time or both, would constitute a default or material breach on the
part of Parent under any term or condition of the Parent Financing Commitment
Letter, and to the knowledge of Parent, no facts or circumstances exist as of
the date hereof that would reasonably be expected to result in Parent being
unable to satisfy on a timely basis any term or condition of closing to be
satisfied by it pursuant to the Parent Financing Commitment Letter. As of the
date hereof, Parent has paid in full all commitment or other fees required by
the Parent Financing Commitment Letter to be paid by it as of the
date hereof. The Parent Financing, if funded in accordance with the
Parent Financing Commitment Letter, will not be in contravention of the terms
and conditions of the Credit Agreement dated as of October 31, 2007, as
amended, among Parent, as borrower, each lender from time to time
party thereto, and Bank of America, N.A., as Administrative Agent, Swing
Line Lender and L/C Issuer (the "Parent Credit Agreement").

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

66  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section 5.27. No Parent Material Adverse Effect. The representations
and warranties contained in this Article 5, disregarding any qualification
contained therein as to materiality or Parent Material Adverse Effect, are
true and correct, with such exceptions as have not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent
Material Adverse Effect.

 

 

Section 5.28. No Other Representations and Warranties. Except for
the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement or any
other Transaction Document, neither Parent nor any other Person makes any
other express or implied representation or warranty on behalf of Parent and
its Subsidiaries (and its and their business operations, financial condition,
assets and properties) and the Company shall be entitled to rely only on
such representations and warranties. Parent disclaims any representation or
warranty, whether made by Parent or any of its Affiliates,
officers, directors, employees, agents or representatives, that is not
contained in this Agreement, any other Transaction Document or in any
certificate delivered pursuant to this Agreement or any other
Transaction Document.

Business Days after the date hereof, the Company shall prepare and mail a
notice complying with the requirements of Section 228 of Delaware Law to all
Stockholders who have not executed and delivered a Stockholder Consent. Such

70  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) As promptly as practicable after the execution and delivery of this
Agreement by each of the parties hereto, the Company shall prepare, with the
cooperation and assistance of Parent, an information statement (the
"Information Statement"), which shall include information about this
Agreement, the other Transaction Documents, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. The Information Statement shall
be reasonably acceptable to Parent. The Company shall cause the
Information Statement to be mailed to the Stockholders as promptly as
practicable (but in no event earlier than two Business Days after the initial
filing of the Registration Statement with the SEC). The Company shall comply
with the requirements of Section 262 of Delaware Law. The
Information Statement and any amendments or supplements thereto, when first
mailed to holders of Company Stock, will comply as to form in all material
respects with the applicable requirements of Delaware Law, and will not

fact necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in the light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading (other than
information which is contained in the Information Statement and is supplied
by Parent); provided that to the extent the Information Statement or any
amendment or supplement thereto contains information of the same nature as
the matters referenced in the first sentence of Section 4.22(k) (as such
matters relate to the Company and its Subsidiaries), such information shall
be true (and not fail to omit necessary facts) based only upon the knowledge
of the Company.

 

 

Section 6.03. No Solicitation. (a) Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries shall, nor shall the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries authorize or permit any of its or their stockholders, officers,
directors, employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants,
consultants, representatives, agents or advisors (collectively,
"Representatives") to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or take
any action to facilitate or encourage the submission of any Acquisition
Proposal, (ii) enter into or participate in any discussions or negotiations
with, furnish any information relating to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or afford access to the business, properties, assets, books or
records of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to, otherwise knowingly
cooperate in any way with, or knowingly assist, participate in, facilitate or
encourage any effort by any Third Party that is seeking to make, or has made,
an Acquisition Proposal, or (iii) enter into any agreement in principle,
letter of intent, term sheet or other similar instrument relating to an
Acquisition Proposal.

 

 

(b) The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and their
respective Representatives to, cease immediately and cause to be terminated
any and all existing activities, discussions or negotiations, if any, with
any Third Party or any Third Party's Representatives with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall promptly, after the date hereof,
request that each Third Party (other than the Company's Representatives), if
any, that has executed a currently binding confidentiality agreement within
the 24-month period prior to the date hereof in connection with its
consideration of any Acquisition Proposal return or

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

71  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

destroy all confidential information heretofore furnished to such Person by
or on behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (and all analyses and
other materials prepared by or on behalf of such Person that contains,
reflects or analyzes that information). The Company shall take all
commercially reasonable actions necessary to secure its rights and ensure the
performance of such other party's obligations under such confidentiality
agreements as promptly as practicable; provided that except as set forth in
the preceding sentence (relating to the request of the Company) the Company
shall not be required to take action to cause a Third Party to return or
destroy information unless the Company has knowledge of a breach of the
confidentiality or use provisions of the applicable confidentiality
agreement.

 

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 6.03,
if at any time following the date of this Agreement and prior to obtaining
the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company has received a written
Acquisition Proposal from a third party that the Company's Board of Directors
believes in good faith to be bona fide and the Company's Board of Directors
determines in good faith, after consultation with an independent financial
advisor and an outside counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or
could reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal, then the
Company may: (A) furnish information with respect to the Company and its
Subsidiaries to the person making such Acquisition Proposal, (B) participate
in discussions or negotiations with the person making such Acquisition
Proposal regarding such Acquisition Proposal and (C) terminate this Agreement
pursuant to Section 10.01(e) to concurrently enter into a definitive
agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal, if the Board determines in
good faith that the failure to take such action would violate its fiduciary
duties under Applicable Law. During the time period contemplated by the first
sentence of this clause (c), the Company shall promptly notify Parent if it
receives an Acquisition Proposal from a person or group of related persons
(including the material terms and conditions thereof but not the identity of
the person making such Acquisition Proposal) and shall keep Parent apprised
of any material developments, discussions and negotiations concerning such
Acquisition Proposal. As used herein, the term "Superior Proposal" means
any bona fide binding written Acquisition Proposal not obtained in violation
of this Section 6.03 that the Company's Board of Directors determines in its
good faith judgment provides for terms and conditions that are more favorable
to the Company's stockholders from a financial point of view than
this Agreement; provided that for purposes of the definition of
"Superior Proposal", the references to "20% or more" in the definition
of Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be references to "a majority" and
the definition of Acquisition Proposal shall only refer to a transaction or
series of transactions (x) directly involving the Company (and not
exclusively its Subsidiaries) or (y) involving a sale or transfer of all or
substantially all of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as
a whole.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

72

Time, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall make or change
any material Tax election, change any annual tax accounting period, adopt or
change any method of tax accounting, file any material amended Tax Returns or
claims for material Tax refunds, enter into any material closing agreement,
surrender any material Tax claim, audit or assessment, surrender any right to
claim a material Tax refund, offset or other reduction in Tax liability,
consent to any extension or waiver of the limitations period applicable to
any Tax claim or assessment or take or omit to take any other action, if any
such action or omission would have the effect of increasing the Tax liability
or reducing any Tax asset of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

 

 

(b) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries shall establish or cause to be
established in accordance with GAAP on or before the Effective Time an
adequate accrual for all Taxes due with respect to any period or portion
thereof ending prior to or as of the Effective Time.

 

 

(c) All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration, value added
and other such Taxes and fees (including any penalties and interest) incurred
in connection with the Merger (including any real property transfer tax and
any similar Tax) shall be paid by the Company when due, and the Company
shall, at its own expense, file all necessary Tax returns and other
documentation with respect to all such Taxes and fees for which Applicable
Law imposes a filing obligation on the Company, and, if required by
Applicable Law, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, join
in the execution of any such Tax returns and other documentation.

 

 

(d) From the date hereof until the Effective Time, the Company shall
cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by Parent and its
authorized representatives, in connection with Tax matters relating to the
Company and its Subsidiaries, including providing reasonable access to the
offices, books and records, and employees and any third-party tax consultants
of the Company and its Subsidiaries, providing records and information that
are reasonably relevant to the preparation and filing of any Tax Return,
statement, report or form, providing records and information relevant to any
audit, litigation or other proceeding, providing copies of any Tax
Sharing Agreements and making employees and any third-party tax
consultants available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional
information and explanation of any material provided hereunder.

its reasonable best efforts to obtain customary "pay-off" letters from each
of the Persons in respect of whom Transaction Expenses are, will be or were
payable, acknowledging that each of such Persons has been paid in full, or
will as of the Closing, be paid in full, all Transaction Expenses owed to it.
All Transaction Expenses that are in excess of the Transaction Expenses Cap
and that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

73  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are not included in the Excess Transaction Expenses Deduction Amount shall be
the sole responsibility of the Designated Stockholders in accordance with
Section 11.02(a) (and, if any claim is made upon the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries after the Closing with respect to any such Transaction Expenses,
Parent may, in its discretion, elect to have such expenses paid from the
Escrow Property in accordance with Section 11.02(a) and the
Escrow Agreement).

 

 

Section 6.06. Company Convertible Debt. Prior to the Closing, the Company
will not (i) amend or waive any term (including the transfer restrictions
contained therein) of any of the Company Convertible Debt Notes or any
related agreement (including the Company Convertible Debt NPA), in either
case, in a manner adverse to Parent (it being agreed and understood that any
amendment or waiver of any term having an effect that applies only in the
event this Agreement is terminated shall not, for purposes hereof, be "in a
manner adverse to Parent") or (ii) repay or prepay any of the Company
Convertible Debt Notes.

 

 

Section 6.07. 280G Approval. Prior to the Closing, the Company will use
its commercially reasonable efforts to satisfy the approval requirements of

in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, including pursuant
to the Stock Plan.

Parent agrees that:

Time or the earlier termination of this Agreement in accordance with the

consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned):

 

 

(a) Parent shall not adopt or propose any change in its certificate of
incorporation or bylaws;

 

 

(b) Parent shall not declare, set aside or pay any dividend or other
distribution (whether in cash, stock or property or any combination thereof)
in respect of its capital stock; and

 

 

(c) Parent shall not, and shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries to, take
any action that would intentionally make any representation and warranty of
Parent hereunder inaccurate in any material respect at, or as of any time
prior to, the Effective Time as if made as of the Effective Time.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

74

Section 7.04 . Employee Matters.

 

 

(a) As used herein, the term "Company Employees" means the individuals who
are employed by the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company immediately
prior to the Effective Time and the term "Continuing Employees" means the
Company Employees who continue to be employed with Parent or one of its
Subsidiaries or the Surviving Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries upon the
Effective Time. Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and
its Subsidiaries to, provide any Company Employee whose employment is
involuntarily terminated within six months following the Closing Date (other
than for cause) who is covered by a severance plan listed on Section 7.04(a)
of the Parent Disclosure Schedule with severance benefits as provided under
such severance plan; provided that such Company Employee or Continuing
Employee, as the case may be, satisfies any conditions for the receipt of
severance benefits under such applicable severance plan.

 

 

(b) Subject to Applicable Law, Parent shall and shall cause the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, for six months following the Closing,
provide to each Continuing Employee while such Continuing Employee continues
to be employed by Parent or one of its Subsidiaries or the Surviving
Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries, employee benefits that are, at the
election of Parent, substantially comparable in the aggregate to either (i)
those provided to similarly situated employees of Parent or (ii) those
provided by the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the
Closing.

 

 

(c) Nothing contained herein shall be construed as requiring Parent, its
Affiliates, the Company or its Subsidiaries to continue any specific Company
Employee Plan, or to continue the employment of any specific person. The
provisions of this Section 7.04 are solely for the benefit of the parties to
this Agreement, and no Company Employee or Continuing Employee shall have any
third-party beneficiary rights or rights to any specific levels of
compensation or benefits as a result of the application of this Section 7.04.

 

 

Section 7.05. Board Appointments. Effective as of the Effective Time (or, if
the Effective Time shall occur before the date of Parent's 2008 annual
meeting of stockholders, promptly after such meeting), the Board of Directors
of Parent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

75

members as the Stockholders are then entitled to nominate pursuant to the
Voting Agreement and (ii) appoint to the Board of Directors the individuals
designated in accordance with the Voting Agreement.

prior to the sixth anniversary of the Closing Date, Parent will not, and will
not permit the Company to, amend (whether by merger, dissolution, liquidation
or otherwise) the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the Company in a
manner that would diminish the indemnification rights of the officers and
directors of the Company thereunder with respect to acts or omissions
occurring prior to the Effective Time and Parent agrees to cause
the Surviving Corporation to indemnify (and advance expenses) to the maximum
extent provided therein except to the extent the Surviving Corporation would
be limited from doing so under Applicable Law. For the avoidance of doubt
the parties agree that any indemnification payment required to be made
thereunder with respect to any claim, action, suit or proceeding by any
holder of shares of capital stock of the Company will be subject to
indemnification under Section 11.02(a) (in accordance with the terms
thereof). The provisions of this Section 7.06 will survive the Closing, shall
be enforceable by each officer and director of the Company and his or her
successors and representatives, each of whom shall be a third party
beneficiary of the obligations set forth in this Section 7.06, and shall be
in addition to any rights such officer or director may have under Applicable
Law or any agreement set forth on Section 4.21(a)(ix) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule.

 

 

(b) At the Closing, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to use all
commercially reasonably efforts to obtain and maintain a "tail" extension of
(i) the Company's existing directors' and officers' insurance policies and
(ii) the Company's existing fiduciary liability insurance policies, in each
case for acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time and for a
claims reporting or discovery period of at least six years from and after the
Effective Time from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit
rating as the Company's current insurance carrier with respect to directors'
and officers' liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance
(collectively, "DandO Insurance") with terms, conditions, retentions and limits
of liability that are at least as favorable as the Company's existing
policies with respect to any actual or alleged error, misstatement,
misleading statement, act, omission, neglect, breach of duty or any other
matter claimed against a director or officer of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries by reason of him or her serving in such capacity that existed or
occurred at or prior to the Effective Time (including in connection with this
Agreement or the other Transaction Documents or the transactions or actions
contemplated hereby or thereby); provided that in no event shall the
Surviving Corporation be required to expend for such tail extension an
aggregate amount in excess of $350,000; provided further that if the cost of
such insurance coverage exceeds such amount, the Surviving Corporation shall
obtain a policy with the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

76  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

greatest coverage available (in its reasonable judgment) for a cost not
exceeding such amount. In lieu of Parent's and the Surviving
Corporation's obligations in the preceding sentence, the Company is hereby
expressly permitted to, prior to Closing, purchase such tail extension;
provided that the terms and conditions thereof are as set forth in this
Section 7.06(b) and otherwise reasonably acceptable to Parent, with the
aggregate payments made (or to be made) by the Company in no event exceeding
an aggregate amount of $350,000.

 

 

(c) If the Surviving Corporation or any of its respective successors or
assigns (i) shall consolidate with or merge into any other corporation or
entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or (ii) shall transfer all or substantially all
of its properties and assets to any individual, corporation or other entity,
then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so that the
successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation shall assume all of the
obligations set forth in this Section 7.06.

 

 

Section 7.07. Books and Records. From and after the Closing, Parent and
the Surviving Corporation shall provide the Stockholder Representative (and
its representatives and advisors) with reasonable access, for (a)
financial reporting or disclosure purposes, or (b) defending any claim in
respect of which an indemnification claim has been made, to all of the
Company's and its Subsidiaries' accounting and tax books, records, notes and
memoranda, whether electronic or written ("Books and Records") in existence
on or prior to the Effective Time, pertaining or relating to the period on or
prior to the Effective Time and reasonably necessary for the relevant
purpose; provided that (A) the provision of access pursuant to this Section
7.07 shall be during normal business hours, following a reasonable advance
request for such access and shall not interfere unreasonably with the conduct
of the business of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (including the Company
and its Subsidiaries) and (B) the provision of access pursuant to this
Section 7.07 shall be conditioned on the Person receiving access entering
into a confidentiality agreement in favor of Parent that is reasonably
acceptable to Parent. Unless otherwise consented to in writing by the
Stockholder Representative, neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation
shall, for a period of five years following the Closing Date or such longer
period as retention thereof is required by Applicable Law, destroy, alter or
otherwise dispose of (or allow the destruction, alteration or disposal of)
any of the Books and Records without first offering to surrender the same to
the Stockholder Representative.

The parties hereto agree that:

 

 

Section 8.01. Commercially Reasonable Efforts.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

77  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(a) Except to the extent expressly provided elsewhere in this Agreement
(including Section 8.09), the Company and Parent shall use their respective
commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions
and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable
under Applicable Law to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including (i) preparing and filing as promptly as practicable with
any Governmental Authority or other Third Party all documentation to effect
all necessary filings, notices, petitions, statements, registrations,
submissions of information, applications and other documents and (ii)
obtaining and maintaining all approvals, consents, registrations, permits,
authorizations and other confirmations required to be obtained from any
Governmental Authority or other Third Party that are necessary, proper or
advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;
provided that the parties hereto understand and agree that neither the
commercially reasonable efforts of any party hereto nor any other obligation
of a party under this Agreement shall be deemed to include (i) entering into
any settlement, undertaking, consent decree, stipulation or agreement with
any Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby or (ii) divesting or otherwise holding separate (including by
establishing a trust or otherwise), or taking any other action (or otherwise
agreeing to do any of the foregoing) with respect to any of its or the
Surviving Corporation's Subsidiaries or any of their respective Affiliates'
businesses, assets or properties. No party shall pay any fee or make any
payment to any Person (other than customary filing fees), make any commitment
or enter into any amendment, consent or other agreement, in each case, with
respect to obtaining any such approval, consent, registration, permit,
authorization or other confirmation, except with the written consent
of Parent.

 

 

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each of Parent and
the Company shall make an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report
Form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the transactions contemplated
hereby as promptly as practicable and in any event within 20 Business Days of

Section 8.02. Certain Filings. The Company and Parent shall cooperate with
one another (i) in determining whether any action by or in respect of, or
filing with, any Governmental Authority is required, or any actions,
consents, approvals or waivers are required to be obtained from parties to
any material contracts, in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) in taking such actions
or making any such filings, furnishing information required in connection
therewith and seeking timely to obtain any such actions, consents, approvals
or waivers. Notwithstanding the foregoing, matters related to the
Registration Statement (and approval thereof by the SEC) shall be governed by
Section 8.09 and not this Section 8.02, and matters 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

78  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

relating to filings under the HSR Act shall be governed by Section 8.01 and
not this Section 8.02.

 

 

Section 8.03. Public Announcements. Parent and the Company shall consult
with each other before issuing any press release, making any other public
statement or scheduling any press conference or conference call with
investors or analysts with respect to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby and, except as may be required by Applicable Law or any
listing agreement with or rule of any national securities exchange (in which
case reasonable efforts shall be used to consult, including the sharing of a
draft thereof prior to public release), shall not issue any such press
release, make any such other public statement or schedule any such press
conference or conference call before such consultation; provided (i) that
Parent shall not be required to consult with the Company prior to making any
employee communications and (ii) neither party shall be required to consult
with the other party prior to making any communications substantially similar
to communications previously issued after consultation with such other party.

 

 

Section 8.04. Further Assurances. At and after the Effective Time, the
officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be authorized to
execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Company or Merger
Subsidiary, any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances and to take
and do, in the name and on behalf of the Company or Merger Subsidiary, any
other actions and things to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise
in the Surviving Corporation any and all right, title and interest in, to and
under any of the rights, properties or assets of the Company acquired or to
be acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in connection
with, the Merger.

 

 

Section 8.05. Notices of Certain Events.

 

 

(a) Each of the Company and Parent shall promptly notify the other of:

 

 

(i) any notice or other communication from any Person alleging that the
consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

 

 

(ii) any notice or other communication from any Governmental Authority in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

 

 

(iii) any actions, suits, claims, investigations or proceedings commenced or,
to its knowledge, threatened against, relating to or involving or otherwise
affecting such party and any of its Subsidiaries, that relate to the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

79  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(iv) any inaccuracy of any representation or warranty of that party contained
in this Agreement at any time during the term hereof that could reasonably be
expected to cause the condition set forth in Section 9.02(a) or Section
9.03(a), as applicable, not to be satisfied; and

 

 

(v) any failure of that party to comply with or satisfy any covenant,
condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder;

 

 

provided, however, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this
Section 8.05 shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies
available hereunder to the party receiving that notice.

 

 

(b) If the condition set forth in Section 9.02(a)(iv) is not capable of being
satisfied prior to the End Date, then, at any time prior to the fifth
Business Day before the date on which the Closing would have been expected to
occur absent the failure of such condition to be satisfied, the Company may
deliver a notice to Parent stating that the condition will not be satisfied,
explaining in reasonable detail why such condition will not be satisfied and
stating that Parent has the right to terminate the Agreement pursuant to
Section 10.01(c)(ii). In such an event, Parent shall, prior to Closing,
elect to either (A) waive the condition set forth in Section 9.02(a)(iv) or
(B) terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.01(c)(ii). If
Parent elects to so waive the condition then Parent will be deemed to have
waived all claims for indemnification pursuant to Section 11.02(a) in respect
of all Damages that, based on the description in the notice provided to
Parent pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 8.05(b), would
reasonably be expected to arise from the matters described in such notice.

 

 

(c) If the condition set forth in Section 9.03(a)(iii) is not capable of
being satisfied prior to the End Date, then, at any time prior to the fifth
Business Day before the date on which the Closing would have been expected to
occur absent the failure of such condition to be satisfied, Parent may
deliver a notice to the Company stating that the condition will not be
satisfied, explaining in reasonable detail why such condition will not be
satisfied and stating that the Company has the right to terminate the
Agreement pursuant to Section 10.01(d)(iv). In such an event, the Company
shall, prior to Closing, elect to either (A) waive the condition set forth in
Section 9.03(a)(iii) or (B) terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section
10.01(d)(iv). If the Company elects to so waive the condition then the
Company and the Stockholders will be deemed to have waived all claims for
indemnification pursuant to Section 11.02(d) in respect of all Damages that,
based on the description in the notice provided to the Company pursuant to
the first sentence of this Section 8.05(c), would reasonably be expected to
arise from the matters described in such notice.

 

 

Section 8.06. Confidentiality. Prior to the Effective Time and after any
termination of this Agreement, each of Parent and the Company shall hold, and

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

80  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

shall cause its shareholders, officers, directors, employees, accountants,
counsel, consultants, advisors and agents to hold, in confidence, all
confidential documents and information concerning the other party furnished
to it or its Affiliates in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement in accordance with, and subject to the provisions of, the
Confidentiality Agreements, including the provisions thereof limiting the use
of such documents and information. Except as provided in the preceding
sentence and except with respect to the "standstill" obligations set forth in
the Confidentiality Agreements (which obligations shall continue as set forth
in such Confidentiality Agreements except to the extent relating to
the transactions contemplated hereby), the Confidentiality Agreements are
hereby terminated.

 

 

Section 8.07. Tax-free Reorganization. Prior to the Effective Time, each of
Parent and the Company shall (and shall cause its respective controlled
Affiliates to) use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Merger to
qualify as a 368 Reorganization, and shall not take any action reasonably
likely to cause the Merger not so to qualify. Parent shall not take, or cause
the Company to take, any action after the Effective Time reasonably likely to
cause the Merger not to qualify as a 368 Reorganization.

 

 

Section 8.08. Access to Information. From the date hereof until the
Effective Time and subject to Applicable Law and each Confidentiality
Agreement, each party hereto shall: (i) give the other party hereto and their
respective counsel, financial advisors, auditors and other authorized
representatives reasonable access to its and its Subsidiaries' offices,
properties, books and records, (ii) furnish to the other party hereto, its
counsel, financial advisors, auditors and other authorized representatives
such financial and operating data and other information as such Persons may
reasonably request, (iii) instruct its and its Subsidiaries' employees,
counsel, financial advisors, auditors and other authorized representatives to
cooperate with the other party hereto in connection therewith and (iv)
cooperate in good faith with the other party hereto, its counsel, financial
advisors, auditors and other authorized representatives (including in
connection with Parent's transition planning activities); provided that (A)
the provision of access pursuant to this Section 8.08 shall be during normal
business hours, following a reasonable advance request for such access and
shall not interfere unreasonably with the conduct of the business of
any Person; and (B) the provision of access pursuant to this Section 8.08
shall, in the case of any Person other than a party or its employees, be
conditioned on (x) any such Person entering into an agreement in favor of the
other party hereto on terms no less favorable to such party than the
applicable Confidentiality Agreement or (y) as an alternative in the case of
a representative of a party, such representative having agreed to comply with
the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement protecting the other
party's information. No information or knowledge obtained in
any investigation pursuant to this Section shall be deemed to modify or
affect any representation or warranty made by any party hereunder. It
is understood and agreed that because of the different circumstances involved
the scope of access

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

81  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and information to be provided to Parent pursuant to the first sentence of
this Section 8.08 will be different from the scope of access and information
to be provided to the Company and that the scope of access and information to
be provided to Parent is based upon what is reasonable for the buyer of an
entire business or company and the scope or access and information to be
provided to the Company is based upon what is reasonable for the acquiror of
a 31% interest in a public company.

 

 

Section 8.09. Registration Statement; Parent Stockholder Meeting.

 

 

(a) As promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement, Parent
shall prepare and file with the SEC the Registration Statement (which shall
include the Parent Proxy Statement and all other proxy materials for the
meeting of its stockholders (the "Parent Stockholder Meeting") to be called
for the purposes of seeking the Parent Stockholder Approval). The Company
shall cooperate in the preparation of the Registration Statement (which shall
include the Parent Proxy Statement). The information in the Registration
Statement (which shall include the Parent Proxy Statement), as it may be
amended or supplemented, shall not, on the date such Registration Statement
is declared effective by the SEC, at the time the Parent Proxy Statement is
first mailed to Parent's stockholders, at the time of the Parent Stockholder
Meeting and at the Closing, contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they are made, not false or misleading, or omit to state any material
fact necessary to correct any statement in any earlier communication with
respect to either the Parent Stock Issuance or the solicitation of proxies
for the Parent Stockholder Meeting which has become false or
misleading; provided that to the extent the Registration Statement or any
amendment or supplement thereto contains information of the same nature as
the matters referenced in the first sentence of Section 4.22(k) (as such
matters relate to Parent and its Subsidiaries), such information shall be
true (and not fail to omit necessary facts) based only upon the knowledge of
Parent. The Registration Statement (including the Parent Proxy Statement)
will comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable
provisions of the 1933 Act and the 1934 Act. If at any time prior to the
Closing, any event or information should be discovered by Parent which should
be set forth in a supplement to the Parent Proxy Statement or an amendment to
the Registration Statement, Parent shall promptly inform the Company.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent makes no representation or warranty
with respect to any information which is contained in the Registration
Statement and is supplied by the Company.

 

 

(b) Parent shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to have the
Registration Statement declared effective by the SEC (which shall include
clearance by the SEC of the Parent Proxy Statement), as promptly as
practicable after such filing and Parent shall cause the Parent Proxy
Statement to be mailed to Parent's stockholders as promptly as practicable
thereafter.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

82  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(c) Parent shall promptly notify the Company of the receipt of any comments
from the SEC or its staff and of any request by the SEC or its staff for
amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement (including the Parent
Proxy Statement included therein) or for additional information and shall
supply the Company with copies of all correspondence between Parent or any of
its representatives and the SEC. Parent and the Company shall cooperate with
each other and provide to each other all information necessary in order to
prepare all amendments to the Registration Statement (including the Parent
Proxy Statement) as expeditiously as practicable.

 

 

(d) If at any time prior to the Parent Stockholder Meeting there shall occur
any event with respect to Parent, or with respect to the information included
in the Registration Statement (including the Parent Proxy Statement), which
event is required to be described in an amendment or supplement to the Parent
Proxy Statement (or a post-effective amendment to the Registration
Statement), such event shall be so described, and such amendment or
supplement shall as promptly as practicable be filed with the SEC and, as
required by Applicable Law, disseminated to the Parent's stockholders.

 

 

(e) Parent shall, as soon as practicable following the date hereof, duly
call, give notice of, convene and hold the Parent Stockholder Meeting for the
purpose of seeking the Parent Stockholder Approval. Parent shall engage a
nationally recognized proxy solicitation firm for the purposes of seeking the
Parent Stockholder Approval and shall instruct such firm to solicit proxies
in a manner that is designed to obtain such approval within a timely
solicitation period, taking into account all relevant facts and
circumstances. Except as required by Applicable Law, Parent shall, through
its Board of Directors, recommend to its stockholders that they give the
Parent Stockholder Approval, including recommending the Parent Stock Issuance
(the "Parent Board Recommendation"), and neither Parent nor the Board of
Directors of Parent shall withhold, withdraw, qualify, modify or amend (or
publicly propose or resolve to withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify), the
Parent Board Recommendation (or approve or recommend, or publicly propose to
approve or recommend, any agreement or transaction, or cause or permit Parent
to enter into any agreement requiring Parent to abandon, terminate or fail to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or by the other Transaction
Documents or breach its obligations hereunder or thereunder, or resolve,
propose or agree to do any of the foregoing). Notwithstanding any
withholding, withdrawal, qualification, modification or amendment of the
Parent Board Recommendation by the Board of Directors of Parent (which, for
the avoidance of doubt, shall only be permitted in accordance with the third
sentence of this Section 8.09(e)), the Board of Directors shall submit, for
Parent Stockholder Approval, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
to Parent's stockholders at the Parent Stockholder Meeting.

 

 

(f) The information supplied by the Company and included in Registration
Statement shall not, on the date the Registration Statement is

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

83  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

declared effective by the SEC, the date the Parent Proxy Statement is first
mailed to the Parent's stockholders, at the time of the Parent Stockholder
Meeting and at the Closing, contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they are made, not false or misleading; provided that to the extent
the Registration Statement or any amendment or supplement thereto contains
information of the same nature as the matters referenced in the first
sentence of Section 4.22(k) (as such matters relate to the Company and
its Subsidiaries), such information shall be true (and not fail to omit
necessary facts) based only upon the knowledge of the Company. If at any
time prior to the Closing, any event or information should be discovered by
the Company which event is required to be described in an amendment or
supplement to the Parent Proxy Statement (or a post-effective amendment to
the Registration Statement), the Company shall promptly inform Parent of
the same. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company makes no representation
or warranty with respect to any information other than information supplied
by the Company.

 

 

(g) The Company agrees that neither it nor any of its Representatives or any
other people acting on its behalf will engage in solicitation or offering
activities in connection with the Parent Stockholder Meeting or the offering
of Parent Stock in connection with the Merger in violation of the 1933 Act or
the 1934 Act.

 

 

(h) Nothing in this Section 8.09 shall prohibit Parent from combining the
Parent Stockholder Meeting with Parent's 2008 annual meeting of stockholders
(including combining the Parent Proxy Statement with the proxy statement for
such annual meeting) so long as doing so would not reasonably be expected to
materially delay obtaining the Parent Stockholder Approval.

 

 

Section 8.10. Financing.

 

 

(a) Parent shall (i) subject to the terms and conditions of the Parent
Financing Commitment Letter and subject to the remainder of this Section
8.10(a), use its commercially reasonable efforts to complete the Parent
Financing effective as of the Effective Time on the terms and conditions
described in the Parent Financing Commitment Letter and such other terms and
conditions as are necessary to give effect to the terms and conditions
described in the Parent Financing Commitment Letter that are commercially
reasonable, customary for bridge loans of a similar size and type, and not
less favorable to Parent than those set forth in the Patriot Credit Agreement
(collectively, "Acceptable Parent Financing Terms"); provided that the
consummation of the Parent Financing on Acceptable Parent Financing Terms
would not reasonably be expected to result in any claim of default under the
Parent Credit Agreement relating to the terms of the Parent Financing
and (ii) commencing at such time as Parent deems appropriate but in any event
no later than 45 days after the date hereof, use its commercially
reasonable efforts to identify one or more alternate financings on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

84  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

terms satisfactory to Parent in its discretion and if so identified, to
negotiate the terms of and execute definitive documents with respect to such
alternate financing (such definitive documents, the "Alternate Financing
Documents"), and if so executed, to consummate the transactions contemplated
by the Alternate Financing Documents (it being agreed and understood that the
determination of Parent to cease negotiating any alternate financing and to
execute or not execute Alternate Financing Documents shall, in each case, be
in Parent's discretion). Parent's obligations pursuant to the preceding
sentence shall, subject to the remainder of this Section 8.10(a), include
using such commercially reasonable efforts to (i) commencing at such time as
Parent deems appropriate but in any event no later than 30 days after the
date hereof, negotiate definitive agreements with respect to the Parent
Financing on Acceptable Parent Financing Terms and (ii) satisfy
all conditions to such Parent Financing or such alternate financing, to the
extent the satisfaction of such conditions is within the reasonable control
of Parent. Parent shall in all material respects comply with its obligations
under the Parent Financing Commitment Letter (or as applicable, any Alternate
Financing Documents). Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent may (i) amend or
otherwise modify the Parent Financing Commitment Letter or Alternate
Financing Documents or (ii) terminate any Alternate Financing Documents or
terminate the Parent Financing Commitment Letter so long as (A) such action
would not reasonably be expected to delay or prevent the consummation of the
Merger (other than pursuant to the two Business Day delay provision pursuant
to Section 9.02(k)(ii)) or (B) in the case of a termination of the Parent
Financing Commitment Letter, Parent has previously entered into binding
Alternate Financing Documents (provided that any termination of the Parent
Financing Commitment Letter shall cause the condition set forth in Section
9.02(k) to be (upon such termination) deemed waived in all respects as set
for therein).

 

 

(b) The Company shall provide to Parent such cooperation and assistance as is
reasonably requested by Parent in connection with the Parent Financing or any
alternate financing, including (i) participation in meetings, (ii) furnishing
Parent and its financing sources with financial and other information
regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries as may be reasonably requested by
Parent (subject to such financing sources being bound by the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement with respect to documents and information of the
Company and its Subsidiaries), (iii) executing and delivering, as of the
Effective Time (and with effect from and after the Effective Time), any
pledge and security documents, other definitive financing documents, or other
certificates, legal opinions or documents, as may be reasonably requested by
Parent and (iv) taking all reasonably requested corporate actions, subject to
the occurrence of the Effective Time (and with effect from and after the
Effective Time), reasonably requested by Parent that are necessary or
customary to permit the consummation of the Parent Financing or any alternate
financing (provided that such corporate action shall not include any
determination with respect to the merits of the Parent Financing or any
alternate financing (or any other arrangement to be in effect after the
Effective Time)). Parent will keep the Company informed on a

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

85  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasonably current basis in reasonable detail of the status of the Parent
Financing or any alternate financing. If the Closing does not occur, Parent
shall reimburse the Company for any reasonable Third Party out of pocket
costs (including reasonable fees and expenses of legal, financial and other
advisors) incurred by the Company in connection with the foregoing matters in
this Section 8.10(b).

 

 

(c) Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to enforce its
rights against any other party to the Parent Credit Agreement with respect
to the Parent Financing or any Alternate Financing Documents and to cause the
Administrative Agent or any other authorized representative of the lenders
party to the Parent Credit Agreement to provide written confirmation to
Parent that the consummation of the Parent Financing as referred to in
Section 9.02(k)(i) or Section 9.02(k)(ii), as applicable, would not result
in any default under the Parent Credit Agreement, which shall include, but
shall not be limited to, upon the request of the Company, promptly commencing
a litigation proceeding against the Administrative Agent or any such other
party, in which Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to either
(A) compel the Administrative Agent or such other person to provide such
confirmation or (B) seek such other remedies that may be appropriate.

Material Adverse Effect) shall be true at and as of the Effective Time as if
made at and as of such time (except to the extent that any such

this Agreement pursuant to this Section 10.01(b)(i) shall not be available to
any party whose breach of any provision of this Agreement results in the
failure of the Merger to be consummated by such time;

 

 

(ii) there shall be any Applicable Law that (A) makes consummation of the

(iii) the Parent Stockholder Meeting shall have been convened and the Parent

(c) by Parent, if:

 

 

(i) a breach of any representation or warranty or failure to perform any
covenant or agreement on the part of the Company set forth in this Agreement
shall have occurred that would cause one or more of the conditions set forth
in Section 9.02(a) not to be satisfied, and either (A) the Company is not
using commercially reasonable efforts to cure such breach or failure or (B)
such condition would not reasonably be expected to be satisfied by the End

(ii) the Company shall have delivered a notice to Parent pursuant to Section

record date for the stockholder vote to approve such transaction shall occur
prior to the Closing Date;

 

 

(iv) Parent shall have delivered a notice to the Company pursuant to Section

The party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 10.01 (other than pursuant to Section 10.01(a)) shall give notice of
such termination to the other party.

 

 

Section 10.02. Effect of Termination.

 

 

(a) Except as set forth below, if this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
Section 10.01, this Agreement shall become void and of no effect without
liability of any party (or any stockholder, director, officer, employee,
agent, consultant or representative of such party) to the other party hereto;
provided that, if such termination shall result from the willful (i) failure
of either party to fulfill a condition to the performance of the obligations
of the other party or (ii) failure of either party to perform a covenant
hereof, such party shall be fully liable for any and all liabilities and
damages incurred or suffered by the other party as a result of such failure.
The parties further agree that if (and only if) the Company establishes
pursuant to a final, non-appealable judgment of the courts referred to in
Section 12.07 that the termination of this Agreement resulted from the
willful breach by Parent of its obligations hereunder, then (and only then)
the Stockholders will be deemed to be third party beneficiaries of this
Agreement in accordance with Section 12.05(a) and may pursue claims for
damages suffered by such stockholders in their capacities as such as a result
of such willful breach (but without duplication of any damages suffered by
the Company, it being agreed and understood that in any such action
contemplated by this sentence, the court may, among other things, consider
whether such damages suffered by such Stockholders should include the benefit
of the bargain of the Merger to the Stockholders (and in that regard, it is
expressly acknowledged and agreed that the Company shall be permitted to
bring such a claim on behalf of the Stockholders as set forth in the
following proviso)); provided that any claim brought by the Stockholders
pursuant to such third party beneficiary right may only be brought by the
Company on behalf of such Stockholders. The provisions of this Section 10.02
and Sections 8.06, 12.03, 12.06, 12.07, 12.08 and 12.13 shall survive any
termination hereof pursuant to Section 10.01.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

92  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event this Agreement is terminated
(i) in accordance with Section 10.01(d)(i) or Section 10.01(b)(iii) (unless,
in either case, at the time of termination one or more of the conditions set
forth in Sections 9.01(b), 9.01(c) or 9.02 had not been satisfied and was not
capable of being satisfied reasonably promptly) or (ii) in accordance with
Section 10.01(b)(i), and in the case of this clause (ii), at the time of
termination (A) the condition set forth in Section 9.02(k) shall not have
been satisfied solely as a result of a potential claim of default under the
Parent Credit Agreement relating to the terms of the Parent Financing and (B)
all other conditions to Closing have been satisfied (or are immediately
capable of being satisfied) or waived, then, in the case of clause (i) or
(ii), as applicable, Parent shall reimburse the Company (on demand) for all
costs and expenses of the Company incurred since January 1, 2008 in
connection with the preparation and negotiation of this Agreement, the other
Transaction Documents, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby, including, without limitation, all fees and expenses of
the Company's counsel (including specialist and local counsel), financial
advisors, auditors, other consultants (including but not limited to Weir
Mining Consultants Inc.) and agents and other lenders under the Company's and
the Subsidiaries' lending facilities; provided that, in no event shall the
amount Parent is required to reimburse pursuant to this sentence exceed
$5,000,000; provided, further that if this Agreement is terminated pursuant
to Section 10.01(d)(i), Section 10.01(b)(i) or Section 10.01(b)(iii), and the
expense reimbursement provided for in this sentence is payable, then such
expense reimbursement shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Company
and its Stockholders and Parent shall not be liable for any other Damages
incurred or suffered by the Company or its Stockholders and the second
sentence of this Section 10.02 shall be inapplicable. The parties acknowledge
and agree that the above expense reimbursement provisions are (i) an integral
part of the transactions contemplated hereby and constitute liquidated
damages and not a penalty in the event of the circumstances giving rise to
the applicability thereof and (ii) essential to the overall transaction
contemplated hereby and the Company has relied, and is relying, on Parent's
agreement to pay such expenses as and when due hereunder.

Notwithstanding the preceding sentences, any breach of representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement in respect of which indemnity may be sought

to Parent (if the indemnity is sought against Parent) or the Stockholder
Representative (if the indemnity is sought against the Stockholders), as
applicable, prior to such time.

 

 

Section 11.02. Indemnification.

 

 

(a) Subject to the last sentence of this Section 11.02(a) and to Sections
11.02(b) and 11.02(c), from and after the Effective Time, the Designated
Stockholders hereby severally (based on each Designated Stockholder's Pro
Rata Share of any applicable Damages) but not jointly indemnify Parent and
its Affiliates (including, from and after the Effective Time, the Company and
its Subsidiaries) and their respective successors and assigns (collectively,
the "Parent Indemnified Parties") against, and agree to hold each of them
harmless from, any and all Damages incurred or suffered by Parent, any
Affiliate of Parent, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries arising out of
any (i) misrepresentation or breach of warranty or alleged misrepresentation
or breach of warranty made by the Company pursuant to any Transaction

any holder of shares of capital stock of the Company (including any suit on
behalf of or in the name of the Company) in their capacity as such, in
connection with the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or relating to its ownership of shares of capital stock or the
issuance of the Company Convertible Debt or (B) any holder of Company
Convertible Debt under or relating to such Company Convertible Debt except
any claim by any such holder of Company Convertible Debt Notes to enforce the
rights described in Section 7 of the Company Convertible Debt NPA or (v)
any Transaction Expenses that are in excess of the Transaction Expenses Cap
(without duplication for Transaction Expenses that are included in the Excess
Transaction Expenses Deduction Amount and are therefore taken into account in
the calculation of the Net Per Share Number), in each case regardless of
whether such Damages arise as a result of the negligence, strict liability or
any other liability under any theory of law or equity of, or violation of any
law by, any party

hereto or any of its Affiliates (including the Company and its Subsidiaries);
provided that with respect to indemnification by the Designated Stockholders
for any Company Warranty Breach (other than a misrepresentation or breach of
warranty of any of the Company Core Representations and other than in cases
of fraud or willful misrepresentation) pursuant to this Section, (x) the
Designated Stockholders shall not be liable for any claim for indemnification
where the amount of Damages with respect to such claim (provided that all
claims based on substantially the same or similar acts, omissions or
circumstances shall be considered part of a single claim for purposes of
calculating the amount of Damages for purposes of this clause (x)) does not
exceed $100,000 (the "Deminimis Amount") (and the amount of such Damages
shall not be aggregated for purposes of clause (y)), (y) the Designated
Stockholders shall not be liable unless the aggregate amount of Damages with
respect to all such Company Warranty Breaches exceeds $6,000,000 (the
"Deductible Amount") (in which case the Designated Stockholders shall be
liable only for an amount equal to the excess of such Damages above such
amount) and (z) the Designated Stockholders' maximum liability shall not
exceed the Escrow Property held in the Escrow Account. The Designated
Stockholders hereby agree that they will not be entitled to seek contribution
from the Company, its Subsidiaries or any of their respective officers,
directors or employees in respect of any liability of the Designated
Stockholders under this Section 11.02(a).

 

 

(b) Parent hereby agrees that after Closing its sole and exclusive remedy
with respect to any and all claims arising out of (i) any Company Warranty
Breach (other than any misrepresentation or breach of warranty of any of the
Company Core Representations and other than in cases of fraud or willful
misrepresentation) or (ii) a Company Covenant Breach (other than a willful
breach) (the claims referred to in clauses (i) and (ii) are hereinafter
referred to as the "Escrow Only Claims") shall be pursuant to a claim for
indemnification against the then-available Escrow Property in accordance with
this Section 11.02 and the Escrow Agreement.

 

 

(c) With respect to all claims for indemnification other than the Escrow Only
Claims ("Direct Indemnification Claims"), the Parent Indemnified Parties may
make a claim (i) against the then available Escrow Property in accordance
with this Section 11.02 and the Escrow Agreement, (ii) against the Designated
Stockholders directly (severally, based on each Designated Stockholder's Pro
Rata Share of any applicable Damages, and not jointly) or (iii) a combination
of the foregoing; provided that (A) the aggregate maximum liability of the
Designated Stockholders in respect of all Direct Indemnification Claims shall
not exceed the proceeds (net of any reasonable brokerage commissions and any
underwriting fees) received by the Designated Stockholders in the Merger (for
the avoidance of doubt, the maximum aggregate liability of each Designated
Stockholder in respect of all Direct Indemnification Claims shall not exceed
the proceeds (net of any reasonable brokerage commissions and any
underwriting fees) received by such Designated Stockholder in the Merger) and
(B) except with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

95  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

respect to claims for misrepresentation or breach of warranty under Sections
4.02, 4.05, 4.20 or 4.26 and claims for indemnification under Section
11.02(a)(iv), the Parent Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to make a
Direct Indemnification Claim after the third anniversary of the Closing (it
being understood and agreed that following the expiration of such time limit
the Parent Indemnified Parties may continue to pursue any claim that was
subject to such time limit so long as such claim was made prior to the
expiration of such time limit). Any amounts finally determined to be due and
payable by a Designated Stockholder hereunder in respect of any Direct
Indemnification Claim (or other claim made directly against a Designated
Stockholder), in each case, to the extent permitted hereunder, may be
satisfied by such Designated Stockholder by payment in cash, delivery of
shares of Parent Stock (valued in accordance with the definition of "Market
Value" hereunder) or in any combination thereof, at the election of the
Designated Stockholder so satisfying such Direct Indemnification Claim or
other claim; provided that any election to pay in whole or in part in shares
of Parent Stock must be made prior to the commencement of the 10 consecutive
trading day period referred to in the definition of "Market Value".

 

 

(d) Subject to Sections 11.02(e) and Section 11.02(f), from and after the
Effective Time, Parent hereby indemnifies each Stockholder (in its capacity
as such) and its Affiliates ("Stockholder Indemnified Parties") against, and
agrees to hold each of them harmless from, any and all Damages incurred or
suffered by the Company or such Stockholder or any of its Affiliates arising
out of any (A) misrepresentation or breach of warranty or alleged
misrepresentation or breach of warranty made by Parent or Merger Subsidiary
pursuant to any Transaction Document (a "Parent Warranty Breach") or (B)
breach of covenant or agreement made or to be performed by Parent or Merger
Subsidiary pursuant to any Transaction Document (a "Parent Covenant Breach"),
in each case regardless of whether such Damages arise as a result of the
negligence, strict liability or any other liability under any theory of law
or equity of, or violation of any law by, any party hereto or any Stockholder
or any of its Affiliates; provided that with respect to indemnification by
Parent for any Parent Warranty Breach (other than a misrepresentation or
breach of warranty of any of the Parent Core Representations and other than
in cases of fraud or willful misrepresentation) pursuant to this Section, (x)
Parent shall not be liable for any claim for indemnification where the amount
of Damages with respect to such claim (provided that all claims based on
substantially the same or similar acts, omissions or circumstances shall be
considered part of a single claim for purposes of calculating the amount of
Damages for purposes of this clause (x)) does not exceed the Deminimis Amount
(and the amount of such Damages shall not be aggregated for purposes of
clause (y)), (y) Parent shall not be liable unless the aggregate amount of
Damages with respect to such Parent Warranty Breaches exceeds the Deductible
Amount (in which case Parent shall be liable only for an amount equal to the
excess of such Damages above such amount), and (z) Parent's maximum liability
shall not exceed $54,000,000 (the "Parent Cap"). In consideration for the
indemnification rights provided in this Section 11.02(d),

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

96  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

each Stockholder hereby waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any
claim under any Applicable Law relating to the sale or distribution of
securities that it might otherwise have by virtue of the transactions
contemplated hereby (and in the event any such claim under Applicable Law is
brought by a Stockholder, such Stockholder hereby waives the indemnification
rights provided in this Section 11.02(d) and shall promptly refund to Parent
the amount of any Damages previously paid by Parent to such Stockholder in
respect of any indemnification claim hereunder). The parties further agree
that if (and only if) the Stockholder Representative establishes pursuant to
a final, non-appealable judgment of the courts referred to in Section 12.07
that Parent has breached this Agreement in a manner giving rise to a right of
indemnification hereunder, then (and only then) the Stockholder Indemnified
Parties will be deemed to be third party beneficiaries of this Agreement for
purposes of this Section 11.02(d); provided that any claim brought by a
Stockholder Indemnified Party pursuant to such third party beneficiary right
may only be brought by the Stockholder Representative on behalf of such
Stockholder Indemnified Party.

 

 

(e) After Closing, the sole and exclusive remedy of the Stockholder
Indemnified Parties with respect to any and all claims arising out of (i) any
Parent Warranty Breach (other than any misrepresentation or breach of
warranty of any of the Parent Core Representations and other than in cases of
fraud or willful misrepresentation) or (ii) a Parent Covenant Breach (other
than a willful breach) (the claims referred to in clauses (i) and (ii) are
hereinafter referred to as the "Parent Non-Core Claims"; and all other
claims for indemnification under Section 11.02(d) are hereinafter referred to
"Parent Core Claims") shall be pursuant to a claim for indemnification
against Parent in accordance with and subject to this Section 11.02.

 

 

(f) Except with respect to indemnification claims for misrepresentation or
breach of warranty under Section 5.02, 5.05 or 5.20, the Stockholder
Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to make a Parent Core Claim after
the third anniversary of the Closing (it being understood and agreed that
following the expiration of such time limit the Stockholder Indemnified
Parties may continue to pursue any claim that was subject to such time limit
so long as such claim was made prior to the expiration of such time limit).
The aggregate maximum liability of Parent in respect of all Parent Core
Claims shall not exceed $534,000,000.

 

 

(g) Amounts finally determined to be due and payable under this Section 11.02
in respect of any Damages that are subject to the indemnification obligations
will be payable within five days of receipt of written notice to the
Indemnifying Party (or the Stockholder Representative, in the case of an
indemnification claim pursuant to Section 11.02(a)) of such Damages, and will
bear interest beginning on the sixth day after receipt of such notice through

during such period plus 2%.

(h) After Closing, each Indemnified Party will take all reasonable efforts to
mitigate any Damages upon becoming aware of any event that would reasonably
be expected to give rise thereto (provided that the costs and expenses of
such mitigation shall be included as Damages arising from such event) and
Damages incurred in violation thereof shall not be recoverable hereunder by
the relevant Indemnified Party.

 

 

(i) The amount of Damages incurred by an Indemnified Party will be reduced by
the amount recovered from any third party (after deducting attorneys' fees,
expenses and other costs of recoveries and any increase in insurance
premiums), including from insurance policies and pursuant to other
indemnification agreements.

 

 

(j) The amount of any Damages for which indemnification is provided under
this Article 11 shall be decreased to take into account any net Tax benefit
received by the applicable Indemnified Party.

 

 

(k) No Indemnified Party shall be entitled to recover Damages or otherwise
be indemnified hereunder (or receive other payment, reimbursement or
restitution) more than once in respect of any one given liability, loss, cost
or shortfall, regardless of whether more than one claim for Damages arises in
respect of it.

 

 

(l) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if Parent waives the
condition set forth in Section 9.02(a)(iv) as set forth in Section 8.05(b),
then Parent will be deemed to have waived its rights to indemnification to
the extent set forth in Section 8.05(b).

 

 

(m) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if the Company waives
the condition set forth in Section 9.03(a)(iii) as set forth in Section
8.05(c), then the Company and the Stockholders will be deemed to have waived
their rights to indemnification to the extent set forth in Section 8.05(c).

 

 

Section 11.03 . Procedures.

 

 

(a) The party seeking indemnification under this Article 11 (the
"Indemnified Party") agrees to give prompt notice (but no later than ten
Business Days after receipt by an Indemnified Party of a notification of such
Third Party claim) to the party against whom indemnity is sought (or the
Stockholder Representative, in the case of an indemnification claim pursuant
to Section 11.02(a)) (the "Indemnifying Party") of the assertion of any
Third Party claim against the Indemnified Party, or the commencement of any
Third Party suit, action or proceeding against the Indemnified Party in
respect of which indemnity may be sought under such Article. The failure to
so notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of
its obligations hereunder, except to the extent such failure shall have
materially and adversely prejudiced the Indemnifying Party. Thereafter, the
Indemnified Party shall 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

98  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deliver to the Indemnifying Party, as promptly as reasonably practicable
following the Indemnified Party's receipt thereof, copies of all written
notices and documents (including any court papers) received by the
Indemnified Party relating to the Third Party claim. The Indemnifying Party
shall be entitled to participate in the defense thereof and, if it so chooses
within 10 Business Days of receipt of notice from the Indemnified Party (or
such lesser number of days set forth in the notice as may be required by
court proceeding in the event of a litigated matter), to, subject to Section
11.03(b), assume the defense thereof with counsel selected by the
Indemnifying Party and reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party;
provided, however, that the Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to
assume or maintain control of the defense of any Third Party claim and shall
pay the fees and expenses of counsel retained by the Indemnified Party if (i)
the Third Party claim relates to or arises in connection with any criminal
proceeding, action, indictment, allegation or investigation, (ii) the Third
Party claim seeks injunctive or equitable relief against the Indemnified
Party, (iii) the Indemnifying Party has failed to defend or is failing to
defend in good faith the Third Party claim, (iv) the Indemnifying Party and
the Indemnified Party are both named parties to the proceedings and the
Indemnified Party shall have reasonably concluded that representation of both
parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential
differing interests between them, (v) in the case of a Parent Indemnified
Party as the Indemnified Party, it would reasonably be expected that the
Damages arising from such Third Party claim will exceed 110% of the Escrow
Availability Amount at such time or (vi) in the case of a Stockholder
Indemnified Party as the Indemnified Party, it would reasonably be expected
that the Damages arising from such Third Party claim will exceed 110% of the
Non-Core Cap Availability Amount at such time and Parent does not waive the
limitations in Section 11.03(b) with respect to such claim;
provided, further, that prior to assuming control of any such defense,
the Indemnifying Party must acknowledge that, subject to Section 11.03(b), it
has an indemnity obligation for all Damages resulting from such Third Party
claim notwithstanding anything in Section 11.02 to the contrary. As
used herein, the term "Escrow Availability Amount" means, with respect to
any given claim at any given time, the amount then remaining in the Escrow
Account at such time after deducting the aggregate amount of all Damages that
would reasonably be expected to arise from other then pending claims against
the Escrow Account. As used herein, the term "Non-Core Cap Availability
Amount" means, with respect to any given claim at any given time, the excess
of the Parent Cap over the sum of (A) the aggregate amount of Damages
previously paid by Parent at such time in respect of claims subject to the
Parent Cap and (B) the aggregate amount of all Damages that would reasonably
be expected to arise from other then pending claims against Parent that are
subject to the Parent Cap. If the Indemnifying Party assumes such defense,
the Indemnified Party shall nonetheless have the right to participate at its
own expense in the defense thereof and to employ counsel separate from the
counsel employed by the Indemnifying Party, it being understood that the
Indemnifying Party shall control such defense. If the Indemnifying Party
chooses to defend a Third Party claim, all Indemnified Parties shall provide
reasonable cooperation in

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

99  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the defense thereof. The Indemnifying Party shall not be liable under this
Article 11 for any settlement, admission of liability, compromise or
other discharge of liability, effected without its consent of any claim,
litigation or proceeding in respect of which indemnity may be sought
hereunder, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. The Indemnifying
Party shall not, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party,
settle, compromise or offer to settle or compromise any Third Party claim
unless (i) such settlement or compromise shall include as an unconditional
term thereof the giving by the claimant of a release of the Indemnified
Party, reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, from all liability
with respect to such Third Party claim and (ii) such settlement or compromise
would not result in (A) the imposition of a consent order, injunction, decree
or obligation that would restrict the future activity or conduct of the
Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates, (B) a finding or admission of a
violation of law or violation of the rights of any Person by the Indemnified
Party or any of its Affiliates, (C) a finding or admission that would have an
adverse effect on other claims made or threatened against the Indemnified
Party or any of its Affiliates, or (D) any monetary liability of the
Indemnified Party that will not be paid or reimbursed by the Indemnifying
Party concurrently with such settlement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no
consent of the Stockholders or the Stockholder Representative shall be
required for the filing of any Tax Return required to be filed by Parent or
the Company after the Effective Time, and no such consent shall be required
in connection with the conclusion of any tax audit or similar proceeding
after the Effective Time.

 

 

(b) If the Indemnifying Party assumes control of the defense of a Third Party
claim in respect of which (i) an Escrow Only Claim has been made, the
Indemnifying Party shall be responsible for (A) 100% of the Damages arising
therefrom up to the Escrow Availability Amount at the time the Indemnifying
Party assumed the defense, (B) 50% of the Damages arising therefrom to the
extent such Damages exceed such Escrow Availability Amount but do not exceed
200% of such Escrow Availability Amount and (C) 100% of the Damages arising
therefrom to the extent such Damages exceed 200% of such Escrow Availability
Amount or (ii) a Parent Non-Core Claim has been made, the Indemnifying Party
shall be responsible for (x) 100% of the Damages arising therefrom up to the
Non-Core Cap Availability Amount at the time the Indemnifying Party assumed
the defense, (B) 50% of the Damages arising therefrom to the extent such
Damages exceed such Non-Core Cap Availability Amount but do not exceed 200%
of such Non-Core Cap Availability Amount and (C) 100% of the Damages arising
therefrom to the extent such Damages exceed 200% of such Non-Core Cap
Availability Amount.

 

 

Section 11.04. Adjustment to Consideration for Tax Purposes. Any amount paid
under Article 11 will be treated as an adjustment to the Merger Consideration
except to the extent a final determination that is not subject to further
appeal, review or modification through proceedings or otherwise or Applicable
Law (including a revenue ruling or other similar pronouncement) 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

100  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

causes or requires any such amount not to constitute an adjustment to the
Merger Consideration for United States federal income Tax purposes.

 

 

Section 11.05. Stockholder Representative.

 

 

(a) Effective upon and by virtue of the consent of the holders of the Company
Stock approving and adopting this Agreement and the Merger, and without any
further act of any of the holders of the Company Stock, the Stockholder
Representative shall be hereby appointed as the representative of the
Designated Stockholders and as the attorney-in-fact and agent for and on
behalf of each Designated Stockholder with respect to any claims by any
Indemnified Party pursuant to Section 11.02(a) and any amendments to or
waivers of the Escrow Agreement or this Article 11; provided, however, that
any amendment or waiver of the Escrow Agreement or this Article 11 that shall
adversely affect the rights or obligations of any Designated
Stockholder under the Escrow Agreement or this Article 11 shall require the
prior written consent of such adversely affected Designated Stockholder
(other than any change affecting all Designated Stockholders similarly). The
Stockholder Representative hereby accepts such appointment. The
Stockholder Representative will take any and all actions and make any
decisions required or permitted to be taken by the Stockholder Representative
under the Escrow Agreement and this Agreement, including the exercise of the
power to (i) agree to, negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises of,
commence any suit, action or proceeding, and comply with orders of courts
with respect to, claims for Damages, (ii) litigate, resolve, settle or
compromise any Contested Claim (as defined in the Escrow Agreement) made
pursuant to this Agreement, and (iii) take all actions necessary in the
judgment of the Stockholder Representative for the accomplishment of the
foregoing or as contemplated by this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement. The
Stockholder Representative will have authority and power to act on behalf of
each Stockholder with respect to the disposition, settlement or other
handling of all claims against the Escrow Property under this Article 11 and
all related rights or obligations of the Designated Stockholders arising
under this Article 11. The Stockholder Representative shall use commercially
reasonable efforts based on contact information available to the Stockholder
Representative to keep the Designated Stockholders reasonably informed with
respect to actions of the Stockholder Representative pursuant to the
authority granted the Stockholder Representative under this Agreement which
actions have a material impact on the amounts payable to the Designated
Stockholders. Each Designated Stockholder shall promptly provide written
notice to the Stockholder Representative of any change of address of such
Designated Stockholder.

 

 

(b) A decision, act, consent or instruction of the Stockholder Representative
(which decision, act, consent or instruction shall be jointly made by each
entity constituting the Stockholder Representative) hereunder shall
constitute a decision, act, consent or instruction of all Designated
Stockholders and, as between Parent and its Affiliates (on the one hand) and
the Designated 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

101  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Stockholders (on the other hand), shall be final, binding and conclusive upon
each of such Designated Stockholders, and the Escrow Agent and Parent may
rely upon any such decision, act, consent or instruction of the Stockholder
Representative as being the decision, act, consent or instruction of each and
every such Designated Stockholder. The Escrow Agent and Parent shall be
relieved from any liability to any Person for any acts done by them in
accordance with such decision, act, consent or instruction of the
Stockholder Representative.

 

 

(c) The Stockholder Representative will incur no liability with respect to
any action taken or suffered by any party in reliance upon any notice,
direction, instruction, consent, statement or other document believed by such
Stockholder Representative to be genuine and to have been signed by the
proper person (and shall have no responsibility to determine the authenticity
thereof), nor for any other action or inaction, except for gross negligence,
bad faith or willful misconduct on the part of the Stockholder
Representative. In all questions arising under this Agreement or the Escrow
Agreement, the Stockholder Representative may rely on the advice of outside
counsel, and the Stockholder Representative will not be liable to anyone for
anything done, omitted or suffered in good faith by the Stockholder
Representative based on such advice.

 

 

(d) The Designated Stockholders shall severally (each based on its Pro Rata
Share) but not jointly indemnify the Stockholder Representative and hold the
Stockholder Representative harmless against any loss, liability or expense
incurred without gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct, on the
part of the Stockholder Representative and arising out of or in connection
with the acceptance or administration of the Stockholder Representative's
duties hereunder, including the reasonable fees and expenses of any legal
counsel retained by the Stockholder Representative.

 

 

(e) At any time during the term of the Escrow Agreement, a majority-in-
interest of Designated Stockholders may, by written consent, appoint a new
representative as the Stockholder Representative. Notice together with a copy
of the written consent appointing such new representative and bearing the
signatures of Designated Stockholders of a majority-in-interest of those
Designated Stockholders must be delivered to Parent and the Escrow Agent not
less than ten days prior to such appointment. Such appointment will be
effective upon the later of the date indicated in the consent or ten days
after such notice is received by Parent and the Escrow Agent. For the
purposes of this Section 11.05, a "majority-in-interest of the Designated
Stockholders" shall mean Designated Stockholders representing in the
aggregate over 50% of the percentage interests in the Escrow Shares.

 

 

(f) In the event that the Stockholder Representative becomes unable or
unwilling to continue in his or its capacity as Stockholder Representative,
or if the Stockholder Representative resigns as a Stockholder Representative,
a majority-in-interest of the Designated Stockholders shall, by written
consent, appoint a new

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

102  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

representative as the Stockholder Representative. Notice and a copy of the
written consent appointing such new representative and bearing the signatures
of the holders of a majority-in-interest of the Designated Stockholders must
be delivered to Parent and the Escrow Agent. Such appointment will
be effective upon the later of the date indicated in the consent or the date
such consent is received by Parent and the Escrow Agent.

 

 

(g) As amongst the Stockholders, and subject to Section 11.05(b), any
instruction given to the Stockholder Representative by a majority-in-interest
of Designated Stockholders, in connection with the matters set forth in
Article 11 or any other matter, shall be final and binding on all
Stockholders.

specify for the purpose by notice to the other parties hereto. All such

Business Day in the place of

receipt. Otherwise, any such notice, request or communication shall be deemed
to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day in the place of
receipt.

 

 

Section 12.02. Amendments and Waivers. (a) Any provision of this Agreement
may be amended or waived prior to the Effective Time if, but only if, such
amendment or waiver is in writing and is signed, in the case of an amendment,
by each party to this Agreement or, in the case of a waiver, by each party
against whom the waiver is to be effective.

 

 

(b) No failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, power or
privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or
partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or
the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. Except as expressly set
forth herein, the rights and remedies herein provided shall be cumulative and
not exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by Applicable Law.

 

 

Section 12.03. Expenses. Except as otherwise provided herein, all costs and
expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement shall be paid by the
party incurring such cost or expense.

 

 

Section 12.04 . Disclosure Schedule References. The parties hereto agree
that any reference in a particular Section of either the Company Disclosure
Schedule or the Parent Disclosure Schedule shall only be deemed to be an
exception to (or, as applicable, a disclosure for purposes of) (a) the
representations and warranties (or covenants, as applicable) of the relevant
party that are contained in the corresponding Section or subsection of this
Agreement; (b) any other representation and warranty (or covenant, as
applicable) of such party that is contained in this Agreement, but only if
the relevance of that reference as an exception to (or a disclosure for
purposes of) such representation and warranty (or covenant, as applicable)
would be readily apparent to a reasonable person who has read only this
Agreement and the Company Disclosure Schedule and the Parent Disclosure
Schedule; and (c) any other representation and warranty (or covenant, as
applicable) of a relevant party that is cross-referenced in such Section.
Except as the context requires, any items or matters reflected in either the
Company Disclosure Schedule or the Parent Disclosure Schedule, as the case
may be, are not necessarily limited to matters required by this Agreement to
be therein reflected, and such items or matters are set forth for
informational purposes only and do not necessarily include items of a similar
nature. In no event shall the inclusion or reference of any such item or
matter be deemed or interpreted to broaden or otherwise modify any of the
provisions of this Agreement. The fact that any item or matter is reflected
in either the Company Disclosure Schedule or the Parent Disclosure Schedule,
as the case may be, shall not be construed as an admission of liability under
Applicable Law, nor shall either the Company Disclosure Schedule or the
Parent Disclosure Schedule, as the case may be, be used as a basis
for interpreting the terms "material,"

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

105  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"materially," "materiality" or "Company Material Adverse Effect" or "Parent
Material Adverse Effect" (as the case may be), or similar
qualifications herein.

 

 

Section 12.05. Binding Effect; Benefit; Assignment. (a) The provisions of
this Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the
parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns. Except
as provided in, and subject to, Section 7.06, Section 10.02 and Article
11 (including the provisions that limit the circumstances in which a non-
party may make a claim), no provision of this Agreement is intended to confer
any rights, benefits, remedies, obligations or liabilities hereunder upon any
Person other than the parties hereto and their respective successors
and assigns. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in Section 7.04 is intended
to create any third party rights, benefits, remedies, obligations
or liabilities under any of the provisions referred to in the
preceding sentence.

 

 

(b) No party may assign, delegate or otherwise transfer any of its rights or
obligations under this Agreement without the consent of each other party
hereto, except that Parent or Merger Subsidiary may transfer or assign its
rights and obligations under this Agreement, in whole or from time to time in
part, to (i) one or more of their Affiliates at any time and (ii) after the
Effective Time, to any Person; provided that such transfer or assignment
shall not relieve Parent or Merger Subsidiary of its obligations hereunder or
enlarge, alter or change any obligation of any other party hereto or due to
Parent or Merger Subsidiary; provided further, that no such assignment shall
adversely affect the Company (prior to the Effective Time) or the
Stockholders.

 

 

Section 12.06. Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without
regard to the conflicts of law rules of such state.

 

 

Section 12.07. Jurisdiction. The parties hereto agree that any suit, action
or proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any matter
arising out of or in connection with, this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be brought in any Delaware state court, and each of
the parties hereby irrevocably consents to the jurisdiction of such courts
(and of the appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in any such suit, action
or proceeding and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by
Applicable Law, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying
of the venue of any such suit, action or proceeding in any such court or that
any such suit, action or proceeding brought in any such court has been
brought in an inconvenient forum. Process in any such suit, action or
proceeding may be served on any party anywhere in the world, whether within
or without the jurisdiction of any such court. Without limiting the
foregoing, each party agrees that service of process on such party as
provided in Section 12.01 shall be deemed effective service of process
on such party.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

106  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section 12.08. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

 

 

Section 12.09. Counterparts; Effectiveness. This Agreement may be signed in
any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same
effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument.
This Agreement shall become effective when each party hereto shall have
received a counterpart hereof signed by all of the other parties hereto.
Until and unless each party has received a counterpart hereof signed by the
other party hereto, this Agreement shall have no effect and no party shall
have any right or obligation hereunder (whether by virtue of any other oral
or written agreement or other communication). Any such counterpart may be
delivered by facsimile or other electronic format (including ".pdf").

 

 

Section 12.10. Entire Agreement. This Agreement, the other Transaction
Documents and, to the extent set forth in Section 8.06, the Confidentiality
Agreements constitute the entire agreement between the parties with respect
to the subject matter of this Agreement and supersede all prior agreements
and understandings, both oral and written, between the parties with respect
to the subject matter of this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents.

 

 

Section 12.11. Severability. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction
of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other
Governmental Authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of
the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall
remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or
invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions
contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any
party. Upon such a determination, the parties shall negotiate in good faith
to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties
as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions
contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest
extent possible.

 

 

Section 12.12. Specific Performance. The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur if any provision of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with the terms hereof and that the parties shall be
entitled (without the requirement to post bond) to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement or to enforce specifically
the performance of the terms and provisions hereof in the courts provided for
in Section 12.07, in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled
at law or in equity.

 

 

Section 12.13. Representation of the Company and its Stockholders. Each of
the parties to this Agreement hereby agrees, on its own behalf and on behalf
of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

107  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

its directors, officers, employees and Affiliates, that Freshfields
Bruckhaus Deringer LLP may serve as counsel to each and any of the Company's
stockholders, the Stockholder Representative and their respective Affiliates
(individually and collectively, "Seller Group"), on the one hand, and the
Company, on the other hand, in connection with the negotiation, preparation,
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents
and the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby and by the other Transaction Documents, and that, both prior to and
following consummation of the Merger (or in the event of the termination of
this Agreement), Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP may serve as counsel to
any member of the Seller Group or any director, member, partner, officer,
employee or Affiliate of Seller Group, in connection with any litigation,
claim or obligation arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the other
Transaction Documents, or the Merger or the other transactions contemplated
hereby and by the other Transaction Documents notwithstanding such
representation, and each of the parties hereto hereby consents thereto and
waives any conflict of interest arising therefrom, and each of such parties
shall cause any Affiliate thereof to consent to waive any conflict of
interest arising from such representation.

 

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

108  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Agreement to be duly
executed by their respective authorized officers as of the day and year first
above written.
