or request for information would reasonably be expected, except for those
listed on _Schedule 3.18_ and none of which are material; and (iv) none of

insurer under any Insurance Policy disclaiming coverage, reserving rights with
respect to a particular claim or such Insurance Policy in general or
canceling or materially amending any such Insurance Policy. Each Acquired
Entity and its assets and properties are insured in amounts no less than as

Contract to which such Acquired Entity is a party or by which its assets or
properties are bound.

Date_ ") and the portion through the end of the Calculation Date for any
taxable period that includes (but does not end on) the Calculation Date (each,
a " _Pre-Calculation Date Tax Period_ "), (iii) all Taxes of any member of an
affiliated, consolidated, combined or unitary group of an Acquired Company is
or was a member on or prior to the Closing Date, including pursuant
to Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 or any analogous or similar state,
local, or non-U.S. law or regulation, (iv) any and all Taxes of any person
imposed on Purchaser, or an Acquired Entity as a transferee or successor, by
contract or pursuant to any law, rule, or regulation, which Taxes relate to
an event or transaction

 



_Purchase and Sale Agreement  WCG _

  



48  occurring on or before the Closing Date, and (v) any termination under
Section 708(b)(1)(B) of the Code of any Acquired Entity attributable to,
resulting from or arising in connection with any transaction preceding those
contemplated by this Agreement to the extent any Seller Party, Acquired Entity
or their Affiliates approved such transaction prior to the Closing Date.

 

(b) In the case of any taxable period that includes (but does not end on)
Calculation Date (a " _Straddle Period_ "), the amount of any state or local
Taxes based on or measured by income, receipts, or payroll of an Acquired
Entity for the Pre-Calculation Date Tax Period shall be determined based on an
interim closing of the books as of the close of business on the Calculation
Date, while in the case of all real property Taxes, personal property Taxes
and other Taxes and similar obligations of an Acquired Entity imposed by the
State of Kansas and Missouri, the United States or any other Governmental
Authority that are due or become due for Straddle Periods, such Taxes and
obligations shall be apportioned to Seller Parties for the Pre-Calculation
Date Tax Period of such Straddle Period, and the amount of such Taxes and
obligations of an Acquired Entity that relate to the Pre-Calculation Date Tax
Period shall be deemed to be the amount of such Taxes and obligations for the
entire taxable period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the
number of days in the taxable period ending on the Closing Date and the
denominator of which is the number of days in such Straddle Period. Seller
Parties shall be jointly and severally responsible for the portion of such
Taxes and obligations attributable to any Pre-Calculation Date Tax
Periods. Each Party shall reasonably cooperate in assuring that such Taxes
and obligations that are the responsibility of Seller Parties pursuant to the
preceding sentences are paid by Seller Parties. If any refund, rebate or
similar payment is received by an Acquired Entity and/or Purchaser for any
Taxes or similar obligations referred to above, then to the extent such
refund, rebate or payment relates to a Pre-Calculation Date Tax Period of an
Acquired Entity it shall be for the benefit of Seller Parties, and the
Acquired Entity or Purchaser shall pay over the amount of such refund, rebate
or payment to Seller Parties with reasonable promptness following receipt
thereof.

 

(c) For any Taxes that relate solely to a taxable period ending on or before
the Closing Date (each, a " _Pre-Closing Date Tax Period_ "), Seller Parties
shall timely prepare and, with respect to Tax Returns due prior to the Closing
Date, file (or cause to be filed) with the appropriate authorities, all Tax
Returns required to be filed by an Acquired Entity;  _provided_ , that no Tax
Return required to be filed after the Calculation Date but prior to the
Closing Date shall be filed without Purchasers prior written approval (not to
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). All Tax Returns required
to be filed by an Acquired Entity after the Closing Date shall be filed (or
cause to be filed) by Purchaser; _provided_ , that if Purchaser objects to any
Tax Return prepared by any Seller Party pursuant to the immediately preceding
sentence, Purchaser shall grant or cause to be granted to a representative of
such Seller Party a limited power of attorney and take any other action
necessary to enable such Seller Party to execute and file, and pursuant
thereto such Seller Party shall execute and file, such Tax Return.

(d) All sales, use, transfer, real property transfer, recording, stock
transfer, value-added and other similar Taxes and fees (" _Transfer Taxes_
"), if any, arising out of or in connection with the transactions effected
pursuant to this Agreement shall be paid by Purchaser. The Parties shall
cooperate in connection with the preparation and filing of all necessary

 



_Purchase and Sale Agreement  WCG _

  



49  documentation and Tax Returns that must be filed in connection with such
Transfer Taxes and will make available to each other, and to any Taxing
Authority, all information, records or documents related to the liability or
potential liability for such Transfer Taxes and will preserve such
information, records or documents until the expiration of any applicable
statute of limitations or extensions thereof.

 

9.02 _Allocation of Purchase Price_.

 

No later than thirty (30) calendar days following the Closing Date, WCG shall
deliver to Purchaser a proposed schedule (the " _Purchase Price Allocation
Schedule_ ") allocating the Purchase Price among the assets and any
liabilities of the Acquired Companies and any other items entering into
Purchasers tax basis for the assets of the Acquired Companies under Section
755 of the Code, among such assets of the Acquired Companies. The Purchase
Price Allocation Schedule shall be subject to Purchasers review, comment, and
prior consent, and Purchaser shall deliver its comments to WCG within
fourteen (14) calendar days after its receipt of the proposed Purchase Price
Allocation Schedule from WCG, and Seller Parties shall incorporate any
reasonable comments of Purchaser into the final Purchase Price
Allocation Schedule. If the Purchaser and Seller Parties are unable to agree
on the final Purchase Price Allocation Schedule, then the final Purchase Price
Allocation Schedule shall be determined by a nationally-recognized accounting
firm that is mutually agreeable to both Purchaser and Seller Parties. The
Purchaser, LC FinCo, PR HoldCo and Seller Parties shall report for Tax
purposes and file Tax Returns in a manner consistent with the final Purchase
Price Allocation Schedule; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that (i) Purchasers
cost for the assets that it purchases may differ from the total amount
allocated hereunder to reflect the inclusion in the total cost of items (for
example, capitalized acquisition costs) not included in the amount so
allocated, (ii) the amount realized by Seller Parties may differ from the
total amount allocated hereunder to reflect transaction costs that reduce the
amount realized for federal income tax purposes, and (iii) that neither
Seller Parties or any of their Affiliates nor Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates will be obligated to litigate any challenge to such allocation of
the Purchase Price by a Governmental Authority. Any adjustments to the
Purchase Price pursuant to this Agreement shall be allocated among the assets
of Acquired Entities for purposes of the Purchase Price Allocation Schedule in
accordance with this _Section 9.02_.

 

9.03 _Tax Contests_.

 

Purchaser shall promptly inform WCG of the commencement of any audit,
examination or proceeding relating in whole or in part to Taxes for which
Seller Parties are responsible to indemnify any Purchaser Indemnified Party
pursuant to this Agreement. With respect to any such Tax, to the extent within
the power of Purchaser, using commercially reasonable efforts, WCG will have
the right, at its sole cost and expense, to control (in the case of a Pre-
Calculation Date Tax Period) or participate in (in the case of a Straddle
Period) the prosecution, settlement or compromise of any proceeding involving
the Tax, including the determination of the value of property for purposes of
real and personal property ad valorem Taxes, _provided_ that WCG shall have
promptly notified Purchaser in writing of its intention to control or
participate in such Tax proceeding. Purchaser will (and will, to the extent
within the power of Purchaser, using commercially reasonable efforts, cause
each Acquired Entity to) take

 



_Purchase and Sale Agreement  WCG _

  



50  such action in connection with any such proceeding that WCG reasonably
requests, including the selection of counsel and experts and the execution of
powers of attorney. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Purchaser will be entitled
to participate in any proceeding involving a Pre-Calculation Date Tax Period,
and WCG will not settle any proceeding without Purchasers prior written
consent, not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Purchaser
will (and will, to the extent within the power of Purchaser, using
commercially reasonable efforts, cause each Acquired Entity to) inform WCG
promptly, and send WCG copies promptly upon receipt, of any notice of an
audit, examination, claim or assessment for any Tax for which Seller Parties
are responsible and keep WCG informed of progress in the proceedings and allow
WCG to attend any meetings and scheduled calls with the Governmental
Authorities to the extent WCG is not controlling the proceedings. WCG will
have an obligation to keep Purchaser similarly informed about proceedings that
it controls and diligently prosecute such proceedings. Failure to give any
notice or keep the other Party informed will reduce Seller Parties
indemnification obligation pursuant to this Agreement only to the extent
Seller Parties are actually prejudiced by the failure. If notice is given to
WCG of the commencement of any such audit, examination or proceeding and WCG
does not, within ten (10) Business Days after Purchasers notice is given,
give notice to Purchaser of its election to assume or participate in the
defense thereof or if WCG fails to diligently prosecute the defense of any
Tax proceeding for which it has elected to assume or participate in the
defense, WCG shall be bound by any determination made in such audit,
examination or proceeding or any compromise or settlement thereof effected by
Purchaser.

 

9.04 _Cooperation_.

The Parties shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested
by any of the other Parties, in connection with the filing of Tax Returns and
the conduct of any Tax proceedings related to the Acquired Entities. For a
period of one (1) year after the Closing Date, the Seller Parties shall
retain records and information which are reasonably relevant to any Tax
matters and make then current employees available, if any, to provide
additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder.
Purchaser and Seller Parties each agree, upon request, to use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain any certificate or other document from any Tax
authority or any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or
eliminate any Tax that could be imposed with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

ARTICLE 10

51 ARTICLE 11

 

INDEMNIFICATION

 

11.01 _Indemnification by Seller Parties_.

 

Seller Parties shall jointly and severally indemnify and hold harmless the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties in respect of, and hold each of them harmless
from and against, any and all Losses suffered, incurred or sustained by any of
them or to which any of them become subject, resulting from, arising out of or
related to (a) any breach of or inaccuracy in any representation or
warranty made by any Seller Party or any of its Affiliates in this Agreement
or any other Investment Document or (b) any breach or nonperformance of any
covenant, agreement or obligation made or to be performed by any Seller Party
or any of its Affiliates under this Agreement or any other Investment
Document. The amount of any such indemnity payable by Seller Parties shall be
reduced by the amount of all net insurance proceeds actually received by the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties as of the time such indemnification payment is
required to be paid in respect of the occurrence of the event giving rise to
the indemnification obligation hereunder.

 

11.02 _Indemnification by Purchaser_.

 

Purchaser shall indemnify and hold harmless the Seller Indemnified Parties in
respect of, and hold each of them harmless from and against, any and all
Losses suffered, incurred or sustained by any of them or to which any of them
become subject, resulting from, arising out of or relating to (a) any breach
of or inaccuracy in any representation or warranty made by Purchaser or any
of its Affiliates in this Agreement or any other Investment Document or (b)
any breach or nonperformance of any covenant, agreement or obligation made or
to be performed by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates under this Agreement or
any other Investment Document. The amount of any such indemnity payable by
Purchaser to a Seller Indemnified Party shall be reduced by the amount of all
insurance proceeds actually received by such Seller Indemnified Party as of
the time such indemnification payment is required to be paid in respect of
the occurrence of the event which gave rise to the indemnification obligation
hereunder.

 

11.03 _Period for Making Claims_.

 

No claim under this Agreement for breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement may be made by a Party unless such Party shall have
delivered a written notice of claim prior to the date that is fifteen (15)
months after the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that a claim for any
breach of (a) any representation or warranty contained in this
Agreement involving fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation shall survive the
Closing indefinitely and (b) any Fundamental Representation shall survive
until sixty (60) days after the expiration of the applicable statute of
limitations period (taking into account any extensions or waivers thereof);
_provided_ , _further_ , that if written notice for a claim of indemnification
has been provided by the Indemnified Party pursuant to _Section 11.05(a)_ on
or prior to the last day of the applicable foregoing survival period, then
the obligation of the Indemnifying Party to indemnify the Indemnified Party
pursuant to this _ARTICLE 11_ shall survive with respect to such claim until
such claim is finally resolved. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, all of the Parties covenants that contemplate actions or
impose obligations following the Closing shall survive in accordance with
their respective terms.

 



_Purchase and Sale Agreement  WCG _

  



52 11.04 _Limitations on Claims; Additional Indemnity Provisions_.

 

(a) Subject to _Section 11.04(b)_, Seller Parties shall not have any
obligation to indemnify the Purchaser Indemnified Parties for Losses pursuant
to _Section 11.01(a)_, and Purchaser shall not have any obligation to
indemnify the Seller Indemnified Parties for Losses pursuant to _Section
11.02(a)_, until the aggregate of all such Losses exceeds Five
Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000.00) (the " _Deductible_ "), at which time
Seller Parties or Purchaser, as applicable, shall be required to indemnify the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties or the Seller Indemnified Parties, respectively,
for all amounts in excess of the Deductible.

(b) The aggregate liability of the Indemnifying Party under this _ARTICLE 11_
shall be limited to an amount equal to Closing Date Purchase Price;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the aggregate liability of Seller Parties or of
Purchaser for any inaccuracy in or breach of any representations other than
the Fundamental Representations shall be limited to an amount equal to
$19,500,000 (the " _Cap_ ").

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the
Deductible and Cap shall not apply to any claim for indemnification pursuant
to _Section 11.01(a)_ or _Section 11.02(a)_ in respect of any claim
involving fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation or willful misconduct or any
inaccuracy in or breach of any Fundamental Representation.

(d) Each Party shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, use its commercially
reasonable efforts to mitigate its Losses (including by using such efforts to
recover any insurance as may be available with respect to such Loss) upon and
after becoming aware of any event which would reasonably be expected to
give rise to any Losses that are indemnifiable under this _ARTICLE 11_ ;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing shall not be deemed to impose any
obligation or duty to initiate legal proceedings to seek such recovery.

 

11.05 _Procedure for Indemnification_.

 

(a) _Notice_. Whenever any claim shall arise for indemnification under this
_ARTICLE 11_ , the Indemnified Party shall promptly notify the Indemnifying
Party of the claim and, when known, the facts constituting the basis for such
claim. In the event of any such claim for indemnification hereunder resulting
from or in connection with any claim or legal proceedings by a third party,
the notice shall specify, if known, the amount or an estimate of the amount of
the liability arising therefrom.

(b) _Settlement of Losses_. The Indemnified Party shall not settle, consent
to the entry of a judgment of or compromise any claim by a third party for
which it is entitled to indemnification hereunder without the prior written
consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) of the
Indemnifying Party.

 



_Purchase and Sale Agreement  WCG _

  



53 11.06 _Rights of Indemnifying Party_.

 

(a) _Right to Assume the Defense_. In connection with any claim which may give
rise to indemnity hereunder resulting from or arising out of any claim or
legal proceeding by a Person other than the Indemnified Party, the
Indemnifying Party, may, upon written notice to the Indemnified Party, assume
the defense of any such claim or legal proceeding, which defense shall be
prosecuted by the Indemnifying Party to a final conclusion or settlement in
accordance with the terms hereof; _provided_ , _however_ , the Indemnifying
Party shall not have the right to assume such defense if (i) such claim or
legal proceeding involves criminal allegations or seeks an injunction,
restraining order, declaratory relief or other non-monetary relief against the
Indemnified Party, (ii) a material conflict of interest exists between the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party or (iii) such claim or legal
proceeding involves potential liability that would be materially adverse to
the interests of the Indemnified Party or could reasonably be expected to
result in Losses that are not fully indemnifiable (including as a result of
the limitations set forth in this _ARTICLE 11_ ).

(b) _Procedure_. If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any such
claim or legal proceeding, the Indemnifying Party shall (i) select counsel
reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party to conduct the defense of such
claims or legal proceedings, and (ii) take all steps necessary in the defense
or settlement thereof, at its sole cost and expense. If the Indemnifying Party
assumes the defense of any such claim or legal proceeding, the Indemnified
Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide any information or
authorization as may be reasonably necessary to allow the Indemnifying Party
to defend such claim or legal proceeding (and the Indemnifying Party shall
reimburse the Indemnified Party for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs, fees
and expenses incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection therewith). The
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to participate in (but not control) the
defense of any such action, with its own counsel and (except as otherwise
provided by  _Section 11.06(d)_) at its sole cost and expense.

(c) _Settlement of Losses_. The Indemnifying Party shall not consent to a
settlement of or the entry of any judgment arising from, any such claim or
legal proceeding, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

 

(d) _No Right or Decline to Assume the Defense_. If the Indemnifying Party
does not have the right to control such claim or legal proceeding or does not
assume the defense of any such claim or legal proceeding resulting therefrom
within fifteen (15) Business Days after the date the Indemnifying Party is
notified of such claim or legal proceeding by the Indemnified Party: (i) the
Indemnified Party may defend against such claim or litigation, at the sole
cost and expense (which cost and expense shall be reasonable) of the
Indemnifying Party, in such manner as the Indemnified Party may deem
reasonably appropriate, including settling such claim or litigation, subject
to the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), and (ii) the Indemnifying Party
shall be entitled to participate in (but not control) the defense of such
action, with its counsel and at its sole cost and expense.

 



_Purchase and Sale Agreement  WCG _

  



54 11.07 _Exclusive Remedy_.

 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary which may be contained herein, the
indemnities set forth in this _ARTICLE 11_ shall become effective as of the
Closing Date. Except as provided in _Section 13.03_, if the Closing shall
occur, (a) the indemnities set forth in _ARTICLE 9_ and this _ARTICLE 11_
shall be the exclusive remedies of the Parties and their respective members,
officers, directors, employees, agents and Affiliates due to breach or
misrepresentation of, or inaccuracy in, a representation or warranty,
nonfulfilment or failure to perform any covenant or agreement contained in
this Agreement, and (b) the Parties shall not be entitled to a rescission of
this Agreement or to any further indemnification rights or claims of any
nature whatsoever in respect thereof, all of which the Parties hereto hereby
waive.

 

11.08 _Indemnity Treatment_.

 

Any amount of indemnification payable pursuant to the provisions of this
_ARTICLE 11_ shall, to the extent possible, be treated as an adjustment to
the Purchase Price for Tax and all other applicable purposes.

ARTICLE 12

 

TERMINATION

 

12.01 _Termination_.

This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to Closing as follows:

(a) by mutual written consent of the Purchaser and WCG;

 

(b) by written notice of either WCG or Purchaser if the Closing has not
occurred on or before June 30, 2015 (the " _Termination Date_ ") (provided,
however, that if the only conditions remaining to be satisfied (other than
those conditions which by their terms cannot be satisfied until the Closing
and which are capable of being satisfied) are the receipt of one or more
Governmental Approvals or the delivery of the audited financial statements set
forth in _Section 7.11(b)_, then the Termination Date may be extended by
either party (unless such party is in default under this Agreement or any
other Investment Document) upon written notice to the other Party to July 31,
2015) and the failure to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement is not caused by a breach of this Agreement by the terminating
Party;

 

(c) by written notice of Purchaser if there has been a breach by any Seller
Party or any of its Affiliates of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement contained in this Agreement or any other Investment Document which
(i) would result in a failure of a condition set forth in _Section 7.01_ or
_7.02_ to be satisfied as of the time of such breach, and (ii) either (x)
cannot be cured prior to the Termination Date, or (y) is a breach of any
Seller Partys obligations to transfer the Acquired Interests at the Closing
in accordance with this Agreement; _provided_ , that the right to terminate
pursuant to this _Section 12.01(c)_ shall not be available to Purchaser if
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates is in material breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement
or any other Investment Document; or

 



_Purchase and Sale Agreement  WCG _

  



55 (d) by written notice of WCG if there has been a breach by Purchaser or any of
its Affiliates of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
contained in this Agreement or any other Investment Document which (i) would
result in a failure of a condition set forth in _Section 8.01_ or _8.02_ to
be satisfied as of the time of such breach, and (ii) either (x) cannot be
cured prior to the Termination Date, or (y) is a breach of Purchasers
obligations to pay the Purchase Price at the Closing in accordance with this
Agreement; _provided_ , that the right to terminate pursuant to this _Section
12.01(d)_ shall not be available to WCG if any Seller Party or any of its
Affiliates is in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement contained in this Agreement or any other Investment Document.

12.02 _Effect of Termination_.

 

(a) If this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to _Section 12.01_, this
Agreement will forthwith become null and void, and there will be no liability
or obligation on the part of Seller Parties or Purchaser (or any of their
respective Representatives or Affiliates) in respect of this Agreement, except
that the applicable portions of _ARTICLE 1_, this  _Section 12.02_, and the
entirety of _Sections 13.01_ , _13.03_ , _13.05_ , _13.06_ , _13.12_ , _13.13_
, _13.14_ and _13.15_ will continue to apply following any termination;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that nothing in this _Section 12.02_ shall release
any Party from liability for any breach of this Agreement by such Party prior
to the termination of this Agreement (and any attempted termination by the
breaching Party shall be void).

(b) Upon termination of this Agreement by a Party for any reason, each Party
shall return or destroy all Information (as defined in the Confidentiality
Agreement as amended by _Section 13.06(a)_ hereof) and all copies, extracts
and reproductions thereof to the extent required by _Section 5_ of the
Confidentiality Agreement (as amended by  _Section 13.06(a)_ hereof).

_Section 13.01_. Any Party from time to time may change its address,
facsimile number or other information for the purpose of notices to that
Party by giving notice specifying such change to the other Party.

13.02 _Entire Agreement_.

This Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreement (as amended by _Section 13.06_
hereof), the Assignments of Membership Interests, the other Investment
Documents, and the exhibits and schedules hereto and thereto, and the other
documents executed and delivered on the Closing Date, shall supersede all
previous oral and written and all contemporaneous oral negotiations,
commitments, and understandings and all other letters, memoranda or other
documents or communications, whether oral, written or electronic, in
connection with the negotiation and execution of this Agreement and with
respect to the subject hereof.

13.03 _Specific Performance_.

 

Each Party to this Agreement agrees that, in view of the uniqueness of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, any failure to perform or breach
of its obligations under this Agreement will result in irreparable damage to
the other Parties, that the remedies available to

 



_Purchase and Sale Agreement  WCG _

  



57  the other Parties at Law alone will be an inadequate remedy for such failure
or breach, and that in addition to any other remedy at law or in equity, each
of the Parties shall be entitled to specific performance by the other Parties
of their respective obligations under this Agreement and immediate injunctive
relief, without the necessity of proving the inadequacy of money damages as a
remedy. Each Party further agrees that, if the other Party seeks to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in respect of such
breach or violation, it will not assert as a defense that a remedy at Law
would be adequate, and nothing contained in this  _Section 13.03_ shall
require any Party to seek (or limit any Partys right to seek) specific
performance under this Agreement before exercising any other right under this
Agreement.

 

13.04 _Time of the Essence_.

 

Time is of the essence with regard to all duties and time periods set forth in
this Agreement.

 

13.05 _Expenses_.

Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, whether or not the
transactions contemplated hereby are consummated, each Party will pay its own
costs and expenses incurred in connection with the negotiation, execution and
performance of this Agreement.

13.06 _Confidentiality_.

 

(a) As amended by this _clause (a)_ , the Confidentiality Agreement shall
continue in full force and effect in accordance with its terms until the
Closing, when it shall be automatically terminated, or if this Agreement
terminates earlier in accordance with _ARTICLE 12_ , until the termination of
the Confidentiality Agreement in accordance with its terms; _provided_ ,
that "Information" under and as defined in the Confidentiality Agreement
shall be deemed to include information, analyses, compilations, data, studies,
notes, interpretations, memoranda or other documents disclosed by Purchaser,
its Affiliates or its or their Representatives to any Seller Party, its
Affiliates and its and their Representatives, and in respect of such
Information each Seller Party shall have the same obligations as Purchaser has
under the Confidentiality Agreement in respect of Information provided by WCG
or its Affiliates; _provided further_ , that "Representatives" under and as
defined in the Confidentiality Agreement shall include representatives of
potential sources of financing, and Purchaser shall be permitted to disclose
the "Information" under and as defined in the Confidentiality Agreement to its
"Representatives" under and as defined in the Confidentiality Agreement to the
extent necessary for Purchaser to pursue a financing; provided, however, to
the extent such financing is contemplated to be executed through the public
markets such permission granted to financing sources and their representatives
shall not extend to the dissemination or disclosure of any "Information" to
such markets (as opposed to any underwriters and their advisors engaged in
anticipation of such public financing and otherwise in accordance with the
Confidentiality Agreement).

 



_Purchase and Sale Agreement  WCG _

  



58 (b) From and after the Closing, each Seller Party shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates and its and their Representatives to, (i) treat and hold as
confidential any information concerning the Business (including know-how and
trade secrets) of the Acquired Entities, the Investment Documents and the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby (collectively, the "
_Confidential Information_ "), except (A) as expressly permitted hereunder,
(B) to the extent such Confidential Information comes into the public domain
after the Closing through no breach by any Seller Party of this _Section
13.06(b)_, (C) to the extent such Confidential Information was or becomes
available to any Seller Party or any of its Affiliates after the Closing Date
on a non-confidential basis from a source other than one of the Acquired
Entities, or (D) to the extent the disclosure of such Confidential Information
is required by Law or any regulatory requirements or as part of the
preparation or issuance of any financial statements, and (ii) refrain from
using any of the Confidential Information other than to prepare Taxes to
comply with any other obligations hereunder and pursue rights under this
Agreement. Each Seller Party acknowledges and agrees that the Confidential
Information is the property of the Acquired Entities. In the event that,
after the Closing Date, any Seller Party or any of its Affiliates or its or
their Representatives is requested or required (by oral question or request
for information or documents in any legal proceeding, interrogatory,
subpoena, civil investigative demand or similar process) to disclose any
Confidential Information, such Person shall notify Purchaser promptly of the
request or requirement so that Purchaser may seek an appropriate protective
order or waive compliance with the provisions of this _Section 13.06(b)_. If,
in the absence of a protective order or the receipt of a waiver hereunder,
such Person is, on the advice of counsel, compelled to disclose
any Confidential Information to any Governmental Authority or else stand
liable for contempt, such Person may disclose such Confidential Information to
such Governmental Authority; _provided_ , that Seller Parties shall use their
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, at the expense and request of
Purchaser, an order or other assurance that confidential treatment shall be
accorded to such portion of the Confidential Information required to be
disclosed as Purchaser shall designate. 

13.07 _Waiver_.

Any term or condition of this Agreement may be waived at any time by the
Party that is entitled to the benefit thereof, but no such waiver shall be
effective unless set forth in a written instrument duly executed by or on
behalf of the Party waiving such term or condition and delivered pursuant to
_Section 13.01_. No waiver by any Party of any term or condition of this
Agreement, in any one or more instances, shall be deemed to be or construed as
a waiver of the same or any other term or condition of this Agreement on any
future occasion. All remedies, either under this Agreement or by Law or
otherwise afforded, will be cumulative and not alternative.

 

13.08 _Amendment_.

This Agreement may be amended, supplemented or modified only by a written
instrument duly executed by or on behalf of each Party.

59 13.09 _No Third Party Beneficiary_.

 

The terms and provisions of this Agreement are intended solely for the benefit

other hand, under this Agreement are not assignable without the prior written
consent of Purchaser or Seller Parties, respectively, which any such Party may
withhold in its discretion; _provided_ _however_ , that any such assignment
by Purchaser to an Affiliate of Purchaser or by Seller Parties to an Affiliate
of WCG following the Closing shall not require consent so long as, any
assignee parties agree to be bound by this Agreement and such assignment
shall not relieve the assignor party from its obligations hereunder; _provided
further_ , that Purchaser and its permitted assigns may at any time without
the prior written consent of Seller Parties: (i) assign, in whole or in part,
its rights and obligations under this Agreement and the other Investment
Documents to one or more of its Affiliates so long as Purchaser remains liable
for the performance of its obligations under this Agreement and the other
Investment Documents, and (ii) assign its rights under this Agreement, and the
Investment Documents for collateral security purposes to any financing parties
providing debt financing to (A) Purchaser, (B) any of the Acquired Entities,

Affiliates of the foregoing entities.

 

13.11 _Severability_.

Any provision of this Agreement which is invalid, illegal, or unenforceable
in any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction, be ineffective to the
extent of such invalidity, illegality, or unenforceability, without affecting
in any way the remaining provisions hereof in such jurisdiction or rendering
that or any other provision of this Agreement invalid, illegal, or
unenforceable in any other jurisdiction. Should any provision of this
Agreement be or become invalid or unenforceable as a whole or in part, this
Agreement shall be reformed to come closest to the original intent and purpose
of the Parties.

13.12 _Governing Law_.

THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED IN ALL RESPECTS BY THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF

13.17 _Disclosures_.

WCG or Purchaser may, at its option, include in the Disclosure Schedules
items that are not material in order to avoid any misunderstanding, and any
such inclusion, or any references to dollar amounts, shall not be deemed to be
an acknowledgment or representation that such items are material, to
establish any standard of materiality or to define further the meaning of such
terms for purposes of this Agreement. In no event shall the inclusion of any
matter in the Disclosure Schedules be deemed or interpreted to broaden Seller
Parties or Purchasers representations, warranties, covenants or agreements
contained in this Agreement. The mere inclusion of an item in the Disclosure
Schedules shall not be deemed an admission by a Seller Party or Purchaser
that such item represents a material exception or fact, event, or
circumstance.

The information and disclosures contained in each schedule of the Disclosure
Schedules shall be deemed to be disclosed and incorporated by reference in
each of the other schedules of the Disclosure Schedules as though fully set
forth in such other schedules (whether or not specific cross-references are
made), if such disclosure describes the relevant facts in reasonable detail
and the relevance of such disclosure to any such other applicable schedule(s)
is reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure.

This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts and by separate
Parties on separate counterparts, each of which when executed shall be deemed
an original, but all such counterparts taken together shall constitute one and
the same instrument. Delivery of an executed counterpart of this Agreement by

as delivery of a manually executed counterpart hereof.

Each Party will consult with the other Parties before issuing any press
releases or otherwise making any public statements with respect to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated herein and will not issue, or
permit any of its respective Affiliates to issue, any such press release or
make any such public statement without the consent of the other Parties (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) unless such action is
required by

 



_Purchase and Sale Agreement  WCG _

  



62  Law or by any national securities exchange and such Party is unable after
good faith efforts to obtain the approval of the other Parties in a timely
manner, to the extent obtaining such approval is not prohibited by Law or the
rules of any applicable national securities exchange, in which case such Party
may make or issue the legally required release or announcement and shall
promptly furnish the other Parties with a copy thereof. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Purchaser shall be permitted to
file a copy of this Agreement as an exhibit to its or its Affiliates filings
with the SEC.

 

13.20 _No Strict Construction_.

hereto and thereto shall be deemed to be the product of all of the Parties,
and no ambiguity shall be construed in favor of or against any Party.

termination of the waiting period prescribed by the HSR Act, if necessary,
pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement promptly after the date of this Agreement, and at the latest within
ten (10) Business Days after the date of this Agreement, and shall supply as
promptly as practicable to the appropriate Governmental Authorities any
additional information and documentary material that may be requested pursuant
to the HSR Act. The HSR Act filing fee shall be borne one-half by Purchaser
and one-half by Seller Parties.

 

(c) As promptly as is reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement,
and at the latest within ten (10) Business Days after the date of this
Agreement, the Parties shall file or cause to be filed with the FERC a single
joint application pursuant to FPA Section 203 as is necessary to obtain
required FERC approval for the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. The Parties shall consult with each other regarding such
filings and shall consider and incorporate in such filings all reasonable
comments, if any, submitted by the other Party with respect thereto, and shall
have the joint right to approve such filings. FERC counsel engaged by the
Parties shall be jointly responsible for and shall execute the filing, and,
once approved by the Parties, counsel for Purchaser shall undertake the actual
filing. Both counsel for Seller Parties and for Purchaser shall manage all
communications with FERC with respect to the FPA Section 203 application. To
the maximum extent practicable and consistent with the provisions of this

_Purchase and Sale Agreement  WCG _

  



63  Section 203 application, including to the extent practicable in preparations
for such communications. The Parties shall cooperate with one another to
respond promptly to any requests for additional information made by the FERC
and use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to cause regulatory
approval to be obtained at the earliest possible date after the date of
filing. Each Party shall bear its own costs incurred in connection with the
FERC filing; _provided_ , _however_ , that if FERC requires or requests the
submission of a statistical or economic competition or market-power study or
screen analysis, under 18 C.F.R. Part 33 or otherwise, the cost of such study
shall be borne one-half by Purchaser and one-half by Seller Parties.

(d) The Parties will provide prompt notification to each other when any such
consent, approval, action, or filing referred to in _Section 13.21(b)_ or
_13.21(c)_ is obtained, taken, made or given, as applicable, and will advise
each other of any material communications with any Governmental Authority or
other Person regarding any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any Party receives a request for additional
information from any Governmental Authority that is related to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, then such Party shall endeavor
in good faith to make, or cause to be made, to the extent practicable and
after consultation with the other Parties, an appropriate response to such
request. Prior to delivery of such response, such Party shall provide the
other Parties with an opportunity to review and comment on such response, to
the extent practicable. No Party shall participate in any meeting, or engage
in any material substantive conversation, with any Governmental Authority
without giving the other Parties and their designated counsel prior notice of
the meeting or conversation and, unless prohibited by such Governmental
Authority, the opportunity to attend or participate.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no Party or
any of its Affiliates shall be required to (i) defend any lawsuit challenging
this Agreement or any other Investment Document or the performance of the
obligations hereunder or thereunder unless it is commercially reasonable to do
so, except as otherwise required by _ARTICLE 11_ , (ii) other than pursuant
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other Investment
Documents, sell, transfer, divest or otherwise dispose of any business, assets

contemplated hereby or thereby, or (iii) give or promise any consideration,
whether such consideration shall consist of the payment of money or shall take
any other form, or grant any accommodation for any consent, Permit, exemption
or waiver required, necessary or advisable from any Person that is not such
Partys Affiliate for the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
or by any other Investment Document.

FORM OF CERTIFICATE OF NON-FOREIGN STATUS FOR SELLER PARTIES

 

CERTIFICATE OF NON-FOREIGN STATUS OF SELLER PARTIES

 

Section 1445 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ ")
provides that a transferee of a U.S. real property interest must withhold tax
if the transferor is a foreign person. For U.S. tax purposes (including
section 1445), the owner of a disregarded entity (which has legal title to a
U.S. real property interest under local law) will be the transferor of the
property and not the disregarded entity. Wind Capital Group, LP, a Delaware
limited partnership, and Lincoln County Wind Project Finco, LP, a Delaware
limited partnership, are each disregarded as separate entities from Wind
Capital Ventures, LP, a Delaware limited partnership (" _Trasnferor_ ") for
U.S. federal tax purposes.

To inform the transferee that withholding of tax is not required upon the
disposition of a U.S. real property interest by Transferor, the undersigned
hereby certifies the following on behalf of the Transferor:

 

1\. Transferor is not a foreign corporation, foreign partnership, foreign
trust, or foreign estate (as those terms are defined in the Code and Treasury
Regulations);

2\. Transferor is not a disregarded entity as defined in Treasury Regulations
section 1.1445-2(b)(2)(iii);

 

3\. Transferors U.S. employer identification number is xx-xxxxxxx; and

 

4\. Transferors office address is shown below.

 

Wind Capital Ventures, LP

 

Chicago, IL 60654

Transferor understands that this certification may be disclosed to the
Internal Revenue Service by transferee and that any false statement contained
herein could be punished by fine, imprisonment, or both.

 

Under penalties of perjury I declare that I have examined this certification
and to the best of my knowledge and belief it is true, correct, and complete,
and I further declare that I have authority to sign this document on behalf of
Transferor.

], pursuant to which Purchaser is purchasing the Acquired Interests (as

themselves, their successors and assigns, hereby agree as follows:

 

1\. _Definitions_. The following terms shall have the following meanings when

   1  | NTD: Insert date 18 months after date hereof. " _Purchaser Representative_ " shall mean the person(s) so designated on

Escrow Agent hereby accepts such appointment and, upon receipt by wire

invest and disburse Escrow Funds in accordance with this Agreement.

 

3\. _Deposit of Escrow Funds_. Simultaneously with the execution and delivery
of this Agreement, Purchaser, on behalf of the Seller Parties, will transfer
Escrow Funds in the amount of $19,500,000 (Nineteen Million Five Hundred
Thousand Dollars), by wire transfer of immediately available funds, to a
segregated account designated by Escrow Agent.

 

4\. _Disbursement of Escrow Funds, Generally_. Escrow Agent shall disburse
Escrow Funds at any time and from time to time, upon receipt of and in
accordance with, a Joint Written Direction. Such Joint Written Direction shall
include instructions to disburse funds conforming to the payment instructions
set forth on Schedule A hereto, or if payment instructions are altered, such
Joint Written Direction shall contain complete payment instructions,
including wire transfer instructions or an address to which a check shall be
sent. On the date that is fifteen (15) business days after the expiration of
the Escrow Period and without any further direction or instruction, Escrow
Agent shall distribute to the Seller Parties, as promptly as practicable, any
remaining Escrow Funds not subject to a Claim Notice in accordance with the
payment instructions for the Seller Parties set forth on Schedule A hereto.
Prior to any disbursement, Escrow Agent shall have received reasonable
identifying information regarding the recipient such that Escrow Agent may
comply with its regulatory obligations and reasonable business practices,
including without limitation a completed United States Internal Revenue
Service (" _IRS_ ") Form W-9 or IRS Form W-8, as applicable. All disbursements
of funds from Escrow Funds shall be subject to the fees and claims of Escrow
Agent and the Indemnified Parties pursuant to Section 11 and Section 12
hereof.

5\. _Administration of and Disbursement for Claims_.

(a) If during the Escrow Period Purchaser elects to make a claim for
obligations owed to it by the Seller Parties, then procedures for
administering and resolving such claims shall be as follows:

(i) If Purchaser asserts an initial claim for amounts owed by the Seller
Parties under the Underlying Agreement that Purchaser wishes to recover from
the Escrow Funds (a " _Seller Claim_ "), it must give written notice of the
claim, which notice must set forth (A) a description of and the general basis
for the claim and (B) the amount owed (or, if such amount is not known, a
reasonable estimate of the amount owed) (" _Claim Notice_ "), to Escrow Agent
and the Seller Parties prior to the expiration of the Escrow Period. Within
fifteen (15) business days after the date upon which such Claim Notice is
delivered to Escrow Agent (" _Claim Notice Delivery Date_ "), the Seller
Parties may advise Purchaser and Escrow Agent in writing whether the Seller
Parties object to some or all of the Seller Claim set forth in the Claim
Notice (a " _Claim Response_ ").

 



Page 2 of 15 (inclusive of Schedules A-D) (ii) Escrow Agent shall pay to Purchaser the amount set forth in a Claim
Notice (but not to exceed the outstanding Escrow Funds) only if (1) the
Escrow Agent has not received from the Seller Parties a Claim Response or a
Freeze Notice within fifteen (15) business days after the Claim Notice
Delivery Date and (2) Purchaser has provided a written statement to Escrow
Agent stating that Purchaser has delivered the Claim Notice to the Seller
Parties in accordance with Section 5(a)(i) and the notice provisions as
defined herein, and that the Seller Parties have failed to object to the
Seller Claim; or (B) pursuant to a Joint Written Direction.

(iii) If, within fifteen (15) business days after the Claim Notice Delivery
Date, Escrow Agent receives from the Seller Parties a Claim Response to any or
all of the Claim Notice amount (the " _Contested Amount_ "), Escrow Agent
shall release to Purchaser all of the Claim Notice amount (but not to exceed
the outstanding Escrow Funds) except for the Contested Amount. Thereafter,
Escrow Agent shall release the Contested Amount (but not to exceed the
outstanding Escrow Funds) only pursuant to (A) a Joint Written Direction or
(B) the order, judgment or decree of any court or the award of an arbitrator
chosen by Purchaser and the Seller Parties.

 

(iv) In the event the Claim Notice sets forth an estimate of the amount owed
pursuant to the Seller Claim and within fifteen (15) business days after the
Claim Notice Delivery Date Seller delivers a notice that such amounts are
subject to this Section 5(a)(iv) (a " _Freeze Notice_ "), Escrow Agent shall
hold the amount of such estimated Seller Claim until Purchaser delivers a
subsequent Claim Notice (a " _Definitive Claim Notice_ ") setting forth the
definitive amount of such Seller Claim which was the subject of the previous
Claim Notice and upon which such Seller Claim shall again be subject to the
provisions of the last sentence of Section 5(a)(i) and Sections 5(a)(ii) and
(iii) as to the payment or disbursement thereof. For the avoidance of doubt
any amount held pursuant to this Section 5(a)(iv) at the expiration of the
Escrow Period shall be deemed to remain subject to a Claim Notice for purposes
of Section 4 hereof and shall only be available for the payment of amounts
related to the subject of the initial Claim Notice, unless the balance of
Escrow Funds is insufficient to pay all of the Seller Claims outstanding at
the expiration of the Escrow Period, in which case Purchaser shall have the
option of receiving Escrow Funds subject to a Freeze Notice in satisfaction of
unrelated Seller Claims to the extent amounts are otherwise payable in
respect thereof pursuant to the terms hereof. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, Purchaser shall be permitted to deliver a
Definitive Claim Notice after the expiration of the Escrow Period.

(b) Escrow Agent shall have no responsibility to determine the validity or
sufficiency of any Claim Notice, Freeze Notice, Definitive Claim Notice or
Claim Response or whether any Claim Notice, Freeze Notice, Definitive Claim
Notice or Claim Response has been received by any of Purchaser, the Seller
Parties or their respective Representatives, or to provide a copy of any
Claim Notice, Freeze Notice, Definitive Claim Notice or Claim Response to any
of Purchaser, the Seller Parties or the Representatives. Escrow Agent may
conclusively presume that any Claim Notice, Freeze Notice, Definitive Claim
Notice or Claim Response received by it has been simultaneously received by
the Seller Parties or by Purchaser, as the case may be.

 

6\. _Suspension of Performance; Disbursement into Court_. If, at any time, (i)
there shall exist any dispute between Purchaser, the Seller Parties or the
Representatives with respect to the holding or disposition of all or any
portion of Escrow Funds or any other obligations of Escrow Agent hereunder,
(ii) Escrow Agent is unable to determine, to Escrow Agents
sole satisfaction, the proper disposition of all or any portion of Escrow
Funds or Escrow Agents proper actions with respect to its obligations
hereunder, or (iii) the Representatives have not, within 10 calendar days of
the furnishing by Escrow Agent of a notice of resignation pursuant to Section
8 hereof, appointed a successor Escrow Agent to act hereunder, then Escrow
Agent may, in its sole discretion, take either or both of the following
actions: (x) suspend the performance of any of its obligations (including
without limitation any disbursement obligations) under this Agreement until
such dispute or uncertainty shall be resolved to the sole satisfaction of
Escrow Agent or until a successor Escrow Agent shall have been appointed, and
(y) petition (by means of an interpleader action or any other appropriate
method) any court of competent jurisdiction, in any venue convenient to Escrow
Agent, for instructions with respect to such 

 



Page 3 of 15 (inclusive of Schedules A-D)  dispute or uncertainty, and to the extent required or permitted by law, pay
into such court, for holding and disposition in accordance with the
instructions of such court, all Escrow Funds, after deduction and payment to
Escrow Agent of fees and expenses (including without limitation court costs
and attorneys fees) payable to, incurred by, or expected to be incurred by
Escrow Agent in connection with the performance of its duties and the
exercise of its rights hereunder. Escrow Agent shall have no liability to
Purchaser, the Seller Parties or the Representatives, their respective owners,
shareholders or members or any other person with respect to any such
suspension of performance or disbursement into court, including without
limitation any liability or claimed liability that may arise, or be alleged to
have arisen, as a result of any delay in the disbursement of Escrow Funds or
any delay with respect to any other action required or requested of Escrow
Agent.

7\. _Investment of Funds_. Based upon Purchasers and the Seller Parties
prior review of investment alternatives, in the absence of further specific
Joint Written Direction to the contrary, Escrow Agent is directed to invest
and reinvest Escrow Funds in the investment indicated on Schedule B hereto.
Purchaser and the Seller Parties may provide Joint Written Direction to
Escrow Agent changing the investment of Escrow Funds; _provided, however_ ,
that no investment may be made except in the following: (i) direct obligations
of the United States of America or obligations the principal of and the
interest on which are unconditionally guaranteed by the United State of
America; (ii) U.S. dollar denominated demand and time deposit accounts with a
national bank or banking association (including Escrow Agent) which has a
rating on its short-term deposits on the date of investment of "A-1" or "A-l+"
by Standard andPoors and "P-1" by Moodys and maturing no more than 360 days
after the date of investment (ratings on holding companies are not considered
as the rating of the bank); or (iii) money market funds, including funds
managed by Escrow Agent or any of its affiliates, rated on the date of
investment "AAAm" by Standard andPoors or "Aaa-mf" by Moodys; _provided,
however_ , that Escrow Agent will not be directed to invest in investments
that Escrow Agent in its sole discretion determines are not consistent with
Escrow Agents policy or practices. Purchaser and the Seller Parties
acknowledge that Escrow Agent does not have a duty nor will it undertake any
duty to provide investment advice. To the extent that Purchaser and the Seller
Parties direct Escrow Agent to invest in a money market fund as described in
clause (iii) in this Section 7, Purchaser and the Seller Parties acknowledge
that they have received from Escrow Agent, either directly or via access to a
relevant website, a current copy of the prospectus for the investment they
have authorized, prior to providing such authorization _._

All investments shall be made in the name of Escrow Agent. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, Escrow Agent may, without notice to
Purchaser and the Seller Parties, sell or liquidate any of the foregoing
investments at any time for any disbursement of Escrow Funds permitted
or required hereunder. All investment earnings shall become part of Escrow
Funds and investment losses shall be charged against Escrow Funds. Escrow
Agent shall not be liable or responsible for loss in the value of any
investment made pursuant to this Agreement, or for any loss, cost or penalty
resulting from any sale or liquidation of Escrow Funds. With respect to any
Escrow Funds received by Escrow Agent after twelve oclock, p.m., St. Paul,
Minnesota, local time, Escrow Agent shall not be required to invest such
funds or to effect any investment instruction until the next day upon which
banks in St. Paul, Minnesota and the New York Stock Exchange are open for
business.

 

8\. _Resignation of Escrow Agent_. Escrow Agent may resign and be discharged
from the performance of its duties hereunder at any time by giving ten (10)
days prior written notice to Purchaser and the Seller Parties specifying a
date when such resignation shall take effect. Upon any such notice of
resignation, Purchaser and the Seller Parties jointly shall appoint a
successor Escrow Agent hereunder prior to the effective date of such
resignation. If Purchaser and the Seller Parties fail to appoint a successor
Escrow Agent within such time, Escrow Agent shall have the right to petition a
court of competent jurisdiction to appoint a successor Escrow Agent, and all
costs and expenses (including without limitation attorneys fees) related to
such petition shall be paid jointly and severally by Purchaser and the Seller
Parties. The retiring Escrow Agent shall transmit all records pertaining to
Escrow Funds and shall pay all Escrow Funds to the successor Escrow Agent,
after making copies of such records as the retiring Escrow Agent deems
advisable and after deduction and payment to the retiring Escrow Agent of all
fees and expenses (including without limitation court costs and attorneys
fees) payable to, incurred by, or expected to be incurred by the retiring
Escrow Agent in connection with the performance of its duties and the exercise
of its rights hereunder. After any retiring Escrow Agents resignation, the
provisions of this Agreement shall inure to its benefit as to any actions
taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Escrow Agent under this
Agreement.

 



Page 4 of 15 (inclusive of Schedules A-D) 9\. _Binding Effect; Successors_. This Agreement shall be binding upon the
respective parties hereto and their heirs, executors, successors or assigns.
If Escrow Agent consolidates, merges or converts into, or transfers all or
substantially all of its corporate trust business (including the escrow
contemplated by this Agreement) to another corporation or association, the
successor or transferee entity shall be the successor Escrow Agent without any
further act.

10.  _Liability of Escrow Agent_. Escrow Agent undertakes to perform only
such duties as are expressly set forth herein and no duties shall be implied.
Escrow Agent has no fiduciary or discretionary duties of any kind. Escrow
Agent shall have no liability under and no duty to inquire as to the
provisions of any agreement other than this Agreement, including without
limitation any other agreement between any or all of the parties hereto or any
other persons even though reference thereto may be made herein. Escrow Agent
shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted by it in good faith except
to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction determines that Escrow
Agents gross negligence or willful misconduct was the sole cause of loss to
Purchaser or the Seller Parties. Escrow Agents sole responsibility shall be
for the safekeeping and disbursement of Escrow Funds in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement. Escrow Agent shall not be charged with knowledge or
notice of any fact or circumstance not specifically set forth herein. Escrow
Agent may rely upon any notice, instruction, request or other instrument, not
only as to its due execution, validity and effectiveness, but also as to the
truth and accuracy of any information contained therein, which Escrow Agent
shall believe to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the person
or parties purporting to sign the same. In no event shall Escrow Agent be
liable for incidental, indirect, special, consequential or punitive damages
or penalties (including but not limited to lost profits), even if Escrow Agent
has been advised of the likelihood of such damages or penalty and regardless
of the form of action. Escrow Agent shall not be responsible for delays or
failures in performance resulting from acts beyond its control, including
without limitation acts of God, strikes, lockouts, riots, acts of war or
terror, epidemics, governmental regulations, fire, communication line
failures, computer viruses, power failures, earthquakes or other disasters.
Escrow Agent shall not be obligated to take any legal action or commence any
proceeding in connection with Escrow Funds, any account in which Escrow
Funds are deposited, this Agreement or the Underlying Agreement, or to appear
in, prosecute or defend any such legal action or proceeding. Escrow Agent may
consult legal counsel selected by it in the event of any dispute or question
as to the construction of any of the provisions hereof or of any other
agreement or of its duties hereunder, or relating to any dispute involving any
party hereto, and shall incur no liability and shall be fully indemnified from
any liability whatsoever in acting in accordance with the advice of such
counsel. Purchaser and the Seller Parties, jointly and severally, shall
promptly pay, upon demand, the reasonable fees and expenses of any such
counsel. Purchaser and the Seller Parties agree to perform or procure the
performance of all further acts and things, and execute and deliver such
further documents, as may be required by law or as Escrow Agent may reasonably
request in connection with its duties hereunder.

 

Escrow Agent is authorized, in its sole discretion, to comply with final
orders issued or process entered by any court with respect to Escrow Funds,
without determination by Escrow Agent of such courts jurisdiction in the
matter. If any portion of Escrow Funds is at any time attached, garnished or
levied upon under any court order, or in case the payment, assignment,
transfer, conveyance or delivery of any such property shall be stayed or
enjoined by any court order, or in case any order, judgment or decree shall be
made or entered by any court affecting such property or any part thereof, then
and in any such event, Escrow Agent is authorized, in its sole discretion, to
rely upon and comply with any such order, judgment or decree which it is
advised by legal counsel selected by it is binding upon it without the need
for appeal or other action; and if Escrow Agent complies with any such order,
judgment or decree, it shall not be liable to any of the parties hereto or to
any other person or entity by reason of such compliance even though such
order, judgment or decree may be subsequently reversed, modified, annulled,
set aside or vacated.

11\. _Indemnification of Escrow Agent_. From and at all times after the date
of this Agreement, Purchaser and the Seller Parties, jointly and severally,
shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, indemnify

 



Page 5 of 15 (inclusive of Schedules A-D)  and hold harmless Escrow Agent and each director, officer, employee,
attorney, agent and affiliate of Escrow Agent (collectively, the "
_Indemnified Parties_ ") against any and all actions, claims (whether or not
valid), losses, damages, liabilities, penalties, costs and expenses of any
kind or nature (including without limitation reasonable attorneys fees)
incurred by or asserted against any of the Indemnified Parties, whether
direct, indirect or consequential, as a result of or arising from or in any
way relating to any claim, demand, suit, action or proceeding (including any
inquiry or investigation) by any person, including without limitation
Purchaser, the Seller Parties and the Representatives, whether threatened or
initiated, asserting a claim for any legal or equitable remedy against any
person under any statute or regulation, including, but not limited to, any
federal or state securities laws, or under any common law or equitable cause
or otherwise, arising from or in connection with the negotiation, preparation,
execution, performance or failure of performance in connection with this
Agreement or any transactions contemplated herein;  _provided, however_ ,
that no Indemnified Party shall be indemnified for any liability finally
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction, subject to no further appeal,
to have resulted solely from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of
such Indemnified Party. Purchaser and the Seller Parties further agree,
jointly and severally, to indemnify each Indemnified Party for all costs,
including without limitation reasonable attorneys fees, incurred by such
Indemnified Party in connection with the enforcement of Purchasers and the
Seller Parties indemnification obligations hereunder. Each Indemnified Party
shall, in its sole discretion, have the right to select and employ separate
counsel with respect to any action or claim brought or asserted against it,
and the reasonable fees of such counsel shall be paid upon demand by Purchaser
and the Seller Parties jointly and severally. The obligations of Purchaser and
the Seller Parties under this Section 11 shall survive any termination of
this Agreement and the resignation or removal of Escrow Agent.

Purchaser and the Seller Parties agree that neither the payment by Purchaser
or the Seller Parties of any claim by Escrow Agent for indemnification
hereunder nor the disbursement of any amounts to Escrow Agent from Escrow
Funds in respect of a claim by Escrow Agent for indemnification shall impair,
limit, modify, or affect, as between Purchaser and the Seller Parties, the
respective rights and obligations of Purchaser and the Seller Parties under
the Underlying Agreement.

 

12\. _Compensation of Escrow Agent_

 

(a) _Fees and Expenses_. Purchaser and the Seller Parties agree, jointly and
severally, to compensate Escrow Agent on demand for its services hereunder in
accordance with Schedule C attached hereto. Without limiting the joint and
several nature of their obligations to Escrow Agent, Purchaser and the Seller
Parties agree between themselves that Purchaser will be wholly
responsible for Escrow Agents compensation. The obligations of Purchaser and
the Seller Parties under this Section 12 shall survive any termination of this
Agreement and the resignation or removal of Escrow Agent.

 

(b) _Disbursements from Escrow Funds to Pay Escrow Agent_. Escrow Agent is
authorized to, and may disburse to itself from Escrow Funds, from time to
time, the amount of any compensation and reimbursement of out-of-pocket
expenses due and payable hereunder (including without limitation any amount to
which Escrow Agent or any Indemnified Party is entitled to seek
indemnification hereunder). Escrow Agent shall notify Purchaser and the
Seller Parties of any disbursement from Escrow Funds to itself or any
Indemnified Party in respect of any compensation or reimbursement hereunder
and shall furnish Purchaser and the Seller Parties copies of related invoices
and other statements.

(c) _Security and Offset_. Each of Purchase and the Seller Parties grant
to Escrow Agent and the Indemnified Parties a security interest in, lien upon
and right of offset against Escrow Funds with respect to any compensation or
reimbursement due any of them hereunder (including any claim for
indemnification hereunder). If for any reason Escrow Funds are insufficient
to cover such compensation and reimbursement, Purchaser and the Seller Parties
shall promptly pay such amounts to Escrow Agent or any Indemnified Party upon
receipt of an itemized invoice.

 

13\. _Representations and Warranties_. Purchaser and each Seller Party each
respectively represent and warrant to Escrow Agent that (i) it has full power
and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and

 



Page 6 of 15 (inclusive of Schedules A-D)  perform its obligations hereunder, and this Agreement has been duly approved
by all necessary action and constitutes its valid and binding agreement
enforceable in accordance with its terms; and (ii) each of the applicable
persons designated on Schedule D hereto have been duly appointed to act as
authorized representatives hereunder and individually have full power and
authority to execute and deliver any Joint Written Direction, to amend,
modify or waive any provision of this Agreement and to take any and all other
actions as authorized representatives under this Agreement, provided that any
change in designation of such authorized representatives shall be provided by
written notice delivered to each party to this Agreement.

14\. _Identifying Information_. To help the government fight the funding
of terrorism and money laundering activities, Federal law requires all
financial institutions to obtain, verify, and record information that
identifies each person who opens an account. For a non-individual person such
as a business entity, charity, trust or other legal entity, Escrow Agent
requires documentation to verify its formation and existence as a legal
entity. Escrow Agent may ask to see financial statements, licenses,
identification and authorization documents from individuals claiming
authority to represent the entity or other relevant documentation. The parties
acknowledge that a portion of the identifying information set forth herein is
being requested by Escrow Agent in connection with the USA Patriot
Act, Pub.L.107-56 (the "Act"), and each agrees to provide any additional
information requested by Escrow Agent in connection with the Act or any other
legislation or regulation to which Escrow Agent is subject, in a timely
manner.

 

15\. _Consent to Jurisdiction and Venue_. In the event that any party hereto
commences a lawsuit or other proceeding relating to or arising from this
Agreement, the parties hereto agree to the personal jurisdiction by and venue
in the state and federal courts in the Borough of Manhattan, State of New York
and waive any objection to such jurisdiction or venue. The parties
hereto consent to and agree to submit to the jurisdiction of any of the
courts specified herein and agree to accept service of process to vest
personal jurisdiction over them in any of these courts.

 

16\. _Notices_. All notices, approvals, consents, requests, and other
communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be delivered by (i)
personal delivery, (ii) national overnight courier service, (iii) certified or
registered mail, return receipt requested, (iv) facsimile transmission, with
confirmed receipt, or (v) electronic mail by way of a PDF attachment thereto
of a manually executed document. Notice shall be effective upon receipt except

or to such other address as each party may designate for itself by like notice
and unless otherwise provided herein shall be deemed to have been given on
the date received.

17\. _Optional Security Procedures._ In the event funds transfer
instructions, address changes or changes in contact information are given
(other than in writing at the time of execution of this Agreement), whether in
writing, by facsimile or otherwise, Escrow Agent is authorized but shall be
under no duty to seek confirmation of such instructions or changes by
telephone call-back to the person or persons designated on Schedule D hereto,
and Escrow Agent may rely upon the confirmation of anyone purporting to be the
person or persons so designated. The persons and telephone numbers for call-
backs may be changed only in writing actually received and acknowledged by
Escrow Agent and shall be effective only after Escrow Agent has a reasonable
opportunity to act on such changes. If Escrow Agent is unable to contact any
of the designated representatives identified in Schedule D, Escrow Agent is
hereby authorized but shall be under no duty to seek confirmation of such
instructions by telephone call-back to any one or more of Purchaser or the
Seller Parties executive officers (" _Executive Officers_ "), as the case
may be, which shall include without limitation the titles of Chief Executive
Officer, President, Vice President, Treasurer, General Partner and Managing
Partner, as Escrow Agent may select. Such Executive Officer shall deliver to
Escrow Agent a fully executed incumbency certificate, and Escrow Agent may
rely upon the confirmation of anyone purporting to be any such officer.
Purchaser and the Seller Parties agree that Escrow Agent may at its option
record any telephone calls made pursuant to this Section 17\. In performing
any funds transfer Escrow Agent may rely solely upon any account numbers or
similar identifying numbers provided by Purchaser or the Seller Parties to
identify (a) the beneficiary, (b) the beneficiarys bank, or (c) an
intermediary bank. Escrow Agent may apply any of Escrow Funds for any payment
order it executes using any such identifying number, even when its use may
result in a person other than the beneficiary being paid, or the transfer of
funds to a bank other than the beneficiarys bank or an intermediary bank
designated. Purchaser and the Seller Parties acknowledge that these
optional security procedures are commercially reasonable.

18\. _Amendment, Waiver and Assignment_. None of the terms or conditions of
this Agreement may be changed, waived, modified, discharged, terminated or
varied in any manner whatsoever unless in writing duly signed by each party to
this Agreement. No course of conduct shall constitute a waiver of any of the
terms 

 



Page 8 of 15 (inclusive of Schedules A-D)  and conditions of this Agreement, unless such waiver is specified in
writing, and then only to the extent so specified. A waiver of any of the
terms and conditions of this Agreement on one occasion shall not constitute a
waiver of the other terms of this Agreement, or of such terms and conditions
on any other occasion. Except as provided in Section 9 hereof, this Agreement
may not be assigned by any party without the written consent of the other
parties.

19\. _Severability_. To the extent any provision of this Agreement is
prohibited by or invalid under applicable law, such provision shall be
ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity, without
invalidating the remainder of such provision or the remaining provisions of
this Agreement.

 

20\. _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be construed and interpreted in
accordance with the internal laws of the State of New York without giving
effect to the conflict of laws principles thereof except for Sections 5-1401
and 5-1402 of the New York General Obligations Law.

 

21\. _Entire Agreement_ _,_ _No Third Party Beneficiaries._ This Agreement
constitutes the entire agreement between the parties relating to the holding,
investment and disbursement of Escrow Funds and sets forth in their entirety

Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer
upon any other person any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever
under or by reason of this Agreement.

22\. _Execution in Counterparts, Facsimiles_. This Agreement, including
without limitation Schedule D hereto, and any Joint Written Direction or other
instruction, may be executed in two or more counterparts, which when so
executed shall constitute one and the same agreement or direction. The
delivery of copies of this Agreement and any Joint Written Instruction and
their respective signature pages by PDF or facsimile transmission shall
constitute effective execution and delivery as to the parties and may be used
in lieu of originals for all purposes.

23\. _Termination_. This Agreement shall terminate upon the distribution of
all Escrow Funds pursuant to any applicable provision of this Agreement, and
Escrow Agent shall thereafter have no further obligation or liability
whatsoever with respect to this Agreement or Escrow Funds.

 

24\. _Dealings_. Escrow Agent and any stockholder, director, officer or
employee of Escrow Agent may buy, sell, and deal in any of the securities of
Purchaser or the Seller Parties and become pecuniarily interested in any
transaction in which Purchaser or the Seller Parties may be interested, and
contract and lend money to Purchaser or the Seller Parties and otherwise act
as fully and freely as though it were not Escrow Agent under this Agreement.
Nothing herein shall preclude Escrow Agent from acting in any other capacity
for Purchaser or the Seller Parties or for any other entity.

 

25\. _Brokerage Confirmation Waiver_. Purchaser and the Seller Parties
acknowledge that to the extent regulations of the Comptroller of the Currency
or other regulatory entity grant them the right to receive brokerage
confirmations for security transactions as they occur, Purchaser and the
Seller Parties specifically waive receipt of such confirmations to the extent
permitted by law. Escrow Agent will furnish Purchaser and the Seller Parties
periodic cash transaction statements that include detail for all investment
transactions made by Escrow Agent.

 

26\. _Tax Reporting_. Escrow Agent shall have no responsibility for the tax
consequences of this Agreement and Purchaser and the Seller Parties shall
consult with independent counsel concerning any and all tax matters. Purchaser
and the Seller Parties shall provide Escrow Agent IRS Form W-9 and IRS Form
W-8, as applicable, for each payee, together with any other documentation
and information requested by Escrow Agent in connection with Escrow Agents
reporting obligations under applicable IRS regulations. If such tax
documentation is not so provided, Escrow Agent may withhold taxes as required
by the IRS. The Seller Parties and Purchaser have determined that any
interest or income on Escrow Funds shall be reported on an accrual basis and
deemed to be for the account of the Seller Parties. Purchaser and the Seller
Parties shall prepare and file all required tax filings with the IRS and any
other applicable taxing authority. Purchaser and the Seller Parties further
agree that:

(a) _Escrow Agent IRS Reporting_. Purchaser shall provide Escrow Agent with
all information requested by Escrow Agent in connection with the preparation
of all applicable Form 1099 and Form 1042-S documents with respect to all
distributions as well as in the performance of Escrow Agents reporting
obligations under the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act and Foreign
Investment in Real Property Tax Act or other applicable law or regulation.

 



Page 9 of 15 (inclusive of Schedules A-D) (b) _Withholding Requests and Indemnification_. Purchaser and the Seller
Parties jointly and severally agree to (i) assume all obligations imposed now
or hereafter by any applicable tax law or regulation with respect to payments
or performance under this Agreement, (ii) request Escrow Agent in writing with

charges, and advise Escrow Agent in writing with respect to any certifications
and governmental reporting that may be required under any applicable laws or
regulations, and (iii) indemnify and hold Escrow Agent harmless pursuant to
Section 11 hereof from any liability or obligation on account of taxes,
assessments, additions for late payment, interest, penalties, expenses and
other governmental charges that may be assessed or asserted against Escrow
Agent.

(c) _Imputed Interest_. To the extent that IRS imputed interest regulations
apply, Purchaser and the Seller Parties shall so inform Escrow Agent, provide
Escrow Agent with all imputed interest calculations and direct Escrow Agent to
disburse imputed interest amounts as Purchaser and the Seller Parties deem
appropriate. Escrow Agent shall rely solely on such provided calculations and
information and shall have no responsibility for the accuracy or completeness
of any such calculations or information.

 

27\. _WAIVER OF TRIAL BY JURY_. EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT HEREBY WAIVES ANY
RIGHT THAT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY ON ANY CLAIM, COUNTERCLAIM, SETOFF,
DEMAND, ACTION OR CAUSE OF ACTION (I) ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY RELATED TO

Investment Direction and Authorization

 

U.S. BANK NATIONAL ASSOCIATION MONEY MARKET ACCOUNT

 

AUTHORIZATION, DESCRIPTION AND TERMS

The U.S. Bank Money Market account is a U.S. Bank National Association ("U.S.
Bank") interest-bearing money market deposit account designed to meet the
needs of U.S. Banks Corporate Trust Services Escrow Group and other Corporate
Trust customers of U.S. Bank. Selection of this investment includes
authorization to place funds on deposit and invest with U.S. Bank.

U.S. Bank uses the daily balance method to calculate interest on this account
(actual/365 or 366). This method applies a daily periodic rate to the
principal balance in the account each day. Interest is accrued daily and
credited monthly to the account. Interest rates are determined at U.S. Banks
discretion, and may be tiered by customer deposit amount.

The owner of the account is U.S. Bank as agent for its trust customers. U.S.
Banks trust department performs all account deposits and withdrawals. Deposit
accounts are FDIC Insured per depositor, as determined under FDIC Regulations,
up to applicable FDIC limits.

 

AUTOMATIC AUTHORIZATION

In the absence of specific written direction to the contrary, U.S. Bank is
hereby directed to invest and reinvest proceeds and other available moneys in
the U.S. Bank Money Market Account. The U.S. Bank Money Market Account is a
permitted investment under the operative documents and this authorization is
the permanent direction for investment of the moneys until notified in writing
of alternate instructions.

Schedule of Fees for Services as Escrow Agent



      |  |  |  | 
---|---|---|---|--- 
    A. |  | Administration Fee, One-Time: |  | $2,500 
 

The one-time administration fee covers the routine duties of Escrow Agent
associated with the administration of the account. Administration fees are
payable in advance. In the event that the Agreement is not terminated within
two years, then an additional administrative fee of $1,000 shall be due for
each year or part thereof. This assumes that Escrow Agent will be directed to
invest in an automated sweep vehicle available through Escrow Agents trust
accounting system.



      |  |  |  | 
---|---|---|---|--- 
    B. |  | Disbursement Processing Fees (if any): |  | $100 per
disbursement in _excess_ of twelve disbursements per year 
 

The first twelve disbursements per year are included within the administration
fee. Disbursement processing fees after twelve disbursements per year (if
any) will billed in arrears. This includes payment by check or wire. This
assumes that Escrow Agent will receive complete and accurate payment
instructions, upon which it can conclusively rely.

 



      |  |  |  | 
---|---|---|---|--- 
    C. |  | Out-of-Pocket Expenses (if any): |  | At Cost 
 

Reimbursement of expenses associated with Escrow Agents acceptance,
administration of, or performance under the Agreement, including without
limitation fees and expenses of legal counsel, accountants and other agents,
tax preparation, reporting and filing, publications, and filing and recording
fees, will be billed at cost.

 

Extraordinary services are responses to requests, inquiries or developments,
or the carrying out of duties or responsibilities of an unusual nature,
including termination, which may or may not be provided for in the governing
documents, are not routine or undertaken in the ordinary course of business.
Payment of fees for extraordinary services is appropriate where particular
requests, inquiries or developments are unexpected, even if the possibility
of such things could have been foreseen at the inception of the transaction. A
reasonable charge will be assessed and collected based on the nature of the
extraordinary service. At our option, these charges will be billed at a flat
fee or at our hourly rate then in effect. Extraordinary services might
include, without limitation, amendments or supplements, specialized reporting,
non-routine calculations, foreign currency conversions, foreign wire
transfers, use investments not automated with the Escrow Agents trust
accounting system, and actual or threatened litigation or arbitration
proceedings.

 

 _IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT PROCEDURES FOR OPENING A NEW ACCOUNT_

 

To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering
activities, Federal law requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify
and record information that identifies each person who opens an account. For
a non-individual person such as a business entity, a charity, a trust or other
legal entity we will ask for documentation to verify its formation and
existence as a legal entity. Escrow Agent may also ask to see financial
statements, licenses, identification and authorization documents from
individuals claiming authority to represent the entity or other relevant
documentation.
