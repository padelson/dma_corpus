iii AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 

THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this _Agreement_ ) is dated as of November
18, 2015, by and among TransDigm Group Incorporated, a Delaware corporation (
_Parent_ ), Hook Acquisition Sub Inc., a Delaware corporation and an indirect
wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent ( _Merger Sub_ ), and Breeze-Eastern
Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the _Company_ ). Capitalized terms used
but not otherwise defined in this Agreement shall have the meanings set forth
in Section 9.3 and in the Sections of this Agreement indicated on Annex
B hereto.

PRELIMINARY STATEMENTS

 

 __A. It is proposed that, upon the terms and subject to the conditions of
this Agreement, Merger Sub will make a cash tender offer (the  _Offer_ ) to
purchase all of the outstanding shares of the common stock, par value $0.01
per share, of the Company (the _Company Common Stock_ ) for the Per Share
Amount (defined below), without interest. __

 

 __B. It is proposed that, upon the terms and subject to the conditions of
this Agreement and in accordance with the Delaware General Corporation Law
(the _DGCL_ ), following the consummation of the Offer, Merger Sub will merge
with and into the Company, with the Company as the surviving corporation (the
_Merger_ ), pursuant to which each share of the Company Common Stock that is
not tendered and accepted pursuant to the Offer (other than (i) shares of
Company Common Stock owned directly or indirectly by Parent, Merger Sub or the
Company or their respective wholly owned subsidiaries and (ii) any Dissenting
Shares) will be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration,
all as more fully provided below. __

C. It is proposed that the Merger shall be governed by and effected pursuant
to Section 251(h) of the DGCL and shall be effected as soon as practicable
following the consummation of the Offer and upon the terms and conditions set
forth in this Agreement.

__D. As a condition and inducement to the willingness of Parent and Merger Sub
to enter into this Agreement, concurrently with the execution and delivery of
this Agreement, certain of the Company Stockholders are entering into tender
and support agreements with Parent and Merger Sub (the _Support Agreements_ ),
in substantially the form attached as Exhibit A hereto pursuant to which,
among other things, each such stockholder has agreed to tender shares of
Company Common Stock (totaling, in the aggregate, approximately 55% of the
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock) to Merger Sub in the Offer. _ _

__E. The Board of Directors of the Company (the _Company Board_ ) has
unanimously determined the Offer and the Merger are advisable and fair to,
and in the best interests of, the Company and its stockholders (the _Company
Stockholders_ ), has approved and adopted this Agreement and the Transactions
and has resolved to recommend that the Company Stockholders accept, and
tender all of their shares of Company Common Stock into, the Offer. __ F. An authorized committee of the Board of Directors of Parent and the Board
of Directors of Merger Sub have, on the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth herein, unanimously determined the Offer and the Merger to be
advisable and fair to, and in the best interests of, their respective
stockholders, and have approved and adopted this Agreement and
the Transactions.

G. Parent will cause the sole direct stockholder of Merger Sub to approve and
adopt this Agreement by written consent immediately following its execution.

 



2 AGREEMENT

 

The parties, intending to be legally bound, agree as follows:

 

ARTICLE 1

THE OFFER 



   1.1 | The Offer 
---|--- 



   (a) | Subject to the terms and conditions herein, Merger Sub shall (and
Parent shall cause Merger Sub to) commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (together with
the rules and regulations thereunder, the _Exchange Act_ )) a cash tender
offer to purchase all of the issued and outstanding shares of the Company
Common Stock for $19.61 U.S. Dollars per share of Company Common Stock (such
amount, or any greater amount per share of Company Common Stock paid pursuant
to the offer, the _Per Share Amount_ and such offer, as it may be amended from
time to time pursuant to the terms hereof, the _Offer_ ) no later than
ten (10) Business Days after the date hereof. Subject to satisfaction or, if
permitted hereunder, waiver of the Tender Offer Conditions (as defined below)
and the terms and conditions hereof, Parent shall cause Merger Sub to
irrevocably accept for purchase, and Merger Sub shall irrevocably accept for
purchase, all shares of the Company Common Stock that have been validly
tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer as soon as practicable (and
in any event not more than the fourth (4th) Business Day) following the
Expiration Date (as defined below). Merger Sub shall not terminate the Offer
prior to any scheduled Expiration Date without the prior written consent of
the Company unless and until this Agreement is terminated in accordance with
Section 8.1. 
---|--- 



   (b) |

The obligation of Merger Sub to, and of Parent to cause Merger Sub to, accept
for purchase, purchase, and pay for any shares of Company Common
Stock tendered pursuant to the Offer (and not validly withdrawn) shall only
be subject to the satisfaction or, if permitted hereunder, waiver pursuant to
the terms hereof of (i) the condition (the _Minimum Condition_ ) that the
number of shares of Company Common Stock validly tendered and not withdrawn
prior to the Expiration Date (excluding shares of Company Common Stock
tendered pursuant to guaranteed delivery procedures that have not yet been
"received," as such term is defined in Section 251(h) of the DGCL, by the
depositary for the Offer pursuant to such procedures), when added to any
shares of Company Common Stock already owned by Parent or any of its
subsidiaries, if any, shall be at least a majority of the shares of Company
Common Stock then outstanding on a fully-diluted basis (assuming the exercise
of all options and other rights to purchase shares of Company Common Stock
regardless of exercise price, vesting schedule or other terms or conditions
thereof, but excluding any Company Stock Options the holders of which have, as
of the Acceptance Date, entered into the option cancellation agreements
described in Section 3.3(a)) and (ii) the other conditions set forth in
Annex A hereto (the conditions described in clauses (i) and (ii) are
collectively referred to as the _Tender Offer Conditions_ ). The Tender Offer 

---|--- 
 



3 and Merger Sub expressly reserves the right (but shall not be obligated) at
any time or from time to time, in its sole discretion, to amend or waive any
such condition (other than the Minimum Condition, which may not be amended or
waived), to increase the Per Share Amount payable in the Offer, and to make
any other changes in the terms and conditions of the Offer; _provided_ , that
without the prior written consent of the Company no change may be made that
decreases the Per Share Amount (except as provided in Section 1.1(h)), changes
the form of consideration payable in the Offer, imposes conditions to the
Offer in addition to the Tender Offer Conditions, decreases the number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject to the Offer, reduces the time period
during which the Offer shall remain open, or modifies, amends or supplements
the Offer or the Tender Offer Conditions in any manner adverse to the Company
Stockholders. 
---|--- 



   (c) | Upon the terms and subject to the conditions thereof, the Offer
shall remain open until at least midnight, New York City time, on the later of
(i) the twentieth (20th) Business Day (determined in accordance with Rule
14d-1(g)(3) under the Exchange Act) following commencement (determined in
accordance with Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) of the Offer and (ii) the
second (2nd) Business Day following the Solicitation Period End Date (the 
_Initial Expiration Date_ ), unless the Initial Expiration Date has been
extended pursuant to, and in accordance with, the provisions of Section 1.1(d)
or as required by Applicable Law or the interpretations of the Securities
and Exchange Commission (the _SEC_ ) (the Initial Expiration Date, or such
the later time and date on which the Initial Expiration Date has been extended
pursuant to, and in accordance with, this Agreement, the _Expiration Date_
).  
---|--- 



   (d) |

Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, except the last sentence of this Section 1.1(d), unless this
Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with Section 8.1, (i)
Merger Sub shall extend the Offer for any period required by any Applicable
Law, or any rule, regulation, interpretation or position of the SEC or its
staff or the NYSE MKT in any such case that is applicable to the Offer, and
(ii) if, on the initial Expiration Date or any subsequent date as of which the
Offer is scheduled to expire, any Tender Offer Condition is not satisfied and
has not been waived, then Merger Sub shall extend (and re-extend) the Offer
and its Expiration Date beyond the initial Expiration Date or such subsequent
date for successive extension periods of up to ten (10) Business Days each, or
for such longer period as the parties may agree, in order to permit the
satisfaction of all of the Tender Offer Conditions; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that if, at any Expiration Date the only Tender Offer Condition that is not
satisfied or waived is the Minimum Condition, then Merger Sub shall not be
required to extend the Offer for more than two subsequent extension periods
after the first such Expiration Date of ten (10) Business Days each, or for
such longer period as the parties may agree. Merger Sub may, in its sole
discretion, following the Acceptance Date, extend the Offer for a "subsequent
offering period" (and one or more extensions thereof) in accordance with Rule
14d-11 under the Exchange Act, and the Offer Documents (as defined
below) may, in Merger Subs sole 

---|--- 
 



4 , that Merger Sub shall not commence any "subsequent offering period" after
the Acceptance Date if the Merger can be effected pursuant to Section 251(h)
of the DGCL. Notwithstanding the above, in no event shall Merger Sub be
required to extend the Offer beyond the Offer Outside Date or so extend the
Offer without the consent of the Company. 
---|--- 
 



   (e) | In the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
Section 8.1, Merger Sub shall (and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to) promptly
(and in any event within one Business Day of such termination),
irrevocably and unconditionally terminate the Offer and Merger Sub shall
promptly return, and shall cause any depository acting on behalf of Merger Sub
to return, all tendered Company Common Stock to the registered holder thereof. 
---|--- 
 



   (f) | Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the
Offer, Merger Sub (or Parent on Merger Subs behalf) shall irrevocably accept
for purchase and pay for all shares of Company Common Stock validly tendered
and not withdrawn as soon as practicable after the Expiration Date (the time
and date of the acceptance for purchase, the _Acceptance Date_ ). If the Per
Share Amount (or any portion thereof) is to be paid to a person other
than the person in whose name the tendered shares of Company Common Stock not
represented by certificates ( _Book Entry Shares_ ) or certificates that,
immediately prior to the Effective Time, represented outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock (the _Certificates_ ) are registered, the amount of any
stock transfer or other similar taxes (whether imposed on the registered
holder(s), or such other person, or otherwise) payable on account of such
issuance or transfer shall be deducted from the Per Share Amount payable,
unless evidence satisfactory to Merger Sub of the payment of such taxes or
exemption therefrom is submitted. If any Certificate has been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and upon providing
an indemnity reasonably satisfactory to Parent and Merger Sub, Merger Sub will
pay the Per Share Amount deliverable in respect of the shares of
Company Common Stock that were evidenced by the lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate. No interest or dividends shall be paid or accrued on any portion
of the Per Share Amount. 
---|--- 
 



   (g) |

As promptly as practicable on the date of commencement of the Offer, Merger
Sub shall file with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO (together
with all amendments and supplements thereto, the _Schedule TO_) with respect
to the Offer. The Schedule TO shall contain or shall incorporate by reference
an offer to purchase (the _Offer to Purchase_ ), form of the related letter
of transmittal, summary advertisement and any other ancillary documents
pursuant to which the Offer will be made (the Schedule TO, the Offer to
Purchase and such other documents, together with all exhibits, supplements
and amendments thereto, being referred to herein collectively as the _Offer
Documents_ ). Merger Sub shall cause the Offer Documents to be disseminated to
Company Stockholders as and to the extent required by applicable federal
securities laws. Parent and Merger Sub shall cause the Offer Documents to
comply in all material respects with the applicable requirements of federal
securities laws. Each of Parent, Merger Sub,  

---|--- 
 



5 provided by any of them for use in the Offer Documents that shall have become
false or misleading in any material respect, and Parent and Merger Sub
further agree to use reasonable best efforts to cause the Schedule TO, as so
corrected, to be filed with the SEC, and the other Offer Documents, as so
corrected, to be disseminated to Company Stockholders, in each case in
all material respects as required by applicable federal securities laws. The
Company shall promptly furnish to Merger Sub and Parent all information
concerning the Company that is required or reasonably requested by Merger Sub
or Parent in connection with their obligations relating to the Offer
Documents or any action contemplated by this Section 1.1(g). Parent and Merger
Sub shall give the Company and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review
and comment on the Schedule TO and the Offer Documents each time before any
such document is filed with the SEC, and Parent and Merger Sub shall give
reasonable and good faith consideration to any comments made by the Company
and its counsel. In addition, Parent and Merger Sub agree to (i) provide the
Company and its counsel with any written comments Parent, Merger Sub or their
counsel may receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff with respect
to the Offer Documents promptly after the receipt of such comments, (ii)
unless there has been a Change of Recommendation, provide a reasonably
detailed description of any oral comments Parent, Merger Sub or their counsel
may receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff with respect to the
Offer Documents promptly after the receipt of such comments, and (iii) unless
there has been a Change of Recommendation, provide the Company and its counsel
a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any written response to such
comments or any proposed amendment to the Offer Documents prior to the filing
thereof with the SEC. Parent and Merger Sub shall use reasonable best efforts
to respond promptly to any such SEC comments. 
---|--- 
 



   (h) | If, between the date of this Agreement and the Acceptance Date,
the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock are changed into a different
number or class of shares by reason of any stock split, division or
subdivision of shares, stock dividend, reverse stock split, consolidation of
shares, reclassification, recapitalization or similar transaction, the Per
Share Amount applicable to such shares of Company Common Stock shall be
adjusted to the extent appropriate;  _provided_ , _however_ , that this
Section 1.1(h) shall not affect or supersede the provisions of Section 6.3(a). 
---|--- 



   1.2 | Company Action 
---|--- 



   (a) | The Company consents to and approves the Offer pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement, subject to Section 6.3(c). The Company further
consents to the inclusion in the Offer Documents of the Company
Board Recommendation. 
---|--- 



   (b) |

Promptly following the filing of the Schedule TO by Merger Sub, the Company
shall file with the SEC and disseminate to the Company Stockholders
a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 pertaining to the
Offer (together with all amendments and supplements thereto, the _Schedule
14D-9_) containing (i) except as provided in Section 6.3(c), the Company
Board 

---|--- 
 



6 required by Section 262(d)(2) of the DGCL, such that the Schedule 14D-9 will
constitute a valid notice of appraisal rights under Section 262(d)(2) of the
DGCL, and (iii) the opinion of the financial advisors referenced in Section
5.23 and a fair summary of the financial analysis conducted by such financial
advisor in accordance with all Applicable Law. The Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the Schedule 14D-9 to be filed with the SEC
on the same day as the Schedule TO shall be filed with the SEC, and in any
event cause it to be filed no later than two (2) Business Days thereafter.
The Company shall cause the Schedule 14D-9 to comply in all material respects
with the applicable requirements of the federal securities laws. The Company,
Parent and Merger Sub agree to correct promptly any information provided by
any of them for use in the Schedule 14D-9 that shall have become inaccurate or
misleading in any material respect, and the Company further agrees to use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the Schedule 14D-9, as so corrected, to be
filed with the SEC and disseminated to Company Stockholders, in each case in
all material respects as required by applicable federal securities laws;
provided that any such filing or dissemination of the corrected Schedule 14D-9
shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, waive, extend or
restart the notice period for purposes of Section 262(d)(2) of the DGCL.
Parent or Merger Sub shall promptly furnish to the Company all information
concerning Parent and Merger Sub that is required or reasonably requested by
the Company in connection with its obligations relating to the Schedule 14D-9.
The Company shall give Parent, Merger Sub, and their counsel a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on the Schedule 14D-9 each time before it
is filed with the SEC and shall give reasonable and good faith consideration
to any comments made by the Parent and Merger Sub and their counsel. In
addition, the Company agrees to (i) provide Parent, Merger Sub and their
counsel with any written comments the Company or its counsel may receive from
time to time from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9
promptly after the receipt of such comments, (ii) unless there has been a
Change of Recommendation, provide Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel a
reasonably detailed description of any oral comments the Company or its
counsel may receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff with respect
to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after the receipt of such comments, and (iii)
unless there has been a Change of Recommendation, provide Parent, Merger Sub
and their counsel reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any written
response to such comments or any proposed amendment to the Schedule 14D-9
prior to the filing thereof with the SEC. The Company shall use reasonable
best efforts to respond promptly to any such SEC comments. 
---|--- 
 



   (c) |

In connection with the Offer, the Company shall within two (2) Business Days
after the date hereof, furnish or cause to be furnished (including by
instructing its transfer agent to promptly furnish) to Merger Sub mailing
labels containing the names and addresses of all record Company Stockholders
and with security position listings of shares of Company Common Stock held in
stock depositories, each as of a recent date, together with all other
available listings and computer files containing names, addresses and security
position listings of record holders 

---|--- 
 



7 Common Stock. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to promptly
furnish or cause to be furnished to Merger Sub such additional information,
including updated listings and computer files of stockholders, mailing labels
and security position listings, and such other assistance in disseminating the
Offer Documents to Company Stockholders as Parent or Merger Sub
may reasonably request, all at Parents expense. Subject to the requirements
of Applicable Law and the rules of NYSE MKT, and except for such steps as are
necessary to disseminate the Offer Documents and any other documents necessary
to consummate the Offer or the Merger, Parent and Merger Sub shall hold in
confidence the information contained in such labels, listings and files and
shall use such information only in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including the Offer and the Merger
(collectively, the _Transactions_ ). If the Offer is terminated or if this
Agreement shall be terminated, Merger Sub and Parent will promptly deliver and
cause their Representatives to deliver to the Company or destroy (and delete
electronic copies of) all copies, summaries and extracts of such information
then in their possession or control. The term _Representatives_ means the
officers, directors, employees, partners, members, managers, agents,
advisors, subsidiaries, affiliates or representatives of a party. __ 
---|--- 



   (d) | The Company shall register (and shall instruct its transfer agent
to register) the transfer of the shares of Company Common Stock accepted for
payment by Merger Sub effective immediately after the Acceptance Date.

MERGER CONSIDERATION; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES



   3.1 | Conversion of Capital Stock 
---|--- 

At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company, or their respective stockholders:



    __(a)  | Each share of common stock of Merger Sub ( _Merger Sub Common
Stock_ ) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be converted into one validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of
common stock of the Surviving Corporation. Such newly issued shares shall
thereafter constitute all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of the
Surviving Corporation. __ 
---|--- 
 



    __(b)  | Subject to the other provisions of this Article 3, each share
of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than shares owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any direct
or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent or of the Company or held in
the treasury of the Company) shall be converted into and represent the right
to receive, and shall be exchangeable for (as provided in Section 3.2), the
Per Share Amount, without interest, in cash payable to the holder of such
share of Company Common Stock (the _Merger Consideration_ ). __ 
---|--- 



   (c) | Each share of Company Common Stock held in treasury of the
Company and each share of Company Common Stock owned by Merger Sub, Parent or
any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent or of the
Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and retired
without any conversion thereof and shall cease to exist, and no payment or
distribution shall be made and no consideration of any kind shall be delivered
in exchange therefor.  
---|--- 



   (d) | At the Effective Time, each share of Company Common Stock
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to
Section 3.1(b) shall be automatically canceled, retired and shall cease to
exist, and the holders immediately prior to the Effective Time of
Certificates and Book Entry Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect
to such Company Common Stock other than the right to receive, upon surrender
of such Book Entry Shares or Certificates in accordance with Section 3.2, the
Merger Consideration for each share of Company Common Stock held by them,
without interest. 
---|--- 



   3.2 | Payment 
---|--- 



    __(a)  |

Pursuant to an agreement (the _Disbursing Agent Agreement_ ), in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to Parent and the Company, to be entered into
prior to the Effective Time between Parent and a U.S. bank or trust company
appointed by Parent and approved in advance by the Company (such approval not
to be unreasonably withheld) (the _Disbursing Agent_ ), prior to
the Effective Time, Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall deposit, or
cause to be deposited, with the Disbursing Agent, in trust in a separate
account for the benefit of the Company Stockholders, the aggregate amount of
cash payable for the Merger  __ 

---|--- 
 



10 Section 3.1. The Disbursing Agent may invest the cash deposited with it in
such manner as Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be,
directs, provided that all of such investments be in obligations of or
guaranteed by the United States of America (collectively, _Permitted
Investments_ ), or in money market funds which are invested solely
in Permitted Investments. Any net profit resulting from, or interest or
income produced by, investment of the deposited cash shall be payable to the
Surviving Corporation. If for any reason (including losses) the funds
deposited with the Disbursing Agent are inadequate to pay the amounts to
which holders of shares shall be entitled under Section 3.2(b), Parent shall
take all steps necessary to, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
promptly deposit in trust additional cash with the Disbursing Agent
sufficient to make all payments required under this Agreement, and Parent and
the Surviving Corporation shall in any event be liable for the payment
thereof. The funds deposited with the Disbursing Agent shall not be used for
any other purpose. The Surviving Corporation shall pay all charges and
expenses, including those of the Disbursing Agent, in connection with the
exchange of shares of Company Common Stock for the Merger Consideration. Any
funds remaining with the Disbursing Agent six months after the Effective Time
shall be released and repaid by the Disbursing Agent to the Surviving
Corporation pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and any additional terms
as may be set forth in the Disbursing Agent Agreement, and such unclaimed
funds shall, subject to Applicable Laws, become the property of the Surviving
Corporation, after which time persons entitled to any part of the Merger
Consideration may look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment. __ 
---|--- 



   (b) | As soon as practicable after the Effective Time (and in any event
not later than the third (3rd) Business Day following the Effective Time),
Parent shall cause the Disbursing Agent to send to each holder
of Certificates or Book Entry Shares a notice and transmittal form advising
such holder of the effectiveness of the Merger and the procedure for
surrendering to the Disbursing Agent such Certificates or Book Entry Shares in
exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon the surrender of a Certificate or
Book Entry Share to the Disbursing Agent together with and in accordance with
a duly completed and validly executed transmittal form and such other
documents as may be required pursuant to such transmittal form, the holder of
the Certificate or Book Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor a cash amount in immediately available funds equal to (A) the number
of shares represented by such Certificate (or affidavits of loss in lieu
thereof as provided in Section 3.2(d)) or Book Entry Shares multiplied by (B)
the Merger Consideration. Upon such surrender, the Disbursing Agent will
promptly pay the Merger Consideration to the Company Stockholders.
Until surrendered, each such Certificate or Book Entry Share shall be deemed
for all purposes to evidence only the right to receive the Merger
Consideration. Any fractional interest in a share of Company Common Stock
shall be entitled to be exchanged for an amount equal to that fraction
multiplied by the Merger Consideration. 
---|--- 
 



11 delivered to a person other than the person in whose name the Certificates or
Book Entry Shares so surrendered are registered, it shall be a condition to
the payment of the Merger Consideration that the Certificates or Book Entry
Shares so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or accompanied by appropriate
stock powers or other instruments and otherwise be in proper form for
transfer, that such transfer otherwise be proper and that the person
requesting such transfer shall have paid to the Disbursing Agent any transfer
or other taxes payable by reason of the foregoing or establish to the
satisfaction of the Disbursing Agent that such taxes have been paid or are
not required to be paid. 
---|--- 



   (d) | If any Certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to
be lost, stolen or destroyed and upon providing an indemnity
reasonably satisfactory to the Surviving Corporation, the Disbursing Agent
will issue the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect to the shares of
Company Common Stock evidenced by the lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate. 
---|--- 
 



   (e) | None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or the Disbursing Agent shall be liable to any person in respect
of cash held on deposit with the Disbursing Agent or that has been released
and repaid to the Surviving Corporation in accordance with Section 3.2(a)
that is delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar law. If any Certificates or Book Entry Shares
shall not have been surrendered immediately prior to the date on which any
cash in respect of such Certificate or Book Entry Shares would otherwise
escheat or become the property of any Governmental Authority, any such cash in
respect thereof shall, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, become the
property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of any person
previously entitled thereto. 
---|--- 



   (f) | After the Effective Time, there shall be no registration of
transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of shares of Company
Common Stock that were issued immediately prior to the Effective Time, other
than transfers to reflect, in accordance with customary settlement
procedures, trades effected prior to the Effective Time. If Certificates are
presented to the Surviving Corporation for transfer following the Effective
Time, they shall be cancelled against delivery of the applicable Merger
Consideration, as provided in Section 3.1(b). 
---|--- 



   (g) | No interest or dividends shall be paid or accrued on any portion
of the Merger Consideration. 
---|--- 



   (h) | As of the Effective Time, the officers and directors of Parent
and the Surviving Corporation will be authorized to execute and deliver, in
the name and on behalf of the Company and Merger Sub, any deeds, bills of
sale, assignments or assurances and to take and do, in the name and on behalf
of the Company and Merger Sub, any other actions and things to vest, perfect
or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving Corporation any and all
right, title and interest in, to and under any of the rights, properties or
assets acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result of,
or in connection with, the Merger. 
---|--- 
 



12 ---|--- 



    __(a)  | Each option to acquire shares of Company Common Stock granted
by the Company (each, a _Company Stock Option_ ) that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not then vested
or exercisable, shall, as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, be, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub,
the Company, the holder of that Company Stock Option or any other person,
cancelled and converted into the right to receive from Parent and the
Surviving Corporation, as promptly as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time (but in any event within five (5) days after the Effective
Time), an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product of (i) the
aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company
Stock Option (assuming full vesting of such Company Stock Option), multiplied
by (ii) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the per share
exercise price under such Company Stock Option, less all applicable deductions
and withholdings required by law to be withheld in respect of such payment;
___provided_ __, that if the exercise price per share is equal to or greater
than the Merger Consideration, such Company Stock Option shall be canceled
without any cash payment being made in respect thereof. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in the event that the applicable plan, award agreement or other
terms and conditions applicable to any Company Stock Option do not permit the
cancellation and conversion of such Company Stock Option without any action by
the holder thereof as provided in this Section 3.3(a), then payment with
respect to such Company Stock Option pursuant to this Section 3.3(a) shall be
conditioned on the holder thereof entering into an option cancellation
agreement with the Company or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, in
form reasonably acceptable to Parent, agreeing to be paid the consideration
provided by this Section 3.3(a) in lieu of any other consideration that might
be claimed by any such holder, unconditionally and irrevocably waiving and
releasing all right or claim that such holder might have or assert in respect
of such consideration, and acknowledging that such Company Stock Options shall
terminate on and may not be exercised after the Effective Time. The Company
shall use reasonable best efforts to secure such option cancellation
agreements as are required by the foregoing as promptly as practicable after
the date hereof. __ 
---|--- 



    __(b)  | Each share of Company Common Stock subject to time- or
performance-based vesting conditions (each, a _Company Restricted Share_ )
__that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without
any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the holder of that
Company Restricted Share or any other person, be cancelled and converted
at the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration in
accordance with Section 3.1(b). __ 
---|--- 



   (c) | The Company (or the appropriate committee thereof) shall take any
actions necessary to effectuate the foregoing provisions of this Section 3.3
as soon as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement, and
in any event prior to the Initial Expiration Date. 
---|--- 
 



13 this Section 3.3 with respect to the Company Stock Options and the Company
Restricted Shares to all holders thereof, as applicable, as promptly
as reasonably practicable following the Effective Time, and in any event no
later than three (3) Business Days after the Effective Time. Parent shall
provide, or cause to be provided, to the Surviving Corporation sufficient
funds to make such payments to the extent that the Surviving Corporation does
not otherwise have sufficient funds to make such payments. 
---|--- 



   3.4 | Withholding Rights 
---|--- 

__Each of Merger Sub, Parent and the Surviving Corporation or the Disbursing
Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to Article 2 or Article 3 of this Agreement to any
holder of Company Common Stock, Company Stock Options or Company Restricted
Shares such amounts as are required to be deducted and withheld with respect
to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the _Code_ ), and the treasury regulations promulgated thereunder, or
any provision of state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts
are so deducted and withheld, and paid over to the appropriate Governmental
Authority, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Company Common Stock,
Company Stock Options or Company Restricted Shares in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made. __



   3.5 | Appraisal Rights 
---|--- 

Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, shares of Company
Common Stock that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and which are held by a Company Stockholder who is entitled to
demand, and properly demands, appraisal of such shares pursuant to, and who
complies in all respects with, the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL (the
_Dissenting Stockholders_ ), shall not be converted into or be exchangeable
for the right to receive the Merger Consideration (the _Dissenting Shares_ ),
but instead such holder shall be entitled to payment of the fair value of
such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the
DGCL (and from and after the Effective Time, such Dissenting Shares shall no
longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled, retired and shall
cease to exist, and such holder shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive the fair value of such Dissenting Shares
in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL), unless and
until such holder shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively
withdrawn or lost rights to appraisal under the DGCL. If any Dissenting
Stockholder shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn
or lost such right to appraisal under the DGCL, such holders shares shall
thereupon be treated as converted into and be exchangeable for the right to
receive, as of the Effective Time, the Merger Consideration for each such
share, in accordance with Section 3.1 and Section 3.2, without any interest
thereon. The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any written
demands for appraisal of any shares, attempted withdrawals of such demands 

 



14  and any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the
Company relating to stockholders rights of appraisal, and (ii) the
opportunity to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings
with respect to demands for appraisal under the DGCL. The Company shall not,
except with the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment
with respect to, or settle, or offer or agree to settle, any such demand for
payment, in respect of Dissenting Shares. Any portion of the Merger
Consideration made available to the Disbursing Agent pursuant to Section 3.2
to pay for shares for which appraisal rights have been perfected shall be
returned to Parent upon demand.

   5.23 | Opinion of Financial Advisor 
---|--- 

Prior to the execution of this Agreement, the Company Board received
and delivered to Parent a true and correct copy of the opinion of Harris
Williams and Co., the Companys financial advisor, to the effect that, as of the
date of the opinion, and subject to the assumptions, limitations, and
qualifications contained in the opinion, the per share consideration to be
received in the Offer and the Merger, taken together, is fair, from a
financial point of view to the holders of Company Common Stock (other than
Parent, Merger Sub, and their respective affiliates) and such opinion has not
been withdrawn, revoked or modified.



   5.24 | Board Recommendation; Section 251(h) Matters 
---|--- 

The Company Board, at a meeting duly called has by unanimous vote of those
directors present (who constituted 100% of the directors then in office) (i)
determined that this Agreement and the Transactions, taken together, are fair
to and in the best interests of the Company Stockholders, (ii) approved,
adopted and declared advisable this Agreement

 



40  and the Transactions, including the Merger (such approval and adoption
having been made in accordance with the DGCL), and (iii) recommended that
Company Stockholders accept the Offer and tender their shares of Company
Common Stock pursuant to the Offer (the _Company Board Recommendation_ ),
which actions have not, as of the date hereof, been subsequently rescinded,
modified, or withdrawn.

 

The Company has not opted out of Section 251(h) of the DGCL in its Certificate
of Incorporation or taken any other action to preclude the Merger from being
effected in accordance with Section 251(h) of the DGCL. The affirmative vote
of the holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of Company
Common Stock is the only vote of the holders of any class or series
of Company capital stock that, absent Section 251(h) of the DGCL, would have
been necessary under Applicable Law and the Companys Certificate of
Incorporation and Bylaws to adopt, approve or authorize this Agreement and
consummate the Merger.



   5.25 | Takeover Laws 
---|--- 

The Company Board has taken all necessary action so that no restriction
contained in any "fair price", "moratorium", "control share acquisition,"
"business combination," or other state or federal anti-takeover statute or
regulation (including Section 203 of the DGCL) is applicable to the execution
and delivery of the Merger Agreement, to the Offer, the Merger, the Support
Agreements or the Transactions. The action of the Company Board in approving
the Offer, the Merger, the Support Agreements and the Transactions is
sufficient to render inapplicable to this Agreement and the Transactions,
including the Merger, the Offer and the Support Agreements, the restrictions
on "business combinations" (as defined in Section 203 of the DGCL) as set
forth in Section 203 of the DGCL. The Company is not party to or subject to a
rights agreement, a "poison pill" or similar agreement or plan.



   5.26 | Insurance 
---|--- 

Section 5.26 of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a list of all
material insurance policies (including information on the premiums payable in
connection therewith and the scope and amount of coverage and deductibles
provided thereunder). During each of the past three calendar years, the
Company and its subsidiaries have been insured under aviation product
liability policies similar in scope and amount of coverage to those set forth
in Section 5.26 of the Company Disclosure Schedule. The Companys insurance
policies are in full force and effect in accordance with their terms, no
notice of cancellation has been received, and there is no existing default or
event which, with the giving of notice or lapse of time or both, would
constitute a default thereunder. The Company is a "named insured" or an
"insured" under such insurance policies. The policies of fire, theft,
liability and other insurance maintained with respect to the assets or
businesses of the Company provide adequate coverage against loss.

 



   5.27 | Product Warranty; FAA Service Bulletins; Air Worthiness
Directives 
---|--- 

Each product manufactured, sold, leased, or delivered by the Company or any
of its subsidiaries has been in conformity with all applicable contractual
specifications and all express and implied warranties made by the Company or
any of its subsidiaries (except to 

 



41  the extent non-conformity is not material) and neither the Company nor any
of its subsidiaries has any material liability for replacement or repair
thereof or other damages in connection therewith, except for liabilities in
the ordinary course of business consistent with past experience. The Company
and each of its subsidiaries (a) is in compliance in all material respects
with all applicable regulations, directives, advisory circulars or similar
official documents issued by the Federal Aviation Administration ( _FAA_ )
and/or foreign aviation authorities (collectively, _Aviation Regulations_ ),
(b) has not violated, been subject to an investigation with respect to, or
made voluntary disclosures with respect to potential material violations of
any Aviation Regulations, and (c) has not been cited by the FAA or foreign
aviation authorities for any material discrepancies or violations during
inspections or audits during the last three years. No party has written or
issued any FAA Service Bulletins or any other Actions as to the Company or any
of its subsidiaries or any products of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries at any time during the last three years, and no such Bulletins
or other Actions are pending. The FAA has not issued any Air Worthiness
Directives as to the Company or any of its subsidiaries or any products of the
Company or any of its subsidiaries at any time during the last three years,
and no such Directives are pending.



   5.28 | Customers 
---|--- 

Except as set forth in Section 5.28 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, none
of the ten (10) largest customers (by revenue) of the businesses of the
Company during the two (2) years prior to the date hereof has canceled or
otherwise terminated, or to the knowledge of the Company, threatened to cancel
or otherwise terminate, its relationship with the Company or any of its
subsidiaries or to decrease materially the quantity of products purchased from
the Company.



   5.29 | Affiliate Transactions 
---|--- 

No officer, director, equity holder or affiliate of the Company or any of
its subsidiaries or any entity in which any such person owns any beneficial
interest, is involved in any business arrangement with, party to any contract
with or has any material interest in any assets, tangible or intangible, used
by, the Company or any of its subsidiaries in the conduct of their respective
businesses.



   5.30 | No Other Representations and Warranties 
---|--- 

Except for the representations and warranties of the Company contained in
this Article 5, the Company is not making and has not made, and no other
person is making or has made on behalf of the Company, any express or implied
representation or warranty in connection with this Agreement or the
Transactions, and no person is authorized to make any such representation or
warranty on behalf of the Company. In connection with the due diligence
investigation of the Company by Parent and Merger Sub, Parent and Merger Sub
have received and may continue to receive from the Company certain estimates,
projections, forecasts and other forward-looking information, as well as
certain business plan information, regarding the Company, its subsidiaries and
their respective businesses and operations. Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge
that there are uncertainties inherent in attempting to make such estimates,
projections, forecasts and other forward-looking statements, as well as in
such business plans, with which Parent 

 



42  and Merger Sub are familiar, that Parent and Merger Sub are taking full
responsibility for making their own evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of
all estimates, projections, forecasts and other forward-looking information,
as well as such business plans, so furnished to them (including the
reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such estimates, projections,
forecasts, forward-looking information, business plans or cost-
related plans), and that Parent and Merger Sub will have no claim against the
Company or any of its subsidiaries, or any of their respective
Representatives, or any other person, with respect thereto. Accordingly,
Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge that none of the Company nor any of its
subsidiaries, nor any of their respective Representatives, nor any other
person, has made or is making any representation or warranty with respect to
such estimates, projections, forecasts, forward-looking statements, or
business plans (including the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying
such estimates, projections, forecasts, forward-looking statements, or
business plans).

The parties agree that:



   6.1 | Mutual Covenants 
---|--- 



   (a) | Efforts 
---|--- 



     | (i) | Upon and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, each of the parties agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and
to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things
necessary, proper or advisable under Applicable Law to consummate and make
effective, and satisfy all conditions to, in the most expeditious manner
practicable, the Transactions, including (A) the obtaining of all necessary
actions or nonactions, waivers, consents and approvals, including the Required
Regulatory Approvals, from Governmental Authorities and the making of all
necessary registrations and filings and the taking of all steps as may be
necessary to obtain an approval or waiver from, or to avoid an action or
proceeding by, any Governmental Authority, (B) the obtaining of all necessary
consents, approvals or waivers from third parties, (C) the defending of any
lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative,
challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the Transactions and (D) the
execution and delivery of any additional instruments necessary to consummate
the Transactions; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the Company
or any of its subsidiaries be required to pay prior to the Effective Time any
fee, penalty or other consideration to any third party for any consent or
approval required for the consummation of the Transactions under any contract
or agreement. 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) |

In furtherance and not in limitation of the other provisions of this Section
6.1, the Company and Parent each agree to make or cause to be made an
appropriate filing of a notification and report form pursuant to the 

---|---|--- 
 



43 practicable, and in any event, within ten (10) days after the date of this
Agreement and to supply as promptly as reasonably practicable any additional
information and documentary material that may be requested pursuant to the HSR
Act, but only in the context of an informal investigation, if applicable, and
in response to a second request under the HSR Act rules. Furthermore, each of
the Company and Parent agrees to make promptly any other filing that may be
required with respect to the Transactions under any other Competition Law or
by any other Governmental Authority, including in connection with
all Required Regulatory Approvals, and to supply as promptly as reasonably
practicable any additional information and documentary material that may be
requested pursuant to such filings. All filing fees required in connection
with any filings with any Governmental Authority under any Competition Law or
other law that may be asserted by any Governmental Authority shall be borne by
Parent. 
---|--- 



     | (iii) |

Each party shall keep the other party apprised of the status of any
communications with, and any inquiries or requests for additional
information from, any Governmental Authority, comply with any such inquiry or
request as promptly as practicable, promptly notify the other party of any
substantive oral or written communication it receives from any Governmental
Authority relating to the matters that are the subject of this Agreement,
permit the other party to review in advance any substantive communication
proposed to be made by such Party to any Governmental Authority and provide
the other party with copies of all correspondence, filings or other
communications between them or any of their Representatives, on the one hand,
and any Governmental Authority or members of its staff, on the other hand;
_provided_ , _however_ , that materials may be redacted (x) to remove
references concerning the valuation of the businesses of the Company and its
subsidiaries, or proposals from third parties with respect thereto, (y) as
necessary to comply with contractual agreements, and (z) as necessary to
address reasonable privilege or confidentiality concerns; _provided_ that
each party shall and shall cause each of its affiliates to use its respective
reasonable best efforts to allow for such access or disclosure (or as much of
it as possible) in such a manner that does not result in a loss of any such
protection or privilege. Each of the Company and Parent shall furnish to the
other party such information and assistance as such party reasonably may
request in connection with the preparation of any submissions to, or
proceedings by, any Governmental Authority. Neither Party shall agree to
participate in any meeting, or engage in any substantive conversation, with
any Governmental Authority in respect of any such filings, investigation or
other inquiry unless it consults with the other party in advance and, unless
prohibited by such Governmental Authority, gives the other party the
opportunity to attend and participate at such meeting or conversation. Neither
party shall (without the consent of the other party) extend, directly or
indirectly, any waiting period under the HSR Act or any other 

---|---|--- 
 



44 Governmental Authority to delay or not to consummate the Transactions. Subject
to the Confidentiality Agreement and to Section 5.3, the parties will
coordinate and cooperate fully with each other in exchanging such information
and providing such assistance as the other party may reasonably request in
connection with the foregoing and in seeking early termination of any
applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act or any other Competition Law. 
---|--- 



     | (iv) | Without limiting the generality of the obligations of
parties pursuant to this Section 6.1(a), Parent agrees to take, or cause to be
taken, any and all steps that it deems reasonable and to make, or cause to
be made, any and all undertakings necessary to resolve, avoid or eliminate
each and every impediment under any Competition Law or any other Law that may
be asserted by any Governmental Authority with respect to the Transactions so
as to enable the Closing to occur as promptly as practicable (and in any
event, no later than the Outside Offer Date) , provided, however, that such
steps shall not include (A) proposing, negotiating, committing to, and
effecting, by consent decree, hold separate Order, or otherwise, the sale,
divestiture, licensing or disposition of any assets, properties or businesses
of Parent, the Company and their respective subsidiaries, or (B) accepting any
operational restrictions or otherwise taking or committing to take actions
that limit Parents and/or its subsidiaries freedom of action with respect
to, or its ability to retain, any of the assets, properties, licenses, rights,
product lines, operations or businesses of Parent, the Company and/or their
respective subsidiaries, in each case, as may be required in order to avoid
the entry of, or to effect the lifting or dissolution of, any Restraint, which
would otherwise have the effect of preventing or delaying the Closing,
as applicable. In addition, Parent shall not be required to defend through
litigation on the merits any claim asserted before any Governmental Authority
with applicable jurisdiction by any party in order to avoid entry of, or to
have vacated or terminated, any Order (whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent) that would prevent the Closing from occurring on or prior to the
Outside Offer Date and Parents failure to take such actions shall not create
an obligation to pay a termination fee. 
---|---|--- 



   (b) |

Public Announcements. The initial press release regarding the execution of
this Agreement and the Transactions shall be a joint press release by Parent
and the Company. Thereafter, the parties shall consult with each other before
issuing any press release or making any public announcement relating to this
Agreement or the Transactions and, except for any press release or
public announcement (i) as may be required by Applicable Law or any listing
agreement with any national securities exchange (and then only after as much
advance notice and consultation as is feasible) or (ii) to bring or defend a
claim in connection with any dispute between the parties regarding this
Agreement or the Transactions, shall not issue any such press release or make
any such public announcement without the consent of the other parties hereto,
which shall not be unreasonably withheld or 

---|--- 
 



45 in this Section 6.1(b) will not apply to any press release or public
announcement, statement or disclosure made by the Company following, and
related to, or by Parent following, a Change of Recommendation by the Company
Board under Section 6.3(c) of this Agreement and (y) nothing in this Section
6.1(b) shall limit the ability of any party hereto to make internal
announcements to its respective employees that are consistent in all material
respects with prior public disclosures regarding the Transactions. 
---|--- 



    (c) | Notification. The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent,
and Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company, of (i) any notice or other
communication received by such party from any Governmental Authority in
connection with the Transactions or from any person alleging that the consent
of such person is or may be required in connection with the Transactions, if
the subject matter of such communication or the failure of such party to
obtain such consent could be material to the Company, the Surviving
Corporation, Parent or the consummation of the Transactions, (ii) any Actions
commenced or, to such partys knowledge, threatened against, relating to or
involving or otherwise affecting such party or any of its subsidiaries which
relate to the Transactions, (iii) the occurrence or non-occurrence of any
fact, event or circumstance known to it that is reasonably likely,
individually or taken together with all other existing facts, events and
circumstances known to it, to cause or result in any of the conditions to the
Merger set forth in Article 7 or any Tender Offer Condition not being
satisfied, and (iv) the failure of the Company or Parent, as the case may be,
to comply with or satisfy any representation or warranty, covenant, condition
or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it pursuant to this Agreement
which would reasonably be expected to result in any condition to the
obligations of any party to effect the Offer, the Merger or any other
Transaction, but the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 6.1(c)
shall not cure any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement contained in this Agreement or otherwise limit or affect the
remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such notice. 
---|--- 



   6.2 | Covenants of Parent 
---|--- 



   (a) | Indemnification; Directors and Officers Insurance. 
---|--- 



     | (i) |

From the Acceptance Date until its sixth anniversary, the Surviving
Corporation will, and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to, fulfill
and honor in all respects the obligations of the Company pursuant to the
indemnification, exculpation or expense advancement agreements between the
Company and its respective current or past directors, officers, employees or
agents as of the Acceptance Date identified on Section 6.2(a) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule (the _Company Indemnified Parties_ ) and any
indemnification, exculpation or expense advancement provisions under the
Companys Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws as in effect on the date of
this Agreement and such agreements shall be assumed by the Surviving
Corporation in the Merger, without further action, at the Effective Time and
shall survive the Merger and shall  

---|---|--- 
 



46 terms, and, in the event that any proceeding is pending or asserted or any
claim made during such period, until the final disposition of such proceeding
or claim. For a period of six years from the Effective Time, the Certificate
of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation will contain
provisions with respect to exculpation, indemnification and advancement of
expenses that are at least as favorable to the Company Indemnified Parties as
those contained in the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Company
as in effect on the date of this Agreement, which provisions will not be
amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely
affect the rights thereunder of individuals who, immediately prior to the
Effective Time, were directors, officers, employees or agents of Company,
unless such modification is required by Applicable Law; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if, at any time prior to the sixth anniversary of the
Effective Time, any Company Indemnified Party delivers to Parent a written
notice asserting a claim for indemnification under this Section 6.2(a), the
claim asserted in such notice shall survive the sixth anniversary of the
Effective Time until such time as the claim is fully and finally resolved. 
---|--- 
 



     | (ii) | From the Effective Time and until its sixth anniversary,
the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to maintain in effect, for the benefit of the current or past
directors and officers of the Company with respect to acts or omissions
occurring prior to or at the Effective Time (including in connection with the
Transactions), the existing policy of directors and officers liability
insurance maintained by the Company as of the date of this Agreement (the
_Existing Policy_ ) or a substitute policy or policies of comparable or better
coverage with respect to both amount, the absence of exclusions and other
terms and conditions; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the Surviving
Corporation shall not be required to expend an annual premium for any coverage
pursuant to this Section 6.2(a)(ii) in excess of 300% of the last annual
premium paid by the Company for the Existing Policy prior to the date hereof.
If the Existing Policy or any substitute policy or policies pursuant to this
Section 6.2(a)(ii) cannot be obtained within the cost limitation set forth in
the immediately preceding sentence, the Surviving Corporation shall provide
the best available coverage within such limitation. The obligations set forth
in this Section 6.2(a)(ii) may be satisfied by the purchase by the Company
prior to the Effective Time of a substitute or tail policy that is acceptable
to Parent and purchased through a source designated or approved by Parent. 
---|---|--- 



     | (iii) | Parent and the Surviving Corporation jointly and severally
agree to pay all expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees, that may be
incurred by any Company Indemnified Party in enforcing the indemnity and
other obligations of Parent and Surviving Corporation provided for in this
Section 6.2(a). 
---|---|--- 
 



47 successors or assigns shall (A) consolidate with or merge with any other
person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger, or (B) transfer all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any person, then, and in each case, proper provisions
shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the surviving corporation
shall assume all the obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation set
forth in this Section 6.2(a). This Section 6.2(a) shall survive the
consummation of the Merger at the Effective Time, is intended to be for the
benefit of, and enforceable by, each person entitled to indemnification
pursuant to this Section 6.2(a) and each such persons or entitys heirs and
representatives, and shall be binding on all successors and assigns of Parent
and the Surviving Corporation.  
---|---|--- 



   (b) | Merger Sub; Obligations of Merger Sub. Prior to the Acceptance
Date, Merger Sub shall not conduct any business or make any investments other
than as specifically contemplated by this Agreement and will not have any
assets (other than a _de minimis_ amount of cash paid to Merger Sub for the
issuance of its stock to Parent) or any material liabilities. Parent shall
cause Merger Sub to perform its obligations under this Agreement and to
consummate the Transactions on the terms and conditions set forth in this
Agreement. Immediately following the execution of this Agreement, Parent shall
cause the direct stockholder of Merger Sub to execute and deliver in its
capacity as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub, a written consent adopting
this Agreement. 
---|--- 



   (c) | Employees and Employee Benefits. 
---|--- 



     | (i) | During the period commencing on the Effective Time and
ending on December 31, 2016 (or if earlier, the date of the employees
termination of employment with Parent or any of its subsidiaries), Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide each employee of the Company
who remains employed by the Surviving Corporation after the Closing (each such
employee, a _Company Continuing Employee_ ), with base salary not less than
the base salary provided by the Company on the date of this Agreement. During
the period commencing on the Effective Time and ending on December 31, 2016
(or if earlier, the date of the employees termination of employment with
Buyer or any of its subsidiaries), Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to provide the Company Continuing Employees with employee health
and welfare benefits (but not cash or equity incentive compensation) that are,
in the aggregate, comparable to the employee health and welfare benefits (i)
provided by the Company on the date of this Agreement or (ii) provided by
Parent and its subsidiaries to its similarly situated employees on the date of
this Agreement; provided, however, the health and welfare benefits provided
to Company Continuing Employees subject to a collective bargaining agreement
shall be subject to the terms of that agreement or any amendment thereof. The
Company Continuing Employees covered by this provision will remain at-will
employees, subject to the terms of any applicable collective bargaining
agreement. 
---|---|--- 
 



48 in Section 3(3) of ERISA or other similar plan, program or arrangement
maintained by Parent or any of its subsidiaries, excluding both any
defined benefit pension plans maintained by Parent or any of its subsidiaries
and any equity compensation arrangements maintained by Parent or any of its
subsidiaries (collectively, _Parent Benefit Plans_ ) in which any Company
Continuing Employee will participate effective as of the Effective Time,
Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, recognize all
service of the Company Continuing Employees with the Company or any of its
subsidiaries, as the case may be, as if such service were with Parent, for
all purposes of such Parent Benefit Plan (including, but not limited to,
eligibility, vesting and level of benefits); _provided_ , that such service
shall not be recognized to the extent that (A) such recognition would result
in a duplication of benefits or (B) such service was not recognized under the
corresponding Plan. 
---|---|--- 



     | (iii) | Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to waive, or
cause to be waived, any pre-existing condition limitations, exclusions,
actively-at-work requirements and waiting periods under any Parent Benefit
Plan in which the Company Continuing Employees (and their eligible
dependents) are eligible to participate from and after the Effective Time,
except to the extent that such pre-existing condition limitations, exclusions,
actively-at-work requirements and waiting periods would not have been
satisfied or waived under the comparable plan of the Company in which the
Company Continuing Employees participated. If a Company Continuing Employee
commences participation in any health benefit plan of Parent or any of its
subsidiaries after the commencement of a calendar year, Parent shall cause
such plan to recognize the dollar amount of all co-payments, deductibles and
similar expenses incurred by such Company Continuing Employee (and his or her
eligible dependents) during such calendar year for purposes of satisfying
such calendar years deductible and co-payment limitations under the relevant
welfare benefit plans in which such Company Continuing Employee (and
dependents) commences participation. 
---|---|--- 



     | (iv) |

Following the Effective Time, with respect to outstanding incentive
compensation accrued by the Company for the fiscal year ending March 31,
2016 and disclosed to Parent, Parent shall cause each Company Continuing
Employee to continue to be eligible to receive payment of such incentive
compensation under the applicable plan for such fiscal year in accordance with
the terms and conditions of such plan as in effect on the Effective Time. In
the event that the employment of a Company Continuing Employee is terminated
by the Company without "cause" (as such term is defined in the Companys 2012
Incentive Compensation Plan) on or after the Effective Time, but prior to the
payment of such incentive compensation, such Company Continuing Employee shall 

---|---|--- 
 



49 shall be pro-rated to the extent such termination occurs prior to March 31,
2016) based on actual results for such fiscal year. Any pro ration shall be
calculated by multiplying such Company Continuing Employees bonus entitlement
for the full fiscal year ending March 31, 2016 had such termination not
otherwise occurred by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of
days that has elapsed between the beginning of such fiscal year and the
applicable termination date, and the denominator of which is the total number
of days in such fiscal year. Incentive compensation paid pursuant to
this Section 6.2(c)(iv) shall be paid at the same time and in the same form
as such incentive compensation is paid in the ordinary course of business to
all other participants under the applicable plan, without regard to any
otherwise applicable continued service requirement. 
---|--- 



     | (v) | This Section 6.2(c) shall be binding upon and inure solely
to the benefit of each of the parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this
Section 6.2(c), express or implied, shall confer upon any other person any
rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Section
6.2(c). Nothing contained herein, express or implied (i) shall be construed to
establish, amend or modify any benefit plan, program, agreement
or arrangement or (ii) shall alter or limit the ability of the Surviving
Corporation, Parent or any of their respective affiliates to amend, modify or
terminate any benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement at any time
assumed, established, sponsored or maintained by any of them. The parties
hereto acknowledge and agree that the terms set forth in this Section 6.2(c)
shall not create any right in any Company employee or any other person to any
continued employment with the Surviving Corporation, Parent or any of their
respective subsidiaries or compensation or benefits of any nature or kind
whatsoever. 
---|---|--- 



   6.3 | Covenants of the Company 
---|--- 



   (a) |

Conduct of the Companys Operations. Between the date of this Agreement and
the Effective Time or the date, if any, on which this Agreement is earlier
terminated pursuant to Section 8.1 (the _Termination Date_ ), except as
required by Applicable Law, as otherwise expressly contemplated or permitted
by this Agreement, as set forth in Section 6.3(a) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule or with the prior written consent of Parent, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, the Company shall conduct
its operations in the ordinary course and shall use its reasonable
best efforts to maintain and preserve its business organization and its
material assets, rights and franchises and to retain the services of its
officers and key employees and maintain its advantageous business
relationships with customers, suppliers, lessees, licensees and other third
parties. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company shall
not, except as required by Applicable Law, as otherwise expressly contemplated
or permitted by this Agreement or as set forth in Section 6.3(a) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, without the prior written consent of Parent,
which consent 

---|--- 
 



50 (the parties acknowledging that any act or transaction referred to in the
definition of "Acquisition Proposal" in Section 6.3(c) will be governed by
Section 6.3(c) and not this Section 6.3(a)): 
---|--- 



     | (i) | do or effect any of the following actions with respect to
its securities: (A) adjust, split, combine or reclassify its capital stock,
(B) other than dividends or distributions by a direct or indirect
wholly owned subsidiary of the Company to its parent, make, declare or pay
any dividend or distribution on, or directly or indirectly redeem, purchase or
otherwise acquire, any shares of its capital stock or any securities or
obligations convertible into or exchangeable for any shares of its capital
stock (except for acquisitions, or deemed acquisitions, of Company Common
Stock or other equity securities of the Company in connection with (x) the
payment of the exercise price of Company Stock Options with Company Common
Stock (including in connection with "net exercises"); (y) required tax
withholding in connection with the exercise of Company Stock Options and the
vesting of Company Restricted Shares, and other awards pursuant to the Plans;
and (z) forfeitures of Company Stock Options and Company Restricted Shares,
pursuant to their terms as in effect on the date of this Agreement, (C) grant
any person any right or option to acquire any shares of its capital stock or
modify the exercise price or vesting period of any Company Stock Options or
Company Restricted Shares, (D) issue, deliver or sell or agree to issue,
deliver or sell any additional shares of its capital stock or any
securities or obligations convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for
any shares of its capital stock or such securities (except pursuant to the
exercise of the Company Stock Options and the vesting or delivery of Company
Restricted Shares that, in each case, are outstanding as of the date hereof),
or (E) enter into any agreement, understanding or arrangement with respect to
the sale, voting, registration or repurchase of its capital stock;

any material substantive respect than those contained in the Confidentiality
Agreement.

_Acquisition Proposal_ means any proposal, offer or indication of
interest made by any person or group of persons (other than Parent, Merger
Sub or an affiliate thereof), including any proposal, offer or indication of
interest to the Company Stockholders, relating to, or that would reasonably be
expected to lead to, in one transaction or a series of related transactions,
(i) any merger, consolidation, share exchange for more than 25% (in number or
voting power) of any class of equity securities of the Company, business
combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or other similar
transaction (including any so-called merger-of-equals and whether or not the
Company is the entity surviving any such transaction) involving the Company or
any of its subsidiaries; (ii) any sale, lease, license, exchange, transfer or
other disposition of assets (including equity securities of any subsidiary) or
businesses that constitute more than 25% of the revenues, net income or assets
of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole; (iii) any sale,
issuance, exchange, transfer or other disposition in which the Company or any
of its subsidiaries participates and which results in any person beneficially
owning more than 25% (in number or voting power) of any class of equity
securities or other capital stock of the Company or of any of its
subsidiaries; or (iv) any transaction, including a tender offer or exchange
offer, that, if consummated, would result in any person, together with all

power) of any outstanding class of equity securities or other capital stock of
the Company or of any of its subsidiaries.

 

 _Superior Proposal_ means an Acquisition Proposal (provided, that for
purposes of the definition of Superior Proposal references to "25%" shall be
deemed to be references to "50%") which the Company Board (A) determines in
its good faith, after consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel
and financial advisor, to be more favorable to the Company Stockholders from
a financial point of view than the Offer and Merger, taking into account all
relevant factors (including, among other things,

 



54  expected timing, risk of consummation, all terms and conditions, and any
proposed changes to this Agreement that may be proposed by the Parent in a
binding written offer in response to such Acquisition Proposal).

_Excluded Party_ means any person or group of related persons from whom the
Company has received, prior to the Solicitation Period End Date, a written
Acquisition Proposal that the Board of Directors of the Company reasonably
determines in good faith, after consultation with the Companys outside legal
counsel and financial advisor (such determination to be made no later than
two (2) Business Days prior to the Solicitation Period End Date), is or could
reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal; _provided_ that any
such person or group of related persons shall cease to be an "Excluded Party"
if such person or group of related persons ceases to be engaged in active
discussions with the Company concerning such Acquisition Proposal or if such
person or group of related persons ceases to represent at least 50% of the
equity financing of the group of persons continuing to engage in active
discussions with the Company concerning such Acquisition Proposal.

 

 _Intervening Event_ means a material event or circumstance relating to the
business, results of operations, assets or financial condition of the Company
or its subsidiaries that is unknown to and not reasonably foreseeable by the
Company Board as of the date hereof and which event or circumstance occurs or
arises after the date hereof and becomes known to the Company Board prior to
the Acceptance Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the
receipt, existence or terms of an Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry relating
thereto or to the consequences thereof constitute an Intervening Event.

 



     | (ii) |

During the period beginning on the date of this Agreement and continuing until
11:59 p.m. (New York City time) on the day that is forty (40) days after the

its Representatives shall be permitted to, and shall have the right to,
directly or indirectly, (A) solicit, initiate or encourage any inquiry with
respect to, or the making, submission or announcement of, any Acquisition
Proposal, (B) participate in discussions or negotiations regarding, and
furnish to any person information (including non-public information and data)
with respect to, and take any other action to facilitate any inquiries or the
making of any proposal that constitutes, or may lead to, an Acquisition
Proposal (provided that the person has executed an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement and that the Company promptly (and in any event within forty-eight
(48) hours) provides Parent with any material non-public information about the
Company that is provided to any such person to the extent such information has
not previously been provided to Parent), and (C) subject to Section
6.3(c)(vi) hereof, authorize, adopt, approve, recommend, or otherwise declare
advisable or propose to authorize, adopt, approve, recommend or declare
advisable (publicly or otherwise) any Superior Proposal. Parent and its 

---|---|--- 
 



55 discourage, interfere with or participate in discussions with, any person
that, to Parents knowledge, has made, or is considering or participating in
discussions or negotiations with the Company or its Representatives regarding
an Acquisition Proposal. No later than 12:00 noon (New York City time) on the
Business Day immediately following the Solicitation Period End Date,
the Company shall identify each Excluded Party and, along with such notice,
provide Parent with a copy of the Acquisition Proposal submitted by such
person on the basis of which the Company Board made the determination that
such person shall be an Excluded Party. 
---|--- 



     | (iii) | Subject to Sections 6.3(c)(iv)-(vi) below, and except as
it may relate to an Excluded Party, (A) on the Solicitation Period End Date,
the Company shall, and shall direct its Representatives to, immediately cease
any discussions or negotiations with any parties that may be ongoing with
respect to any Acquisition Proposal and (B) during the period beginning on the
Solicitation Period End Date and continuing until the Effective Time or, if
earlier, the Termination Date, the Company agrees that it and its
Representatives shall not, directly or indirectly, (1) solicit, initiate or
knowingly facilitate or encourage any inquiry with respect to, or the making,
submission or announcement of, any Acquisition Proposal, (2) participate in
any negotiations regarding an Acquisition Proposal with, or furnish any non-
public information or access to its properties, books, records or personnel
to, any person that has made or, to the Companys knowledge, is considering
making an Acquisition Proposal, (3) engage in discussions regarding an
Acquisition Proposal with any person that has made or, to the Companys

approve, endorse, or recommend any Acquisition Proposal, (5) enter into any
letter of intent or agreement in principle or any agreement providing for any
Acquisition Proposal, (6) otherwise cooperate with, or assist or participate
in, or knowingly facilitate or encourage any effort or attempt by any person
(other than Parent, Merger Sub or their Representatives) with respect to, or
which would reasonably be expected to result in, an Acquisition Proposal, or
(7) exempt any person from the restrictions contained in any state takeover or
similar laws. Notwithstanding the commencement of the obligations of the
Company under this Section 6.3(c)(iii), the Company may continue to engage in
activities permitted in Section 6.3(c)(ii) with respect to an Excluded Party
until the Acceptance Date, including with respect to any amended or revised
proposal submitted by such Excluded Party. 
---|---|--- 



     | (iv) |

Notwithstanding the limitations set forth in Section 6.3(c)(iii), at any time
from the Solicitation Period End Date and continuing until the earlier of the
Acceptance Date and the Termination Date, if the Company receives an
unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal which (A) does not 

---|---|--- 
 



56 pursuant to Section 6.3(c), (B) which (i) constitutes a Superior Proposal or
(ii) the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with the
Companys outside legal counsel and financial advisor, would reasonably be
expected to result in a Superior Proposal and (C) the Company Board determines
in good faith, after consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel,
that the failure of the Company Board to take the actions set forth in clauses
(x) and (y) below with respect to such Acquisition Proposal would be
reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the directors exercise of their
fiduciary obligations to the Company Stockholders under Applicable Law, then
the Company may take the following actions: (x) furnish non-public information
to the person making such Acquisition Proposal (provided that the person has
executed an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement and that the Company promptly
provides Parent with any material non-public information about the Company
that is provided to any such person to the extent such information has not
previously been provided to Parent) and (y) engage in discussions or
negotiations with such person with respect to such Acquisition Proposal. Prior
to taking any of the actions described in the foregoing clauses (x) and (y),
the Company shall give written notice to Parent of any such determination by
the Companys Board, which notice shall describe in reasonable detail the
basis for such determination; _provided_ that this Section 6.3(a)(iv)
shall not apply to Acquisition Proposals (or amendments or modifications
thereto) made by Excluded Parties, which are governed by Section 6.3(a)(ii). 
---|--- 



     | (v) | Other than in accordance with this Section 6.3(c)(v) and
Section 6.3(c)(vi), the Company Board shall not: (A) withdraw, modify, amend
or qualify, or propose publicly to withdraw, modify, amend or qualify in a
manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, the Company Board Recommendation; (B)
approve, adopt or recommend any Acquisition Proposal or enter into any
agreement (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement) with respect
thereto; (C) exempt any person from the restrictions contained in any state
takeover or similar laws; or (D) fail to include the Company Board
Recommendation in the Schedule 14D-9 or to permit Parent to include the
Company Board Recommendation in the Offer Documents (each of the foregoing, a
_Change of Recommendation_ ). Notwithstanding the foregoing, other than in
connection with an Acquisition Proposal (which is covered by Section
6.3(c)(vi) hereof), the Company Board may, in response to an Intervening
Event, at any time prior to the Acceptance Date, make a Change of
Recommendation if the Company Board has concluded in good faith, after
consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel, that the failure of
the Company Board to effect a Change of Recommendation would be inconsistent
with the directors fiduciary obligations to the Company Stockholders under
Applicable Law; _provided_ , that the Company provides Parent written notice
at least forty-eight (48) hours in advance of the Change of Recommendation
advising Parent that it intends to take such action and specifying the
Intervening Event in reasonable detail.  
---|---|--- 
 



57 contrary, in response to the receipt of a Superior Proposal that has not been
withdrawn or abandoned and that has not resulted from a material breach of
the Companys obligations under this Section 6.3, the Company Board may, at
any time prior to the Acceptance Date, (x) make a Change of Recommendation if
the Company Board has concluded in good faith, after consultation with
the Companys outside legal counsel, that the failure of the Company Board to
effect a Change of Recommendation would be inconsistent with the directors
exercise of their fiduciary obligations to the Company Stockholders under
Applicable Law and/or (y) terminate this Agreement to enter into a definitive
agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal; _provided_ , ___however_ ,
that the Company shall not terminate this Agreement pursuant to the
foregoing clause (y) unless concurrently with such termination, the Company
pays the Termination Fee (defined below) in full; and _provided_ , _further_ ,
that the Company Board shall not take any of the foregoing actions unless:  
---|---|--- 



     | (A) | the Company shall have provided prior written notice to
Parent of its intention to take such action, at least seventy-two (72) hours
in advance of taking such action with respect to such Superior Proposal (the 
_Notice Period_ ), which notice shall specify the identity of the party making
such Superior Proposal and the material terms and conditions thereof; 
---|---|--- 



     | (B) | after providing such notice and prior to effecting any such
actions, the Company shall, during the Notice Period, negotiate with Parent or
its Representatives in good faith (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate)
to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement as
would permit the Company not to effect a Change of Recommendation or would
cause the Acquisition Proposal no longer to be a Superior Proposal, as
reasonably determined by the Company Board, and make the Companys
Representatives available for such negotiations; and 
---|---|--- 



     | (C) | the Company Board shall have considered in good faith any
changes to this Agreement offered in writing by Parent in a manner that would
form a binding contract if accepted by the Company and shall have determined
in good faith, after consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel
and financial advisor, that the Superior Proposal would continue to constitute
a Superior Proposal if such changes were to be given effect. 
---|---|--- 
 

In the event of any amendment to the financial terms or any other material
revision to the Superior Proposal, the Company shall be required to deliver a
new written notice to Parent and to again comply with the requirements

 



58  of this Section 6.3(c)(vi) with respect to such new written notice, except
that the Notice Period shall be reduced to forty-eight (48) hours (rather than
the seventy-two (72) hours otherwise contemplated by this Section
6.3(c)(vi)).



     | (vii) | No Change of Recommendation shall change the approval of
the Company Board for purposes of causing any state takeover statute or other
state law to be inapplicable to the Transactions. However, after the
Termination Date, the state takeover statutes will apply to any offer, stock
purchase or other action by Parent that triggers those measures. 
---|---|--- 



     | (viii) | After the Solicitation Period End Date, the Company shall
promptly (and, in any event, within one (1) business day) notify Parent of any
Acquisition Proposal or any request for non-public information relating
to the Company or any of its subsidiaries in connection with an Acquisition
Proposal. That notice shall indicate the material terms and conditions of the
Acquisition Proposal and thereafter the Company shall keep Parent reasonably
informed, on a current basis, of the status and terms of any such Acquisition
Proposal or material changes thereto. 
---|---|--- 



     | (ix) | Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the
Company or the Company Board from complying with its disclosure obligations
with respect to an Acquisition Proposal (including making any disclosure to
its stockholders if the Company Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with the its outside legal counsel, that the failure of the
Company Board to make such disclosure would be reasonably likely to be
inconsistent with the directors exercise of their fiduciary obligations to
the Company Stockholders under Applicable Law or under its obligations under
federal securities laws or the NYSE MKT) or from taking or disclosing to its
stockholders a position contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated
under the Exchange Act. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary except for the next sentence of this Section 6.3(c)(ix), disclosure
that the Company Board has determined that any person or group is an Excluded
Party and information related to the Acquisition Proposal of such person or
group (including the identity of the person or group and the terms and
conditions of such Acquisition Proposal) shall not be deemed to be a Change of
Recommendation if made prior to the Acceptance Date. Any of the foregoing
disclosure other than (i) a factually accurate statement by the Company that
only describes the Companys receipt of an Acquisition Proposal, the identity
of the person or group making such proposal, the terms and conditions
thereof, and the operation of this Agreement with respect thereto and contains
a "stop, look, and listen" communication of the type contemplated by Rule
14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act, (ii) an express rejection of any applicable
Acquisition Proposal, or (iii) an express reaffirmation of the Company Board
Recommendation shall be deemed to be a Change of Recommendation. 
---|---|--- 
 



59 Company shall provide Parent an opportunity to participate in, but not
control, the defense or settlement of (which shall include the right to review
and to propose comments to all material filings or responses to be made by
the Company in connection with) any stockholder litigation against the Company
and its directors relating to any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the Merger, and the Company shall give reasonable and
good faith consideration to any comments proposed by Parent to any material
filings or responses made in connection with such litigation. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in no event shall the Company
enter into, agree to or disclose any full or partial settlement with respect
to such stockholder litigation without Parents consent, such consent not to
be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. Each of Parent and the
Company shall notify the other promptly of the commencement of any such
stockholder litigation of which it has received notice and keep the other
party reasonably informed with respect to the status of any such stockholder
litigation.  
---|--- 



   (e) | Compensation Arrangements. Prior to the Acceptance Date, the
Company (acting through the compensation committee of the Company Board) shall
take all such steps as may be required to cause each agreement, arrangement
or understanding entered into by the Company or a subsidiary of the Company on
or after the date hereof with any of its officers, directors or employees
pursuant to which consideration is paid to such officer, director or employee
to be approved as an "employment compensation, severance or other employee
benefit arrangement" within the meaning of Rule 14d-10(d)(1) under the
Exchange Act and to satisfy the requirements of the non-exclusive safe harbor
set forth in Rule 14d-10(d) under the Exchange Act. 
---|--- 



   (f) | Access. The Company shall permit Parent and its Representatives
to have appropriate access at all reasonable times and upon reasonable advance
notice to the Companys premises, properties, books, records, contracts,
documents, customers and suppliers as Parent may reasonably request (in each
case, in a manner so as to not interfere in any material respect with the
normal business operations of the Company or any of its subsidiaries);
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that the Company shall not be required to permit
such access or make such disclosure, to the extent it determines, after
consultation with outside counsel, that such disclosure or access would
reasonably be likely to violate any Applicable Law. Parent will keep the
information obtained pursuant to this Section 6.3(f) or in connection with
this Agreement confidential in accordance with the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement. 
---|--- 
 



   (g) | Stock Exchange De-Listing. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company
shall cooperate with Parent and use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause
to be taken, all actions, and do or cause to be done all things, reasonably
necessary, proper or advisable on its part under Applicable Law and rules and
policies of the NYSE MKT to enable the delisting by the Surviving Corporation
of the Company Common Stock from the NYSE MKT and the deregistration of
the Company Common Stock under the Exchange Act as promptly as practicable
after the Effective Time. 
---|--- 
 



60 may approve, in accordance with the procedures set forth in Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act, any dispositions of equity securities of
the Company (including derivative securities with respect to equity securities
of the Company) resulting from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
by each officer or director of the Company who is subject to Section 16 of
the Exchange Act with respect to equity securities of the Company.

be references to "50%". 
---|--- 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in the event that
the Termination Fee becomes payable pursuant to this Section 8.3 and is paid
in accordance with this Agreement, the receipt of such fee shall be deemed to
be the exclusive remedy for any breach and any and all losses or damages
suffered or incurred by Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective
Representatives in connection with this Agreement (and the termination or
breach hereof), the Transactions (and the abandonment thereof) or any matter
forming the basis for such termination, and none of the Parent, Merger Sub,
any of their respective Representatives or any other person shall be entitled
to bring or maintain any other claim, action or proceeding against the
Company, its affiliates and its and their respective Representatives arising
out of this Agreement, any of the Transactions or any matters forming the
basis for such termination, whether for damages or specific performance of
this Agreement. In no event will the Company be required to pay the
Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

Agreement, this Agreement may be amended by the parties at any time prior to

allowed, (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or
other acts of such party, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations
and warranties contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto,
and (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions (except for
the Minimum Condition) contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a party

written instrument signed on behalf of such party. Any delay in exercising any
right under this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right. The
conditions to each of the parties obligations to consummate the Transactions
are for the sole benefit of such party and may be waived by such party in
whole or in part to the extent permitted by Applicable Law.

---|--- 

This Agreement, and all claims or causes of action (whether at law, in
contract or in tort) that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to this

other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any
jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.

 



   9.9 | Consent to Jurisdiction; Venue. 
---|--- 



   (a) | Each of the parties irrevocably submits to the exclusive
jurisdiction and venue of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and

Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware declines to accept jurisdiction
over a particular matter, any state or federal court within the State of
Delaware) for the purpose of any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or the Transactions and irrevocably waives, to the
fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, and covenants not to assert or
plead any objection it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any
suit, action, or proceeding in any such court or that any such suit, action
or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient
forum. Each of the parties agrees that a final judgment in any action or
proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by
suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law. 
---|--- 



   (b) | Each of the parties irrevocably consents to the service of any
summons and complaint and any other process in any other action or proceeding

---|--- 
 



   9.10 | Waiver of Jury Trial

ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT HEREOF.

 



69 ---|--- 

Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations
hereunder shall be assigned, delegated or otherwise transferred by any of the
parties hereto (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior

be enforceable by the parties and their respective successors and assigns.



   9.12 | Expenses 
---|--- 

All costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
Transactions shall be paid by the party incurring such expenses.



   9.13 | Severability 
---|--- 

If any term, provision, covenant or restriction of this Agreement is held by a
court of competent jurisdiction or other Governmental Authority to be
invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms, provisions,
covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and
effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated so long as
the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not
affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such a
determination, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this
Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as
possible in an acceptable manner in order that the Transactions be consummated
as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

 



   9.14 | Specific Performance 
---|--- 

The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur and that the parties
would not have any adequate remedy at law in the event that any of the
provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the
parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent or
restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in any agreed court,
without proof of actual damages (and each party hereby waives any requirement
for the securing or posting of any bond or other security in connection
therewith), specific performance being in addition to any other remedy to
which the parties are entitled in accordance with this Agreement. The
Company, on the one hand, and Parent and the Merger Sub, on the other hand
hereby agree not to raise any objections to the availability of the equitable
remedy of specific performance to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened
breaches of this Agreement by such party (or parties) or to specifically
enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches or
threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and
obligations of such party (or parties) under this Agreement.

specified period of time, which need only be true and correct as of such date
or with respect to such period), except, in each case, where the failure of
such other representations and warranties to be true and correct, individually
or in the aggregate, has not had a Material Adverse Effect; 
---|--- 



   (e) | the Company shall have breached in any material respect any

_provided_ that nothing herein shall relieve any party from any obligation or
liability such party has under the Agreement; ___provided_ , further, that the
Minimum Condition may not be waived. The failure by Parent or Merger Sub at
any time to exercise any of the foregoing rights shall not be deemed a waiver
of any such right; the waiver of any such right with respect to particular
facts and other circumstances shall not be deemed a waiver with respect to any
other facts and circumstances; and each such right shall be deemed an ongoing
right that may be asserted at any time and from time to time.

TENDER AND SUPPORT AGREEMENT

 

This TENDER AND SUPPORT AGREEMENT, dated as of November , 2015 (this "
_Agreement_ "), is among TransDigm Group Incorporated, a Delaware corporation
(" _Parent_ "), Hook Acquisition Sub Inc., a Delaware corporation and an
indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "), and the
undersigned stockholders of Breeze-Eastern Corporation, a Delaware
corporation (the " _Company_ ") set forth on _Schedule I_ attached hereto
(each a, " _Stockholder_ " and together, the " _Stockholders_ ").

 

WHEREAS, each Stockholder beneficially owns (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under
the Exchange Act) the number of shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per
share, of the Company (" _Company Common Stock_ ") set forth opposite such
Stockholders name on _Schedule I_ hereto;

 

WHEREAS, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company propose to enter into an Agreement
and Plan of Merger, dated as of the date hereof (as the same may be amended
or supplemented from time to time, the " _Merger Agreement_ "), to provide for
(i) the making of a cash tender offer (such cash tender offer, as it may be
amended from time to time in accordance with the terms of the Merger
Agreement, the " _Offer_ ") to purchase all outstanding shares of the Company
Common Stock, and (ii) following the consummation of the Offer, the merger of
Merger Sub with and into the Company, with the Company continuing as the
surviving corporation (the " _Merger_ ");

WHEREAS, as an inducement to and condition to the willingness of Parent
and Merger Sub to enter into the Merger Agreement, Parent has required that
the Stockholders enter into this Agreement; and

WHEREAS, capitalized terms used but not defined herein have the meanings
assigned to them in the Merger Agreement.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and of the mutual
covenants, representations, warranties and agreements set forth herein and in
the Merger Agreement, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties
hereto agree as follows:

 



     | 1. | _Agreement to Tender_. 
---|---|--- 

(a) Each Stockholder hereby agrees to validly tender or cause to be tendered
in the Offer all shares of Company Common Stock currently beneficially owned
by such Stockholder and any additional shares of Company Common Stock with
respect to which such Stockholder becomes the beneficial owner
(including, without limitation, by purchase, by the exercise of Company Stock
Options or otherwise) after the date of this Agreement (collectively, but
excluding any shares that are disposed of in compliance with _Section 7(b)_,
the " _Subject Shares_ ") pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of the
Offer no later than ten (10) Business Days after the receipt by such
Stockholder of all documents or instruments required to be delivered pursuant
to the terms of the Offer, including the letter of transmittal in the case of
certificated Subject Shares. In furtherance of the foregoing, at the time of
such tender, each Stockholder shall (i) deliver to the Disbursing Agent
designated in the Offer (A) a letter of   transmittal with respect to the Subject Shares complying with the terms of
the Offer, (B) a certificate or certificates representing the Subject Shares
or an "agents message" (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the
Disbursing Agent may reasonably request) in the case of a book-entry transfer
of any Subject Shares and (C) all other documents or instruments, to the
extent applicable, in the form required to be delivered by the other
stockholders of the Company pursuant to the terms of the Offer, and/or (ii)
instruct its broker or such other Person that is the holder of record of any
Subject Shares to tender such Subject Shares pursuant to and in accordance
with the terms of the Offer. Each Stockholder agrees that once the Subject
Shares are tendered, such Stockholder will not withdraw or cause to be
withdrawn any of the Subject Shares from the Offer, unless and until this
Agreement shall have been validly terminated in accordance with _Section
13_.

(b) If the Offer is terminated or withdrawn by Merger Sub, or the Merger
Agreement is terminated prior to the Acceptance Date, Parent and Merger Sub
shall promptly return, and shall cause the Disbursing Agent to return, all
tendered Shares to the registered holders of the Shares tendered in the Offer
(and in connection with the foregoing, Merger Sub shall direct the Disbursing
Agent to so return such tendered Shares within three (3) Business Days of any
such termination or withdrawal).

 



     | 2. | _Voting of Subject Shares; Irrevocable Proxy_. 
---|---|--- 

(a) At every meeting of the stockholders of the Company called, and at every
adjournment or postponement thereof, or as part of or in connection with any
action by written consent in lieu of meeting of stockholders of the Company,
each Stockholder shall, or shall cause the holder of record on any applicable
record date to, vote, or express consent or dissent with respect to, the
Subject Shares (to the extent that any of the Subject Shares are not purchased
in the Offer) (i) against (A) any agreement or arrangement related to or in
furtherance of any Acquisition Proposal, (B) any other transaction the
consummation of which would reasonably be expected to prevent or materially
delay or interfere with the Offer or the Merger, or (C) any action, proposal,
transaction or agreement that would reasonably be expected to result in (x) a
breach of any covenant, representation or warranty or other obligation or
agreement of such Stockholder under this Agreement or (y) the failure of any
Tender Offer Condition to be satisfied, and (ii) in favor of any other matter
necessary for consummation of the Transactions, which is considered at any
such meeting of stockholders, and in connection therewith to execute any
documents reasonably requested by Parent that are necessary or appropriate in
order to effectuate the foregoing.

(b) Each Stockholder, revoking (or causing to be revoked) any proxies that it
has heretofore granted, hereby irrevocably appoints Parent as attorney-in-fact
and proxy for and on behalf of such Stockholder, for and in the name, place
and stead of such Stockholder, to: (i) attend any and all stockholder
meetings of the Company with respect to the matters set forth in _Section
2(a)_; (ii) vote, express consent or dissent or issue instructions to the
record holder to vote, express consent or dissent with respect to the Subject
Shares in accordance with the provisions of _Section 2(a)_ at any such
meeting; and (iii) grant or withhold, or issue instructions to the record
holder to grant or withhold, consistent with the provisions of  _Section
2(a)_, all written consents with respect to the Subject Shares. The foregoing
proxy shall be deemed to be a proxy coupled with an interest, is irrevocable
and shall not be terminated by operation of law or 

 



2  upon the occurrence of any other event other than the valid termination of
this Agreement pursuant to _Section 13_. Each Stockholder hereby affirms that
the irrevocable proxy set forth in this _Section 2(b)_ is given in
connection with and granted in consideration of and as an inducement to Parent
entering into the Merger Agreement and that such irrevocable proxy is given to
secure the obligations of such Stockholder under _Section 2(a)_ hereof. The
irrevocable proxy set forth in this _Section 2(b)_ is executed and intended
to be irrevocable, subject, however, to automatic termination, upon the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to  _Section 13_. Parent agrees not
to exercise the proxy granted herein for any purpose other than the purposes
described in this Agreement.

 

3\. _Documentation and Information_. No Stockholder shall make any public
announcement regarding this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby without the prior written consent of Parent, except as may be required
by Applicable Law. Each Stockholder (a) consents to and authorizes the
publication and disclosure by Parent of such Stockholders identity and
holdings of Subject Shares, the nature of such Stockholders commitments,
arrangements and understandings under this Agreement (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, the disclosure of this Agreement) and any other
information, in each case, that Parent reasonably determines is required to
be disclosed by Applicable Law (based on the advice of outside legal counsel)
in any press release, the Offer Documents, the Companys Schedule 14D-9 (in
each case, including all schedules and documents filed with the SEC) or any
other disclosure document in connection with the Offer, the Merger and the
other Transactions and (b) agrees to promptly give to Parent and the Company
any information they may reasonably require for the preparation of any such
disclosure documents. Parent agrees to provide Stockholders and their counsel
a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the disclosures with respect
to the Stockholders authorized by the previous sentence, and will give good
faith consideration to any comments raised by the Stockholders and their
counsel; _provided, however,_ that Parent will not be required to provide any
Stockholder or its counsel the opportunity to review any disclosures
authorized by the previous sentence if the information with respect to such
Stockholder in such disclosures has previously been publicly filed in
compliance with the foregoing provisions. Nothing in the foregoing sentence
shall limit the ability of a Stockholder to make announcements to its
respective limited partners that are consistent in all material respects with
prior public disclosures regarding the transactions contemplated hereby. Each
Stockholder agrees to promptly notify Parent of any required corrections with
respect to any information supplied by such Stockholder specifically for use
in any such disclosure document, if and to the extent that any such
information shall have become false or misleading in any material respect.
Parent and Merger Sub agree to promptly give to each Stockholder any
information regarding Parent and Merger Sub that such Stockholder reasonably
requires for the preparation of any documents that such Stockholder is
required to file with the SEC in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the filing of any Schedules 13D or 13G or
amendments to Schedules 13D or 13G and filings under Section 16 of the
Exchange Act.

 

4\. _No Solicitation of Acquisition Proposals_. During the Agreement Period,
each Stockholder shall not, and shall not knowingly permit any director,
partner, officer, employee, accountant, consultant, legal counsel, investment
banker, financial advisor, broker, finder or agent or other representative
(each, a " _Representative_ ") of such Stockholder to (a) directly or
indirectly, solicit, initiate, encourage or facilitate any inquiry, offer or
proposal with respect to, or that constitutes or would reasonably be expected
to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal or a

 



3  proposal to acquire any of the Subject Shares (except in connection with a
Transfer of Subject Shares that is permitted under _Section 7(b)_) or (b)
directly or indirectly, enter into, continue or otherwise engage or
participate in any discussions or negotiations with respect to an Acquisition
Proposal or provide information to any Person with respect to, or that would
reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal or a proposal to
acquire any of the Subject Shares (except in connection with a Transfer of
Subject Shares that is permitted under _Section 7(b)_). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, this Section 4 shall not (x) require the Stockholders to attempt
to limit or restrict any Representative that is an officer or director of the
Company from acting in such persons capacity as an officer or director of the
Company, as provided in Section 9 hereof, or (y) prevent any Representative
of a Stockholder from providing any analytical support services to the Company
or its Board of Directors in connection with the process contemplated by
Section 6.3(c) of the Merger Agreement.

 

5\. _Representations and Warranties of Stockholders_. Each Stockholder
represents and warrants (severally and not jointly) to Parent and Merger Sub
as follows (it being understood that, except where expressly stated to be
given or made as of the date hereof only, the representations and warranties
contained in this Agreement shall be made as of the date hereof, as of
the Acceptance Date and, if the Subject Shares have not been previously
accepted for payment pursuant to the Offer, as of the Effective Time):

 

(a) _Organization._ Such Stockholder is duly organized, validly existing and
in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization.

(b) _Authorization._ Such Stockholder has all requisite corporate, limited
liability company, partnership or trust power and authority to enter into and

authorized by all necessary corporate, limited liability company, partnership
or trust action on the part of such Stockholder. This Agreement has been duly
executed and delivered by such Stockholder and, assuming its due and
valid authorization, execution and delivery by Parent and Merger Sub,
constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of such Stockholder,
enforceable against such Stockholder in accordance with its terms, subject to
the effect of any applicable bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency,
moratorium or similar laws affecting creditors rights generally and subject,
as to enforceability, to the effect of general principles of equity.

 

(c) _No Violation._

(i) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by such Stockholder does
not, and the performance by such Stockholder of its obligations hereunder will
not, (A) conflict with, or result in violation of any provision of its
certificate or articles of incorporation, bylaws or similar organizational
documents, (B) violate, or conflict with, or result in a breach of any
provision of, or constitute a default (or an event that, with the giving of
notice, the passage of time or otherwise, would constitute a default) under,
or entitle any party (with the giving of notice, the passage of time or
otherwise) to terminate, accelerate, modify or call a default under, or result
in the creation of any lien, security interest, charge or encumbrance upon
any of the properties or assets of such Stockholder under any of the terms,
conditions or

 



4  provisions of any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, deed of trust, license,
contract, undertaking, agreement, lease or other instrument or obligation to
which such Stockholder is a party or (C) assuming compliance with the matters
referred to in _Section 5(c)(ii)_, violate any order, writ, injunction,
decree, statute, rule or regulation applicable to such Stockholder or its
properties or assets, except, in the case of clauses (B) and (C), for such
matters as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected
to prevent, delay, impair or otherwise adversely affect, in each case, in any
material respect, the ability of such Stockholder to perform its obligations
hereunder or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.

(ii) No action or consent or approval of, or review by, or registration or
filing by such Stockholder with, any Governmental Authority is required in
connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement by such
Stockholder or the performance by such Stockholder of its
obligations hereunder, except for filings that may be required under the HSR
Act or any other applicable Competition Law or under federal securities law,
including the filing with the SEC of any Schedules 13D or 13G or amendments to
Schedules 13D or 13G and filings under Section 16 of the Exchange Act as may
be required in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, or the securities laws of any state or other
jurisdiction.

 

(d) _Ownership of Subject Shares._ As of the date hereof, such Stockholder is,
and (except with respect to any Subject Shares Transferred in accordance with
_Section 7(b)_ or accepted for payment pursuant to the Offer) at all times
during the Agreement Period (as defined below) will be, the beneficial owner
of, and have good and marketable title to, such Subject Shares with no
restrictions on such Stockholders rights of disposition pertaining thereto.
Other than as provided in this Agreement (including as set forth on _Schedule
I_ hereto), such Stockholder has, and (except with respect to any Subject
Shares Transferred in accordance with _Section 7(b)_) at all times during
the Agreement Period will have, the sole power, directly or indirectly, to
vote, dispose of, exercise and convert, as applicable, the Subject Shares, and
to demand or waive any appraisal rights or issue instructions pertaining to
the Subject Shares with respect to the matters set forth in this Agreement, in
each case with no limitations, qualifications or restrictions on such rights
(except as imposed by Applicable Law or pursuant to Company policies and
procedures governing trading in the Companys securities), and, as such, has,
and (except with respect to any Subject Shares Transferred in accordance with

the issuance of) instructions with respect to the matters set forth in this
Agreement, (ii) agree to all matters set forth in this Agreement and (iii)
demand and waive any applicable appraisal or dissent rights. Except to the
extent of any Subject Shares acquired after the date hereof (which shall
become Subject Shares upon that acquisition), the number of shares of
the Company Common Stock set forth on the signature page hereof are the only
shares of Company Common Stock beneficially owned by such Stockholder on the
date of this Agreement. Other than the Subject Shares, such Stockholder does
not own any shares of Company Common Stock or any options to purchase or
rights to subscribe for or otherwise acquire any securities of the Company and
has no interest in or voting rights with respect to any securities of the
Company. Except as provided in this Agreement, there are no agreements or
arrangements of any kind, contingent or otherwise, to which Stockholder is a
party obligating such Stockholder to Transfer or cause to be Transferred, any
of the Subject Shares. Except pursuant to this Agreement, no Person has any
contractual or other right or obligation to purchase or otherwise acquire any
of the Subject Shares.

 



5 (e) _No Proxies._ Except as set forth on _Schedule I_ hereto, none of the
Subject Shares are subject to any voting agreement or proxy.

(f) _Absence of Litigation._ As of the date hereof, there is no Action
pending against, or, to the knowledge of such Stockholder, threatened against
or otherwise affecting, such Stockholder or any of its properties or assets
(including the Subject Shares) that could reasonably be expected to impair in
any material respect the ability of Stockholder to perform its obligations
hereunder or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby on a timely
basis.

(g)  _Opportunity to Review; Reliance._ Such Stockholder has had the
opportunity to review the Merger Agreement and this Agreement with counsel of
its own choosing. None of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company, or their
respective counsel, has provided advice to such Stockholder with respect to
this Agreement or the validity or effect of this Agreement. Such Stockholder
understands and acknowledges that Parent and Merger Sub are entering into the
Merger Agreement in reliance upon such Stockholders execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement.

(h) _Finders  Fees. _No investment banker, broker, finder or other
intermediary is entitled to a fee or commission from Parent, Merger Sub or the
Company in respect of this Agreement based upon any arrangement or agreement
made by or on behalf of such Stockholder in its or his capacity as such.

 

6\. _Representations and Warranties of Parent and Merger Sub_. Each of Parent
and Merger Sub hereby, jointly and severally, represent and warrant to the
Stockholders, as of the date hereof and as of the Acceptance Date, that (a)
such party is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization, (b) such
party has all requisite corporate power and authority to enter into and
deliver this Agreement and to perform its obligations hereunder, (c) the
execution and delivery by such party of this Agreement and the consummation by
such party of the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly authorized
by all necessary corporate action on the part of such party and (d) this
Agreement constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of such party,
enforceable against such party in accordance with its terms, subject to the
effect of any applicable bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, moratorium or
similar laws affecting creditors rights generally and subject, as to
enforceability, to the effect of general principles of equity.



     | 7. | _No Proxies for or Encumbrances on Subject Shares_. 
---|---|--- 

(a) Except pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, during the Agreement
Period, each Stockholder shall not (nor shall it permit any Person under such
Stockholders control to), without the prior written consent of Parent,
directly or indirectly, (i) grant any proxies, powers of attorney, rights of
first offer or refusal, or enter into any voting trust or voting agreement or
arrangement with respect to any Subject Shares, (ii) sell (including short
sell), assign, transfer, tender, pledge, encumber, grant a participation
interest in, hypothecate or otherwise dispose of (including by gift) (each, a
" _Transfer_ ") any Subject Shares, (iii) otherwise permit any encumbrance to
be created on any Subject Shares, or (iv) enter into any contract, agreement,
option, instrument or other arrangement or understanding with respect to the
direct or

 



6  indirect Transfer of any Subject Shares. For the avoidance of doubt,
customary arrangements with respect to Subject Shares that are held in margin
accounts as of the date hereof and that would not prevent, impair or delay
any Stockholders ability to comply with the terms and conditions of this
Agreement will not be deemed to violate the restrictions contained in the
previous sentence. Each Stockholder shall not, and shall not permit any
Person under such Stockholders control or any of its or their respective
representatives to, seek or solicit any such Transfer or any such contract,
agreement, option, instrument or other arrangement or understanding. Except to
the extent permitted under the terms of this Agreement, each Stockholder
shall not take any other action that would restrict, limit or interfere in any
material respect with the performance of such Stockholders obligations
hereunder or the Transactions. 

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Stockholder shall have the right to
Transfer all or any portion of its Subject Shares to a Permitted Transferee
of such Stockholder if and only if such Permitted Transferee shall have agreed
in writing, in a manner reasonably acceptable in form and substance to Parent,
(i) to accept such Subject Shares subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement and (ii) to be bound by this Agreement and to agree and acknowledge
that such Person shall constitute a Stockholder for all purposes of this
Agreement. " _Permitted Transferee_ " means any affiliate of a Stockholder.

(c) During the Agreement Period, each Stockholder hereby authorizes Parent and
Merger Sub to direct the Company to impose stop orders to prevent the
Transfer of any Subject Shares on the books of the Company in violation of
this Agreement.

8\. _Waiver of Appraisal Rights_. Each Stockholder hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally waives, and agrees not to exercise or assert, on its own
behalf or on behalf of any other holder of Company Common Stock, any rights of
appraisal, any dissenters rights or any similar rights relating to the
Merger that such Stockholder may have by virtue of, or with respect to, any
Subject Shares.

 

9\. _Directors and Officers_. This Agreement shall apply to each Stockholder
solely in its capacity as a holder of Company Common Stock, Company Stock
Options or other equity interests in the Company. Notwithstanding any
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, nothing in this Agreement shall
(or shall require a Stockholder to attempt to) (a) limit or restrict
any actions or omissions of a director or officer of the Company, including,
without limitation, (i) in the exercise of his or her fiduciary duties as a
director or officer of the Company under Applicable Law, (ii) in his or her
capacity as a trustee or fiduciary of any of the Companys Plans or trusts or
(iii) in the exercise of his or her role as a director or officer of the
Company in carrying out the process contemplated in Section 6.3(c) of the
Merger Agreement or (b) prevent or be construed to create any obligation on
the part of any director or officer of the Company or any trustee or fiduciary
of any of the Companys Plans or trusts from taking any action in his or her
capacity as such director, officer, trustee or fiduciary.

10\. _Notices of Certain Events_. Each Stockholder shall notify Parent of any
development occurring after the date hereof that causes, or that would
reasonably be expected to cause, any breach of any of the representations and
warranties of such Stockholder set forth in _Section 5_. Each Stockholder
shall notify Parent of the number of any new Subject Shares acquired by such
Stockholder, if any, after the date hereof. Any such shares shall be subject
to

 



7  the terms of this Agreement as though owned by such Stockholder on the date
hereof. Parent and Merger Sub shall notify each Stockholder of any development
occurring after the date hereof that causes, or that would reasonably be
expected to cause, any breach of any of the representations and warranties of
Parent and Merger Sub set forth in _Section 6_.

 

11\. _Further Assurances_. Parent, Merger Sub and each Stockholder will each
execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, all further
documents and instruments and use their respective commercially reasonable
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be
done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under Applicable Laws
and regulations, to perform their respective obligations under this
Agreement.

12\. _Certain Adjustments_. In the event of a stock split, stock dividend or
distribution, or any change in the Company Common Stock by reason of a stock
split, reverse stock split, recapitalization, combination, reclassification,
readjustment, exchange of shares or the like, the term "Subject Shares" shall
be deemed to refer to and include such shares as well as all such stock
dividends and distributions and any securities into which or for which any or
all of such shares may be changed or exchanged or which are received in
the transaction.

13\. _Termination_ _._ This Agreement shall automatically terminate and become
void and of no further force or effect on the earliest to occur of (a) the
Acceptance Date, (b) the termination of this Agreement by written notice from
Parent to the Stockholders, (c) any reduction of the Per Share Amount (except
as provided in Section 1.1(h) of the Merger Agreement), (d) a Change of
Recommendation made in compliance with Section 6.3(c)(v) or (vi) of the Merger
Agreement, (e) the termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its
terms or (f) a willful or intentional material breach by Parent of its
obligations under his Agreement (the period from the date hereof through such
time being referred to as the " _Agreement Period_ "); _provided_ that (i)
this  _Section 13_ and the applicable definitional and interpretive
provisions of _Section 15_ shall survive such termination and (ii) no such
termination shall relieve or release any Stockholder, Parent or Merger Sub
from any obligations or liabilities arising out of its breach of this
Agreement prior to its termination.

14\. _Stockholder Obligations_ _._ The obligations of each Stockholder
hereunder shall be several and not joint, and no Stockholder shall be liable
for any breach of the terms of this Agreement by any other Stockholder. Each
of Parent and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and each Stockholder, on the other
hand, shall be entitled to enforce its rights under this Agreement against the
other, and it shall not be necessary for any other Stockholder to be joined as
an additional party in any proceeding for such purpose. No Stockholder may
enforce this Agreement against any other Stockholder party hereto. A default
by any Stockholder of its obligations pursuant to this Agreement shall not
relieve any other Stockholder of any of its obligations to Parent and/or
Merger Sub under this Agreement.

15\. _Miscellaneous_.

 

(a) _Non-Survival of Representations and Warranties._ None of the
representations and warranties in this Agreement or in any
instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall survive the Effective
Time.

 



8 (b) _Notices._ All notices and other communications hereunder shall be in
writing and shall be deemed given if delivered personally, dispatched by a
nationally recognized overnight courier service or sent via facsimile (with a
confirmatory copy sent by overnight courier) to the parties at the following

or to such other Persons or addresses as may be designated in writing by the
party to receive such notice as provided above. Any notice, request,
instruction or other document given as provided above shall be deemed given to
the receiving party upon actual receipt, if delivered personally; when
dispatched, if sent by facsimile, subject to confirmation of uninterrupted
transmission by a transmission report; provided that any notice dispatched by
facsimile after 17:00 hours (at the place where facsimile is to be received)
shall be deemed to have been received at 08:00 (at the place where facsimile
is to be received) on the next Business Day; one day after being delivered to
the courier, if sent by overnight courier service.

 



9 (c) _Amendment and Waivers._ Any provision of this Agreement may be amended or
waived during the Agreement Period (as defined below) if, but only if, such
amendment or waiver is in writing and is signed, in the case of an amendment,
by each party to this Agreement or, in the case of a waiver, by each party
against whom the waiver is to be effective. No failure or delay by any party
in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a
waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any
other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power
or privilege. The rights and remedies herein provided shall be cumulative and
not exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by Applicable Law. In the
event Parent amends or waives the terms and conditions of any Tender
and Support Agreement it has entered into with any other stockholder of the
Company, the result of which would make the terms and conditions of such other
Tender and Support Agreement more favorable to such stockholder than the terms
and conditions hereof are to the Stockholders, then Parent will offer to
amend or waive the terms and conditions of this Agreement so they are no less
favorable to the Stockholders than the terms and conditions of such other
Tender and Support Agreement are to such other stockholders.

(d) _Binding Effect; Benefit; Assignment._ The provisions of this Agreement
shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto
and their respective successors and assigns. No provision of this Agreement is
intended to confer any rights, benefits, remedies, obligations or liabilities
hereunder upon any Person other than the parties hereto and their respective
successors and assigns. Neither Stockholder, on the one hand, nor Parent or
Merger Sub, on the other hand, may assign or delegate this Agreement or any of
its rights, interests or obligations hereunder (whether by operation of law
or otherwise) without the prior written approval of Parent or the
Stockholders, as applicable.

(e) _Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial._

(i) This Agreement, and all claims or causes of action (whether at law, in
contract or in tort) that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to this
Agreement, the negotiation, execution or performance hereof or thereof, and
the Transactions shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to any choice or
conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any
other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any
jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.

 

(ii) Each of the parties irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction and
venue of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and any state
appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, if the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware declines to accept jurisdiction over a
particular matter, any state or federal court within the State of Delaware)
for the purpose of any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating
to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and irrevocably
waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, and covenants not to assert or
plead any objection it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of
any suit, action, or proceeding in any such court or that any such suit,
action or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an
inconvenient forum. Each of the parties agrees that a final judgment in any
suit, action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other
jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law.

 



10 (iii) Each of the parties irrevocably consents to the service of any summons
and complaint and any other process in any action or proceeding relating to
the Offer or the Merger, on behalf of itself or its property, by the personal
delivery of copies of such process to such party. Nothing in this _Section
15(e)_ shall affect the right of any party hereto to serve legal process in
any other manner permitted by law.

(f) EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL
BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE)
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY OR THE ACTIONS OF PARENT, MERGER SUB OR ANY STOCKHOLDER IN THE
NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT HEREOF.

(g) _Severability._ If any term, provision, covenant or restriction of this
Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other Governmental
Authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms,
provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall remain in full
force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated so
long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated
hereby is not effected in any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon
such a determination, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify
this Agreement so as to affect the original intent of the parties as closely
as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions
contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest
extent possible.

(h) _Specific Performance._ The parties agree that irreparable damage
would occur and that the parties would not have any adequate remedy at law in
the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is
accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement in any agreed court, without proof of actual damages (and each
party hereby waives any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond or
other security in connection therewith), specific performance being in
addition to any other remedy to which the parties are entitled in accordance
with this Agreement. Stockholder, on the one hand, and Parent and the Merger
Sub, on the other hand, hereby agree not to raise any objections to the
availability of the equitable remedy of specific performance to prevent or
restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement by such party (or
parties) or to specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement
to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with,
the covenants and obligations of such party (or parties) under this
Agreement.

(i) _Expenses._ All costs and expenses incurred in connection with this
Agreement shall be paid by or on behalf of the party incurring such cost or
expense, whether or not the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are
consummated.

 



11 (j) _Counterparts; Effectiveness._ This Agreement may be executed in any
number of counterparts (and such counterparts may be transmitted
electronically), which together shall constitute one and the same Agreement.
The parties may execute more than one copy of the Agreement, each of which
shall constitute an original. This Agreement shall become effective when each
party hereto shall have received a counterpart hereof signed by all of the
other parties hereto. Until and unless each party has received a counterpart
hereof signed by the other party hereto, this Agreement shall have no effect
and no party shall have any right or obligation hereunder (whether by virtue
of any other oral or written agreement or other communication).

 

(k) _Entire Agreement._ This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement among
the parties and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings,
agreements or representations by or among the parties, written and oral, with
respect to the subject matter hereof.

(l)  _Interpretation._ When a reference is made in this Agreement to a
Section, such reference shall be to a Section of this Agreement unless
otherwise indicated. The headings contained in this Agreement are for
reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever the words "include", "includes", or
"including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by
the words "without limitation". The meanings assigned to each term defined
herein shall be equally applicable to both the singular and plural forms of
such term, and words denoting any gender shall include all genders. Any
agreement, instrument or statute defined or referred to herein or in any
agreement or instrument that is referred to herein means such agreement,
instrument or statute as from time to time amended, modified or supplemented,
including (in the case of agreements or instruments) by waiver or consent and
(in the case of statutes) by succession of comparable successor statutes and
references to all attachments thereto and instruments incorporated therein.

 

(m) _No Presumption._ This Agreement shall be construed without regard to any
presumption or rule requiring construction or interpretation against the
party drafting or causing any instrument to be drafted.

(n) _No Ownership Interest._ Except as otherwise specifically provided
herein, nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to vest in Parent
or Merger Sub any direct or indirect ownership or incidence of ownership of or
with respect to the Subject Shares. All rights, ownership and
economic benefits of and relating to the Subject Shares shall remain vested
in and belong to the Stockholders, and neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall
have any authority to manage, direct, restrict, regulate, govern or administer
any of the policies or operations of the Company or exercise any power or
authority to direct the Stockholders in the voting of any of the Subject
Shares, except as otherwise specifically provided herein.
