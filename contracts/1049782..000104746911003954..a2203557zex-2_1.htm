  AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of April 19, 2011 (this "
_Agreement_ "), by and between Brookline Bancorp, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (" _Buyer_ "), and Bancorp Rhode Island, Inc., a Rhode Island
corporation (the " _Company_ ").

  

    
RECITALS 

  

 WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Buyer and the Company have determined that it is in the best interests of their respective corporations and shareholders to enter into this Agreement and to consummate the strategic business combination provided for herein, pursuant to which, subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the Company will merge with and into Buyer, with Buyer being the surviving corporation and continuing its corporate existence under the laws of the State of Delaware (the " _Merger_ "); 

  

 WHEREAS, as a condition to the willingness of Buyer to enter into this Agreement, each of the Chairman and the directors and executive officers of the Company (the " _Voting Agreement Shareholders_ ") has entered into a Voting Agreement, dated as of the date hereof, with Buyer (each a " _Voting Agreement_ "), pursuant to which each Voting Agreement Shareholder has agreed, among other things, to vote such Voting Agreement Shareholder\'s shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (" _Company Common Stock_ ") in favor of the approval of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Voting Agreement; 

  

 WHEREAS, the parties intend the Merger to qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), and that this Agreement shall constitute a "plan of reorganization" for purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of the Code; and 

  

 WHEREAS, the parties desire to make certain representations, warranties and agreements in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe certain conditions to the Merger. 

  

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants, representations, warranties and agreements contained herein, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties agree as follows: 

  

    
ARTICLE ITHE MERGER 

   

 1.1 _ The Merger._ Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, in accordance with the Delaware General Corporation Law (the " _DGCL_ ") and the Rhode Island Business Corporation Act (the " _RIBCA_ "), and in reliance upon the representations, warranties and covenants set forth herein, at the Effective Time, the Company shall merge with and into Buyer, the separate corporate existence of the Company shall cease and Buyer shall survive and continue its corporate existence under its Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws and the laws of the State of Delaware (Buyer, as the surviving corporation in the Merger, being sometimes referred to herein as the " _Surviving Corporation_ "). 

  

 1.2 _ Effective Time._ On the Closing Date, as promptly as practicable after all of the conditions set forth in Article VII shall have been satisfied or, if permissible, waived by the party entitled to the benefit of the same, Buyer and the Company shall (a) execute and file with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware a certificate of merger in a form reasonably satisfactory to Buyer and the Company, in accordance with the DGCL, and (b) execute and file with the Secretary of State of the State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations articles of merger in a form reasonably satisfactory to Buyer and the Company, in accordance with the RIBCA. The Merger shall become effective on the date of such filings at the time specified therein (the " _Effective Time_ "). 

  

 1.3 _ Effects of the Merger._ At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger shall be as provided herein and as provided in the applicable provisions of the DGCL and the RIBCA. 

  

 1.4 _ Closing._ The transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be consummated at a closing (the " _Closing_ ") that will take place at the offices of Goodwin Procter LLP, Exchange Place, Boston, Massachusetts 02109, on a date to be specified by the parties, which shall be no later than five      
  

Business Days (as defined in Section 9.3) after all of the conditions to the
Closing set forth in Article VII (other than conditions to be satisfied at the
Closing, which shall be satisfied or waived at the Closing) have been
satisfied or waived in accordance with the terms hereof, such day being
referred to herein as the " _Closing Date_." Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the Closing may take place at such other place, time or date as may be
mutually agreed upon in writing by Buyer and the Company.

  

 1.5 _ Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws._ The Certificate of Incorporation of Buyer, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation, until thereafter amended as provided therein and in accordance with applicable law. The Bylaws of Buyer, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation, until thereafter amended as provided therein and in accordance with applicable law. 

   

 1.6 _ Directors of the Surviving Corporation._ The directors of Buyer immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation, each of whom shall serve in accordance with the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation; _provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer shall expand the size of its Board of Directors by two seats in connection with the Merger and designate Merrill W. Sherman and one other director of the Company as mutually agreed upon by Buyer and the Company to serve on the Board of Directors of the Surviving Corporation with terms expiring in 2014, effective as of the Effective Time. 

   

 1.7 _ Officers of the Surviving Corporation._ The officers of Buyer immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 1.8 _ Company Bank._ The Board of Directors of Bank Rhode Island (the " _Company Bank_ ") immediately after the Effective Time shall consist of the current directors of the Company Bank, with the substitution of the Chief Executive Officer of Buyer for the Chief Executive Officer of the Company. Buyer intends to maintain the Company Bank\'s separate legal existence and name after the Effective Time. 

  

 1.9 _ Tax Consequences._ It is intended that the Merger shall qualify as a "reorganization" under Section 368(a) of the Code, and that this Agreement shall constitute a "plan of reorganization" for purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of the Code. 

  

    
ARTICLE IIMERGER CONSIDERATION; 
ELECTION AND EXCHANGE PROCEDURES 

   

 2.1 _ Merger Consideration._ Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, at the Effective Time, automatically by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Buyer, the Company or any shareholder of the Company: 

  

  

 (a) Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Buyer (" _Buyer Common Stock_ ") that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain outstanding following the Effective Time and shall be unchanged by the Merger. 

   

 (b) Each share of Company Common Stock held as Treasury Stock (as defined in Section 9.3) immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and retired at the Effective Time without any conversion thereof, and no payment shall be made with respect thereto. 

  

 (c) Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Treasury Stock) shall become and be converted into, as provided in and subject to the limitations set forth in this Agreement, the right to receive at the election of the holder thereof as provided in Section 2.4 either (1) $48.25 in cash, without interest (the " _Cash Consideration_ "), or (2) 4.686 shares (the " _Exchange Ratio_ ") of Buyer Common Stock (the " _Stock_

  

      

  
  

 _Consideration_ "). The Cash Consideration and the Stock Consideration are
sometimes referred to herein collectively as the " _Merger Consideration_."

  

  

 2.2 _ Rights as Shareholders; Stock Transfers._ All shares of Company Common Stock, when converted as provided in Section 2.1(c), shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each certificate (a " _Certificate_ ") previously evidencing such shares shall thereafter represent only the right to receive for each such share of Company Common Stock, the Merger Consideration and, if applicable, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Buyer Common Stock in accordance with Section 2.3. At the Effective Time, holders of Company Common Stock shall cease to be, and shall have no rights as, shareholders of the Company, other than the right to receive the Merger Consideration and cash in lieu of fractional shares of Buyer Common Stock as provided under this Article II. After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of shares of Company Common Stock, other than transfers of Company Common Stock that have occurred prior to the Effective Time. 

  

 2.3 _ Fractional Shares._ Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, no fractional shares of Buyer Common Stock and no certificates or scrip therefor, or other evidence of ownership thereof, will be issued in the Merger. In lieu thereof, Buyer shall pay to each holder of a fractional share of Buyer Common Stock an amount of cash (without interest) determined by multiplying the fractional share interest to which such holder would otherwise be entitled by the average of the daily closing prices during the regular session of Buyer Common Stock on The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (" _NASDAQ_ ") (as reported in _The Wall Street Journal_ or, if not reported therein, in another authoritative source) for the ten consecutive trading days ending on the fifth Business Day immediately prior to the Closing Date, rounded to the nearest whole cent. 

  

 2.4 _ Election Procedures._ 

  

  

 (a) An election form and other appropriate and customary transmittal materials (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of such Certificates to a bank or trust company designated by Buyer and reasonably satisfactory to the Company (the " _Exchange Agent_ ")) in such form as the Company and Buyer shall mutually agree (the " _Election Form_ "), shall be mailed no less than 20 Business Days prior to the anticipated Closing Date or such other date as the Company and Buyer shall mutually agree (the " _Mailing Date_ ") to each holder of record of Company Common Stock as of five Business Days prior to the Mailing Date. Each Election Form shall permit the holder of record of Company Common Stock (or in the case of nominee record holders, the beneficial owner through proper instructions and documentation) to (i) elect to receive the Cash Consideration for all or a portion of such holder\'s shares (a " _Cash Election_ "), (ii) elect to receive the Stock Consideration for all or a portion of such holder\'s shares (a " _Stock Election_ "), or (iii) make no election with respect to the receipt of the Cash Consideration or the Stock Consideration (a " _Non-Election_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that, notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, but subject to Section 2.5, 2,347,000 shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (the " _Stock Conversion Number_ "), shall be converted into the Stock Consideration and the remaining shares of Company Common Stock shall be converted into the Cash Consideration (the " _Cash Consideration Number_ "). A record holder acting in different capacities or acting on behalf of other Persons (as defined in Section 9.3) in any way will be entitled to submit an Election Form for each capacity in which such record holder so acts with respect to each Person for which it so acts. Shares of Company Common Stock as to which a Cash Election has been made are referred to herein as " _Cash Election Shares_." Shares of Company Common Stock as to which a Stock Election has been made are referred to herein as " _Stock Election Shares_." Shares of Company Common Stock as to which no election has been made (or as to which an Election Form is not properly completed and returned in a timely fashion) are referred to herein as " _Non-Election Shares_." The aggregate number of shares of Company 

  

      

  

Common Stock with respect to which a Stock Election has been made is referred
to herein as the " _Stock Election Number_."

   

 (b) To be effective, a properly completed Election Form shall be received by the Exchange Agent on or before 5:00 p.m., Eastern Time, on the 25th day following the Mailing Date (or such other time and date as mutually agreed upon by the parties (which date shall be at least five Business Days prior to the anticipated Closing Date and shall be publicly announced by Buyer as soon as practicable prior to such date)) (the " _Election Deadline_ "), accompanied by the Certificates as to which such Election Form is being made or by an appropriate guarantee of delivery of such Certificates, as set forth in the Election Form, from a member of any registered national securities exchange or a commercial bank or trust company in the United States ( _provided_ , _however_ , that such Certificates are in fact delivered to the Exchange Agent by the time required in such guarantee of delivery; failure to deliver shares of Company Common Stock covered by such guarantee of delivery within the time set forth on such guarantee shall be deemed to invalidate any otherwise properly made election, unless otherwise determined by Buyer, in its sole discretion). For shares of Company Common Stock held in book entry form, Buyer shall establish procedures for delivery of such shares, which procedures shall be reasonably acceptable to the Company. If a holder of Company Common Stock either (i) does not submit a properly completed Election Form in a timely fashion or (ii) revokes the holder\'s Election Form prior to the Election Deadline (without later submitting a properly completed Election Form prior to the Election Deadline), the shares of Company Common Stock held by such holder shall be designated Non-Election Shares. In addition, all Election Forms shall automatically be revoked, and all Certificates returned, if the Exchange Agent is notified in writing by Buyer and the Company that this Agreement has been terminated. Subject to the terms of this Agreement and of the Election Form, the Exchange Agent shall have reasonable discretion to determine whether any election, revocation or change has been properly or timely made and to disregard immaterial defects in any Election Form, and any good faith decisions of the Exchange Agent regarding such matters shall be binding and conclusive. Neither Buyer nor the Exchange Agent shall be under any obligation to notify any Person of any defect in an Election Form. 

  

 (c) The allocation among the holders of shares of Company Common Stock of rights to receive the Cash Consideration and the Stock Consideration will be made as set forth in this Section 2.4(c) (with the Exchange Agent to determine, consistent with Section 2.4(a), whether fractions of Cash Election Shares, Stock Election Shares or Non-Election Shares, as applicable, shall be rounded up or down). 

    

 (i) If the Stock Election Number exceeds the Stock Conversion Number, then all Cash Election Shares and all Non-Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration, and, subject to Section 2.3 hereof, each holder of Stock Election Shares will be entitled to receive the Stock Consideration in respect of that number of Stock Election Shares held by such holder equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the number of Stock Election Shares held by such holder by (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the Stock Conversion Number and the denominator of which is the Stock Election Number, with the remaining number of such holder\'s Stock Election Shares being converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration; 

  

 (ii) If the Stock Election Number is less than the Stock Conversion Number (the amount by which the Stock Conversion Number exceeds the Stock Election Number being referred to herein as the " _Shortfall Number_ "), then all Stock Election Shares shall be converted into the 

   

      

   
  

right to receive the Stock Consideration and the Non-Election Shares and the
Cash Election Shares shall be treated in the following manner:

    

 (A) if the Shortfall Number is less than or equal to the number of Non-Election Shares, then all Cash Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration and, subject to Section 2.3 hereof, each holder of Non-Election Shares shall receive the Stock Consideration in respect of that number of Non-Election Shares held by such holder equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the number of Non-Election Shares held by such holder by (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the Shortfall Number and the denominator of which is the total number of Non-Election Shares, with the remaining number of such holder\'s Non-Election Shares being converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration; or 

  

 (B) if the Shortfall Number exceeds the number of Non-Election Shares, then all Non-Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Stock Consideration, and, subject to Section 2.3 hereof, each holder of Cash Election Shares shall receive the Stock Consideration in respect of that number of Cash Election Shares equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the number of Cash Election Shares held by such holder by (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount by which (1) the Shortfall Number exceeds (2) the total number of Non-Election Shares and the denominator of which is the total number of Cash Election Shares, with the remaining number of such holder\'s Cash Election Shares being converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration. 

    

  

 2.5 _ Adjustments to Preserve Tax Treatment._ If either the tax opinion referred to in Section 7.2(b) or the tax opinion referred to in Section 7.3(b) cannot be rendered (as reasonably determined, in each case, by the counsel charged with giving such opinion) as a result of the Merger potentially failing to satisfy the "continuity of interest" requirements under applicable federal income tax principles relating to reorganizations under Section 368(a) of the Code, then Buyer shall increase the Stock Conversion Number to the minimum extent necessary to enable the relevant tax opinions to be rendered; _provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer shall not be obligated to make any such adjustment if, as a result of such adjustment, Buyer would be obligated to obtain approval of its stockholders in order to consummate the Merger. 

  

 2.6 _ Exchange Procedures._ 

  

  

 (a) On or before the Closing Date, for the benefit of the holders of Certificates, (i) Buyer shall cause to be delivered to the Exchange Agent, for exchange in accordance with this Article II, certificates representing the shares of Buyer Common Stock issuable pursuant to this Article II (" _New Certificates_ ") and (ii) Buyer shall deliver, or shall cause to be delivered, to the Exchange Agent an aggregate amount of cash sufficient to pay the aggregate amount of cash payable pursuant to this Article II (including the estimated amount of cash to be paid in lieu of fractional shares of Buyer Common Stock) (such cash and New Certificates, being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). 

   

 (b) As promptly as practicable following the Effective Time, and provided that the Company has delivered, or caused to be delivered, to the Exchange Agent all information which is necessary for the Exchange Agent to perform its obligations as specified herein, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a Certificate or Certificates who has not previously surrendered such Certificate or Certificates with an Election Form, a form of letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration into which the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificate or Certificates shall have been converted 

  

      

  
  

pursuant to Sections 2.1, 2.3 and 2.4 of this Agreement. Upon proper
surrender of a Certificate for exchange and cancellation to the Exchange
Agent, together with a properly completed letter of transmittal, duly
executed, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor, as applicable, (i) a New Certificate representing that
number of shares of Buyer Common Stock (if any) to which such former holder
of Company Common Stock shall have become entitled pursuant to this Agreement,
(ii) a check representing that amount of cash (if any) to which such former
holder of Company Common Stock shall have become entitled pursuant to this
Agreement and/or (iii) a check representing the amount of cash (if any)
payable in lieu of a fractional share of Buyer Common Stock which such former
holder has the right to receive in respect of the Certificate surrendered
pursuant to this Agreement, and the Certificate so surrendered shall
forthwith be cancelled. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section
2.6(b), each Certificate (other than Certificates representing Treasury Stock)
shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the
right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration provided in
Sections 2.1, 2.3 and 2.4 and any unpaid dividends and distributions thereon
as provided in Section 2.6(c). No interest shall be paid or accrued on (x)
any cash constituting Merger Consideration (including any cash in lieu of
fractional shares) or (y) any such unpaid dividends and distributions payable
to holders of Certificates.

  

 (c) No dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time with respect to Buyer Common Stock shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate until the holder thereof shall surrender such Certificate in accordance with this Section 2.6. After the surrender of a Certificate in accordance with this Section 2.6, the record holder thereof shall be entitled to receive any such dividends or other distributions, without any interest thereon, which theretofore had become payable with respect to shares of Buyer Common Stock represented by such Certificate. 

  

 (d) The Exchange Agent and Buyer, as the case may be, shall not be obligated to deliver cash and/or a New Certificate or New Certificates representing shares of Buyer Common Stock to which a holder of Company Common Stock would otherwise be entitled as a result of the Merger until such holder surrenders the Certificate or Certificates representing the shares of Company Common Stock for exchange as provided in this Section 2.6, or an appropriate affidavit of loss and indemnity agreement and/or a bond in an amount as may be required in each case by Buyer. If any New Certificates evidencing shares of Buyer Common Stock are to be issued in a name other than that in which the Certificate evidencing Company Common Stock surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a condition of the issuance thereof that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or accompanied by an executed form of assignment separate from the Certificate and otherwise in proper form for transfer, and that the Person requesting such exchange pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other tax required by reason of the issuance of a New Certificate for shares of Buyer Common Stock in any name other than that of the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered or otherwise establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid or is not payable. 

  

 (e) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the shareholders of the Company for six months after the Effective Time (as well as any interest or proceeds from any investment thereof) shall be delivered by the Exchange Agent to Buyer. Any shareholders of the Company who have not theretofore complied with Section 2.6(b) shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect of each share of Company Common Stock such shareholder holds as determined pursuant to this Agreement, in each case without any interest thereon. If outstanding Certificates for shares of Company Common Stock are not surrendered or the payment for them is not claimed prior to the date on which such shares of Buyer Common Stock or cash would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any governmental unit or agency, the unclaimed items shall, to the extent permitted by abandoned 

  

      

  
  

property and any other applicable law, become the property of Buyer (and to
the extent not in its possession shall be delivered to it), free and clear of
all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled to such property.
Neither the Exchange Agent nor any party to this Agreement shall be liable to
any holder of shares of Company Common Stock represented by any Certificate
for any consideration paid to a public official pursuant to applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar laws. Buyer and the Exchange Agent
shall be entitled to rely upon the stock transfer books of the Company to
establish the identity of those Persons entitled to receive the Merger
Consideration specified in this Agreement, which books shall be conclusive
with respect thereto. In the event of a dispute with respect to ownership of
any shares of Company Common Stock represented by any Certificate, Buyer and
the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deposit any Merger Consideration
represented thereby in escrow with an independent third party and thereafter
be relieved with respect to any claims thereto.

  

 (f) Buyer (through the Exchange Agent, if applicable) shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock such amounts as Buyer is required to deduct and withhold under applicable law. Any amounts so deducted and withheld shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Company Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Buyer. 

  

  

 2.7 _ Anti Dilution Provisions._ In the event Buyer or the Company changes (or establishes a record date for changing) the number of, or provides for the exchange of, shares of Buyer Common Stock or Company Common Stock issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a result of a stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, reclassification, or similar transaction with respect to the outstanding Buyer Common Stock or Company Common Stock and the record date therefor shall be prior to the Effective Time, the Exchange Ratio and/or the Cash Consideration shall be proportionately and appropriately adjusted; _provided_ , _however_ , that, for the avoidance of doubt, no such adjustment shall be made with regard to the Buyer Common Stock if (i) Buyer issues additional shares of Buyer Common Stock and receives consideration for such shares in a bona fide third party transaction or (ii) Buyer issues employee or director stock grants or similar equity awards. 

   

 2.8 _ Options and Other Stock-Based Awards._

Non-Employee Directors Stock Plan, as amended (collectively, the " _Company Option Plans_ "), whether vested or unvested, which is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and which has not been exercised or canceled prior thereto shall, at the Effective Time, be canceled and, as of the Effective Time, the Company shall pay to the holder thereof cash in an amount equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock provided for in such Option and (ii) the excess, if any, of the Cash Consideration over the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock provided for in such Option, which cash payment shall be made without interest and shall be net of all applicable withholding taxes. At the Effective Time, the Company Option Plans shall terminate and the provisions in any other plan, program or arrangement providing for the issuance or grant of any other interest in respect of the capital stock of the Company shall be of no further force and effect and shall be deemed to be deleted. The Company shall take all actions necessary in order to effect the provisions of this Section 2.8, including, without limitation, seeking all necessary approvals and providing any notices required under the Company Option Plans. 

  

      

  

 (b) As of the Effective Time, all restricted stock awards granted under the Company Option Plans (other than any performance shares, which shall be treated pursuant to Section 2.8(c) below) shall vest in full so as to no longer be subject to any forfeiture or vesting requirements, and all such shares of Company Common Stock shall be considered outstanding shares for all purposes of this Agreement, including, without limitation, for purposes of the right to receive Election Forms and to make elections and receive the Merger Consideration with respect thereto. 

  

 (c) As of the Effective Time, each performance share award granted to any employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (as defined in Section 9.3) under the Company Option Plans that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and, as of the Effective Time, the Company shall pay to the holder thereof cash in an amount equal to the product of (i) the Cash Consideration, multiplied by (ii) the number of performance shares earned in accordance with the terms governing such award as of the Effective Time based on performance calculated through the last day of the calendar quarter ending immediately prior to the Effective Time, which cash payment shall be made without interest and shall be net of all applicable withholding taxes; _provided_ , _however_ , that for purposes of determining whether such performance shares have been earned, the Company\'s earnings per share shall be calculated without deduction for any Transaction Related Expenses (as defined in the next sentence). For purposes of the previous sentence, " _Transaction Related Expenses_ " shall mean (i) any expense attributable to the acceleration of vesting of restricted stock awards after the date hereof and (ii) any attorney\'s fees, investment banking fees, accounting fees, consulting fees and other costs or expenses incurred by the Company or the Company Bank proximately in connection with the negotiation, execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement. 

  

 (d) The Board of Directors of the Company (the " _Company Board_ ") (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof administering the Company Option Plans) shall adopt such resolutions or take such other actions as may be required to effect the foregoing. 

  

  

 2.9 _ Reservation of Right to Revise Structure._ Buyer may at any time change the method of effecting the business combination contemplated by this Agreement if and to the extent that it deems such a change to be desirable; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such change shall (i) alter or change the amount of the consideration to be issued to holders of Company Common Stock as merger consideration as currently contemplated in this Agreement, (ii) reasonably be expected to materially impede or delay consummation of the Merger, (iii) adversely affect the federal income tax treatment of holders of Company Common Stock in connection with the Merger, or (iv) require submission to or approval of the Company\'s shareholders after the plan of merger set forth in this Agreement has been approved by the Company\'s shareholders. In the event that Buyer elects to make such a change, the parties agree to execute appropriate documents to reflect the change.

 3.13 _ Taxes and Tax Returns._ For purposes of this Section 3.13, any reference to the Company or its Subsidiaries shall be deemed to include a reference to the Company\'s predecessors or the predecessors of its Subsidiaries, respectively, and any reference to the Company shall be deemed to include its Subsidiaries, including any predecessors of its Subsidiaries, except where explicitly inconsistent with the language of this Section 3.13. Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.13_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule: 

  

  

 (a) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries has filed all Tax Returns that it was required to file under applicable laws and regulations, other than Tax Returns that are not yet due or for which a request for extension was filed consistent with requirements of applicable law or regulation. All such Tax Returns were correct and complete in all material respects and have been prepared in substantial compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. Taxes due and owing by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (whether or not shown on any Tax Return) have been paid other than Taxes that have been reserved or accrued on the balance sheet of the Company and which the Company is contesting in good faith. The Company is not the beneficiary of any extension of time within which to file any Tax Return and neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries currently has any open tax years. No claim has ever been made by an authority in a jurisdiction where the Company does not file Tax Returns that it is or may be subject to taxation by that jurisdiction. There are no Liens for Taxes (other than Taxes not yet due and payable) upon any of the assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. 

  

 (b) The Company has withheld and paid all Taxes required to have been withheld and paid in connection with any amounts paid or owing to any employee, independent contractor, creditor, shareholder, or other third party. 

  

 (c) No foreign, federal, state, or local tax audits or administrative or judicial Tax proceedings are being conducted or to the Company\'s Knowledge are pending with respect to the Company. Other than with respect to audits that have already been completed and resolved, the Company has not received from any foreign, federal, state, or local taxing authority (including jurisdictions 

  

      

  
  

where the Company has not filed Tax Returns) any (i) notice indicating an
intent to open an audit or other review, (ii) request for information related
to Tax matters, or (iii) notice of deficiency or proposed adjustment for any
amount of Tax proposed, asserted, or assessed by any taxing authority against
the Company.

  

 (d) The Company has made available to Buyer with true and complete copies of the United States federal, state, local, and foreign income Tax Returns filed with respect to the Company for taxable periods ended on or after December 31, 2007.

The Company is not a party to or bound by any Tax allocation or sharing agreement. The Company (i) has not been a member of an affiliated group filing a consolidated federal income Tax Return (other than a group the common parent of which was the Company), and (ii) has no liability for the Taxes of any individual, bank, corporation, partnership, association, joint stock company, business trust, limited liability company, or unincorporated organization (other than the Company) under Reg. Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of state, local, or foreign law), as a transferee or successor, by contract, or otherwise. 

  

 (g) The unpaid Taxes of the Company (i) did not, as of the end of the most recent period covered by the Company SEC Reports filed on or prior to the date hereof, exceed the reserve for Tax liability (which reserve is distinct and different from any reserve for deferred Taxes established to reflect timing differences between book and Tax income) set forth on the face of the financial statements included in the Company SEC Reports filed on or prior to the date hereof (rather than in any notes thereto), and (ii) do not exceed that reserve as adjusted for the passage of time in accordance with the past custom and practice of the Company in filing its Tax Returns. Since the end of the most recent period covered by the Company SEC Reports filed prior to the date hereof, the Company has not incurred any liability for Taxes arising from extraordinary gains or losses, as that term is used in GAAP, outside the ordinary course of business consistent with past custom and practice. 

  

 (h) The Company shall not be required to include any item of income in, or exclude any item of deduction from, taxable income for any taxable period (or portion thereof) ending after the Closing Date as a result of any: (i) change in method of accounting for a taxable period ending on or prior to the Closing Date; (ii) "closing agreement" as described in Code Section 7121 (or any corresponding or similar provision of state, local or foreign income Tax law) executed on or prior to the Closing Date; (iii) intercompany transactions or any excess loss account described in Treasury Regulations under Code Section 1502 (or any corresponding or similar provision of state, local or foreign income Tax law); (iv) installment sale or open transaction disposition made on or prior to the Closing Date; (v) prepaid amount received on or prior to the Closing Date; 

  

      

  
  

(vi) election with respect to the discharge of indebtedness under Section

would have the effect of deferring any liability for Taxes of the Company
from any period ending on or before the Closing Date to any period ending
after the Closing Date.

   

 (i) The Company has not distributed stock of another Person or had its stock distributed by another Person in a transaction that was purported or intended to be governed in whole or in part by Section 355 or Section 361 of the Code. 

  

 (j) As of the date hereof, the Company is aware of no reason why the Merger will fail to qualify as a "reorganization" under Section 368(a) of the Code. 

  

  

 3.14 _ Employee Benefit Plans._ 

  

  

 (a) _Schedule 3.14(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true, complete and correct list of every Employee Program (as defined below) that is maintained by the Company or any ERISA Affiliate (as defined below) or with respect to which the Company or any ERISA Affiliate has or may have any liability (the " _Company Employee Programs_ "). 

  

 (b) True, complete and correct copies of the following documents, with respect to each Company Employee Program, where applicable, have previously been made available to Buyer: (i) all documents embodying or governing such Company Employee Program and any funding medium for the Company Employee Program; (ii) the most recent IRS determination or opinion letter; (iii) the two most recently filed IRS Forms 5500; (iv) the most recent actuarial valuation report; (v) the most recent summary plan description (or other descriptions provided to employees) and all modifications thereto; and (vi) all non-routine correspondence to and from any state or federal agency. 

  

 (c) Each Company Employee Program that is intended to qualify under Section 401(a) or 501(c)(9) of the Code is so qualified and has received a favorable determination or approval letter from the IRS with respect to such qualification, or may rely on an opinion letter issued by the IRS with respect to a prototype plan adopted in accordance with the requirements for such reliance, or has time remaining for application to the IRS for a determination of the qualified status of such Company Employee Program for any period for which such Company Employee Program would not otherwise be covered by an IRS determination and, to the Knowledge of the Company, no event or omission has occurred that would cause any Company Employee Program to lose such qualification. 

  

 (d) Each Company Employee Program is, and has been operated, in compliance with applicable laws and regulations and is and has been administered in accordance with applicable laws and regulations and with its terms. No litigation or governmental administrative proceeding, audit or other proceeding (other than those relating to routine claims for benefits) is pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened with respect to any Company Employee Program or any fiduciary or service provider thereof. All payments and/or contributions required to have been made with respect to all Company Employee Programs either have been made or have been accrued in accordance with the terms of the applicable Company Employee Program and applicable law and with respect to any such contributions, premiums, or other payments required to be made under or with respect to any Company Employee Program that are not yet due or payable, to the extent required by GAAP, adequate reserves are reflected on the Company Balance Sheet. 

  

 (e) No Company Employee Program is a single employer pension plan (within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(15) of ERISA (as defined below)) for which the Company or any ERISA Affiliate could incur liability under Section 4063 or 4064 of ERISA or a plan maintained by more than one employer as described in Section 413(c) of the Code. 

  

      

                                    

  

  

 (f) Neither the Company nor any current ERISA Affiliate maintains or contributes to, or within the past six years has maintained or contributed to, any Employee Program that is or was subject to Title IV of ERISA, Section 412 of the Code, Section 302 of ERISA or is a Multiemployer Plan (as defined below) and neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has incurred any liability under Title IV of ERISA that has not been paid in full. 

  

 (g) Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.14(g)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, none of the Company Employee Programs provides health care or any other non-pension welfare benefits to any employees after their employment is terminated (other than as required by Part 6 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA or similar state law) and the Company has never promised to provide such post-termination benefits. 

  

 (h) Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.14(h)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, each Company Employee Program may be amended, terminated, or otherwise modified by the Company to the greatest extent permitted by applicable law, including the elimination of any and all future benefit accruals thereunder and no employee communications or provision of any Company Employee Program has failed to effectively reserve the right of the Company or the ERISA Affiliate to so amend, terminate or otherwise modify such Company Employee Program. Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.14(h)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, neither the Company nor any of its ERISA Affiliates has announced its intention to modify or terminate any Company Employee Program or adopt any arrangement or program which, once established, would come within the definition of a Company Employee Program. Each asset held under each Company Employee Program may be liquidated or terminated without the imposition of any redemption fee, surrender charge or comparable liability. 

  

 (i) The per share exercise price of each Option is no less than the fair market value of a share of Company Common Stock on the date of grant of such Option (and as of each later modification thereof within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code) determined in a manner consistent with Section 409A of the Code. Since December 31, 2004 and through December 31, 2008, each Company Employee Program that constitutes in any part a nonqualified deferred compensation plan within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code (each, a " _NQDC Plan_ ") has been operated and maintained in accordance with a good faith, reasonable interpretation of Section 409A of the Code with respect to amounts deferred (within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code) after December 31, 2004. From and after January 1, 2009, each NQDC Plan has been operated and maintained in operational and documentary compliance with Section 409A of the Code and applicable guidance thereunder. No payment to be made under any Company Employee Program is, or to the Knowledge of the Company, will be, subject to the penalties of Section 409A(a)(1) of the Code. 

  

 (j) No Company Employee Program is subject to the laws of any jurisdiction outside the United States. 

  

 (k) Except as set forth and quantified in reasonable detail on _Schedule 3.14(k)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the shareholder approval of this Agreement, nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby could (either alone or in conjunction with any other event) (i) result in, or cause the accelerated vesting payment, funding or delivery of, or increase the amount or value of, any payment or benefit to any employee, officer, director or other service provider of the Company or any of its ERISA Affiliates; (ii) limit the right of the Company or any of its ERISA Affiliates to amend, merge, terminate or receive a reversion of assets from any Company Employee Program or related trust; (iii) result in any "parachute payment" as defined in Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code (whether or not such payment is considered to be reasonable compensation for services rendered); or (iv) result in a requirement to pay any tax "gross-up" or similar "make-whole" payments to any 

  

      

  
  

employee, director or consultant of the Company or an ERISA Affiliate.
_Schedule 3.14(k)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule lists the
Company\'s "disqualified individuals" for purposes of Section 280G of the
Code. Based upon the assumptions set forth in _Schedule 3.14(k)_ of
the Company Disclosure Schedule, each payment to be made under any Company
Employee Program is, or to the Knowledge of the Company, will be deductible
under Section 162(m) of the Code.

In the case of an Employee Program funded through a trust described in Section 401(a) of the Code or an organization described in Section 501(c)(9) of the Code, or any other funding vehicle, each reference to such Employee Program shall include a reference to such trust, organization or other vehicle. 

  

 (ii) " _ERISA_ " means the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended. 

  

 (iii) An entity " _maintains_ " an Employee Program if such entity sponsors, contributes to, or provides benefits under or through such Employee Program, or has any obligation to contribute to or provide benefits under or through such Employee Program, or if such Employee Program provides benefits to or otherwise covers any current or former employee, officer or director of such entity (or their spouses, dependents, or beneficiaries). 

  

 (iv) An entity is an " _ERISA Affiliate_ " of the Company if it would have ever been considered a single employer with the Company under Section 4001(b) of ERISA or part of the same "controlled group" as the Company for purposes of Section 302(d)(3) of ERISA. 

  

 (v) " _Multiemployer Plan_ " means an employee pension or welfare benefit plan to which more than one unaffiliated employer contributes and which is maintained pursuant to one or more collective bargaining agreements. 

   

  

 3.15 _ Labor Matters._ The Company and its Subsidiaries are in compliance with all federal, state and local laws respecting employment and employment practices, terms and conditions of employment, and wages and hours, and other than normal accruals of wages during regular payroll cycles, there are no arrearages in the payment of wages. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, or bound by any collective bargaining agreement, contract or other agreement or understanding with a labor union or labor organization, nor is the Company or any of its Subsidiaries the subject of a proceeding asserting that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has committed an unfair labor practice (within the meaning of the National Labor Relations Act) or seeking to compel the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to bargain with any labor organization as to wages and conditions of employment. No work stoppage involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is pending, or to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is involved in, or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened with or affected by, any dispute, arbitration, lawsuit or administrative proceeding relating to labor or employment matters that would reasonably be expected to interfere in any respect with the respective business activities represented by any labor union, and to the Knowledge of the Company, no labor union is attempting to organize employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. 

        

 3.16 _ Insurance._ The Company and each of its Subsidiaries is insured, and during each of the past three calendar years has been insured, for reasonable amounts with financially sound and reputable insurance companies against such risks as companies engaged in a similar business would, in accordance with good business practice customarily be insured, and has maintained all insurance required by applicable laws and regulations. _Schedule 3.16_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule lists all insurance policies maintained by the Company and each of its Subsidiaries as of the date hereof, including, without limitation, any bank-owned life insurance policies (" _BOLI_ "). Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.16_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, all of the policies and bonds maintained by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries are in full force and effect and all claims thereunder have been filed in a due and timely manner and, to the Knowledge of the Company, no such claim has been denied. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is in breach of or default under any insurance policy, and there has not occurred any event that, with the lapse of time or the giving of notice or both, would constitute such a breach or default. The value of the BOLI set forth on _Schedule 3.16_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule is fairly and accurately reflected on the Company Balance Sheet. Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.16_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, the BOLI, and any other life insurance policies on the lives of any current and former officers and directors of the Company and its Subsidiaries that are maintained by the Company or any such Subsidiary or otherwise reflected on the Company Balance Sheet are, and will at the Effective Time be, owned by the Company or such Subsidiary, as the case may be, free and clear of any claims thereon by the officers, directors or members of their families. Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.16_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, the death benefit under the BOLI on the lives of the participants in the SERPs is, and as of the Effective Time will be, at least equal to the death benefit each such participant may be entitled to receive under the SERPs (after taking into account any acceleration of vesting under the SERPs as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement).

Person (other than Buyer) any information or data with respect to the Company

principle or letter of intent relating to an Acquisition Proposal. Any
violation of the foregoing restrictions by any of the Company Representatives,
whether or not such Company Representative is so authorized and whether or not
such Company Representative is purporting to act on behalf of the Company or
otherwise, shall be deemed to be a breach of this Agreement by the Company.
The Company and its Subsidiaries shall, and shall cause each of the
Company Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated any

Persons with respect to any existing or potential Acquisition Proposal.

 (b) Notwithstanding Section 6.5(a), prior to the date of the Company Meeting, the Company may take any of the actions described in clause (ii) of Section 6.5(a) if, but only if, (i) the Company has received a bona fide unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a breach of this Section 6.5; (ii) the Company Board determines in good faith, (A) after consultation with its outside legal counsel and a nationally recognized, independent financial advisor, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal and (B) after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that it is required to take such actions to comply with its fiduciary duties to the Company\'s shareholders under applicable law; (iii) the Company has provided Buyer with at least three Business Days\' prior notice of such determination; and (iv) prior to furnishing or affording access to any information or data with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or otherwise relating to an Acquisition Proposal, the Company receives from such Person a confidentiality agreement with terms no less favorable to the Company than those contained in the Buyer Confidentiality Agreement.

 For purposes of this Agreement, " _Superior Proposal_ " shall mean any bona fide written proposal (on its most recently amended or modified terms, if amended or modified) made by a third party to enter into an Acquisition Transaction on terms that the Company Board determines in its good faith judgment, after consultation with outside legal counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation (i) would, if consummated, result in the acquisition of all, but not less than all, of the issued and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock or all, or substantially all, of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis; (ii) would result in a transaction that (A) involves consideration to the holders of the shares of Company Common Stock that is more favorable, from a financial point of view, than the consideration to be paid to the Company\'s shareholders pursuant to this Agreement, considering, among other things, the nature of the consideration being offered and any material regulatory approvals or other risks associated with the timing of the proposed transaction beyond or in addition to those specifically contemplated hereby, and which proposal is not conditioned upon obtaining financing and (B) is, in light of the other terms of such proposal, more favorable to the Company\'s shareholders than the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and (iii) is reasonably likely to be completed on the terms proposed, in each case taking into account all legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of the proposal. 

  

 (c) The Company shall promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) notify Buyer in writing if any proposals or offers are received by, any information is requested from, or any negotiations or discussions are sought to be initiated or continued with, the Company or the Company Representatives, in each case in connection with any Acquisition Proposal, and such notice shall indicate the name of the Person initiating such discussions or negotiations or making such proposal, offer or information request and the material terms and conditions of any proposals or offers (and, in the case of written materials relating to such proposal, offer, information request, negotiations or discussion, providing copies of such materials (including e-mails or other electronic communications) except to the extent that such materials constitute confidential information of the party making such offer or proposal under an effective confidentiality agreement).

 (e) Notwithstanding Section 6.5(d), prior to the date of the Company Meeting, the Company Board may withdraw, qualify, amend or modify the Company Recommendation (a " _Company Subsequent Determination_ ") after the fifth Business Day following Buyer\'s receipt of a notice (the " _Notice of Superior Proposal_ ") from the Company advising Buyer that the Company Board has decided that a bona fide unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal that it received (that did not 

  

      

  
  

result from a breach of this Section 6.5) constitutes a Superior Proposal if,
but only if, (i) the Company Board has reasonably determined in good faith,
after consultation with outside legal counsel, that it is required to take
such actions to comply with its fiduciary duties to the Company\'s
shareholders under applicable law, (ii) during the five Business Day period
after receipt of the Notice of Superior Proposal by Buyer (the " _Notice
Period_ "), the Company and the Company Board shall have cooperated and
negotiated in good faith with Buyer to make such adjustments, modifications
or amendments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement as would enable
the Company to proceed with the Company Recommendation without a Company
Subsequent Determination; _provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer shall not have
any obligation to propose any adjustments, modifications or amendments to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement and (iii) at the end of the Notice
Period, after taking into account any such adjusted, modified or amended
terms as may have been proposed by Buyer since its receipt of such Notice of
Superior Proposal, the Company Board has again in good faith made the
determination (A) in clause (i) of this Section 6.5(e) and (B) that such
Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal. In the event of any
material revisions to the Superior Proposal, the Company shall be required to
deliver a new Notice of Superior Proposal to Buyer and again comply with the
requirements of this Section 6.5(e), except that the Notice Period shall be
reduced to three Business Days.

  

 (f) Nothing contained in this Section 6.5 shall prohibit the Company or the Company Board from complying with the Company\'s obligations required under Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act; _provided_ , _however_ , that any such disclosure relating to an Acquisition Proposal (other than a "stop, look and listen" or similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act) shall be deemed a change in the Company Recommendation unless the Company Board reaffirms the Company Recommendation in such disclosure. 

  

  

 6.6 _ Takeover Laws._ No party shall take any action that would cause the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be subject to requirements imposed by any Takeover Laws, as applicable, and each party shall take all necessary steps within its control to exempt (or ensure the continued exemption of) the transactions contemplated by this Agreement from, or if necessary challenge the validity or applicability of, any applicable Takeover Laws, as now or hereafter in effect, that purports to apply to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

Provided that the Company has cooperated as required above, Buyer agrees to file the requisite applications to be filed by it with the FRB and the Governmental Authorities of the states in 

        
  

which Buyer, the Company and their respective Subsidiaries operate. Each of

applicable laws relating to the exchange of information, with respect to, all
material written information submitted to any third party or any Governmental
Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
In exercising the foregoing right, each of the parties hereto agrees to act

 (b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall purchase an extended reporting period endorsement under the Company\'s existing directors\' and officers\' liability insurance coverage for the Company\'s directors and officers in a form acceptable to the Company which shall provide such directors and officers with coverage for six years following the Effective Time of not less than the existing coverage under, and have other terms at least as favorable to, the insured persons than the directors\' and officers\' liability insurance coverage presently maintained by the Company, so long as the aggregate cost is less than 250% of the annual premium currently paid by the Company for such insurance (the " _Premium Limit_ "). In the event that the Premium Limit is insufficient for such coverage, the Company may enter into an agreement to spend up to that amount to purchase such lesser coverage as may be obtained with such amount. 

  

 (c) In the event Buyer or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, to the extent necessary, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Buyer shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.9.

similar plans, Buyer shall not treat any employee of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries as a "new" employee for purposes of any exclusions under any
health or similar plan of Buyer for a pre-existing medical condition to the
extent that any such exclusion did not apply under a health or similar plan
of the Company or its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time,
and any deductibles, co-payments or out-of-pocket expenses paid under any of
the Company\'s or any of its Subsidiaries\' health plans shall be credited

In accordance with the terms and conditions of SERPs, upon the Effective Time, Buyer shall establish a rabbi trust with a third party financial institution mutually acceptable to the Company and Buyer and meeting the requirements of the SERPs and shall deposit funds with the trustee of such trust equal to the then present value of all accrued benefits provided under the SERPs (computed on the basis of the actuarial assumptions stated in the SERPs), and Buyer shall thereafter make annual additional deposits with the trustee to reflect increases in the accrued benefits to the extent necessary and required under the SERPs. 

  

 (d) If requested by Buyer, the Company shall terminate its 401(k) plan as of the day prior to the Effective Time (but contingent upon the occurrence thereof) and adopt all required compliance amendments pursuant to written resolutions, the form and substance of which shall be reasonably satisfactory to Buyer.

Each portion of the Employee Retention Amount that is so allocated will be paid in such amounts, at such times and upon such conditions as shall be set forth in letter agreements with each such Company Employee. 

  

 (g) The Company and Buyer shall use reasonable best efforts to consult with each other, and will consider in good faith each other\'s advice, prior to sending any notices or other communication materials to the employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries regarding this Agreement, the Merger or the effects thereof on the employment, compensation or benefits of such employees and, in any case, any such notice or communication materials shall comply with applicable law. 

   

 (h) Notwithstanding anything else contained herein to the contrary, nothing in this Section 6.10 shall be construed to create any third party beneficiary rights in any Person who is not a party to this Agreement. 

  

      

                                     

    

  6.11 _ Notification of Certain Matters._ Each of Buyer and
the Company shall give prompt notice to the other of any fact, event or
circumstance known to it that (a) is reasonably likely, individually or taken
together with all other facts, events and circumstances known to it, to result
in any condition set forth in Article VII not being satisfied, or (b)
notwithstanding the standards set forth in Section 9.1, would cause or
constitute a material breach of any of its representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements contained herein. No such notice by Buyer or the
Company shall affect or be deemed to modify or waive any representation,

contemplated hereby and thereby and supersedes any and all other oral or
written agreements heretofore made. Except for Section 6.9 (Indemnification;
Directors\' and Officers\' Insurance), nothing in this Agreement, expressed
or implied, is intended to confer upon any person, other than the parties
hereto or their respective successors, any rights, remedies, obligations or
liabilities under or by reason of this Agreement.

  

 9.8 _ Assignability; Binding Effect._ Prior to the Closing, this Agreement may not be assigned by Buyer without the written consent of the Company and no such assignment shall release Buyer of its obligations hereunder. After the Closing, Buyer\'s rights and obligations hereunder shall be freely assignable. This Agreement may not be assigned by the Company without the prior written consent of Buyer. This Agreement shall be binding upon and enforceable by, and shall inure to the benefit of, the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns, and except as expressly set forth herein, is not intended to confer upon any other person any rights or remedies hereunder. 

   

 9.9 _ Headings; Interpretation._ The headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and are not part of this Agreement. The word "including" and words of similar import when used in this Agreement shall mean "including, without limitation," unless the context otherwise requires or unless otherwise specified. Words of number may be read as singular or plural, as required by context. 

  

 9.10 _ Counterparts._ This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to constitute an original. 

  

 9.11 _ Governing Law._ This Agreement shall be governed by, and interpreted in accordance with, the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, without regard to the conflict of law principles thereof. Each of the parties hereto (a) consents to submit itself to the personal jurisdiction of the state or federal courts located in the State of Rhode Island in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (b) agrees that all claims in respect of such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in any such court, and (c) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such court. Each of the parties hereto waives any defense or inconvenient forum to the maintenance of any action or proceeding so brought and waives any bond, surety or other security that might be required of any other party with respect thereto. To the extent permitted by applicable law, any party hereto may make service on another party by sending or delivering a copy of the process to the party to be served at the address and in the manner provided for the giving of notices in Section 9.6. Nothing in this Section 9.11, however, shall affect the right of any party to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by law. EACH OF BUYER AND THE COMPANY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHTS TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. 

   

 9.12 _ Specific Performance._ The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with its specific terms or were otherwise breached. Each party agrees that, in the event of any breach or threatened breach by any other party of any covenant or obligation contained in this Agreement, the non-breaching party shall be entitled to seek (i) a decree or order of specific performance to enforce the observance and performance of such covenant or obligation, and (ii) an injunction restraining such breach or threatened breach.
