WHEREAS the respective boards of directors or managers (or other similar
governing body), as applicable, of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub have
approved and declared advisable, as applicable, this Agreement and determined
that the Merger on the terms provided for in this Agreement is advisable and

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein, the
parties agree as follows:

  

    

  


 

  

ARTICLE I 
  
  _The Merger_

  


 

  

SECTION 1.01. _The Merger._ Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the provisions of the DLLCA,
at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company
(the " _Merger_ "), the separate company existence of Merger Sub shall
thereupon cease, and the Company shall be the surviving company in the Merger.
The Company, as the surviving company after the Merger, is hereinafter
referred to as the " _Surviving Company_ ".

  


 

  

SECTION 1.02. _Closing._ (a) The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ")
shall take place at the offices of Cravath, Swaine and Moore LLP, 825 Eighth
Avenue, New York, New York 10019, at 9:00 a.m. on the third business day
following the satisfaction (or, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, the
written waiver) of the conditions set forth in Section 7.01, or, if on such
day any other condition set forth in Article VII has not been satisfied (other
than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing,
but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions at such time)
(or, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, waived in writing by the party
entitled to the benefit thereof), as soon as practicable after all of the
conditions set forth in Article VII have been satisfied (other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions at such time) (or,
to the extent permitted by applicable Law, waived in writing by the party
entitled to the benefit thereof), or at such other place, time and date as may
be agreed by the Company and Parent; _provided_ that, if the Marketing Period
has not ended at the time of the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set
forth in Article VII (other than those conditions that by their nature are to
be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of
those conditions at such time), then, subject to the continued satisfaction or
waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VII at such time, the Closing
shall occur instead on the earliest of (i) any business day during the
Marketing Period as may be specified by Parent on no less than two business
days' prior written notice to the Company, (ii) the second business day
following the final day of the Marketing Period or (iii) such other place,
time and date as may be agreed by the Company and Parent. The date on which
the Closing occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the " _Closing Date_ ".
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, unless otherwise
agreed to by the Company and Parent, the Closing shall not occur prior to
October 2, 2017.

  


 

  

SECTION 1.03. _Effective Time_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement,
as soon as practicable on the Closing Date, the Company shall cause the Merger
to be consummated by filing a certificate of merger executed in accordance
with, and in such form as is required by, the relevant provisions of the DLLCA
(the " _Certificate of Merger_ "), and shall make all other filings,
recordings or publications required under the DLLCA in connection with the
Merger. The Merger shall become effective at the time that the Certificate of
Merger is filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the "
_Secretary of State_ ") or, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, at such
later time as is agreed to by the parties hereto prior to the filing of such
Certificate of Merger and specified in the Certificate of Merger (the time at
which the Merger becomes effective is herein referred to as the " _Effective
Time_ ").

  

  


 

  

 

2  

  

  

SECTION 1.04. _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects
provided in this Agreement and as set forth in the applicable provisions of
DLLCA.

  


 

  

SECTION 1.05. _Certificate of Formation; Surviving Company Limited Liability
Company Agreement_.

  


 

  

(a) At the Effective Time and without any further action on the part of the
Company or Merger Sub or any other person, the certificate of formation of the
Company, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time (the "
_Certificate of Formation_ "), shall be the Certificate of Formation of the
Surviving Company as of the Effective Time, until duly amended in accordance
with applicable Law.

  


 

  

(b) At the Effective Time and without any further action on the part of the
Company or Merger Sub or any other person, the Company LLC Agreement, as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the limited liability
company agreement of the Surviving Company (the " _Surviving Company LLC
Agreement_ ").

  


 

  

SECTION 1.06. _Officers of the Surviving Company_. The managers and officers
of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial
managers and officers of the Surviving Company, effective as of the Effective
Time, each to hold office in accordance with the terms of the Surviving
Company's Certificate of Formation and the Surviving Company LLC Agreement.

  


 

  

ARTICLE II 
  
  _Effect on the Membership Interests of the Constituent Companies; Exchange
of Certificates_

  


 

  

SECTION 2.01. _Effect on Interests and Units_. At the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company,
Parent, Merger Sub or the holder of any Units of the Company or any holders of
membership interests of Merger Sub:

  


 

  

(a) _Merger Sub Interests_. Each membership interest in Merger Sub (a "
_Merger Sub Interest_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into membership interests in the Surviving
Company, as such membership interests are provided for by the Surviving
Company LLC Agreement.

  


 

  

(b) _Cancelation of Certain Units_. All Units that are owned by the Company as
treasury units immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and
shall cease to exist and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange
therefor. All Units held by Parent or Merger Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be canceled and shall cease to exist and no consideration
shall be delivered in exchange therefor. Each Unit that is owned by any direct
or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Company or of Parent (other than
Merger Sub) shall not represent the right to receive the Merger Consideration
and shall be, at the election of Parent, either (i) converted into membership
interests of the Surviving Company or (ii) canceled.

  


 

  

(c) _Conversion of Units_. Each Class A Unit issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall at the Effective Time be
converted automatically into and shall thereafter represent the right to
receive the Class A Merger Consideration, and each Class B Unit issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not vested,
shall at the Effective Time be converted automatically into and shall
thereafter represent the right to receive the Class B Merger Consideration.

  

  

 

3  

  


 

  

(d) _Effect on Units_. As of the Effective Time, all Units shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and
the holders immediately prior to the Effective Time of Units shall cease to
have any rights with respect thereto (other than any rights provided in this
Agreement), except for the right to receive the applicable consideration to be
paid in consideration therefor as set forth in this _Section 2.01_ in
accordance with this Agreement (subject, in each case, to any applicable
withholding tax as provided in Section 3.01(f)). No holder of Units shall be
entitled to any "appraisal rights", "dissenter's rights" or any similar rights
under the DLLCA or any other applicable Law.

  


 

  

SECTION 2.02. _Exchange of Units for Consideration._

  


 

  

(a) _Paying Agent_. Parent will engage the Escrow Agent or another bank or
trust company appointed by Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Company to
be the paying agent (in such role, the " _Paying Agent_ ") and enter into an
agreement, in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Company, with such Paying
Agent and Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to effect the exchange of cash
for Units which are entitled to payment pursuant to _Sections 2.01(c)_. To
facilitate such exchange, prior to the Closing, the Company shall provide each
holder of Units (each a " _Unitholder_ ") with a customary Letter of
Transmittal, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent and the
Company (the " _Letter of Transmittal_ "). The Company shall provide to
Parent, as promptly as reasonably practicable upon receipt thereof, copies of
each Letter of Transmittal delivered to the Company prior to the Closing.
Following the Closing, the Representative shall provide to Parent, as promptly
as reasonably practicable upon receipt thereof, copies of each Letter of
Transmittal delivered to the Representative. Upon the Closing, Parent shall
cause the Paying Agent to promptly pay each Unitholder that has duly executed
and delivered a Letter of Transmittal the portion of the Estimated Class A
Merger Consideration and the Estimated Class B Merger Consideration (subject
to _Section 2.02(b)_ and _Section 2.02(c)_ ) to which such Unitholder is
entitled at the Closing in accordance with the Closing Consideration Schedule.

  


 

  

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, (i) a portion
of the aggregate Merger Consideration to be paid to each Unitholder in respect
of its Units pursuant to this Agreement shall be reduced by the amount set
forth opposite such Unitholder's name on the Closing Consideration Schedule
(such amount under the heading "Escrow Amount", the applicable Unitholder's "
_Proportionate Adjustment Escrow Amount_ ") and (ii) such Proportionate
Adjustment Escrow Amounts shall be deposited by Parent in the Adjustment
Escrow Account pursuant to Section 3.01(d)(ii)(A).

  


 

  

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, (i) a portion
of the aggregate Merger Consideration to be paid to each Unitholder in respect
of its Units pursuant to this Agreement shall be reduced by the amount set
forth opposite such Unitholder's name on the Closing Consideration Schedule
(such amount under the heading "Indemnification Amount", the applicable
Unitholder's " _Proportionate Indemnification Escrow Amount_ ") and (b) such
Proportionate Indemnification Escrow Amounts shall be deposited by Parent in
the Indemnity Escrow Account pursuant to Section 3.01(d)(ii)(B). 
 

  

 

4  

  


 

  

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, (i) a portion
of the aggregate Merger Consideration to be paid to each Unitholder in respect
of its Units pursuant to this Agreement shall be reduced by the amount set
forth opposite such Unitholder's name on the Closing Consideration Schedule
(such amount under the heading "Representative Reserve", the applicable
Unitholder's " _Proportionate Representative Reserve Amount_ ") and (ii) such
Proportionate Representative Reserve Amount shall be deposited by Parent in
the Representative Account in accordance with Section 3.01(d)(ii)(C).

  


 

  

SECTION 2.03. _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in or Obligations
from Units_. The applicable portion of the Merger Consideration paid in
respect of Units upon the surrender of a Letter of Transmittal in accordance
with the terms of this _Article II_ shall be deemed to have been paid in full
satisfaction of all rights and obligations pertaining to the Units (other than
any other rights and obligations provided herein), and at the Effective Time,
the membership interest transfer books of the Company shall be closed and
thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers on the
membership interest transfer books of the Surviving Company of the Units that
were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.

  


 

  

SECTION 2.04. _Termination of Fund_. At any time following the first (1st)
anniversary of the Closing Date, the Surviving Company shall be entitled to
require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds that had been made
available to the Paying Agent and which have not been disbursed in accordance
with this _Article II_ (other than, for the avoidance of doubt, any Adjustment
Escrow Amount or Indemnity Escrow Amount held by the Escrow Agent in
accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement), and thereafter Unitholders
entitled to receive payment pursuant to this _Article II_ shall be entitled to
look only to the Surviving Company (subject to abandoned property, escheat or
other similar Laws) as general creditors thereof with respect to the payment
of any applicable portion of the Merger Consideration, that may be payable
upon surrender of any Units held by such Unitholders, as determined pursuant
to this Agreement, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, none of the Surviving Company, Parent, the Paying Agent or any
other person shall be liable to any former holder of Units for any amount
properly delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Laws. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by such
Unitholders at such time at which such amounts would otherwise escheat to or
become property of any Governmental Entity shall become, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, the property of the Surviving Company, free and
clear of all claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto.

  


 

  

SECTION 2.05. _No Liability_. Parent shall have no liability to any of the
Unitholders for any act or omission by the Escrow Agent or the Representative
pursuant to this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement.

(a) At least three business days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall
deliver to Parent (x) an estimated Closing Balance Sheet (the " _Estimated
Closing Balance Sheet_ "), which shall include as a liability an amount equal
to the remaining unpaid severance costs, termination payments and other
similar employment costs (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any employer-
paid portion of any employment or payroll taxes) to the Company and its
subsidiaries as of the Adjustment Time resulting from or incurred in
connection with any past restructuring activities (such amount, the " _Unpaid
Severance Amount_ ") and (y) a statement (the " _Initial Statement_ ") setting
forth reasonably detailed calculations of (i) the amount of Closing Debt, (ii)
the amount of Unpaid Expenses, (iii) the Company's good faith estimate of
Closing Cash (" _Estimated Closing Cash_ "), (iv) the Company's good faith
estimate of Closing Working Capital (" _Estimated Closing Working Capital_ ")
and (v) the Company's good faith estimate of the Unpaid Severance Amount ("
_Estimated Unpaid Severance Amount_ "), in each case, calculated in accordance
with the definition thereof.

  


 

  

(b) On the business day immediately preceding the Closing Date, the Company
shall deliver to Parent:

  


 

  

(i) a schedule (the " _Closing Capitalization Schedule_ ") setting forth the
number of Class A Units, Class B Units and Voting Units, in each case broken
down by series, issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(after giving effect to the Exchange) and the amount of any accrued or
declared but unpaid dividends or other distributions, if any, immediately
prior to the Effective Time. The Closing Capitalization Schedule shall also
set forth the name and the number of Class A Units, Class B Units and Voting
Units, in each case broken down by series, held by each such holder
immediately prior to the Effective Time (both before and after giving effect
to the Exchange). The Closing Capitalization Schedule shall be complete and
correct in all respects.

  


 

  

(ii) a complete and correct schedule (the " _Closing Consideration Schedule_
") setting forth, on a holder-by-holder basis, (u) the amount of Estimated
Class A Merger Consideration with respect each holder of Class A Units (after
giving effect to the Exchange), (v) the amount of Estimated Class B Merger
Consideration with respect to each holder of Class B Units, (w) the
Proportionate Adjustment Escrow Amount with respect to each Unitholder, (x)
the Proportionate Representative Reserve Amount with respect to each
Unitholder, (y) the Proportionate Indemnification Escrow Amount with respect
to each Unitholder and (z) the net amount to be paid to each Unitholder by the
Paying Agent pursuant to _Section 2.02_.

  


 

  

(c) In the event that the Company or Parent discovers an error in the Closing
Consideration Schedule, whether prior to or after the payment of the
consideration contemplated thereby, such party shall notify the other party
and they shall thereafter reasonably cooperate to correct such error
(including by adjusting the amount of consideration payable to the payees
thereof).

  


 

  


 

  

 

6  

  

  

(d) _Payments_

  


 

  

(i) At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall transfer to the Paying
Agent cash in an aggregate amount equal to the Estimated Class A Merger
Consideration _plus_ the Estimated Class B Merger Consideration _less_ the
Adjustment Escrow Amount _less_ the Indemnity Escrow Amount _less_ the
Representative Reserve Amount by wire transfer of immediately available funds
to the account designated for such purpose by the Paying Agent (the " _Closing
Date Payment_ ");

  


 

  

(ii) At the Closing, Parent shall pay, in cash by wire transfer of immediately
available funds:

  


 

  

(A) $5,000,000 (such amount, the " _Adjustment Escrow Amount_ ") shall be
deposited into an escrow account (the " _Adjustment Escrow Account_ "), which
shall be established pursuant to an escrow agreement substantially in the form
of Exhibit A attached hereto (the " _Escrow Agreement_ "), which Escrow
Agreement shall be entered into on the Closing Date by and among Parent, the
Representative and PNC Bank National Association as escrow agent (the "
_Escrow Agent_ "); and

  


 

  

(B) $10,000,000 (such amount, the " _Indemnity Escrow Amount_ ") shall be
deposited into an escrow account (the " _Indemnity Escrow Account_ ")
established pursuant to the Escrow Agreement.

  


 

  

(C) $2,000,000 (such amount, the " _Representative Reserve Amount_ ") shall be

according to such Unitholder's Pro Rata Reserve Share and otherwise in
accordance with the Certificate of Formation, the Company LLC Agreement, any
award agreement (including any "Unit Award Agreement" as such term is defined
in the Company LLC Agreement) in respect of Class B Units and applicable Law,

(e) _Closing Deliveries._ At the Closing:

  


 

  

(i) the Representative and Parent shall enter into, execute and deliver to
each other the Escrow Agreement;

  


 

  


 

  

 

7  

  

  

(ii) the Company shall deliver to Parent all certificates required to be
delivered by the Company on or prior to the Closing Date pursuant to Section
7.02; and

  


 

  

(iii) Parent shall deliver to the Company all certificates required to be
delivered by Parent on or prior to the Closing Date pursuant to Section 7.03.

  


 

  

(iv) Parent shall pay the Escrow Agent Fee, in cash by wire transfer of
immediately available funds, to the Escrow Agent.

(vi) the Company shall deliver to Parent a copy of the minutes of the meeting
of the board of managers of the Company approving the Merger, this Agreement,
the Escrow Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.

  


 

  

(f) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Parent and the
Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the portion of the
Closing Date Payment (or any other amount) otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement or the Indemnification Agreement to any Unitholder, for the benefit
of the Unitholders such amounts as Parent, the Paying Agent or any of their
respective affiliates is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the
making of any such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(the " _Code_ "), or any provision of state, local or non-U.S. tax Law;
_provided_ that Parent shall provide the Representative with written notice
of, and an explanation of the legal basis for, any such deduction and
withholding within five (5) business days of the Closing Date. To the extent
that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority
by Parent or the Paying Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Unitholder in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made. Parent shall reasonably
cooperate with the Representative to mitigate or eliminate any such deductions
or withholdings.

  


 

  

SECTION 3.02. _Post-Closing Adjustment._ (a) Within 60 days after the Closing
Date, Parent shall prepare and deliver to the Representative the Closing
Balance Sheet, which shall include, for the avoidance of doubt, as a liability
an amount equal to the Unpaid Severance Amount, as well as a statement (the "
_Final Statement_ ") setting forth a reasonably detailed calculation of
Closing Cash, Closing Working Capital and the Unpaid Severance Amount, in each
case prepared in good faith and calculated in accordance with the definition
thereof. For the avoidance of doubt, no asset, liability or amount shall be
duplicated or otherwise included in more than one of the calculations of
Closing Cash, Closing Working Capital, Closing Debt, Unpaid Expenses, the
Representative Reserve Amount or the Unpaid Severance Amount. For purposes of
complying with the terms set forth in this Section 3.02, the Representative
and Parent shall cooperate with and make available to each other and their
respective accountants and other representatives all information, records,
data and working papers ( _provided_ that the Representative or Parent, as
applicable, has executed and delivered any customary non-reliance, release or
other agreement required by the accountants that prepared such working
papers), and shall permit reasonable access to its officers, employees,
agents, properties, offices, plants and other facilities, books and records,
as may be reasonably required in connection with the preparation and analysis
of the Closing Balance Sheet, Final Statement, Closing Cash, Closing Working
Capital and the Unpaid Severance Amount and the resolution of any disputes
related thereto in accordance with this Section 3.02.

  


 

  


 

  

 

8  

  

  

(b) _Objections; Resolution of Disputes._

  


 

  

(i) Unless the Representative notifies Parent in writing prior to the end of
the 30-day period following Parent's delivery of the Closing Balance Sheet and
the Final Statement of any objection to the Closing Balance Sheet or the
calculations of Closing Cash, Closing Working Capital or the Unpaid Severance
Amount (a " _Notice of Objection_ "), the Closing Balance Sheet and the Final
Statement shall become final and binding and shall be deemed to set forth the
Closing Cash, Closing Working Capital and the Unpaid Severance Amount for all
purposes hereunder.

  


 

  

(ii) If the Representative delivers a Notice of Objection to Parent within
such 30-day period, Parent and the Representative shall use commercially
reasonable best efforts to resolve the Representative's objections included in
the Notice of Objection during the 30-day period commencing on the date the
Representative delivers the Notice of Objection. Any Notice of Objection shall
specify in reasonable detail the nature and amount of any objections, which
objections shall be limited to disagreements as to whether there were errors
in the calculation of Closing Cash, Closing Working Capital or the Unpaid
Severance Amount and whether the Closing Balance Sheet and the Final Statement
were prepared in accordance with this Agreement. If the Representative and
Parent are able to resolve all objections included in the Notice of Objection
within such 30-day period, then the parties shall revise the Closing Balance
Sheet and the Final Statement to reflect such resolution and the Closing
Balance Sheet and the Final Statement, as so revised, shall become final and
binding and the Final Statement shall be deemed to set forth the Closing Cash,
Closing Working Capital and Unpaid Severance Amount for all purposes
hereunder.

  

  


 

  

 

9  

  

  

  

  

(iii) If the Representative and Parent are unable to resolve all objections in
the Notice of Objection within such 30-day period, then such unresolved
objections shall be submitted promptly to PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, or, if
such firm declines to act, another nationally recognized public accounting
firm mutually agreed upon by Parent and the Representative in writing and, if
Parent and the Representative are unable to so agree within 10 days after the
end of such 30-day period, then Parent and the Representative shall each
select a nationally recognized public accounting firm and such firms shall
jointly select a third nationally recognized public accounting firm (such
selected firm in any case, the " _Independent Expert_ "). The parties shall
instruct the Independent Expert to render its reasoned written decision as to
the disputed items (which, for the avoidance of doubt shall only include the
objections raised in the Notice of Objection unless otherwise mutually agreed
by Parent and the Representative) and the effect of its decision on the
Closing Balance Sheet and the Final Statement as promptly as practicable but
in no event later than 60 days after its selection, which decision must be in
writing and must set forth, in reasonable detail, the basis therefor. In
resolving any disputed item, the Independent Expert (A) shall act in the
capacity of an expert and not as an arbitrator, (B) shall limit its review to
the objections specifically set forth in the Notice of Objection as a disputed
item (other than matters thereafter resolved by mutual written agreement of
the Representative and Parent) and (C) shall not assign a value to any
disputed item greater than the greatest value for such item claimed by either
party or less than the smallest value for such item claimed by either party in
the Notice of Objection. For the avoidance of doubt, but subject to the last
sentence of Section 2.06 of the Indemnification Agreement, any dispute as to
whether the Closing Balance Sheet and the Final Statement (and the calculation
of Closing Cash, Closing Working Capital and the Unpaid Severance Amount) were
prepared in accordance with the Accounting Methodologies shall be resolved
pursuant to this Section 3.02, irrespective of whether such dispute may give
rise to a claim for indemnification under the Indemnification Agreement. The
Representative and Parent shall each furnish to the Independent Expert such
working papers and other relevant documents and information relating to the
disputed items, and shall provide interviews and answer questions, as the
Independent Expert may reasonably request in connection with its
determinations of such disputed items. In the event the Representative or
Parent shall participate in teleconferences or meetings with, or make
presentations to, the Independent Expert, the other party shall be entitled to
participate in such teleconferences, meetings or presentations. The terms of
appointment and engagement of the Independent Expert shall be as agreed upon
between the Representative and Parent. The fees and expenses of the
Independent Expert shall be allocated to and borne by the Representative, on
the one hand, and Parent, on the other hand, based on one minus the percentage
that the Independent Expert's determination (before such allocation) in favor
of the Representative or Parent, as applicable, bears to the total amount of
the total items in dispute as originally submitted to the Independent Expert.
For example, should the items in dispute total in amount to $1,000 and the
Independent Expert awards $600 in favor of the Representative's position, then
60% of the costs of its review would be borne by Parent and 40% of the costs
of its review would be borne by the Representative. The resolution of disputed
items by the Independent Expert shall be final and binding, and the
determination of the Independent Expert shall constitute an arbitral award
that is final, binding and non-appealable and upon which a judgment may be
entered by a court having jurisdiction over the party against which such
determination is to be enforced. The parties shall revise the Closing Balance
Sheet and the Final Statement to reflect the determination of the Independent
Expert and the Closing Balance Sheet and the Final Statement, as so revised,
shall become final and binding and the Final Statement shall be deemed to set
forth the Closing Cash, Closing Working Capital and the Unpaid Severance
Amount for all purposes hereunder. 
 

  

  

 

9  

  

  

  

(iv) After the Closing Balance Sheet and the Final Statement shall have become
final and binding, neither the Representative nor the Parent shall have any
further right to make any claims against the other party in respect of any
element of Closing Cash, Closing Working Capital or the Unpaid Severance
Amount. For the avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Article II or in the Indemnification Agreement, the fact that the
Closing Balance Sheet and Final Statement have become final and binding shall
not in any way impair the ability of Parent to bring an indemnification claim
in respect of the Closing Debt or Unpaid Expenses pursuant to the
Indemnification Agreement.

  


 

  

(c) _Adjustment Payment._

  

  

 

10  

  

  

(i) The Closing Date Payment shall be (A) increased by the amount by which
Closing Working Capital is greater than the Estimated Closing Working Capital
or decreased by the amount by which Closing Working Capital is less than the
Estimated Closing Working Capital, (B) increased by the amount by which
Closing Cash is greater than the Estimated Closing Cash or decreased by the
amount by which Closing Cash is less than the Estimated Closing Cash and (C)
increased by the amount by which the Unpaid Severance Amount is less than the
Estimated Unpaid Severance Amount or decreased by the amount by which the
Unpaid Severance Amount is greater than the Estimated Unpaid Severance Amount
(the Closing Date Payment as so increased or decreased being referred to
herein as the " _Adjusted Closing Date Payment_ ").

  


 

  

(ii) Within five business days after the Closing Balance Sheet and the Final
Statement have become final and binding in accordance with Section 3.02(b):

  


 

  

(A) if the Closing Date Payment is less than the Adjusted Closing Date
Payment, (1) Parent shall pay, or cause to be paid, to the Paying Agent an
amount equal to such difference (the amount of such difference, the " _Parent
Shortfall_ ") to the Paying Agent (for further distribution by the Paying
Agent to each Unitholder according to such Unitholder's Pro Rata Adjustment
Escrow Share of such Parent Shortfall and otherwise in accordance with the
Certificate of Formation, the Company LLC Agreement, any award agreement
(including any "Unit Award Agreement" as such term is defined in the Company
LLC Agreement) in respect of Class B Units and applicable Law, including the
DLLCA, as applicable) in cash by wire transfer of immediately available funds
to an account designated in writing by the Representative at least two
business days prior to the payment date and (2) Parent and the Representative
shall deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent instructing the
Escrow Agent to release the Adjustment Escrow Funds from the Adjustment Escrow
Account to the Paying Agent (for further distribution by the Paying Agent to
each Unitholder according to such Unitholder's Pro Rata Adjustment Escrow
Share of such Adjustment Escrow Funds and otherwise in accordance with the
Certificate of Formation, the Company LLC Agreement, any award agreement
(including any "Unit Award Agreement" as such term is defined in the Company
LLC Agreement) in respect of Class B Units and applicable Law, including the
DLLCA, as applicable); and 
 

  

  

(B) if the Closing Date Payment is greater than the Adjusted Closing Date
Payment (the amount of such difference, the " _Unitholder Shortfall_ "),
Parent and the Representative shall deliver joint written instructions to the
Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to deliver to Parent an amount equal
to the Unitholder Shortfall out of the Adjustment Escrow Account (and, if
applicable, out of the Indemnity Escrow Account as provided for in clause (y)
of the following proviso); _provided_ that (x) if the Unitholder Shortfall is
less than the Adjustment Escrow Funds (the amount by which the Unitholder
Shortfall is less than the Adjustment Escrow Funds is referred to as the "
_Adjustment Escrow Excess Amount_ "), Parent and the Representative shall
deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow
Agent to release the Adjustment Escrow Excess Amount from the Adjustment
Escrow Account to the Paying Agent (for further distribution by the Paying
Agent to each Unitholder according to such Unitholder's Pro Rata Adjustment
Escrow Share of such Adjustment Escrow Excess Amount and otherwise in
accordance with the Certificate of Formation, the Company LLC Agreement, any
award agreement (including any "Unit Award Agreement" as such term is defined
in the Company LLC Agreement) in respect of Class B Units and applicable Law,
including the DLLCA, as applicable) substantially simultaneously with the
payment to Parent of funds from the Adjustment Escrow Account and (y) if the
Unitholder Shortfall is more than the Adjustment Escrow Funds (the amount by
which the Unitholder Shortfall is more than the Adjustment Escrow Funds is
referred to as the " _Adjustment Escrow Shortfall Amount_ "), Parent and the
Representative shall deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent
instructing the Escrow Agent to release the Adjustment Escrow Shortfall Amount
from the Indemnity Escrow Account to Parent substantially simultaneously with
the payment to Parent of funds from the Adjustment Escrow Account.

  

  

 

11  

  

  

(iii) The parties' payment obligations under this Section 3.02(c) shall not be
subject to offset or reduction by reason of any actual or alleged breach of
any representation, warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement or any
right or alleged right of indemnification hereunder or for any other reason.
Parent shall have no liability with respect to the payments made in accordance
with the Closing Consideration Schedule or any amounts which the
Representative is required to distribute to the Unitholders pursuant to this
Agreement or the Indemnification Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, except
as otherwise contemplated by the Indemnification Agreement, in no event will
Parent or Merger Sub be required to pay amounts in the aggregate to the
Unitholders in excess of the Final Purchase Price.

  


 

  

(d) _Post-Closing Books and Records._ Following the Closing through the
resolution of any adjustment to the Closing Date Payment contemplated by this
Section 3.02, neither Parent nor the Representative shall take any action with
respect to the accounting books and records of the Company and its
subsidiaries on which the Closing Balance Sheet and the Final Statement is to
be based that could prevent, obstruct or otherwise affect (i) the results of
the procedures set forth in this Section 3.02, including the preparation of
the calculations of Closing Cash, Closing Working Capital and the Unpaid
Severance Amount, or (ii) the procedures set forth in this Section 3.02,

Except as set forth on the disclosure letter delivered by the Company to

the corresponding section or subsection of this Agreement, except to the
extent that it is reasonably apparent from the face of such disclosure that
such disclosure is relevant to another section or subsection of this

business or the ownership, leasing or operation of its properties or assets
makes such qualification or licensing necessary, other than where the failure

aggregate, Units entitled to cast votes constituting at least 100% of the
votes entitled to be cast on the adoption of this Agreement by holders of
Units outstanding on the Record Date, voting together as a single class. The
Written Consents of the Consenting Unitholders constitutes, alone and without
any other vote or consent of any other Unitholder, the Unitholder Approval.

  


 

  

SECTION 4.03. _Authority; Noncontravention._ (a) The Company has the requisite
power and authority to execute, deliver and perform this Agreement, to

of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms,
except as enforceability may be limited by the Bankruptcy Exceptions.

  

  

 

16  

  

  

(b) Except as may result from any facts or circumstances related solely to
Parent or Merger Sub, the execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement by the Company, the consummation by the Company of the transactions
contemplated hereby and the compliance by the Company with the provisions
hereof do not and will not conflict with, or result in any violation (i) of
the Company's or any of its subsidiaries' Organizational Documents, (ii) or
breach of, or default (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both)
under, or give rise to a right of, or result in, termination, cancellation or

(b) Except as may result from any facts or circumstances related solely to any
Unitholder, the Company or the Company's subsidiaries, the execution, delivery
and performance of this Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub and the
Indemnification Agreement by Parent and the consummation of the transactions

(c) Except as may result from any facts or circumstances related solely to any

other than (i) compliance with and filings under the HSR Act, (ii) compliance
with and filings under the Exchange Act and (iii) those Consents, filings and

nor the annual gross revenues from sales in, from or into Canada, of Parent
and its affiliates exceeds the amount set forth on Section 5.02(c) of the
Company Disclosure Letter, as determined in accordance with the Competition
Act (Canada) and the Notifiable Transactions Regulations promulgated
thereunder.

  


 

  

SECTION 5.03. _Brokers; Fees and Expenses._ The only broker or finder that has
acted for Parent or its affiliates in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby or that may be entitled to any brokerage fee,
finder's fee or commission in respect thereof is Moelis and Company, whose fees
or commissions will be paid by Parent.

  


 

  

SECTION 5.04. _Financing._ Parent affirms that it is not a condition to the
Closing or any of the its other obligations under this Agreement that Parent
obtains financing for or related to any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. Parent has provided the Company true, correct and complete
copies, as of the date hereof, of an executed commitment letter from the
financial institutions identified therein (the " _Lenders_ "), to provide,
subject to the terms and conditions therein, debt financing in the amounts set
forth therein for the purpose of funding in part the cash consideration for
the Merger (being collectively referred to as the " _Debt Financing_ ") and
all contracts, fee letters, engagement letters and other arrangements
associated therewith ( _provided_ that provisions in any fee letter or
engagement letter relating solely to fees and economic terms (other than
covenants) agreed to by the parties thereto may be redacted (none of which
redacted provisions could adversely affect the availability, conditionality,
enforceability, termination or aggregate principal amount of the Debt
Financing at the Closing); _provided_ , _further_ , that prior to execution of
this Agreement, Parent shall have advised the Company in writing of the
maximum amount of fees (including original issue discount) and an estimate of
expenses payable by Parent or its affiliates under such commitment letter, fee
letters and engagement letters) (such commitment letter and related term
sheets, including all exhibits, schedules and annexes, and each such fee
letter and engagement letter, as may be amended or replaced from time to time
to the extent permitted by Section 6.17, collectively, the " _Debt Financing
Commitment_ "). The Debt Financing Commitment is valid, binding and, to the
Knowledge of Parent, is enforceable by Parent against the other parties
thereto in accordance with its terms, subject to the Bankruptcy Exceptions. As
of the date hereof, the Debt Financing Commitment is in full force and effect
and the respective obligations and commitments have not been withdrawn,
rescinded or terminated (and, to the Knowledge of Parent, no such withdrawal,
rescission or termination is contemplated) or otherwise amended or modified in
any respect. As of the date hereof, no event has occurred which (with or
without notice, lapse of time, or both) would reasonably be expected to
constitute a breach in any material respect or default on the part of Parent
or, to the Knowledge of Parent, any of the other parties to the Debt Financing
Commitment. As of the date hereof, to the Knowledge of Parent, Parent does not
have any reason to believe that (a) any party to the Debt Financing Commitment
will be unable to satisfy on a timely basis any term thereof, (b) any of the
conditions to the Debt Financing will not be satisfied or (c) the full amount
of the Debt Financing will not be available to Parent on the Closing Date,
and, to the Knowledge of Parent, Parent is not aware of the existence of any
fact or event as of the date hereof that would be expected to cause such
conditions to the Debt Financing not to be satisfied or the full amount of the
Debt Financing not be available and the Merger not to occur. As of the date
hereof, no Lender has notified Parent of its intention to terminate any of the
Debt Financing Commitment or not to provide the Debt Financing. Assuming (i)
the satisfaction of the conditions in Sections 7.01 and 7.02 hereof and (ii)
that the Debt Financing is funded in accordance with its terms, the net
proceeds from the Debt Financing, together with cash on hand, will be
sufficient to fund the Estimated Purchase Price, the payment of any fees and
expenses of or payable by Parent, and any other amounts required to be paid by
Parent in connection with the consummation of the Merger. Parent has paid in
full any and all commitment or other fees required by the Debt Financing
Commitment that are due as of the date hereof, and will pay, after the date
hereof, all such fees as they become due. The Debt Financing Commitment
delivered to the Company contains all of the conditions precedent (none of
which have been redacted) to the obligations of the parties thereunder to fund
the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitment to be funded
on the Closing Date. There are no side letters or other Contracts (except for
any customary fee letters and/or engagement letters, true and complete copies
of which have been provided to the Company, with customary redactions (none of
which redacted terms would reasonably be expected to adversely affect the
principal amount or availability of the Debt Financing) relating to the Debt
Financing to which Parent or any of its subsidiaries is a party other than as
expressly set forth in the Debt Financing Commitment.

SECTION 5.05. _Exclusivity of Representations and Warranties_. Neither Parent
nor any of its affiliates are making any representation or warranty of any
kind or nature whatsoever, oral or written, express or implied, except as
expressly set forth in this Article V, and Parent hereby disclaims any such
other representations and warranties. Parent acknowledges and agrees that
except for the representations and warranties made by the Company or any
Unitholder in Article IV, the Indemnification Agreement, the applicable Holder
Agreement and in the Company Disclosure Letter, none of the Company, the
Unitholders or any of their respective affiliates makes any other
representation or warranty of any kind or nature whatsoever, oral or written,
express or implied with respect to the Company, the Unitholders or their
respective affiliates and Parent hereby disclaims reliance on any such other
representation or warranties.

  


 

  


 

  

 

40  

  

  

SECTION 5.06. _Solvency_. Neither Parent nor any of its subsidiaries have
taken any steps to seek protection pursuant to any law or statute relating to
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership, liquidation or winding
up, nor does Parent or any of its subsidiaries have any knowledge or reason to
believe that any of their respective creditors intend to initiate involuntary
bankruptcy proceedings or any actual knowledge of any fact which would
reasonably lead a creditor to do so. The Parent and its subsidiaries,
individually and on a consolidated basis, are not as of the date hereof, and
after giving effect to the transactions contemplated hereby to occur at the
Closing, will not be Insolvent.

  


 

  

SECTION 5.07. _Proceedings_. There are no material Proceedings pending or, to
the Knowledge of Parent, threatened against Parent or any of its subsidiaries,
at law or in equity, or before or by any federal, state, municipal or other
Governmental Entity, domestic or foreign, and neither Parent nor any of its
subsidiaries is subject to any outstanding material Judgment of any court or
other Governmental Entity that would reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

of doubt, the Surviving Company or any subsidiary of the Surviving Company

respect to the Merger, (ii) make any election to change the U.S. tax
classification the Company or any subsidiary of the Company which election has

otherwise increase the tax liability of any Unitholder (except as required by
a final determination of liability in respect of tax that, under applicable
Law, is not subject to further appeal, review or modification, including a
"determination" as defined in Section 1313(a) of the Code).

retained by or on behalf the Company or any of its affiliates prior to the
Closing in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, except to the

Takeover Proposal or (iii) approve, endorse, recommend, execute or enter into
any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle,
joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or merger, acquisition or
similar agreement constituting, contemplating or otherwise relating to any
Takeover Proposal or any inquiry or proposal that could reasonably be expected
to lead to a Takeover Proposal. The term " _Takeover Proposal_ " means any

be provided with (i) the annual base salary or wages in effect with respect to
such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date, (ii) annual
target incentive compensation opportunities that are substantially comparable
in the aggregate to the annual target incentive compensation opportunities in

transaction-related or other one-time retention bonus, and equity-based
compensation), and (iii) employee benefits (other than defined benefit
pensions or retiree or post-employment health and welfare benefits) that are
no less favorable, in the aggregate, than the employee benefits in effect with
respect to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date;
provided that, commencing January 1, 2018, Parent may, in its discretion,
provide to Continuing Employees in the United States employee benefits that
are no less favorable in the aggregate than the employee benefits provided to
similarly-situated employees of Parent and its affiliates.

  


 

  


 

  

 

51  

  


 

  

(b) Parent will cause each employee benefit plan or program of Parent or its
affiliates in which Continuing Employees are eligible to participate after the

purposes of benefit accrual in each vacation, severance or other paid-time off
plan or program), the service of such Continuing Employees prior to the
Closing with the Company or any of its subsidiaries (including any
predecessors thereto) as if such service were with Parent or its affiliates,
in each case to the same extent that such service was recognized by the
Company or any of its subsidiaries immediately prior to the Closing under the
corresponding Benefit Plan or Benefit Agreement; _provided_ that no such
crediting of service shall be required to the extent it would result in any
duplication of benefits.

  


 

  

(c) Parent will cause each employee benefit plan or program that is a group
health plan of Parent and its affiliates (including the Company or any of its
subsidiaries) in which Continuing Employees are eligible to participate after

(i) waive, or cause the waiver of, all limitations as to preexisting
conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and
coverage requirements, other than limitations or waiting periods that are
already in effect prior to the Closing with respect to such Continuing
Employee under the comparable Benefit Plan or Benefit Agreement and that have
not been satisfied as of the Closing, and (ii) use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause each New Plan to provide such Continuing Employee and his or
her eligible dependents with credit for any co-payments made, deductibles paid
and out-of-pocket expenses incurred under a corresponding provision of the
comparable Benefit Plan or Benefit Agreement during the portion of the plan
year ending on the date on which participation in the New Plan begins in
satisfying any applicable coinsurance, deductible or out-of-pocket
requirements under any such New Plan or reimburse such Continuing Employee for
such expenses if Parent deems appropriate to avoid or address hardship to such
Continuing Employee.

  


 

  

(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 6.10, Parent shall
comply, and cause each of its applicable affiliates (including the Company or
any of its subsidiaries) (i) to comply, with all applicable Laws, including
without limitation, foreign Laws, regarding the terms and conditions of
employment of, and the provision of compensation and benefits to, employees of
the Company and its subsidiaries, including but not limited to Continuing
Employees and (ii) to comply and satisfy all post-Closing obligations of the
Company and its subsidiaries with respect to employees and former employees of
the Company and its subsidiaries, including but not limited to Continuing
Employees, under applicable Laws or any Benefit Plan or Benefit Agreement as
in effect as of the Closing Date, provided that, any amendments to any Benefit
Plan or Benefit Agreement made between the date hereof and the Closing Date
shall be made in accordance with Section 6.01(b)(iii).

  


 

  


 

  

 

52  

  

  

(e) No earlier than fifteen (15) days, and no later than ten (10) days, prior

consultant or independent contractor of the Company of any of its
subsidiaries.

  


 

  

(f) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary and without limiting the
generality of Section 9.02, the parties hereby acknowledge and agree that all
provisions contained in this Section 6.10 are included for the sole benefit of
the parties, and that nothing in this Agreement, whether express or implied,
(i) shall be treated as an amendment or other modification of any Benefit
Plan, Benefit Agreement, New Plan or other employee benefit plan, program,
policy, arrangement or agreement (or an undertaking to amend any such plan or
arrangement), (ii) shall limit the right of Parent, the Company or their
respective affiliates to terminate, amend or otherwise modify any Benefit
Plan, Benefit Agreement, New Plan or other employee benefit plan, program,
policy, arrangement or agreement following the Closing or (iii) shall create
any third-party beneficiary or other right (A) in any other person, including
any Participant or any participant in any Benefit Plan, Benefit Agreement, New
Plan or other employee benefit plan, program, policy, arrangement or agreement
(or any dependent or beneficiary thereof) or (B) to continued employment with
Parent or the Company or any of their respective affiliates.

Existing DandO Policy for the year ended December 31, 2016, then Parent or the
Company, as applicable, shall only be required to offer the coverage available

consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger,
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any person, then, and in each such case, to the extent necessary,
proper provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the
Company, as the case may be, shall assume the applicable obligations set forth
in this 7.16.

  


 

  

(d) The rights of each Indemnified Person under this Section 6.15 shall

best efforts to (i) comply with its obligations under the Debt Financing
Commitment and any definitive agreements related thereto (the " _Debt
Financing Documents_ "), (ii) maintain in effect the Debt Financing
Commitment, (iii) negotiate and enter into Debt Financing Documents on a
timely basis on terms and conditions (including the "market flex" provisions)
contained in the Debt Financing Commitment or otherwise not less favorable in
any material respect with respect to conditionality to Parent in the aggregate
than those contained in the Debt Financing Commitment (it being understood and
agreed that in no event may any such Debt Financing Document contain any term
or condition that would not be permitted under this _Section 6.17_ if it were
an amendment, supplement, modification, waiver of any provision, or
replacement of the Debt Financing Commitment), (iv) satisfy on a timely basis
all conditions contained in the Debt Financing Commitment that are applicable
to Parent and within its control, including the payment of any commitment,
engagement or placement fees required as a condition to the Debt Financing and
(v) if all conditions to the Debt Financing Commitment have been satisfied,
cause the Lenders to consummate the Debt Financing at or prior to the Closing
Date (it being understood that it is not a condition to Closing under this
Agreement for Parent to obtain the Debt Financing). Parent shall give the
Company prompt notice upon having knowledge of any breach by any Lender under
the Debt Financing Documents or any termination of any of the Debt Financing
Documents. Other than as set forth in this Section 6.17, Parent shall not,

  


 

  


 

  

 

55  

  

  

without the prior written consent of the Company, amend, modify, supplement or
waive any of the conditions or contingencies to funding contained in the Debt
Financing Documents or any other provision of, or remedies under, the Debt
Financing Documents (other than in accordance with the "market flex"
provisions), in each case to the extent such amendment, modification,
supplement or waiver could reasonably be expected to have the effect of (A)
reducing the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing (including by increasing
the amount of fees to be paid or original issue discount) below what is
required to consummate the Merger, (B) imposing new or additional conditions
or contingencies or otherwise expanding, amending or modifying any of the
conditions to the Debt Financing or (C) otherwise expanding, amending or
modifying any other provision of the Debt Financing Commitment in a manner
that could reasonably be expected to (1) adversely affecting the ability of
Parent to (x) timely consummate the Merger and other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement on the Closing Date or (y) enforce its rights against other
parties to the Debt Financing Commitment or the definitive agreements with
respect thereto or (2) delay the Closing; _provided_ that notwithstanding any
other provision of this Agreement, Parent shall be entitled from time to time
to (aa) amend, restate, replace, supplement or otherwise modify, or waive any
of its rights under, the Debt Financing Commitment or substitute other
financing for all or any portion of the Debt Financing from the same or
alternative financing sources, and (bb) amend, restate, replace, supplement or
otherwise modify the Debt Financing Commitment for the purpose of adding
agents, co-agents, lenders, arrangers, bookrunners or other persons that have
not executed the Debt Financing Commitment as of the date hereof, in each
case, subject to subclauses (A), (B) and (C) above . Upon any such amendment,
supplement or modification, in accordance with the terms of this Section
6.17(a), the term " _Debt Financing Commitment_ " shall mean for all purposes
of this Agreement the Debt Financing Commitment as so amended, supplemented or
modified. Parent shall promptly deliver to the Company true, correct and
complete copies of any such amendment, supplement or modification (subject, in
the case of any fee letter or engagement letter, to redactions permitted by
Section 5.04). Parent shall keep the Representative reasonably informed and in
reasonable detail of any material activity concerning the Debt Financing
(including the status thereof). Parent shall provide to the Representative
copies of the Debt Financing Documents and such other information and
documentation as shall be reasonably requested by the Representative for
purposes of monitoring the progress of the financing activities. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent shall give the Representative
prompt written notice (and, in any event, no later than five (5) business
days) of (I) the termination or expiration of the Debt Financing Commitment or
Debt Financing Documents, (II) any breach or default (or any event or
circumstance that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, could
reasonably be expected to give rise to any breach or default) by Parent, or,
to the knowledge of Parent, any other party to the Debt Financing Commitment
or Debt Financing Documents, (III) the receipt of any notice or other
communication from any Lender or any other party to the Debt Financing
Commitment or the Debt Financing Documents with respect to (AA) any actual,
threatened or alleged breach, default, termination or repudiation by any party
to the Debt Financing Commitment or the Debt Financing Documents or of any
provisions of the Debt Financing Commitment or the Debt Financing Documents
(including any proposal by any Lender or any other party to the Debt Financing
Commitment or the Debt Financing Documents to withdraw, terminate or make any
material change in the terms of (including the amount of Debt Financing
contemplated) by the Debt Financing Commitment or (BB) any material dispute or
disagreement between or among any parties to the Debt Financing Commitment or
the Debt Financing Documents with respect to the obligation to fund the Debt
Financing or the amount of the Debt Financing to be funded at Closing, and
(IV) any good faith belief by Parent that it is likely that it will not be
able to obtain all or any portion of the Debt Financing on the terms and
conditions, in the manner or from the sources contemplated by any of the Debt
Financing Commitment or the Debt Financing Documents. Without limiting the
foregoing, as soon as reasonably practicable, but in any event within 2
business days of the date the Representative delivers to Parent a written
request therefor, Parent shall provide to the Representative and its
representatives any and all information reasonably requested by the
Representative relating to any circumstances referred to in clause (I), (II),
(III) or (IV) of the immediately preceding sentence.

  


 

  


 

  

 

56  

  


 

  

(b) In the event that all or any portion of the Debt Financing becomes
unavailable on the terms and conditions (including "market flex" provisions)
contemplated in the Debt Financing Commitment, Parent shall use its reasonable
best efforts to (i) promptly obtain the Debt Financing or such portion of the
Debt Financing from alternative sources in an amount sufficient, when added to
any portion of the Debt Financing that is available and cash on hand and other
readily available liquidity, to pay in cash all amounts required to be paid by
Parent in cash in connection with the Merger (" _Alternative Debt Financing_
") and (ii) obtain a new financing commitment letter (the " _Alternative Debt
Commitment Letter_ ") and a new definitive agreement with respect thereto that
provides for financing (A) on terms not less favorable in any material respect
to Parent (taking into account the "market flex" provisions of the existing
Debt Financing Commitment), (B) containing conditions and other terms that
would reasonably be expected to affect the availability thereof that (1) are
not more onerous, taken as a whole, than those conditions and terms contained
in the Debt Financing Commitment as of the date hereof and (2) would not
reasonably be expected to delay the Closing and (C) in an amount that is
sufficient, when added to any portion of the Debt Financing that is available
and cash on hand and other readily available liquidity, to pay in cash all
amounts required to be paid by Parent in cash in connection with the Merger.
In such event, the term " _Debt Financing_ " as used in this Agreement shall
be deemed to include any Alternative Debt Financing, and the term " _Debt
Financing Commitment_ " as used in this Agreement shall be deemed to include
any Alternative Debt Commitment Letter. Parent shall promptly deliver to the
Representative true, correct and complete copies of any such Alternative Debt
Commitment Letter (subject, in the case of any fee letter or engagement
letter, to redactions permitted by Section 5.04). For the avoidance of doubt,
the parties hereto agree that the Company shall cooperate with Parent to
obtain any Alternative Debt Financing in the manner and to the extent set
forth in Section 6.17(c).

  


 

  

(c) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
provide, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause any attorney,
accountant or other advisor, agent or representative retained by the Company
to provide, in each case at Parent's sole expense, all cooperation reasonably
requested by Parent that is customary in connection with Parent's efforts to
obtain the Debt Financing on terms contemplated by the Debt Financing
Commitment, including using reasonable best efforts to: (i) prior to the end
of the Marketing Period, participate in a reasonable number of meetings
(including with prospective Lenders), drafting sessions, due diligence
sessions and rating agency presentations in each case upon reasonable notice
and at mutually agreeable dates and times in connection with the Debt
Financing; (ii) furnish Parent and Lenders with (A) the historical financial
statements of the Company required by paragraph 5 of the Debt Financing
Commitment (as in effect on the date hereof) (such information referred to in
this clause (A), the " _Required Financial Information_ ") and (B) such other
financial information regarding the Company as is customarily provided in
connection with any financing comparable to the Debt Financing ( _provided_
that in connection with the foregoing clause (B), the Company

  

  


 

  

 

57  

  

  

shall only be obligated to deliver such financial information to the extent it
may be reasonably obtained from the books and records of the Company and its
subsidiaries without undue effort or expense); (iii) prior to the end of the
Marketing Period, reasonably assist Parent and the Lenders in the preparation
of (A) a customary bank information memorandum (as well as a public-side
version thereof) for the Debt Financing and(B) materials for rating agency
presentations; (iv) provide the Lenders, at least five (5) Business Days prior
to the Closing Date, with all documentation and other information required by
regulatory authorities and as reasonably requested in writing by Parent at

Company in connection with applicable "know your customer" and anti-money
laundering rules and regulations, including the USA PATRIOT ACT, Title III of
Pub. L. 107-56 (signed into law October 26, 2001) and (v) consent to the
reasonable use of the Company's trademarks, service marks or logos in
connection with the Debt Financing prior to the Closing Date; _provided_ that
such logos are used solely in a manner that is not intended to or reasonably
likely to harm or disparage the Company or any of the subsidiaries or the
reputation or goodwill of the Company or any of the subsidiaries. Parent
acknowledges and agrees that none of the Company or any of their respective
affiliates or any of their respective managers, directors, officers,
employees, representatives and advisors (including legal, financial and
accounting advisors) shall incur any liability to any person under or in
connection with the Debt Financing. Except in the case of Losses arising or
resulting from fraud as determined by a final, non-appealable judgment by a
court of competent jurisdiction, Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the
Company and their respective affiliates and managers, directors, officers,
employees, representatives and advisors (including legal, financial and
accounting advisors) from and against any and all Losses suffered or incurred
by them in connection with the arrangement of the Debt Financing or any
Alternative Debt Financing and any information utilized in connection
therewith (other than information provided by or on behalf of the Company
expressly for use in connection therewith). Parent shall, upon the request of
the Company, promptly reimburse the Company for all documented out-of-pocket
costs or expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with
cooperation provided for in this Section 6.17(c). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, (1) such requested cooperation shall not (x) unreasonably interfere
with the business or operations of the Company or its subsidiaries, (y) cause
significant competitive harm to the Company or its subsidiaries if the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement are not consummated or (z) result
in the material contravention of, or that could reasonably be expected to
result in a material violation or breach of, or a default under, any laws or
under any material contract to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is
a party in effect, (2) nothing in this _Section 6.17(c)_ shall require
cooperation to the extent that it would (x) cause any condition to the Closing
set forth in _Article VII_ to not be satisfied or (y) cause any breach of this
Agreement, (3) none of the Company or any of its subsidiaries shall be
required to (t) pay any commitment or other similar fee, (u) incur or assume
any liability in connection with the financings contemplated by the Debt
Financing Commitment or the Debt Financing Documents prior to the Closing, (v)
deliver or obtain auditor

  


 

  


 

  

 

58  

  


 

  


 

  

comfort letters or opinions of internal or external counsel, (w) provide
access to or disclose information where the Company determines that such
access or disclosure could jeopardize the attorney-client privilege or
contravene any law or contract, (x) deliver any audited financial statements
to the extent not already available to the Company, (y) require the Company to
prepare separate consolidating financial statements for the Company or any
subsidiary of the Company or (z) waive or amend any terms of this Agreement or
any other contract to which the Company or its subsidiaries is party, (4) none
of the directors of the Company, acting in such capacity, shall be required to
execute, deliver or enter into or perform any agreement, document or
instrument with respect to the Debt Financing or adopt any resolutions
approving the agreements, documents and instruments pursuant to which the Debt
Financing is obtained and (5) none of the Company, its subsidiaries or their
respective directors, officers or employees shall be required to execute,
deliver or enter into, or perform any agreement, document or instrument,
including any definitive agreements with respect to the Debt Financing, that
is not contingent upon the Closing or that would be effective prior to the
Closing Date and the directors and managers of the Company's subsidiaries
shall not be required to adopt resolutions approving the agreements, documents
and instruments pursuant to which the Debt Financing is obtained, in each case
which are effective prior to the Closing Date. Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, without limiting the Company's cooperation
obligations under this _Section 6.17(c)_ , with respect to Alternative Debt
Financing, if (I) the cooperation required to be provided pursuant to this
_Section 6.17(c)_ in connection with such Alternative Debt Financing is more
onerous to the Company than what is required to be provided pursuant to this
_Section 6.17(c)_ with respect to the Debt Financing Commitment in effect on
the date hereof and without giving effect to any Alternative Debt Financing
contemplated hereunder (to the extent more onerous, the " _Incremental Debt
Financing Cooperation_ ") and (II) the Company fails to provide any portion of
such Incremental Debt Financing Cooperation, then such failure to provide such
Incremental Debt Financing Cooperation shall not be deemed to be a breach of
this _Section 6.17(c)_ for purposes of Article VII of this Agreement (this
sentence, the " _Incremental Debt Financing Provision_ "). Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary, the Company shall be deemed to have complied with
this _Section 6.17(c)_ for all purposes of this Agreement (including _Article
VII_ and _Article VIII_ ) unless the Debt Financing has not been obtained
primarily as a result of the Company's willful breach of its obligations under
this _Section 6.17(c)_. For the avoidance of doubt, the parties hereto
acknowledge and agree that the provisions contained in this _Section 6.17(c)_
represent the sole obligation of the Company, its subsidiaries and affiliates
and their respective directors, officers or employees with respect to
cooperation in connection with the arrangement of the Debt Financing and no
other provision of this Agreement (including the Exhibits and Schedules
hereto) shall be deemed to expand or modify such obligations.

SECTION 9.05. _Counterparts._ This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement, and
shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each
of the parties and delivered, in person or by facsimile, or by electronic
image scan, receipt acknowledged, to the other parties.

  


 

  

SECTION 9.06. _Integrated Contract._ This Agreement, including the Company
Disclosure Letter and the Exhibits and Schedules hereto, any written
amendments to the foregoing satisfying the requirements of Section 9.13 hereof
and the Confidentiality Agreement, the Indemnification Agreement, the Holder
Agreements and the Escrow Agreement, constitute the entire agreement between
the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof and
supersede any previous agreements and understandings between the parties with
respect to such matters. All Exhibits and Schedules attached hereto or
referred to herein are hereby incorporated in and made a part of this
Agreement as if set forth in full herein. Any term used in the Company
Disclosure Letter or any Exhibit or Schedule hereto but not otherwise defined
therein shall be defined as set forth in this Agreement.

  


 

  

SECTION 9.07. _Severability._ The invalidity, illegality or unenforceability
of any portion of this Agreement shall not affect the validity, force or
effect of the remaining portions of this Agreement. If it is ever held that
any restriction hereunder is too broad to permit enforcement of such
restriction to its fullest extent, each party agrees that a court of competent
jurisdiction may enforce such restriction to the maximum extent permitted by
Law, and each party hereby consents and agrees that such scope may be
judicially modified accordingly in any Proceeding brought to enforce such
restriction.

  


 

  

SECTION 9.08. _Governing Law._ This Agreement and disputes relating hereto
(whether for breach of contract, tortious conduct or otherwise) shall be
governed and construed in accordance with the Laws of the State of Delaware,
without reference to its conflicts of law principles; _provided_ that
notwithstanding the foregoing, all matters relating to the Debt Financing
shall be exclusively governed and construed in accordance with the Laws of the
State of New York without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law
provision or rule whether of the State of New York or any other jurisdiction
that would cause the application of Law of any jurisdiction other than the
State of New York and each of the parties hereto agrees that the waiver of
jury trial set forth in Section 9.11 shall be applicable to any such matter.

  


 

  

SECTION 9.09. _Jurisdiction._ (a) Each party irrevocably agrees that any
Proceeding against it arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby or disputes relating hereto (whether for
breach of contract, tortious conduct or otherwise) shall be brought
exclusively in a federal court sitting in the State of Delaware located in New
Castle County, or, if such court does not have subject matter jurisdiction, in
the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware located in New Castle County,
and irrevocably accepts and submits to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of
the aforesaid courts in personam with respect to any such Proceeding. Each of
Parent, Merger Sub and the Company irrevocably and unconditionally waives any
objection to the laying of venue of any Proceeding arising out of or in
connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or
disputes relating hereto (whether for breach of contract, tortious conduct or
otherwise) in (i) the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware located in
New Castle County or (ii) any federal court sitting in the State of Delaware
located in New Castle County and irrevocably and unconditionally waives and
agrees not to plead or claim in any such court that any such Proceeding
brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. This
Section 9.09 shall not apply to any dispute under Section 3.02 that is
required to be decided by the Independent Expert.

  

  


 

  

 

73  

  

  

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, each of the
parties hereto agrees that it will not bring, or permit any of its affiliates
to bring, any suit, action or other proceeding of any kind or description,
whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise,
against any Lender or any Lender Related Party arising out of or relating to
(x) the Debt Financing or (y) this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement in any forum other than a court of competent
jurisdiction located within Borough of Manhattan in the City of New York, New
York, whether a state or federal court, and each of the parties hereto agrees
that the waiver of jury trial set forth in Section 9.11 shall be applicable to
any such suit, action or other proceeding.

  


 

  

SECTION 9.10. _Service of Process._ Each party agrees that service of any
process, summons, notice or document by U.S. registered mail to such party's
respective address set forth in Section 9.03 shall be effective service of
process for any Proceeding in Delaware with respect to any matters for which
it has submitted to jurisdiction pursuant to Section 9.09.

  


 

  

SECTION 9.11. _Waiver of Jury Trial._ Each party hereby waives, to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable Law, any right it may have to a trial by jury
in respect of any Proceeding arising out of or in connection with this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or disputes relating hereto
(whether for breach of contract, tortious conduct or otherwise). Each party
(a) certifies that no representative, agent or attorney of any other party has
represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other party would not, in the
event of any Proceeding, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver and (b)
acknowledges that it and the other parties have been induced to enter into
this Agreement by, among other things, the mutual waivers and certifications
in this Section 9.11.

  


 

  

SECTION 9.12. _Enforcement._ The parties agree that irreparable damage would
occur, for which monetary damages (even if available) would not be an adequate
remedy, and that the parties would not have any adequate remedy at Law in the
event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is
accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions or specific performance or other equitable relief to prevent
breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the provisions of this Agreement, this being in addition to any other remedy
to which the parties are entitled at Law or in equity. Each party agrees that
it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and
other equitable relief on the basis that any other party has an adequate
remedy at Law or that any award of specific performance is not an appropriate
remedy for any reason at law or in equity. Each party hereby waives any
requirements for the securing or posting of any bond with such equitable
remedy.

  


 

  


 

  

 

74  

  

  

SECTION 9.13. _Amendments._ This Agreement may be amended, modified,
superseded or canceled only by an instrument in writing signed by the Company,
Parent and Merger Sub and any of the provisions hereof may be waived only by
an instrument in writing signed by or on behalf of the party waiving
compliance; _provided_ that following the Unitholder Approval, there shall be
no amendment or change to the provisions hereof which by Law would require
further approval by the Unitholders without such approval; _provided, further_
that Sections 8.02, 9.02, 9.06, 9.08, 9.09(b), 9.11, this 9.13 and 9.14 (in
each case, together with any related definitions and other provisions of this
Agreement to the extent a modification or termination would serve to modify
the substance or provisions or such sections) may not be amended, modified,
superseded, canceled or waived in a manner that is adverse to the Lenders or
the Lender Related Parties without the prior written consent of the Lenders.

  


 

  

SECTION 9.14. _No Recourse to Lenders_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, the Company (i) agrees on its behalf and on behalf

their respective affiliates relating to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Debt Financing),

Party in connection with this Agreement (including any of the transactions
contemplated hereby) and the Debt Financing, whether at law or equity, in
contract, in tort or otherwise and (iii) agrees not to, and shall not, (A)
seek to enforce this Agreement against, make any claims for breach of this
Agreement, or seek to recover monetary damages (including, for the avoidance
of doubt, any special, consequential, punitive, indirect, speculative or
exemplary damages or damages of a tortious nature) from, any Lender or any
Lender Related Party or (B) seek to enforce the commitment in respect of any
Debt Financing against, make any claims for breach of commitments in respect
of any Debt Financing against, or seek to recover monetary damages (including,
for the avoidance of doubt, any special, consequential, punitive, indirect,
speculative or exemplary damages or damages of a tortious nature) from, or
otherwise sue, any Lender or any Lender Related Party for any reason in
connection with commitments in respect of any Debt Financing or the
obligations of the Lenders and the Lender Related Parties thereunder, this
Agreement, or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or Debt
Financing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this _Section 9.14_ shall
in any way limit or modify any Lender's obligations to Parent under the Debt
Financing Commitment or any obligation of any Lender to the Company and its
subsidiaries following the Closing Date.

  


 

  

SECTION 9.15. _Further Assurances._ Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub
agrees to execute and deliver, upon the written request of any other party,
any and all such further instruments and documents as are reasonably
appropriate for the purpose of obtaining the full benefits of this Agreement.

  


 

  


 

  

 

75  

  

  

SECTION 9.16. _Acknowledgement._ Each party acknowledges and agrees that (i)
none of the other parties hereto, any of such other parties' subsidiaries or
any of their respective officers or directors has made any representation or
warranty, expressed or implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of any

hereby agrees, on its own behalf and on behalf of its directors, members,
partners, officers, employees and affiliates, that Schulte Roth and Zabel LLP
may serve as counsel to the Unitholders, on the one hand, and the Company, on
the other hand, in connection with the negotiation, preparation, execution and

Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and each of the
parties to this Agreement consents to such representation and waives any
conflict of interest arising from such representation, and each of such
parties shall cause any affiliate to consent to waive any conflict of interest
arising from such representation.

  


 

  

SECTION 9.18. _Survival of Covenants, Agreements, Representations and
Warranties._ For purposes of this Article IX (and notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in this Agreement or otherwise), the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement shall be
deemed to survive the Closing and to remain in full force and effect,
regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any party, until the
indemnification obligation therefor terminates in accordance with the
Indemnification Agreement.

  


 

  

SECTION 9.19. _Representative._ (a) The Company hereby irrevocably appoints
the Representative as each Unitholder's true and lawful representative,
attorney-in-fact and agent of the Unitholders in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and in any litigation or
arbitration involving this Agreement. By its approval of the Merger and the
adoption of this Agreement and/or its acceptance of any consideration pursuant
to this Agreement, each Unitholder hereby irrevocably approve and adopt the
appointment of the Representative. In connection therewith, the Representative
is authorized to do or refrain from doing all further acts and things, and to
execute all such documents as the Representative shall deem necessary or
appropriate, and shall have the power and authority to:

  


 

  

(i) act for some or all of the Unitholders with regard to all matters
pertaining to this Agreement;

  


 

  

(ii) act for the Unitholders to transact matters relating to Proceedings;

  


 

  


 

  

 

76  

  


 

  


 

  

(iii) execute and deliver all amendments, waivers, ancillary agreements,
certificates and documents that the Representative deems necessary or
appropriate in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement;

  


 

  

(iv) receive funds, make payments of funds, and give receipts for funds;

  


 

  

(v) do or refrain from doing, on behalf of the Unitholders, any further act or
deed that the Representative deems necessary or appropriate in the
Representative's discretion relating to the subject matter of this Agreement,
in each case as fully and completely as the Unitholders could do if personally
present;

  


 

  

(vi) give and receive all notices required to be given or received by the
Unitholders under this Agreement;

  


 

  

(vii) give any written direction to the Paying Agent or the Escrow Agent on
behalf of the Unitholders; and

  


 

  

(viii) receive service of process in connection with any claims under this
Agreement.

  


 

  

All decisions and actions of the Representative on behalf of the Unitholders
shall be binding upon all Unitholders, and no Unitholder shall have the right
to object, dissent, protest or otherwise contest the same.

  


 

  

(b) The Representative shall act for the Unitholders on all of the matters set
forth in this Agreement in the manner the Representative believes to be in the
best interest of the Unitholders. The Representative is authorized to act on
behalf of the Unitholders notwithstanding any dispute or disagreement among
the Unitholders. In taking any action as Representative, the Representative
may rely conclusively, without any further inquiry or investigation, upon any
certification or confirmation, oral or written, given by any person whom the
Representative reasonably believes to be authorized thereunto. The
Representative may, in all questions arising hereunder, rely on the advice of
counsel, and the Representative shall not be liable to any of the parties
hereto or to any Unitholder for anything done, omitted or suffered in good
faith by the Representative based on such advice. The Representative
undertakes to perform such duties and only such duties as are specifically set
forth in this Agreement and no implied covenants or obligations shall be read
into this Agreement against the Representative. The Representative shall not
have any liability to any of the parties hereto or the Unitholders for any act
done or omitted hereunder as Representative while acting in good faith. To the
extent not satisfied from the Representative Account, the Representative shall
be entitled to reimbursement, from the Unitholders for all reasonable
expenses, disbursements and advances (including fees and disbursements of its
counsel, experts and other agents and consultants) incurred by the
Representative in such capacity, and for indemnification against any loss,
liability or expenses arising out of actions taken or omitted to be taken in
its capacity as the Representative (except for those arising out of the
Representative's bad faith or willful misconduct), including the costs and
expenses of investigation and defense of claims.

  


 

  


 

  

 

77  

  

  

(c) The Representative shall have reasonable access to relevant information
about the Company for purposes of performing the Representative's duties and
exercising the Representative's rights hereunder; _provided_ that the
Representative shall treat confidentially and not disclose any nonpublic
information from or about the Company to anyone except (i) in connection with
any disputes arising out of or in connection with this Agreement and (ii) as
required by law or to its employees, advisors or consultants and to the
Unitholders, in each case who have a need to know such information, provided
that such persons are bound by obligations of confidentiality to the
Representative of at least as high a standard as those imposed on the
Representative under this Agreement.

  


 

  

(d) In the event the Representative becomes unable to perform the
Representative's responsibilities hereunder or resigns from such position, the
Unitholders (acting by a written instrument signed by Unitholders who held, as
of immediately prior to the Effective Time, a majority (measured on an as-
exercised and as-converted basis) of the then outstanding Units) shall select
another representative to fill the vacancy of the Representative, and such
substituted representative shall be deemed to be the Representative for all
purposes of this Agreement. The Representative may be removed only upon
delivery of written notice to Parent signed by persons who, as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time, held a majority (measured on an as-exercised and
as-converted basis) of the then outstanding Units.

  


 

  

(e) For all purposes of this Agreement:

  


 

  

(i) Parent shall be entitled to rely conclusively on the instructions and
decisions of the Representative as to the settlement of any disputes or claims
under this Agreement, or any other actions required or permitted to be taken
by the Representative hereunder, and no party hereunder or any Unitholder
shall have any cause of action against Parent for any action taken by Parent
in reliance upon the instructions or decisions of the Representative;

  


 

  

(ii) the provisions of this Section 9.19 are independent and severable, are
irrevocable (subject only to Section 9.19(e)) and coupled with an interest and
shall be enforceable notwithstanding any rights or remedies that any
Unitholder may have in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; and

  


 

  

(i) the provisions of this Section 9.19 shall be binding upon the executors,
heirs, legal representatives, personal representatives, successor trustees and
successors of each Unitholder, and any references in this Agreement to a
Unitholder shall mean and include the successors to the rights of each
applicable Unitholder hereunder, whether pursuant to testamentary disposition,
the laws of descent and distribution or otherwise.

  


 

  

SECTION 9.20. _Indemnification Agreement; Escrow Agreement._ By its approval
of the Merger and the adoption of this Agreement and/or its acceptance of any
consideration pursuant to this Agreement, each Unitholder hereby (a) agrees to
the terms and conditions of the Indemnification Agreement, including the
indemnification obligations set forth in Article II thereof, and any written
amendments to the Indemnification Agreement satisfying the requirements of
Section 4.13 thereof, makes the representations and warranties set forth in
Article III thereof and otherwise agrees to be bound thereby, regardless of
whether such Unitholder executes and delivers a signed counterpart of the
Indemnification Agreement, and (b) acknowledges and consents to the terms of
the Escrow Agreement, and any written amendments thereto satisfying the
requirements of Section 18 thereof.
