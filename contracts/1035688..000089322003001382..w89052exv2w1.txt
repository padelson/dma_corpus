Sheet shall include a footnote reflecting the amount of accrued reserves for
each open cost report of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries. Attached
to the Closing Date Balance Sheet shall be a schedule setting forth the
reserves on the Closing Date Balance Sheet in substantially the same level of
detail as Stockholder has previously provided in writing to Buyer with
respect to the Company\'s December 31, 2002 and March 31, 2003 balance
sheets. The Closing Date Balance Sheet shall be prepared in accordance with
GAAP using the same GAAP accounting principles, practices, methodologies and
policies as the Balance Sheet, except as provided in Schedule 2.4(a). From
the Closing Date Balance Sheet, Buyer shall prepare and deliver
to Stockholder, within such 90-day period, a statement (the "Statement")
setting forth the calculation of the Working Capital as of the Closing (the
"Closing Date Working Capital"). After the Closing Date, at Buyer\'s request,
Stockholder shall provide Buyer and its representatives any information
reasonably requested and shall provide them access at all reasonable times to
the personnel, properties, books and records relating to the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries for such purpose.   (b) Objections; Resolution of
Disputes.   (i) Unless Stockholder notifies Buyer in writing within  30
days after Buyer\'s delivery of the Statement of any objection to the 
computation of Closing Date Working Capital set forth therein (the  "Notice
of Objection"), the Statement shall become final and   8     binding.
During such 30-day period, Stockholder and its representatives  shall be
permitted to review the working papers of Buyer and Buyer\'s  accountants
relating to the Statement, and Buyer shall provide  Stockholder and its
representatives any information reasonably  requested and shall provide them
access at all reasonable times to the  personnel, properties, books and
records relating to the Company and  the Company Subsidiaries for such
purpose. Any Notice of Objection  shall specify in reasonable detail the
basis for the objections set  forth therein. Any Notice of Objection shall
include only objections  based on (A) mathematical errors in the computation
of Closing Date  Working Capital or (B) Closing Date Working Capital not
having been  calculated in accordance with Section 2.4(a).   (ii) If
Stockholder provides the Notice of Objection to  Buyer within such 30-day
period, Stockholder and Buyer shall, during  the 30-day period following
Buyer\'s receipt of the Notice of Objection,  attempt in good faith to
resolve Stockholder\'s objections. During such  30-day period, Buyer and its
representatives shall be permitted to  review the working papers of
Stockholder and Stockholder\'s accountants  relating to the Notice of
Objection and the basis therefor. If  Stockholder and Buyer are unable to
resolve all such objections within  such 30-day period, the matters remaining
in dispute shall be submitted  to a nationally recognized public accounting
firm mutually agreed upon  and jointly engaged by Stockholder and Buyer and,
if Stockholder and  Buyer are unable to so agree within 10 days after the end
of such  30-day period, then Stockholder and Buyer shall each select such a
firm  and such firms shall jointly select a third nationally recognized
firm  to be jointly engaged by Stockholder and Buyer to resolve the
disputed  matters (such selected firm being the "Independent Expert"). The 
parties shall instruct the Independent Expert to render its reasoned  written
decision as promptly as practicable but in no event later than  60 days after
its selection. The resolution of disputed items by the  Independent Expert
shall be final and binding, and the determination of  the Independent Expert
shall constitute an arbitral award that is  final, binding and non-appealable
and upon which a judgment may be  entered by a court having jurisdiction
thereover. The fees and expenses  of the Independent Expert shall be
allocated between Stockholder and  Buyer in such a way that Buyer shall be
responsible for that portion of  the fees and expenses equal to such fees and
expenses multiplied by a  fraction the numerator of which is the aggregate
dollar value of  disputed items submitted to the Independent Expert by
Stockholder that  are resolved against Buyer (as finally determined by the
Independent  Expert) and the denominator of which is the total dollar value
of the  disputed items so submitted by Stockholder, and Stockholder shall
be  responsible for the remainder of such fees and expenses.   (c)
Adjustment Payment. Within 10 days after the Statement has become final and
binding in accordance with this Section 2.4, (i) if the Closing Date Working
Capital is greater than the Target Working Capital, Buyer shall pay to (x)
the account designated pursuant to Section 2.2(b)(iii) an amount in cash
(subject to any required employment-related withholding) equal to the product
of (I) the difference between the Closing Date Working Capital minus the
Target Working Capital (such difference, the "Adjustment Amount") times
(II) a fraction the numerator of which is the aggregate number of Company
Options and Company Stock Units outstanding as of the Closing and the
denominator of which is the aggregate number of Shares, Company Options and
Company Stock Units outstanding as of the Closing (such   9    numbers
to be disclosed in writing to Buyer by the Company prior to Closing), and (y)
Stockholder an amount in cash equal to the (I) the Adjustment Amount minus
(II) the amount paid pursuant to the immediately preceding clause (x) and the
amount of any employment-related withholdings; and (ii) if the Closing
Date Working Capital is less than the Target Working Capital, Stockholder
shall pay to Buyer an amount in cash equal to such difference. Any such
payment hereunder shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to an account designated in writing by Stockholder or Buyer, as the
case may be. In the event of any payment to be made under subclause (i)(x) of
the first sentence of this Section 2.4(c) above, Stockholder shall provide to
Buyer prior to such payment a schedule setting forth the allocation of the
gross amount so payable among the holders of the Company Options and Company
Stock Units. Buyer shall calculate employment-related withholding amounts
based on such allocation and shall provide Stockholder on the date the
related payment is made a schedule showing the calculation of the amounts so
withheld with respect to each such holder. Buyer shall pay to the Company
such amounts as were withheld under the immediately preceding sentence and
the Company shall remit such amounts to the appropriate Governmental Agency.
Buyer shall, or shall cause the Company to, comply with all applicable Tax
reporting requirements with respect to such payments. Buyer and Stockholder
shall cooperate in the preparation of the schedules described above and in
all matters related to the required withholding of Taxes with respect to
payments to be made under this Section.   (d) Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary herein, Buyer shall not be required to make any payment to any
holders of Company Options or Company Stock Units in respect of such Company
Options or Company Stock Units, it being understood that any payment due such
holders in respect of such Company Options or Company Stock Units shall be
made by Stockholder pursuant to the Distribution Agreement, and Stockholder
shall indemnify and hold harmless any Buyer Indemnitee (as defined in Section
9.2(a)) against and from any claims to the contrary made by the holders of
Company Options or Company Stock Units.   ARTICLE 3. REPRESENTATIONS AND

relating to employee wage withholding.   Section 3.18 Insurance. Schedule
3.18 contains a true and complete list of all insurance policies or binders
of insurance or programs of self-insurance maintained by or on behalf of the
Company or Company Subsidiaries and/or the properties leased by the Company
or Company Subsidiaries, as the case may be, in effect for policy periods
beginning on or after July 1, 2002 indicating for each policy the carrier,
risks insured, the amounts of coverage, deductible, premium rate, cash value
if any, whether such policy is on an "occurrence" or "claims made" basis,
expiration date and whether the program was retrospectively rated. All such
policies are in full force and effect. True and complete copies of all such
insurance policies and binders have been made available for inspection by
Buyer prior to the date of this Agreement. The coverage under each such
policy and binder is in full force and effect, and no written notice of
cancellation or non-renewal has been received by the Company or any Company
Subsidiary, except as set forth on Schedule 3.18. To the Knowledge of the
Company, the Company and Company Subsidiaries, as the case may be, are not in
material default under any of such policies. Except as set forth on Schedule
3.18, all installments for premiums under such policies are current. No
insurance company has issued a reservation of rights or denial of
coverage for any claim currently pending against the Company or any Company
Subsidiary, except as set forth on Schedule 3.18. Since January 1, 2002,
neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has been refused any
insurance. Except as disclosed on Schedule 3.18, neither the Company nor any
Company Subsidiary is now, nor will in the future be obligated to pay any
retrospectively rated premiums, deductible amounts or self-insured retentions
in connection with any insurance policies. Since January 1, 2002, to the
Company\'s Knowledge, there has not been any failure to present any material
claim under any such policy in a timely fashion or in the manner or detail
required by the policy. Catherine Wiggins is the corporate risk manager of
the Company, is the employee of the Company to whom all material incident
reports are required by corporate policy and procedure to be sent and such
person does not delegate the responsibility for receipt of such reports.  
Section 3.19 Labor Relations and Employment. There is no labor strike or
material labor dispute, slowdown, stoppage or lockout pending, or to the
Knowledge of the Company, threatened against or affecting the Company or any
Company Subsidiary. To the Knowledge of the Company, there are no
union claims to represent the employees of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary, and there are no current union organizing activities among the
employees of the Company or any Company Subsidiary. Neither the Company nor
any Company Subsidiary is a party to or bound by any collective bargaining or
similar agreement with any labor organization, or work rules or practices
agreed to with any labor organization or employee association, applicable to
employees of the Company or such Company Subsidiary, as the case may be.
Except as set forth on Schedule 3.19, neither the Company nor any Company
Subsidiary has experienced any material work stoppage, strike, slowdown or,
to the Knowledge of the Company, union organizational efforts since January
1, 1999.   24     Section 3.20 Medicare Participation/Accreditation.  
(a) The Company and each Company Subsidiary, as applicable, are qualified for
participation in the Medicare, Medicaid, CHAMPUS and TRICARE programs, have
current and valid provider contracts with such programs and are, and have
been, in compliance in all material respects with the conditions of
participation in such programs with respect to each participating location,
except as set forth on Schedule 3.20. Set forth on Schedule 3.20 are all of
the Company\'s and the Company Subsidiaries\' provider numbers, a list of the
outpatient clinics, hospitals or contracts that are billing for
services utilizing such provider numbers and the type of designation of such
facility or service billed. Except as set forth on Schedule 3.20, neither the
Company nor any Company Subsidiary has received any written notice from any
of the Medicare, Medicaid, CHAMPUS or TRICARE programs, of any pending or
threatened investigation or survey, and neither the Company nor any Company
Subsidiary has reason to believe that any such investigation or survey is
pending or threatened, other than that which would not reasonably be
expected, individually or in the aggregate, to have a Material Adverse
Effect.   (b) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has received
notice of any pending or threatened investigation or inquiry (other than
routine surveys and audits that have not resulted in an investigation
or inquiry) from any governmental agency, fiscal intermediary, carrier or
similar entity that enforces or administers the statutory or regulatory
provisions in respect of any governmental health care program. There are no
outstanding judgments orders, writs, injunctions or decrees of any
Governmental Agency in respect of any governmental health care program
against the Company or any Company Subsidiary which would result in liability
to the Company or the Company Subsidiaries in excess of $25,000 (whether or
not covered by insurance) or that would materially affect or delay the
Company\'s or any Company Subsidiary\'s performance of this Agreement. There
are no material, non-monetary orders, writs, injunctions or decrees of any
Governmental Agency outstanding in respect of any governmental health care
program against the Company or any Company Subsidiary.   Section 3.21 Cost
Reports and Other Filings. Except as set forth on Schedule 3.21, each cost
report and other required claims and governmental filings ("Filings") with
respect to Medicare and each state Medicaid program in which they participate
required to be filed by or on behalf of the Company or a Company Subsidiary
on or prior to the Closing Date has been or will be timely filed and all
amounts shown on such cost reports as owed by the Company or a Company
Subsidiary have been or will be paid timely. All of such Filings were, when
filed or as they have been subsequently amended, true and complete in all
material respects. The Company has made available for inspection by Buyer
prior to the date of this Agreement each such Filing. Schedule 3.21 lists the
Medicare and Medicaid cost reports filed by the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries for any period after December 31, 1996 for which the Company or
any Company Subsidiary could be liable. Schedule 3.21 sets forth which of
such cost reports have been audited and finally settled, audited but not
finally settled and neither audited nor settled, and a brief description
of any and all notices of program reimbursement, proposed or pending
audit adjustments, disallowances, appeals of disallowances, and any and all
other unresolved claims or disputes in respect of such cost reports. There is
no basis for any claims against the Company or any Company Subsidiary by any
third-party payors other than routine Medicare and Medicaid audit adjustments
which adjustments have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary  
25    has received any written notice that Medicare or Medicaid has any
claims against it which could result in offsets against future reimbursement
in excess of that provided for in the Balance Sheet.   Section 3.22
Exclusion. To the Knowledge of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries,
neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary employs or contracts with any
person who has been excluded from participation in a federal health care
program (as defined in 42 U.S.C. Section 1320a-7b(f)) where such action could
reasonably serve as a basis for the Company\'s or any Company Subsidiary\'s
suspension or exclusion from the Medicare or any state Medicaid program.  
Section 3.23 Federal Health Care Programs.   (a) Neither the Company, any
Company Subsidiary, any affiliate nor any person who has a direct or indirect
ownership interest (as those terms are defined in 42 C.F.R. Section
1001.1001(a)(2)) in the Company or any Company Subsidiary of 5% or more, or
who has an ownership or control interest (as defined in Section 1124(a)(3) of
the Social Security Act or any regulations promulgated thereunder) in the
Company or any Company Subsidiary, or who is an officer, director, agent or
managing employee (as defined in 42 C.F.R. Section 1001.1001(a)(i)): (a)
except as set forth on Schedule 3.23, has had a civil monetary penalty
assessed against it under Section 1128A of the Social Security Act or any
regulations promulgated thereunder; (b) has been excluded from participation
under any federal health care program; or (c) has been convicted (as that
term is defined in 42 C.F.R. Section 1001.2) of any of the categories of
offenses as described in the Social Security Act Section 1128(a) and (b)(1),
(2), (3) or any regulations promulgated thereunder.   (b) All home office
cost reports filed by the Company and each Company Subsidiary are true and
complete and the costs contained in such reports are appropriately included
therein and have been properly allocated among the Company and each Company
Subsidiary and businesses in accordance with Medicare and Medicaid rules and
regulations.   (c) To the Knowledge of the Company, no action is pending or
threatened to suspend, limit or terminate the status of the Company or
any Company Subsidiary as a provider in any federal health care program.
Except as set forth on Schedule 3.23, neither the Company nor any Company
Subsidiary has received notice that a third party private payor intends to
terminate or fail to renew any contractual arrangement with the Company or
any Company Subsidiary from which the Company derived more than $100,000 in
revenue during 2002.   Section 3.24 Billing; Gratuitous Payments. Except as
set forth in Schedule 3.24, all billing by, or on behalf of, the Company or
any Company Subsidiary to third-party payors, including, but not limited
to, Medicare, Medicaid and private insurance companies has been true and
complete in all material respects. Neither the Company nor any Company
Subsidiary has received any notice from any third-party payor, including but
not limited to, Medicare or Medicaid, that indicates that Buyer could not
continue to bill in substantially the same manner and structure as the
Company or any Company Subsidiary is billing on the date hereof.  
26     Section 3.25 Reimbursement Matters. Except as disclosed on
Schedule 3.25, for the previous three years, the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries have not received any written notice of denial of
payment or overpayment of a material nature from a federal health care
program or any other third party reimbursement source (inclusive of managed
care organizations) with respect to items or services provided by the Company
and/or any Company Subsidiary, other than those which have been finally
resolved in any settlement for an amount less than $100,000. Neither the
Company nor any Company Subsidiary is subject to (i) a "focused review" of
claims by Medicare or (ii) a "Corporate Integrity Agreement" or similar
government - mandated compliance program.   Section 3.26 No Criminal
Proceedings. Except as set forth on Schedule 3.26, there are no pending
actions, charges, indictments or investigations of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary or, with respect to their employment with the Company or any
Company Subsidiary, their agents, officers or employees which involve
allegations of criminal violations by the Company or any Company Subsidiary
or their agents, officers or employees acting on behalf of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary of any federal, state or local statute, law or ordinance,
including, without limitation, Medicare or Medicaid.   Section 3.27 Bank
Accounts. Schedule 3.27 sets forth a list of all bank and securities accounts
and lockboxes maintained by the Company or any Company Subsidiary.  
Section 3.28 Brokers or Finders. Except for J.P. Morgan Securities, Inc.
("JPMorgan") and Lehman Brothers Inc., whose fees shall be paid by the
Company (provided that any such payment results in a reduction of
Closing Date Working Capital) or Stockholder, no broker, finder or investment
banker is entitled to any fee or commission from the Company, any Company
Subsidiary or Stockholder for services rendered on behalf of the Company, any
Company Subsidiary or Stockholder in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.  B. Representations and Warranties of

notice, Buyer shall inform the Company in writing as to whether Buyer
consents or does not consent to the contemplated action or inaction. If
Buyer   32    takes no action in writing with respect to such notice

have consented to such contemplated action or inaction.   (c) The Company,
upon written notice to Buyer, may, at any time after the date hereof through

out of or results from any actions taken by the Company or any Company

in the second sentence of Section 5.1(a) and otherwise permitted by this
Agreement and, if existing or occurring at the date hereof, would have been
required to be listed or described in one or more of the Schedules. Such
amendments or additions shall qualify the representations and warranties made
by the Company on the Closing Date and for purposes of Section 9.1
hereof.   Section 5.2 Pre-Closing Access to Properties and Records;
Confidentiality. Between the date hereof and the Closing Date, the Company
will, and will cause the Company Subsidiaries to, give
authorized representatives of Buyer, in such a manner as not to unduly
disrupt normal business activities, reasonable access to the premises,
properties, contracts, books, records and affairs of the Company and Company
Subsidiaries and will cause the officers of the Company and Company
Subsidiaries to furnish such financial, technical and operating data and
other information pertaining to the Business as Buyer shall from time to time
reasonably request; provided that, nothing in the foregoing shall be deemed
to require the Company or any Company Subsidiary to provide any such access
for purposes of environmental investigations, surveys or similar actions.
Buyer will hold in confidence all information obtained as a result of such
access or furnished by Stockholder, the Company or Company Subsidiaries in
accordance with the terms of the confidentiality agreement dated November 19,
2002 between the JPMorgan and Buyer (the "Confidentiality Agreement"), and
will use such information only for the purpose of considering the
transactions contemplated hereby, and if such transactions are not
consummated as contemplated herein, will promptly return or destroy, as the
case may be, all such information and all information derived therefrom
(including all copies thereof) to Stockholder in accordance with the terms of
such Confidentiality Agreement. The parties hereto agree that it
is impossible to measure in money the damages which will accrue by reason of
a breach by Buyer of this Section 5.2, and, therefore, this Section may
be specifically enforced. Buyer hereby waives the claim or defense therein
that any other party has an adequate remedy at law. Notwithstanding the
provisions of this Agreement and the provisions of the Confidentiality
Agreement, Buyer may disclose, in financing offering documents, other
documents related to Buyer\'s financing of the transaction and in filings
with the Securities and Exchange Commission, financial and other information
concerning the Company, the Business and the transactions contemplated
hereby, including the Company\'s financial statements and any other
information derived therefrom; provided that, in any such case such
disclosure is required by law or regulation or in Buyer\'s reasonable
judgment is reasonably necessary for marketing purposes.   Section 5.3 Post-
Closing Access to Records. Buyer agrees to preserve all records delivered by
Stockholder, the Company or Company Subsidiaries pursuant to this Agreement
for a period of at least seven years from the Closing Date or, if longer, the
period of completion and closure of all United States, state, local and
foreign Tax audits and returns of Stockholder, the Company and Company
Subsidiaries and their affiliated entities relating to   33    periods
prior to the Closing Date. Thereafter, Buyer will not voluntarily dispose of,
alter or destroy any such records without giving thirty (30) days prior
written notice to Stockholder to permit it, at its expense, to
examine, duplicate or take possession of such records. During the period such
records are so required to be preserved and kept, duly authorized
representatives of Stockholder shall, upon reasonable prior notice, have
access thereto during normal business hours to examine, inspect and copy such
records. Buyer and Stockholder shall provide each other with reasonable
access to any records or information relevant to any Tax Return, audit or
examination by any Governmental Agency, or judicial or administrative
proceeding or determination relating to liability for Taxes (including
refunds) as are in its possession or subject to its control pursuant to this
Section 5.3.   Section 5.4 HSR. Each of Buyer and the Company shall
(a) promptly, (but in no event later than five business days after the date
hereof) make or cause to be made the filings required of such party or any of
its subsidiaries or affiliates under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust

Stockholder shall, or shall cause the Company and Company Subsidiaries to,
prepare and file with the appropriate Governmental Agency all Tax Returns
required to be filed (with extensions) by the Company or any Company
Subsidiary on or prior to the Closing Date and will cause the Company and
Company Subsidiaries to pay all Taxes required to be paid with respect to
such Tax Returns.   (b) Buyer shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, all
Tax Returns required to be filed (with extensions) by the Company or any
Company Subsidiary after the Closing Date. Each such Tax Return for any Pre-
Closing Tax Period or for any Straddle Period shall be prepared in accordance
with past practice of the Company or the Company Subsidiary, as applicable,
unless otherwise required by applicable laws.   (i) Other than as provided
in Section 5.5(b)(iii), in the  case of each Tax Return for any Pre-Closing
Tax Period, Buyer shall  deliver to Stockholder, at least 45   34    
days prior to the applicable filing deadline, a copy of such Tax Return  for
Stockholder\'s review and approval. Stockholder shall have 30 days  following
receipt of each such Tax Return to deliver to Buyer its  written approval of
such Tax Return or a written statement of  Stockholder\'s desired revisions
to such Tax Return. Upon receipt of  written approval from Stockholder or
upon making any revisions  requested by Stockholder or upon Stockholder\'s
failure to give notice  within such 30-day period, Buyer shall timely file,
or cause to be  timely filed with the appropriate Governmental Agency all
such Tax  Returns and shall pay, or cause to be paid, all Taxes required to
be  paid with respect to such Tax Returns.   (ii) Other than as provided in
Section 5.5(b)(iii), in the  case of each Tax Return for any Straddle Period,
Buyer shall deliver to  Stockholder, at least 90 days prior to the applicable
filing deadline,  a copy of such Tax Return, together with a calculation of
the amount of  Taxes related to such Tax Return that is attributable to the
portion of  such Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date (the "Pre-Closing
Tax  Calculation"). The Stockholder shall, within 30 days of receipt of
each  such Tax Return and Pre-Closing Tax Calculation, deliver to Buyer its 
written approval or written notice of objection with respect to such  Tax
Return or Pre-Closing Tax Calculation. If Buyer and Stockholder are  unable
to resolve any dispute within 15 days following Buyer\'s receipt  of
Stockholder\'s notice of objection delivered pursuant to the  preceding
sentence, such dispute shall be submitted to the Independent  Expert
selected, to the extent not previously selected, in accordance  with the
procedures set forth in Section 2.4(b)(ii) for final  determination, which
determination shall be binding upon Buyer and  Stockholder. Upon Buyer\'s
receipt of Stockholder\'s written approval or  upon the final determination
of all disputes with respect to a Tax  Return, Buyer shall file, or cause to
be filed, with the appropriate  Governmental Agency such Tax Return and shall
pay, or cause to be paid,  all Taxes required to be paid with respect to such
Tax Return. If a  final determination has not been made by the time the
filing of such  Tax Return is required, Buyer shall timely file, or cause to
be timely  filed, such Tax Return and pay, or cause to be paid, all Taxes due
and  file, or cause to be filed, an amended Tax Return, if necessary, upon 
final determination of an Independent Expert.   (iii) In the case of each
Tax Return for any Pre-Closing  Tax Period or Straddle Period relating to
employment taxes, Buyer (A)  shall cause such Tax Return to be timely filed
with the appropriate  Governmental Agency in accordance with past practice of
the Company and  Company Subsidiaries, (B) shall timely pay or cause to be
paid all  Taxes due with respect to such Tax Return, and (C) shall deliver
such  Tax Return to Stockholder for review as soon as practicable following 
the filing of such Tax Return and take any action, if reasonably  requested
by Stockholder, to correct or amend such Tax Return.   (c) Buyer agrees (i)
to furnish Stockholder with copies of all correspondence received from any
Governmental Agency in connection with any audit relating to the Tax Returns
of the Company or any Company Subsidiary for taxable periods beginning prior
to the Closing Date, and (ii) to cooperate, to the extent reasonably
requested by Stockholder, in connection with any audit, litigation or other
proceeding with respect to Taxes of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary.   35     (d) Stockholder and Buyer agree, upon the other
party\'s reasonable request and at the requesting party\'s expense, to make
any filing or to obtain any certificate or other document from any
Governmental Agency or any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate,
reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby.   (e) Buyer shall not make or permit to be
made any election under section 338 of the Code with respect to its
acquisition of the Company or any Company Subsidiary.   (f) All transfer,
registration, stamp, documentary, sales, use and similar Taxes (including but
not limited to, all applicable real estate transfer or gains Taxes and any
stock transfer Taxes), including any penalties, interest and additions with
respect thereto, and fees incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be the responsibility of and be paid
by Buyer. Stockholder and Buyer shall cooperate in the timely making of all
filings, returns, reports and forms as may be required in connection
therewith.   (g) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement,
after the Closing Date, Stockholder shall indemnify and hold harmless Buyer,
the Company and any Company Subsidiary from and against (i) any Taxes of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary attributable to any Pre-Closing Tax
Period or the portion of any Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date
(determined without regard to any Tax benefit attributable to the cash-out of
the Company Options and Company Stock Units), to the extent any such Taxes
exceed the accruals for such Taxes (reduced by any incremental Tax benefit
resulting from the cash out of the Company Options and Company Stock Units)
reflected in the computation of Closing Date Working Capital, as finally
determined pursuant to Section 2.4(a), and (ii) any Taxes of any person other
than the Company or a Company Subsidiary imposed under Treas. Regs. Section
1.1502-6 (or analogous provision of state, local or foreign law) by reason of
the Company or the Company Subsidiary being a member of a consolidated,
combined or unitary group of corporations prior to the Closing Date. In the
case of any Straddle Period, Taxes attributable to the portion of such
Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date shall be determined as if such
taxable period ended as of the close of business on the Closing Date;
provided that, real property, personal property and other ad valorem Taxes
shall be prorated on a daily basis. The amount of any Taxes for which
indemnification is provided under this Section 5.5(g) shall be increased or
decreased to take account of any net Tax detriment or benefit, respectively,
actually realized arising from such Taxes or the receipt of
such indemnification payment. Buyer (or its affiliated entities) shall be
obligated to use all commercially reasonable efforts to pursue in good faith
Tax benefits arising from amounts for which indemnification is provided under
this Section 5.5(g).   (h) Stockholder, in its sole discretion, shall have
the right to participate in or control any audit or examination by any
Governmental Agency and contest and defend against any assessment, notice of
deficiency or other adjustment or proposed adjustment relating to or with
respect to Taxes or Tax Returns for any Pre-Closing Tax Period and shall have
full control over the resolution or settlement of any such matters; provided
that, in the event that any such adjustment would have an adverse effect on
the Company or a Company Subsidiary for a Post-Closing Tax Period,
Stockholder (i) shall permit Buyer to participate in the proceeding to the
extent the adjustment may affect the Tax liability of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary for a Post-Closing Tax Period and (ii) shall not settle or
otherwise compromise such proceeding   36    without the prior written
consent of Buyer, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. To the extent
Stockholder does not assume full control over any such matters, Buyer shall
use commercially reasonably efforts to defend positions taken on Tax Returns
for Pre-Closing Tax Periods and shall keep Stockholder reasonably informed of
the progress of any such proceedings and shall not settle or otherwise
compromise such proceeding without the prior written consent of Stockholder,
which shall not be unreasonably withheld. To the extent that any assessment,
notice of deficiency or other adjustment or proposed adjustment relating to
or with respect to Tax Returns for any taxable period other than a Pre-
Closing Tax Period would have an adverse effect on Stockholder or
require indemnification pursuant to Section 5.5(g) or Section 9.2(a), Buyer,
(i) shall permit Stockholder to participate in the proceeding to the extent
the adjustment may affect the liability of Stockholder and (ii) shall not
settle or otherwise compromise such proceeding without the prior written
consent of Stockholder, which shall not be unreasonably withheld.   (i) If,
at any time on or after the Closing Date, the Company or any affiliates
thereof actually receives any refund, rebate, return or other similar payment
or credit with respect to Taxes relating to or arising out of a Pre-Closing
Tax Period or the portion of any Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date
(other than a refund, rebate, return or other similar payment or credit
attributable to a carryback of a net operating loss, capital loss or similar
Tax attribute from a taxable period (or portion thereof) following
the Closing Date), such Person shall promptly notify Stockholder in writing
and shall remit the full amount of such payment or credit to Stockholder
in immediately available funds, to the extent the amount of such refund
exceeds the amount, if any, taken into account in the determination of
Closing Date Working Capital. Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to pursue any refund, rebate, return or other similar payment to which it
becomes entitled.   (j) Stockholder shall deliver to Buyer a non-
foreign affidavit dated as of the Closing Date which shall conform to the
model certification set forth in Treasury Regulations Section
1.1445-2(b)(2)(iii)(B).   Section 5.6 Resignations. On the Closing
Date, Stockholder shall cause to be delivered to Buyer duly signed
resignations, effective immediately after the Closing, of all directors of
the Company.   Section 5.7 Employee Matters.   (a) For a period of one
year following the Closing Date, Buyer agrees it will provide or cause to be
provided to the employees of the Company and Company Subsidiaries immediately
prior to the Closing Date (the "Company Employees") compensation and benefits
(including severance benefits) that are no less favorable than the benefits
currently provided to similarly-situated employees of Buyer. From and after
the Closing Date, Buyer will recognize any prior service of the Company
Employees with the Company or any predecessor entity (to the extent credited
by the Company) or any Company Subsidiary as of the Closing Date for all
purposes (other than for benefit accrual under any defined benefit plan)
under Buyer\'s benefit plans and arrangements in which they become
participants to the same extent such service was recognized by the Company
prior to the Closing Date. Buyer agrees that where applicable with respect to
any welfare plan of Buyer, Buyer will (i) waive, with respect to any Company
Employees, any pre-existing condition exclusion and actively-at-work
requirements, to the extent   37    such exclusion or requirement would
not have applied under the applicable plan of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary and (ii) provide that any covered expenses incurred on or before
the Closing Date by a Company Employee or a Company Employee\'s covered
dependents shall be taken into account for purposes of satisfying applicable
deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket provisions after the
Closing Date to the same extent as such expenses would be taken into account
if incurred by similarly situated employees of Buyer. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, (i) following the Closing Date, Buyer will cause the Company to
honor the terms of the employment, retention and severance agreements and
plans as set forth on Schedule 5.7 (subject to any right to modify such
agreements and plans in accordance with their terms) and (ii) for the six
month period following the Closing Date, Buyer will cause the Company to (A)
recognize any prior service of the Company Employees with the Company or
any predecessor entity (to the extent normally credited by the Company) or
any Company Subsidiary for the purposes of the Company\'s Severance Policy
KRC - HR - 7603, which is set forth on Schedule 5.7, (B) honor the
obligations set forth in the Company\'s Severance Policy KRC - HR - 7603 in
effect as of the date hereof (without regard to any amendment or termination
provision) as such obligations relate to the amount of severance paid
pursuant to such plan to a terminated employee and (C) cover any such
terminated employee under the then-current medical plans of the Company for
the one month period following termination and, thereafter, to provide COBRA
coverage at the expense of such terminated employee as required by law.  
(b) (i) Stockholder shall take, and shall cause the Company to take, all
actions necessary to transfer the sponsorship of the Kessler Rehabilitation
Corporation Employer Retirement Savings Plan (f/k/a The Kessler
Rehabilitation Corporation Pension Plan) and its related trust from
the Company to Stockholder or KMRREC (as determined by Stockholder in its
sole discretion) prior to the Closing Date.   (ii) Stockholder shall cause,
except as provided herein or as required by applicable law, as of the Closing
Date, all employees of Stockholder or KMRREC and their dependents and
beneficiaries to cease to accrue further benefits, and have no rights to
further participation, under any Employee Plan. Notwithstanding the above,
with respect to any employee of Stockholder or KMRREC (including any
beneficiary or dependent thereof), the Company shall retain (1) all
liabilities and obligations arising under any Employee Plan that is a group
life, accident, medical, dental or disability plan or similar arrangement to
the extent that such liability or obligation relates to claims incurred
(whether or not reported) on or prior to the Closing Date and (2) all
liabilities and obligations arising under any worker\'s
compensation arrangement to the extent such liability or obligation relates
to events occurring (whether or not reported) during the period prior to the
Closing Date; provided that, Stockholder shall promptly, and in any case
within 10 business days of Buyer\'s written request, reimburse Buyer for any
reasonable and documented additional costs that it, or its Employee Plans,
may incur, over and above the premiums previously paid by Stockholder or
KMRREC, on account of retaining the liabilities described in 5.7(b)(ii)(1)
and (2) above, whether such additional costs are incurred by way of
additional out of pocket costs, or retrospective premium adjustments or
otherwise. For purposes of this Section 5.7(b)(ii), a claim shall be deemed
to be incurred when (A) with respect to medical or dental benefits, the
medical or dental services giving rise to such claim are performed and (B)
with respect to life, accident or disability benefits, when the event,
condition or illness giving rise to such claim occurs.   38     (c) The
Stockholder shall indemnify and hold harmless Buyer, the Company and any
Company Subsidiary or successor thereof, to the fullest extent permitted by
law from and against any and all liabilities, costs, claims and expenses,
including all professional fees (such as attorneys\' or accountants\' fees),
arising out of the payment of any "excess parachute payments" as defined by
section 280G of the Code ("Excess Parachute Payments"). Such costs shall
include, but not be limited to, the costs of paying any tax gross-up to the
individual who receives an excess parachute payment and the costs of the lost
deduction to the Buyer, Company, or any Company Subsidiary or successor
thereof, if applicable, of the payment of any "excess parachute payments." It
is agreed and understood that the indemnification described in this Section
5.7(c) shall not be subject to the limitations described in Sections 9.2 or
9.10 hereof. Buyer shall, and shall cause the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries to, not take any position in connection with the filing of any
Tax Return (including on amended Tax Returns) or in the event of any
dispute with any Governmental Agency contrary to or not consistent with the
position of Stockholder that the Company qualifies for exemption under
Section 280G(b)(5)(A)(i) of the Code in any Tax filings or Tax reports of the
Company, any Company Subsidiary or any Company Employee unless Buyer
reasonably concludes that the position taken by Stockholder is not supported
by substantial authority within the meaning of Section 6662(d)(2)(B)(i) of
the Code.   Section 5.8 DandO; Indemnification/Insurance.   (a) From and
after the Closing Date, Buyer will indemnify and hold harmless each officer
and director of the Company and Company Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date
to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, the organizational
documents of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, as applicable, and any
agreement effective as of the date of this Agreement between any such officer
or director and the Company or any Company Subsidiary, in each case, in
respect of acts or omissions occurring on or prior to the Closing Date.  
(b) At the Closing, Buyer shall, on behalf of the Company, purchase on a
prepaid noncancelable basis, from the insurance company and on the terms set
forth on Exhibit E, directors\' and officers\' liability insurance (or an
extended reporting endorsement) in respect of acts or omissions occurring on
or prior to the Closing Date, covering each person currently covered by the
policy to which the "tail" relates (a copy of which has been made available
to Buyer). In satisfying its obligation under this Section 5.8(b) Buyer shall
pay, or cause to be paid, premiums in the amount of $360,000, with any excess
premiums to be paid by Stockholder.   Section 5.9 Implied Warranties. Except
as expressly provided in this Agreement, neither the Company nor Stockholder
has made or is making any representation or warranty whatsoever to Buyer as
to Stockholder, the Company, Company Subsidiaries or the Business. Without
limiting the foregoing, Buyer acknowledges that Stockholder, the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries have not made any implied warranties (whether of
merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose or otherwise), or any
representation or warranty as to the viability or likelihood of success of
the Business, the Company or any Company Subsidiary after the Closing Date,
or any representation or warranty as to the information contained in the
Information Memorandum furnished by JPMorgan on behalf of the Company, or in
any subsequent or supplemental materials provided by the Company or
Stockholder, except as expressly provided in this Agreement.   39    
Section 5.10 Non-Competition; Nonsolicitation.   (a) For a period of seven
years from and after the Closing Date, neither Stockholder nor any of its
Subsidiaries (collectively, the "Restricted Parties") shall, directly or
indirectly, own, manage, operate, control or participate in the ownership,
management, operation or control of, or provide any financing or lease any
assets to, any entity that engages in a Competing Business; provided,
however, that the foregoing shall not restrict any Restricted Party with
respect to (i) establishing, developing, sponsoring, promoting and providing
educational programs and medical and scientific research in the field of
physical rehabilitation and fields ancillary thereto, (ii) sponsoring and
assisting not-for-profit treatment facilities devoted to improving and
protecting the health and welfare of all persons, particularly those with
physical disabilities, (iii) aiding persons with physical and
other disabilities, (iv) providing access to community resources aimed at
promoting life and health, (v) providing assistance to persons with the aim
of permitting them to learn to lead full and meaningful lives and (vi)
fundraising for any of the foregoing, so long as, in any event, no Restricted
Party receives any remuneration from patients or patients\' insurance
companies for services provided to patients; provided further, that the
foregoing shall not prohibit the beneficial or record ownership by a
Restricted Party of up to five percent of the outstanding securities of a
Competing Business, so long as the Restricted Parties do not actively
participate in the management of such Competing Business.   (b) For a
period of five years from and after the Closing Date, the Restricted Parties
shall not directly or indirectly solicit (other than for charitable
purposes), employ, retain as a consultant or attempt to entice away from
Buyer, the Company, the Company Subsidiaries or their respective affiliates,
any Protected Employee, except (i) for those Protected Employees set forth on
Schedule 5.10(b) and (ii) that the Restricted Parties may employ or retain as
a consultant any Protected Employee who is no longer employed by the Company
or any Company Subsidiary solely for the purpose of assisting in the
processes contemplated in Section 2.4 hereof. For a period of two years from
and after the Closing Date, the Restricted Parties shall not directly or
indirectly solicit (other than for charitable purposes) or attempt to entice
away from Buyer, the Company, the Company Subsidiaries or their respective
affiliates any person, firm or corporation which is, or has been during the
six-month period commencing on the Closing Date, a customer of Buyer, the
Company or a Company Subsidiary.   (c) In the event that the covenants
contained in this Section 5.10 shall be determined by any court of competent
jurisdiction to be unenforceable by reason of its extending for too long a
period of time or over too large a geographical area or by reason of its
being too extensive in any other respect, it shall be interpreted to extend
only over the longest period of time over which it may be enforceable and/or
over the largest geographical area as to which it may be enforceable and/or
to the maximum extent in all other respects as to which it may be
enforceable, all as determined by such court in such action.   (d) The
parties are entering into the foregoing covenant to assure Buyer of the
transfer of the goodwill of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, and in
order to induce Buyer to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Stockholder and Buyer covenant that, in the event of a breach by
Stockholder of the terms and conditions of this Section 5.10 to be performed,
Buyer may suffer irreparable damage for which remedies at law are inadequate
and therefore, with respect to a breach of this Section 5.10, notwithstanding
any other   40    provision of this Agreement, Buyer may receive, from a
court of competent jurisdiction, an injunction, a decree for specific
performance or such other equitable relief as may be deemed appropriate under
the circumstances, in addition to any other remedies at law or in equity
Buyer, the Company or any Company Subsidiary may have.   (e) Stockholder
shall, upon reasonable prior notice, give authorized representatives of Buyer
reasonable access to Stockholder and its records during normal business hours
and will furnish such information as Buyer shall from time to time reasonably
request to permit Buyer to propose to Stockholder the portion of the Final
Purchase Price allocable to Stockholder\'s undertakings pursuant to this
Section 5.10. Buyer agrees to reimburse Stockholder for any reasonable and
documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred plus the pro rata
salary, wage and benefits of any Stockholder employees used pursuant to such
access and furnishing of information. Buyer will, and will cause its
representatives to, hold in confidence all information obtained as a result
of such access or furnished by Stockholder in accordance with the terms of
the Confidentiality Agreement, and will use such information only for the
purposes set forth in this Section 5.10(e). Provided Stockholder has complied
with its obligations set forth in this Section 5.10, Buyer shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to submit, within five business days prior to
the Closing Date, to Stockholder Buyer\'s calculation of the portion of the
Final Purchase Price allocable to Stockholder\'s undertakings pursuant
to this Section 5.10. Unless Stockholder notifies Buyer within 30 days
after Buyer\'s delivery of such computation of any objection to such
computation (the "Allocation Objection"), the computation shall become final
and binding. Any Allocation Objection shall specify in reasonable detail the
basis for the objections set forth therein. An Allocation Objection shall
thereafter be treated in accordance with the procedures for resolving Notices
of Objection set forth in Section 2.4(b)(ii) of this Agreement.   Section
5.11 No Solicitation. During the period beginning on the date hereof and
ending on the earlier of the Closing Date and the date of termination of this
Agreement, Stockholder will not (and will cause its Subsidiaries and
representatives not to) (a) solicit or initiate the submission of any
proposal or offer from any person relating to the direct or
indirect acquisition of all or any substantial portion of the Shares or
assets of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries or (b) participate in any
discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish any information with
respect to, any effort or any attempt by any person other than Buyer to do or
seek any of the foregoing.   Section 5.12 Confidentiality. After the
Closing, Stockholder and its Subsidiaries (other than the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries) shall not, directly or indirectly, and Stockholder
shall not permit its representatives to, disclose to any person or entity or

or disputes or to fulfill Stockholder\'s obligations under this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby or (b) as permitted pursuant to the
Affiliation and Services Agreement.   41     Section 5.13 Acquisition of
Rights to Confidentiality. To the extent permitted by the terms thereof, at
the Closing Stockholder shall assign, grant and convey to Buyer all its
rights under confidentiality agreements between it and persons other than
Buyer that were entered into in connection with or relating to a possible
sale of the Shares or any part thereof (collectively "Other Confidentiality
Letters"), including the right to enforce all terms of the Other
Confidentiality Letters. At the Closing, Stockholder shall deliver to Buyer
copies of the Other Confidentiality Letters to the extent permitted by the
terms thereof.   Section 5.14 Payment of Indebtedness. Prior to
or concurrent with the Closing, Stockholder shall, or shall cause the Company
and Company Subsidiaries to, pay off all indebtedness of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries listed on Schedule 5.14, and shall remove, or cause to

copy of the letter from Fleet National Bank confirming that all Encumbrances
relating to such indebtedness will be removed by Fleet National Bank
effective upon payment of the amount set forth in the pay-off letter.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Stockholder shall not, and shall not cause the
Company or any Company Subsidiary to, pay off any indebtedness listed on
Schedule 5.14 unless, in the reasonable judgment of Stockholder and the
Company, after such pay-off, the Company will have an amount of Working
Capital that is not less than the Target Working Capital; provided that,
Stockholder shall, or shall cause the Company to, provide notice to Buyer of
such pay-off prior to paying off any such indebtedness.   Section 5.15
Argosy Health, LLC. Stockholder shall indemnify and hold Buyer, the Company

corresponding period.   Section 5.19 Related Transactions. Stockholder
shall, and shall cause the Company and Company Subsidiaries to, take any and
all actions necessary so that, as of the Closing, there will be no
liabilities or obligations from the Company or Company Subsidiaries to

or any Company Subsidiary receives a payment for services rendered by Core
Rehab Management, LLC ("Core") under circumstances in which the particular
account receivable that should be credited with such payment is not clearly
designated or readily apparent (the "Undesignated Payments"), the parties

Closing Date; provided, that, in any event, the same does not constitute a
breach of any of the Company\'s or Stockholder\'s representations, warranties
or covenants herein and are not otherwise liabilities against which
Stockholder has indemnified a Buyer Indemnitee.   (b) Notwithstanding
Section 9.3(a), (i) Buyer shall not be liable, pursuant to Section 9.3(a)(i),
for any Losses unless the aggregate of all Losses covered by such section
suffered by Stockholder exceeds, on a cumulative basis, an amount equal to $3
million, and then only to the extent of any such excess, (ii) the aggregate
liability of Buyer hereunder pursuant to Section 9.3(a)(i) and Section 9.4
for Losses suffered by Stockholder shall in no event exceed $42,500,000 and
(iii) Buyer shall not be liable to Stockholder for its indirect, special,
incidental, consequential or punitive damages which are not reasonably
foreseeable (other than damages paid to third parties) resulting from
breaches by Buyer of its representations, warranties or
covenants hereunder.   (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, the limitations on liability under Section 9.3(b) for Losses
suffered by a Stockholder Indemnitee shall not apply to the representations
and warranties set forth in Sections 4.1 ("Organization of Buyer") (in so far
as it relates to the due incorporation or organization of Buyer), 4.2(a)
("Authority") and 4.6 ("Brokers or Finders") and, solely to the extent
related to the foregoing, the certificate delivered pursuant to Section 8.1
of this Agreement; provided that, (i) such liability shall in no event exceed
the Final Purchase Price and (ii) no limitation or condition of liability or
indemnity shall apply to fraud.   Section 9.4 Cost Report Liability
Indemnification. Promptly (but in any event within 90 days) following the end
of each calendar year after the Closing Date, Buyer shall prepare and deliver
to Stockholder a report in reasonable detail of Cost Report Liabilities for
cost reports closed during such year (or, in the case of 2003, for the period
from the Closing Date to December 31, 2003). To the extent that such Cost
Report Liabilities for cost reports closed during such calendar year exceed
the amount reserved for such cost reports as current liabilities on the
Closing Date Balance Sheet, Stockholder will promptly pay to Buyer 90% of
such excess. To the extent that such Cost Report Liabilities for cost reports
closed during such calendar year are less than the amount reserved for such
cost reports as current liabilities on the Closing Date Balance Sheet, Buyer
will promptly pay to Stockholder 90% of such excess reserve. Buyer hereby
agrees that it shall take any and all actions consistent with actions
customarily taken by   53    Buyer on its own behalf to minimize any and
all Cost Report Liabilities and to recover and have refunded any and all
amounts payable to the Company or any Company Subsidiary to the extent the
Company or any Company Subsidiary was underpaid with respect to any Medicare
or Medicaid cost reports below Medicare and Medicaid\'s reimbursement
obligations in respect of such Medicare or Medicaid cost report.   Section
9.5 75% Rule Reimbursement.   (a) Stockholder agrees to reimburse Buyer for
(i) all revenues from periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date that
Buyer is finally determined to be required, by the fiscal intermediary for
the hospitals of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, to remit due
solely to the failure by the Company or any Company Subsidiary prior to the
Closing to comply with 42 C.F.R. Section 412.23(b) (the "75% Rule") as
applied by such fiscal intermediary and (ii) all reasonable and documented
out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries in connection with resolving the amount of such revenues to be
remitted. In the event that Stockholder is required to make any
reimbursements to Buyer pursuant to this Section 9.5, Stockholder shall have
the same right to participate in the defense of and, if it so chooses, to
assume the defense of any dispute relating to such reimbursement as the
Indemnifying Party does pursuant to Section 9.8.   (b) In the event that the
application of the 75% Rule results in the remitting of revenues by the
Company for the year ended December 31, 2003, (i) such revenues (and any and
all related out-of-pocket costs and expenses) relating to patients that were
admitted on or after the Closing Date shall in no event be subject to any
reimbursement by Stockholder, (ii) Stockholder shall, pursuant to Section
9.5(a) (but subject to Section 9.2(b)(ii)), reimburse Buyer for such revenues
(and any reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred
by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries in connection with resolving the
amount of such revenues to be remitted) relating to patients that were
discharged on or prior to the Closing Date and (iii) Stockholder shall,
pursuant to Section 9.5(a) (but subject to Section 9.2(b)(ii)), reimburse
Buyer for that fraction of the revenues (and any reasonable and documented
out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries in connection with resolving the amount of such revenues to be
remitted) related to each patient admitted prior to the Closing Date and
discharged after the Closing Date equal to (A) the total number of days of
such patient\'s stay that fell on or prior to the Closing Date, over (B) the
total number of days of such patient\'s stay.   (c) Buyer shall, and shall
cause the Company and Company Subsidiaries to, not take any position contrary
to or not consistent with the position Stockholder takes with respect to the
Company\'s or any Company Subsidiary\'s compliance with the 75% Rule during
any period ending on or prior to the Closing Date or any period a portion of
which ends on or prior to the Closing Date in any communication or dispute
with any Governmental Agency, fiscal intermediary, carrier or similar entity
that enforces or administers the statutory or regulatory provisions in
respect of any governmental health care program, so long as such position is
a reasonable position (it being understood that Buyer and Stockholder\'s
position with respect to periods after Closing and pre-Closing, respectively,
may be different).   54     (d) Stockholder shall not take any position
contrary to or not consistent with the position Buyer takes with respect to
the Company\'s or any Company Subsidiary\'s compliance with the 75% Rule
during any period beginning on or after the Closing Date or any period a
portion of which ends on or after the Closing Date in any communication or
dispute with any Governmental Agency, fiscal intermediary, carrier or similar
entity that enforces or administers the statutory or regulatory provisions in
respect of any governmental health care program, so long as such position is
a reasonable position (it being understood that Buyer and Stockholder\'s
position with respect to periods after Closing and pre-Closing, respectively,
may be different).   Section 9.6 Employee Benefits
Liabilities Indemnification. The parties agree that there shall be reflected
on the Closing Date Balance Sheet a reserve for incurred but not paid claims
under the Company\'s self insured dental and optical reimbursement plans and
dependent care reimbursement plan. The reserve for such items reflected on
the Closing Date Balance Sheet shall be referred to herein as the "Employee
Benefits Reserve" and such plans shall be referred to herein as the "Self
Insured Plans." Within 45 days after the last day employees are entitled to
submit claims under the Self Insured Plans with respect to events that
occurred prior to the Closing, Buyer will send to Stockholder a calculation
of the amount of such claims with respect to events that occurred prior to
the Closing that were paid or are payable after the Closing Date and (a) if
such amount is less than the amount of the Employee Benefits Reserve, Buyer,
within 5 days from the delivery of such calculation, shall pay Stockholder
the amount of such shortfall and (b) if such amount is more than the amount
of the Employee Benefits Reserve, Stockholder, within 5 days from the
delivery of such calculation, shall pay Buyer the amount of such overage.  
Section 9.7 Workers\' Compensation Insurance Indemnifications. To the extent
that the end-of-year audits for the Company\'s two workers\' compensation
policies with New Jersey Manufacturers and Liberty Mutual result in a premium
call for the Company for 2003, Stockholder shall pay to Buyer no later than
45 days following such end-of-year audits that amount of cash that equals (a)
such premium call, times (b) the number of days that have elapsed from and
including January 1, 2003 to the Closing Date, divided by (c) 365. To the
extent that the end-of-year insurance company audits for the Company\'s two
workers\' compensation policies with New Jersey Manufacturers and Liberty
Mutual result in a refund to the Company for 2003, Buyer shall pay
to Stockholder no later than 45 days following such end-of-year audits that
amount of cash that equals (a) such refund, times (b) the number of days that
have elapsed from and including January 1, 2003 to the Closing Date, divided
by (c) 365.   Section 9.8 Third Party Claims. Promptly after the receipt
by Buyer Indemnitees or Stockholder Indemnitees of a notice of any claim,
action, suit or proceeding of any third party which is subject
to indemnification hereunder, such party (the "Indemnified Party") shall
give written notice of such claim to the party obligated to provide
indemnification hereunder (the "Indemnifying Party"), stating the nature and
basis of such claim and the amount thereof, to the extent known ("Asserted
Liability"). Failure of the Indemnified Party to give such notice shall not
relieve the Indemnifying Party from any liability which it may have on
account of this indemnification or otherwise, except to the extent that the
Indemnifying Party is actually prejudiced thereby. The Indemnifying Party
shall be entitled to participate in the defense of and, if it so chooses, to
assume the defense of, or otherwise contest, such claim, action, suit or  
55    proceeding with counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party and
reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party if (i) the claim involves
solely monetary damages and (ii) the Indemnifying Party expressly agrees in
writing with the Indemnified Party that, as between the two, the Indemnifying
Party is solely obligated to satisfy and discharge the claim; provided that,
the Indemnifying Party shall not, without the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Party, enter into any compromise or settlement that commits the
Indemnified Party to take, or to forbear to take, any action or which does
not provide for a complete release by such third party of the Indemnified
Party. If the Indemnifying Party elects to defend such Asserted Liability, it
shall within 30 days notify the Indemnified Party of its intent to do so.
Upon the election by the Indemnifying Party to assume the defense of, or
otherwise contest, such claim, action, suit or proceeding, the Indemnifying
Party shall not be liable for any legal or other expenses subsequently
incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with the defense thereof,
although the Indemnified Party shall have the right to participate in the
defense thereof and to employ counsel, at its own expense. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the Indemnifying Party shall be liable for the reasonable fees
and expenses of counsel employed by the Indemnified Party, if and only to the
extent that (i) the Indemnifying Party has not employed counsel to assume the
defense of such action within a reasonable time after receiving notice of the
commencement of the action, (ii) the employment of counsel and the amount
reimbursable therefor by the Indemnified Party has been authorized in writing
by the Indemnifying Party or (iii) representation of the Indemnifying Party
and the Indemnified Party by the same counsel would, in the
reasonable opinion of such counsel, constitute a conflict of interest. The
parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to minimize Losses from
claims by third parties and shall act in good faith in responding to,
defending against, settling or otherwise dealing with such claims,
notwithstanding any dispute as to liability as between the parties under this
Article 9. The parties shall also reasonably cooperate in any such defense,
give each other reasonable access to all information relevant thereto and use
commercially reasonable efforts to make employees and other representatives
available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information
and explanation of any material provided in connection therewith. In
addition, in the case of claims relating to environmental matters,
Stockholder shall be given reasonable access to the relevant sites and shall
have the right to attend all material meetings with Governmental Agencies or
other third parties responsible for the claim or any related remedial action.
Whether or not the Indemnifying Party shall have assumed the defense, the
Indemnifying Party shall not be obligated to indemnify the other party
hereunder for any settlement entered into without the Indemnifying Party\'s
prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed.   Section 9.9 Indemnification Amounts. Subject to the limitations
set forth in Section 9.2(b) and Section 9.3(b), the amount of any Losses for
which indemnification is provided under this Article 9 shall be increased or
decreased to take account of any net tax detriment or benefit, respectively,
actually realized arising from such Losses or the receipt of
such indemnification payment. If any Indemnified Party (or its affiliated
entities) shall have received any payment pursuant to this Article 9 with
respect to any Losses and subsequently receives insurance proceeds or other
amounts or actually realizes a tax benefit with respect to such Losses, then
such Indemnified Party (or its affiliated entities) shall promptly pay to the
Indemnifying Party the amount so recovered (after deducting the amount of the
expenses incurred by it in procuring such recovery), but not in excess of the
amount previously so paid by the Indemnifying Party. The Indemnified Party
shall be obligated to use all commercially   56    reasonable efforts
to pursue in good faith (i) claims under any applicable insurance policies
(including, without limitation, any applicable insurance policies maintained
by the Company) and against other third parties who may be responsible for
Losses and (ii) tax benefits arising from Losses for which indemnification is
provided under this Article 9. For all Tax purposes, Stockholder and Buyer
agree to treat any indemnity payment under this Agreement as an adjustment to
the Final Purchase Price, unless a final determination requires
otherwise.   Section 9.10 Indemnification Period. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary, the indemnification obligations of Stockholder and Buyer (a)
for representations and warranties shall continue for the applicable survival
period set forth in Section 9.1 (other than to the extent
such representations and warranties relate to Medicare and Medicaid cost
reports, which are addressed in subclause "(c)" herein), (b) for any covenant
(other than Section 9.4) shall continue indefinitely unless expressly set
forth in such covenant and (c) pursuant to Section 9.4 shall continue for a
two year period following the Closing Date in the case of Medicare and
Medicaid cost reports for which a Notice of Program Reimbursement has been
received on or prior to the Closing Date and for a two year period following
the receipt of a Notice of Program Reimbursement with respect to any Medicare
or Medicaid cost report for which a Notice of Program Reimbursement has not
been received on or prior to the Closing Date (except, in each case, for
circumstances that are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a
judgment that has become final to have resulted from fraud, in which case the
survival is indefinite); provided, however, that any claim for
indemnification in respect of which notice is given in accordance with the
provisions of Section 9.8 hereof prior to the termination of any such period
shall survive with respect to such claim until final resolution thereof.  
Section 9.11 Exclusive Remedies. The sole and exclusive remedy of a party to
this Agreement for monetary damages for any claim arising under this
Agreement against another party hereto shall be the indemnification provided
in this Article 9, and each party agrees that it will not pursue any other
remedy, except that any such party may seek specific performance
or injunctive relief.   Section 9.12 Miscellaneous.   (a) Solely for
purposes of calculating the amount of Losses for the purposes of this Article
9 arising out of or relating to any breach of a representation or warranty,
the references to "Material Adverse Effect" or other materiality
qualifications contained in the representations and warranties and the
certificates delivered pursuant to Sections 7.1 and 8.1 of this Agreement
shall be disregarded (except for any breach of any representation or warranty
contained in Section 3.9 and, solely to the extent it relates to Section 3.9,
the certificate delivered pursuant to Section 7.1 of this Agreement and
except when used for purposes of determining items to be listed on
the Schedules pursuant to Sections 3.11(a)(x), 3.11(a)(xiv) and 3.17(a)(i)(A)
of this Agreement).   (b) No right of indemnification hereunder shall
be limited by reason of any investigation or audit conducted before or after
the Closing or the knowledge of the non-breaching party of any breach of
a representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement
or in any certificate delivered pursuant to Section 7.1 or Section 8.1 of
this Agreement by the other party at any time, or the decision of any party
to complete the Closing.   57     ARTICLE 10. TERMINATION.   Section
10.1 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the
Closing Date as follows, and in no other manner:   (a) by mutual consent of
Buyer and Stockholder;   (b) by Buyer if any of the conditions set forth
in Article 6 or Article 7 shall have become incapable of fulfillment, and
shall not have been waived by Buyer;   (c) by Stockholder if any of the
conditions set forth in Article 6 or Article 8 shall have become incapable of
fulfillment, and shall not have been waived by Stockholder; or   (d) by
either Buyer or Stockholder if the Closing has not occurred within 150 days
of this Agreement; provided, however, that neither party may terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this subsection (d) if the Closing has not occurred by
such date, by reason of the failure of such party to perform in all material
respects any of its obligations under this Agreement.   Section 10.2
Liability of Buyer and Stockholder. Upon termination pursuant Section 10.1(b)
or Section 10.1(c) hereof due to an unintentional misrepresentation or
unintentional breach of warranty or covenant or an unintentional default of a
party, the sole remedy shall be that the party at fault reimburse the other
parties for all legal, investment banking, accounting, and other out-of-
pocket expenses reasonably incurred by it in connection with this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby. Upon any termination pursuant to
Section 10.1(a) or Section 10.1(d) hereof, no party shall have any liability
or obligation under this Agreement (except to observe the confidentiality
obligations of such party), and each party shall bear the expenses incurred
by it.   ARTICLE 11. MISCELLANEOUS.   Section 11.1 Notices.   (a) Except

Interest. This Agreement shall not be assignable by any of the parties
hereto, except that this Agreement shall be assignable in whole or in part by
Buyer to any Subsidiary of Buyer, provided that no such assignment shall
relieve the assignor of its obligations hereunder. This Agreement shall inure
to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective
successors and permitted assigns. Except as specifically provided in Article
9 hereof, this Agreement is for the sole and exclusive benefit of the parties
to this Agreement and their successors and assigns and nothing in this
Agreement is intended to confer, expressly or by implication, upon any other
person any legal or equitable rights, remedies or claims under or by reason
of this Agreement.   Section 11.3 Governing Law. This Agreement shall
be governed by, and construed and enforced in accordance with, the laws of
the State of New York.   Section 11.4 Counterparts. This Agreement may be
executed simultaneously in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be

party.   Section 11.5 Publicity. Stockholder and Buyer agree that press
releases and other announcements (including to employees of, and any entities
or persons having business dealings with, the Company and/or
Company Subsidiaries) with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby
shall be subject to mutual agreement; provided, however, that either party
may make such announcements as, on the advice of its counsel, such party is
required to make pursuant to applicable law or the requirements of a stock
exchange or other applicable self-regulatory organization, but in such event
such party shall, to the extent practicable, give the other party reasonable
prior notice and an opportunity to comment on the proposed announcement.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, immediately after the
execution of this Agreement, the Company shall deliver to the employees of
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries a notice regarding employee benefits
in the form attached hereto as Exhibit I.   62     Section 11.6
Complete Agreement. This Agreement, the exhibits hereto and the schedules and
documents delivered pursuant hereto or referred to herein contain the entire
agreement between the parties hereto with respect to the transactions
contemplated herein and supersede all previous negotiations, commitments and
writings.   Section 11.7 Amendments and Waivers. Stockholder and Buyer may
(a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other
acts of the parties hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations
and warranties contained in this Agreement or in any or documents delivered
pursuant hereto, (c) waive compliance with any of the covenants or agreements
contained in this Agreement or (d) amend this Agreement, if and only, in the
case of an extension or amendment, if such action is set forth in a written
agreement signed by both parties, or, in the case of a waiver, if such waiver
is signed by the party against whom the waiver is to be effective.  
Section 11.8 Expenses. Except as specifically provided in this Agreement,
Buyer, on the one hand, and Stockholder (on behalf of the Company, the
Company Subsidiaries and Stockholder), on the other hand, shall bear the
expenses incurred by it (and in the case of Stockholder, the
expenses incurred by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries) in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, Stockholder and Buyer shall each be responsible
for 50% of all filing fees incurred in connection with any filing made
pursuant to the HSR Act.   Section 11.9 Interpretation. The headings
contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not
affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.  
Section 11.10 Severability. Any portion or provision of the Agreement which
is invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that
jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity, illegality or
unenforceability, without affecting in any way the remaining portions or
provisions hereof in such jurisdiction or, to the extent permitted by law,
rendering that or any other portion or provision of the Agreement invalid,
illegal or unenforceable in any other jurisdiction.   Section 11.11 Further
Assurances. Each party hereto agrees, to the extent reasonable, to execute
any and all documents and to perform such other acts as may be necessary or
expedient to further the purposes of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby.   Section 11.12 Schedules. The headings contained in
the Schedules are for convenience of reference only and shall not be deemed
to modify or influence the interpretation of this Agreement or the
information contained in the Schedules. Any matter set forth on any Schedule
shall be deemed to be set forth on any other Schedule to which such matter
may be responsive or which may require such matter to be disclosed, so long
as the relevance of such matter to such other Schedule is reasonably
apparent. Certain matters set forth in the Schedules are included for
informational purposes only, notwithstanding the fact that, because they do
not rise above applicable materiality thresholds or otherwise, they would not
be required to be set forth herein by the terms of this Agreement. Disclosure
of such matters shall not be taken as an admission by Stockholder, the
Company or Buyer that such disclosure is required to be made  
63    under the terms of any provision of this Agreement or is outside the
ordinary course of business, and in no event shall the disclosure of such
matters be deemed or interpreted to broaden or otherwise amend the
representations, warranties and covenants contained in the Agreement. For
purposes of Section 5.23, the term "reasonable efforts" shall include the
actions set forth on Schedule 11.12.   Section 11.13 Tax Disclosure.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein or in any other
agreement to which the parties hereto are parties or by which they are bound,
the obligations of confidentiality contained herein, as they relate to the
transactions contemplated hereby, shall not apply to the federal tax
structure or federal tax treatment of the transactions contemplated hereby,
and each party hereto (and any employee, representative, or agent of any
party hereto) may disclose to any and all persons, without limitation of any
kind, the federal tax structure and federal tax treatment of the transactions
contemplated hereby. The preceding sentence is intended to cause the
transactions contemplated hereby not to be treated as having been offered
under conditions of confidentiality for purposes of Section 1.6011-4(b)(3)
(or any successor provision) of the Treasury Regulations promulgated under
Section 6011 of the Code, as amended, and shall be construed in a manner
consistent with such purpose.   [Signatures follow on page S-1]
