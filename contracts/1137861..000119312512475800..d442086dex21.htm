hereof;

WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of each of the Company and Merger
Sub have unanimously determined to recommend to their respective stockholders
the adoption of this Agreement;

WHEREAS, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the Merger

agree as follows:

 

ARTICLE I

 

 _THE MERGERS_

1.1 _The Merger_.

Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and
in accordance with the DGCL, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged

Corporation_ ").

1.2 _The Subsequent Merger_.

Immediately following the Effective Time and in accordance with the DGCL,
Parent will cause the Initial Surviving Corporation to merge with and into
Sister Subsidiary and the separate corporate existence of the Initial
Surviving Corporation shall thereupon cease (the " _Subsequent Merger_ "), and
Sister Subsidiary shall be the surviving entity in the Subsequent Merger, and
shall succeed to and shall by virtue of the Subsequent Merger continue its
existence under the laws of the State of Delaware as a direct wholly-owned
subsidiary of Parent. Sister Subsidiary, as the surviving entity of
the Subsequent Merger, is referred to herein as the " _Final Surviving
Entity_ ". At the effective time of the Subsequent Merger and without any
further action on the part of the Initial Surviving Corporation, Parent,

Corporation, Parent or Sister Subsidiary, each share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of the Initial Surviving Corporation issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Subsequent Merger
shall continue as one limited liability company interest of Sister Subsidiary,
which shall constitute the only outstanding equity of Sister Subsidiary. Any
other equity of the Sister Subsidiary shall automatically be cancelled and
retired and shall cease to be outstanding, and no consideration shall be
delivered or deliverable in exchange therefor.

1.3 _Effective Time of the Merger and the Subsequent Merger_.

(a) Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, as soon as practicable on
the Closing Date, the parties hereto shall cause the Merger to be consummated
by filing a certificate of merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") with the

and executed in accordance with, the relevant provisions of the DGCL, and the
Merger shall become effective at the time set forth in the Certificate of
Merger, which shall be between 4:30 p.m. and 11:59 p.m. Eastern time on the
Closing Date (such time at which the Merger becomes effective, the "
_Effective Time_ ").

 



2 (b) Immediately following the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the
Subsequent Merger to be consummated by filing a certificate of merger with
the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, in such form as is required
by, and executed in accordance with, the relevant provisions of the DGCL and
Delaware Limited Liability Company Act (the " _DLLCA_ "), and the Subsequent
Merger shall become effective upon such filing of such certificate of merger
with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware.

at the Effective Time all the property, rights, privileges, powers and

(b) At the effective time of the Subsequent Merger, the effect of the
Subsequent Merger shall be as provided in the applicable provisions of the

(ii) Unless otherwise determined by Parent prior to the Effective Time, the

ARTICLE III

 

 _EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL_

_STOCK; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES_

3.1 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, as a result of the
Merger and without any further action on the part of the Company, Parent,
Merger Sub or any holder of any capital stock of the Company, Parent or Merger
Sub:

 

(a) _Merger Sub_. Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of
Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be converted into one share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share,
of the Initial Surviving Corporation, which shall constitute the only
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Initial Surviving Corporation as
of immediately after the Effective Time.

(b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock_. Each share of
common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Company (the " _Company
Common Stock_ "), and each other share of capital stock of the Company, that
is owned by the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company or by Parent, Merger
Sub or any other Subsidiary of Parent shall automatically be cancelled and
retired and shall cease to be outstanding, and no Merger Consideration shall
be delivered or deliverable in exchange therefor.

 

(c) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Subject to _Section 3.3_, each
issued and outstanding share of Company Common Stock (other than Dissenting
Shares and shares of Company Common Stock to be cancelled and retired pursuant
to _Section 3.1(b)_), shall be converted into the right to receive the
following consideration, without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ "):

(i) 0.2482 (as may be adjusted pursuant to _Section 3.4_, the " _Exchange
Ratio_ ") shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Parent, fully
paid and nonassessable, (collectively, the " _Parent Common Stock_ ") (such
Parent Common Stock, together with any cash in lieu of fractional Parent
Common Stock to be paid pursuant to _Section 3.2(f)_, the " _Stock
Consideration_ ");

(ii) $1.50 in cash (the " _Cash Consideration_ "); and

 

(iii) one contingent value right (a " _CVR_ ") issued by Parent subject to and
in accordance with the CVR Agreement. Each CVR issued as Merger Consideration
hereunder will be in the form attached as Annex A to the CVR Agreement (the "
_CVR Certificate_ ").

At the Effective Time, each share of Company Common Stock shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease
to be outstanding, and, in the 

 



5  case of book-entry shares (" _Book-Entry Shares_ "), the names of the former
registered holders shall be removed from the registry of holders of such
shares, and (A) each holder of a certificate representing any such shares
(other than Book-Entry Shares) of Company Common Stock (a " _Certificate_ ")
shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to
receive the Merger Consideration upon the surrender of such Certificate (for
each share of Company Common Stock previously represented thereby), and (B)
each holder of Book-Entry Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto except the right to receive the Merger Consideration following such
removal of such holders name from the registry of holders of such shares (for
each such Book-Entry Share).

 

Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, to the extent that
the number of shares of Parent Common Stock issuable as Stock Consideration 
_plus_ the number of shares of Parent Common Stock underlying Assumed Options
would exceed 19.99% of the outstanding shares or voting power of Parent Common
Stock as of the Effective Time, then the Exchange Ratio for each issued and
outstanding share of Company Common Stock (other than Dissenting Shares and
shares of Company Common Stock to be cancelled and retired pursuant to
_Section 3.1(b)_) shall be reduced so that the number of shares of Parent
Common Stock issued as Stock Consideration _plus_ the number of shares of
Parent Common Stock underlying Assumed Options equals 19.99% of the
outstanding shares or voting power of Parent Common Stock as of the Effective
Time (the amount of the reduction of the Exchange Ratio for each issued and
outstanding share of Company Common Stock (other than Dissenting Shares and
shares of Company Common Stock to be cancelled and retired pursuant to
_Section 3.1(b)_), the " _Exchange Ratio Per Share Reduction Amount_ ")) and
each issued and outstanding share of Company Common Stock (other than
Dissenting Shares and shares of Company Common Stock to be cancelled and
retired pursuant to _Section 3.1(b)_) shall have the right to
receive additional cash consideration equal to the product of (a) the
Exchange Ratio Per Share Reduction Amount multiplied by (b) the Parent Share
Price. As used in this Agreement, the term " _Parent Share Price_ " shall mean
the volume weighted average price paid per share of Parent Common Stock for
the ten (10) most recent days that the Parent Common Stock has traded on The
NASDAQ Global Select Market ending on the last full trading day immediately
prior to the Closing Date.

(d) Each holder of Company Options outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be permitted to elect for all or any portion of such
Company Options to be exercised on a net basis by undertaking irrevocably to
exchange the shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Options
pursuant to Section 3.1(c) and, in connection with such exchange, by
relinquishing a fraction of the aggregate Merger Consideration payable
pursuant to Section 3.1(c) with respect to such shares of Company Common Stock
corresponding to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the sum of the per
share exercise price of such Company Option and the per share amount of any
required withholdings with respect to the exercise of such Company Option by
(y) the estimated per share value of the Merger Consideration determined,
solely for purposes of effectuating net exercises contemplated by this
Section 3.1(d), by agreement of the Parties reasonably in advance of the
Closing Date. At the Effective Time, each option to purchase Company Common
Stock (each, a " _Company Option_ ") (or portion thereof), whether vested or
unvested, that is outstanding and unexercised as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time (disregarding Company Options which the holder has elected to
be exercised on a net basis pursuant to the first sentence of this Section
3.1(d)) shall be assumed by Parent and converted into an option (each, an "
_Assumed Option_ ") to acquire that number of

 



6  shares of Parent Common Stock (rounded to the nearest whole share) equal to
the product of (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to
such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by
(ii) the Option Exchange Ratio (as defined below), and each such Assumed
Option shall be exercisable at a price per share of Parent Common Stock (which
price per share shall be rounded to the nearest whole cent) equal to the
aggregate exercise price of such Company Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time divided by the Option Exchange Ratio. Each Assumed Option shall
otherwise be subject to the same terms and conditions as were applicable
under the respective Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time.
It is the intention of the parties that (i) each Assumed Option that qualified
as an incentive stock option (as defined in Section 422 of the Code) shall
continue to so qualify, to the maximum extent permissible, following the
Effective Time, and (ii) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock and
exercise price per share of Parent Common Stock under each Assumed Option
shall be determined in a manner consistent with the requirements of Section
409A of the Code. The Company shall take all actions as are necessary under
the Companys 2001 Long-Term Stock Incentive Plan, as amended, and the
Companys 2012 Equity Incentive Plan (each, a " _Company Stock Incentive
Plan_ " and collectively, the " _Company Stock Incentive Plans_ "), the
agreements evidencing each such Company Option, and any applicable Law to
effect the assumption of the Company Options upon the Effective Time,
including, but not limited to, adopting all resolutions and giving all timely
notices. The form and substance of any such resolutions and notices shall be
subject to review and approval of Parent, which approval shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Parent shall take all
actions as are necessary to approve and effectuate the assumption by Parent of
such Company Options. The "Option Exchange Ratio" shall mean an amount equal
to the lesser of (i) 0.5558, or (ii) the sum of (x) the Exchange Ratio plus
(y) the quotient obtained by dividing (1) $6.20 by (2) the Parent Share Price.
The Parent and the Company have agreed that the Option Exchange Ratio
is intended to reflect a reasonable method for determining the fair market
value of the stock subject to the Company Options (within the meaning of
Treas. Reg. 1.424-1(a)(9)) as of the date hereof.

 

(e) Prior to the dates actions must be taken pursuant to this _Section
3.1(e)_, and subject to the reasonable review of Parent, the Company shall
take all actions that are necessary to cause (A) the Companys stock purchase
plans, including, without limitation, the BioMimetic Therapeutics, Inc. 2005
Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the " _Company Employee Stock Purchase Plan_
"), to be modified, terminated and/or suspended so that no new offering period
to purchase Company Common Stock shall or may occur from and after the date
hereof; (B) the rights of participants under the Company Employee Stock
Purchase Plan with respect to any offering period then underway to be
determined by shortening such offering period so that the last day of such
offering period is the date hereof, together with such other appropriate
adjustments as are necessary to reflect such shortened offering period and to
otherwise treat such shortened offering period as a fully effective and
completed offering period for all purposes under such plan; and (C) to cause
the Company Employee Stock Purchase Plan to terminate effective as of the
close of business on the day immediately prior to the Effective Time.

3.2 _Exchange of Share Certificates_.

(a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate
Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, or another bank, trust company or
transfer agent as reasonably

 



7  satisfactory to the Company to act as agent (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") for
the holders of shares of Company Common Stock to receive the Merger
Consideration to which such holders shall become entitled with respect to
such holders shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to _Section 3.1(c)_. At
or prior to the Effective Time, Parent or Merger Sub shall deposit with the
Exchange Agent (i) that number of shares of Parent Common Stock, as
applicable, (ii) cash, and (iii) CVR Certificates representing the aggregate
number of CVRs issuable pursuant to the CVR Agreement, in each case as are
issuable or payable pursuant to this _Article III_ in respect of shares of
Company Common Stock for which Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are properly
delivered to the Exchange Agent. The deposit made by Parent or Merger Sub, as
the case may be, pursuant to this _Section 3.2(a)_ is hereinafter referred
to as the " _Exchange Fund_ ". The Exchange Agent shall cause the Exchange
Fund to be (i) held for the benefit of the holders of Company Common Stock and
(ii) applied promptly to making the payments provided for in _Section
3.1(c)_. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any purpose that is not
expressly provided for in this Agreement; _provided_ that Parent may direct
the Exchange Agent to invest the Exchange Fund in obligations of or
guaranteed by the United States of America and backed by the full faith and
credit of the United States of America or in commercial paper obligations
rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Services, Inc. or Standard and
Poors Corporation, respectively; _provided further_ that no such investment
or losses thereon shall affect the Merger Consideration payable to the holders
of Company Common Stock, and following any losses Parent shall promptly
provide additional funds to the Exchange Agent for the benefit of the holders
of Company Common Stock in the amount of such losses. Any interest or other
income resulting from such investments shall be (A) the property of Parent
and (B) promptly paid to Parent. Parent shall, prior to the Effective Time,
allot Parent Common Stock referred to in _Section 3.1(c)_ on the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement.

 

(b) _Payment Procedures_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time (and in any event within five (5) Business Days of the
Effective Time), the Final Surviving Entity shall cause the Exchange Agent to
mail to each holder of record of shares of Company Common Stock at the
Effective Time (A) a letter of transmittal specifying that delivery of
the Certificates shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates and Book-Entry Shares shall pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or evidence of
Book-Entry Shares, as the case may be, to the Exchange Agent, such letter of
transmittal to be in customary form and have such other provisions as Parent
and the Company shall reasonably agree and (B) instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of the Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss
in lieu thereof) and evidence of Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger
Consideration (such instructions shall include instructions for the payment of
the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the Person in whose name the
surrendered Certificate is registered on the transfer books of the Company,
subject to the receipt of appropriate documentation for such transfer). Upon
the proper surrender of a Certificate (or effective affidavit of loss in
lieu thereof) or evidence of Book-Entry Shares to the Exchange Agent,
together with a properly completed letter of transmittal, duly executed, and
such other documents as may reasonably be requested by the Exchange Agent, the
holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares will be entitled to receive
in exchange therefor the applicable Merger Consideration (after giving effect
to any required tax withholdings) that such holder has the right to receive
pursuant to this _Article III_ , and the Certificate or Book-Entry Shares so
surrendered will forthwith be cancelled and retired. No interest shall be
paid, payable or accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of the
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. In the 

 



8  event of a transfer of ownership of shares of Company Common Stock that is
not registered in the transfer records of the Company, the Merger
Consideration to be paid and issued upon due surrender of the Certificate or
Book-Entry Shares may be paid to such a transferee if the Certificate or
evidence of Book-Entry Shares formerly representing such shares of Company
Common Stock is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all
documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that
any applicable stock transfer Taxes have been paid or are not applicable.

For the purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Person_ " shall mean any
individual, corporation (including, without limitation, any not-for-profit
corporation), general or limited partnership, limited liability company,
joint venture, estate, trust, association, organization, Governmental Entity
or other entity of any kind or nature.

(c) _Transfers_. After the Effective Time, there shall be no registration of
transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of shares of Company
Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains unclaimed by the holders of Company Common Stock one (1) year after
the Effective Time shall be returned to, and to the extent not prohibited by
Law, become the property, free and clear of all claims or interest of, Parent,
the Final Surviving Entity or another Affiliate of Parent, as may be
designated by Parent or the Final Surviving Entity. Any holders of Company
Common Stock who have not theretofore complied with this _Article III_ shall
thereafter look only to Parent or the Final Surviving Entity as a general
unsecured creditor for payment of the Merger Consideration, without any
interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, the Final
Surviving Entity, the Exchange Agent or any other Person shall be liable to
any former holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any amount properly
delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Laws. For the purposes of this Agreement, the term "
_Affiliate_ " means, with respect to any Person, (i) each Person that,
directly or indirectly, owns or controls such Person, and (ii) each Person
that controls, is controlled by or is under common control with such Person or
any Affiliate of such Person, _provided_ , that, for the purpose of this
definition, " _control_ " of a Person shall mean the possession, directly or
indirectly, of the power to direct or cause the direction of its management or
policies, whether through the ownership of voting securities, by contract or
otherwise.

(e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent (and upon such terms and
subject to such conditions as Parent shall reasonably require), (i) the
agreement by such Person to indemnify and hold harmless Parent, the Final
Surviving Entity and any of their respective Affiliates from and against any
and all claims with respect to such Certificate and/or (ii) if required by
the Exchange Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond in a reasonable
amount as indemnity against any and all such claims, the Exchange Agent or
Parent (as the case may be) will issue, or cause to be issued, in exchange
for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration upon
due surrender of the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such
Certificate pursuant to this Agreement.

 



9 (f) _Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement
to the contrary, no fractional shares of Parent Common Stock will be issued
and any holder of shares of Company Common Stock entitled to receive a
fractional share of Parent Common Stock but for this _Section 3.2(f)_ shall
be entitled to receive a cash payment, without interest, rounded to the
nearest cent, determined by multiplying (i) the per share value calculated as
the average of the closing sale prices of one share of Parent Common Stock for
the ten (10) most recent days that the Parent Common Stock has traded on The
NASDAQ Global Select Market ending on the last full trading day immediately
prior to the Effective Time by (ii) the fractional interest of the share of
Parent Common Stock which such holder would otherwise be entitled to receive
under _Section 3.1(b)_.

(g) _Withholding Rights_. Each of Parent, the Final Surviving Entity and the
Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this _Article III_ such amounts as
it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such
payment under provision of any federal, state, local or foreign Tax Law. If
Parent, the Final Surviving Entity or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be,
so withholds amounts and pays such amounts to the appropriate
Governmental Entity, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company Common
Stock or Company Options in respect of which Parent, the Final Surviving
Entity or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be, made such deduction and
withholding.

3.3 _Appraisal Rights_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, with respect
to each share of Company Common Stock (including Book-Entry Shares) as to
which the holder thereof (i) has not voted in favor of the Merger or consented
thereto in writing and who has demanded appraisal for such shares in
accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL, (ii) properly complied with Section
262 of the DGCL and (iii) has not effectively withdrawn or lost its rights to
appraisal (each, a " _Dissenting Share_ "), if any, such holder shall be
entitled to payment (subject to, and net of, any applicable withholding Tax),
solely from the Final Surviving Entity, of the appraisal value of such
Dissenting Shares to the extent permitted by and in accordance with the
provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL, except that (x) if any holder
of Dissenting Shares, under the circumstances permitted by Section 262 of the
DGCL, affirmatively withdraws or loses (through failure to perfect or
otherwise) the right to dissent or its rights for appraisal of such Dissenting
Shares, (y) if any holder of Dissenting Shares fails to establish his
entitlement to appraisal rights as provided in the DGCL or (z) if any holder
of Dissenting Shares takes or fails to take any action the consequence of
which is that such holder is not entitled to payment for his shares under the
DGCL, such holder or holders shall forfeit the right for appraisal of such
shares of Company Common Stock and such shares of Company Common Stock shall
cease to constitute Dissenting Shares, and each such share of Company Common
Stock shall, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, thereupon be deemed to
have been converted into, and to have become exchangeable for, as of the
Effective Time, the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without
any interest thereon, upon surrender, in the manner provided in _Section
3.2_, of such formerly Dissenting Shares.

 



10 (b) The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of, together with copies of,
any demands for appraisal received by the Company, withdrawals of such
demands, and any other instruments served on or otherwise received by the
Company pursuant to the DGCL. Parent shall have the right to participate in
all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any and all such demands for
appraisal. Without limiting, and in furtherance of, the foregoing, the Company
shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, (i) make any
payment with respect to any such demands for appraisal, (ii) offer to settle
or otherwise settle any such demands, (iii) waive any failure to properly make
or effect any such demand for appraisal or other action required to perfect
appraisal rights in accordance with the DGCL or (iv) agree to do any of the
foregoing.

3.4 _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_.

 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if, after the date
hereof, and prior to the Effective Time, the issued and outstanding Company
Common Stock or Parent Common Stock shall have been changed into a different
number of shares or a different class by reason of any stock split, reverse
stock split, stock dividend, reclassification, recapitalization, split-
up, combination, exchange of shares or other similar transaction, or Parent
changes the number of shares of Parent Common Stock represented by a share of
Parent Common Stock, then the Merger Consideration and Exchange Ratio and any
other similarly dependent items, as the case may be, shall be equitably
adjusted to provide to the holders of Company Common Stock the same economic
effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such action, and as so
adjusted shall, from and after the date of such event, be the Merger
Consideration, the Exchange Ratio or other dependent item, as applicable,
subject to further adjustment in accordance with this _Section 3.4_.

 

ARTICLE IV

 

 _THE CLOSING_

4.1 _Closing_.

The closing (the " _Closing_ ") of the transactions contemplated by this

as a foreign corporation in each jurisdiction where the ownership or operation

volume of the Company Common Stock, in and of itself (it being understood
that the underlying cause(s) of any such decline or change may be taken into

Event (with the understanding that the occurrence of an Adverse FDA Event
permits Parent to terminate this Agreement pursuant to the terms and
conditions of _Article IX_ ); except in the case of the preceding clauses (i),
(ii), or (iii), to the extent that such effects have a
materially disproportionate impact on the Company and its Subsidiaries taken
as a whole as compared to other companies in the same industry as the Company.

As used in this Agreement, the term " _Adverse FDA Event_ " shall mean any of
the following: (i) receipt by the Company of an order from the FDA under 21

Augment PMA submission but with a label that does not include at least the
following indications: primary hindfoot and ankle fusions, with no black box

another event) (i) result in any payment becoming due, or increase the amount
of any compensation or benefits due, to any current or former employee of the
Company and its Subsidiaries or with respect to any Company Compensation and
Benefit Plan; (ii) increase any benefits otherwise payable under any Company
Compensation and Benefit Plan; (iii) result in the acceleration of the time
of payment or vesting of any such compensation or benefits; or (iv) result in

ERISA or section 4975 of the Code. 

(viii) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the

deductible as a result of Section 280G or 162(m) of the Code.

Letter, no stock or other securities issued by the Company or any Affiliate

thereunder (" _Section 409A_ "), and (ii) since January 1, 2009, in
operational and documentary compliance with Section 409A.

rights to any employee, director, officer, consultant, or independent
contractor of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries, or any ERISA Affiliate who
performs services outside the United States.

January 1, 2010 and are in material compliance with applicable U.S. and
foreign, federal, state or local laws, statutes, ordinances, rules,
regulations, judgments, orders, injunctions, decrees, arbitration awards and
agency requirements (collectively with Permits, as defined below, " _Laws_ ")
and permits, licenses, authorizations, consents, approvals and franchises
from Governmental Entities required to conduct their businesses as currently
conducted (" _Permits_ ").

(i) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has knowledge of any
actual or threatened enforcement action or investigation by the FDA or any

the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (each, a " _Company Partner_ ") have
been so filed, maintained or furnished by the Company, its Subsidiaries and,
to the knowledge of the Company, the Company Partners, as applicable, except
where the failure to file, maintain or furnish such reports documents, forms,
claims, Permits, applications, records, submissions, supplements, amendments

professional scientific standards and applicable Law, have been conducted
using clinical practices sufficient to allow the resulting data to be included

the Companys public filings or the efficacy or safety of the Company Products
or the Companys filings with any Governmental Entity. The Company and its
Subsidiaries have not received any written notices, correspondence or other
communication from the FDA or any other Governmental Entity since January 1,

24  specifications therefor. The processes used to produce the Company Products
are described in documents maintained by the Company in a materially complete

manufacture or distribution of any Company Product produced at any facility
where any Company Product is manufactured, tested, processed, packaged or held
for sale, or (iv) investigate the Company or its products or its practices
related thereto.

(ix) The Company and its Subsidiaries are and at all times since January 1,
2010 have been in compliance with federal or state criminal or civil Laws

interactions

 



25  with healthcare professionals, the Company has a corporate compliance
program, which it follows, both in the United States and, as applicable, in
foreign countries, which complies with applicable Law and the Company
believes is the substantial equivalent of the AdvaMed Code of Ethics on
Interactions with Health Care Professionals and/or MEDECs Code on
Interactions with Healthcare Professionals and international equivalents in
the respective countries to which those codes apply.

(x) The Company and its Subsidiaries are in compliance with, and have been in

any director (or Person in a similar position), officer, agent or employee of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has made, directly or indirectly, any
payment or promise to pay, or gift or promise to give or authorized such a
promise or gift, of any money or anything of value, directly or

official or inducing him or her to use his or her influence to affect any act
or decision of a Governmental Entity; or (B) any foreign political party or
official thereof or candidate for foreign political office for the purpose of
influencing any official act or decision of such party, official or candidate
or inducing such party, official or candidate to use his, her or its

the case of both (A) and (B) above in order to assist the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries to obtain or retain business for, or direct business to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, as applicable, and under circumstances
which would subject the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any liability
under the FCPA or any of the Anticorruption Laws. The prohibition on indirect
payments or commitments includes any situation where the Person making the
payment knows, believes, or is aware of the possibility that the Person
receiving the payment will pass the payment through, in whole or in part, to a
foreign official in the circumstances set forth above.

(xi) The Company further represents and warrants, on behalf of itself and its
Subsidiaries, that (A) they have not been found by a Governmental Entity or

director, shareholder, beneficial owners, employee, agent, or Subsidiary has
received any notice or other communication, in writing or otherwise, from a
Governmental Entity regarding any actual, alleged, or potential violation of,
or failure to comply with, the Anticorruption Laws.

or any of its Subsidiaries has licensed to any third party the right to use
any material Intellectual Property Rights (other than non-exclusive licenses
to customers as customary in the industry), in each case specifying the
parties to the agreement (such agreements, the " _Company Intellectual
Property Agreements_ "). To the knowledge of the Company: (A) all Company
Intellectual Property Agreements are in full force and effect, as the same
may have been amended prior to the date hereof, and (B) neither the Company,
its Subsidiaries nor any third party that is party to any Company Intellectual
Property Agreement is in material breach thereof. The Company has not
received written notice of any pending disputes regarding the scope of any
Company Intellectual Property Agreements, performance under the Company
Intellectual Property Agreements, or with respect to payments made or received
under any Company Intellectual Property Agreements.

(s) _Title to Properties_. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries has good
and valid title to all of its material real properties and physical assets,
free and clear of all mortgages, liens, pledges, charges, security interests,
encumbrances or other adverse claims of any kind in respect of such property
or asset (collectively, " _Liens_ "), except Permitted Liens. _Section
5.1(s)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a list of all real
property currently leased, subleased, licensed or occupied by or from the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries (the " _Company Facilities_ ") and
identifies all leases, lease guaranties, subleases and similar agreements
relating to the Companys occupancy of the Company Facilities and all
amendments, terminations and modifications thereof (the " _Company Leases_
"). All Company Leases and all leases pursuant to which the Company and each
of its Subsidiaries leases from others material personal property are valid
and effective in accordance with their respective terms, and there is not,
under any of

 



33  such leases, any existing default or event of default of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries or, to the knowledge of the Company, any other party (or
any event which with notice or lapse of time, or both, would constitute such
a default) that, individually or in the aggregate, would be reasonably likely
to be material to the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole or the
operations of their respective businesses as currently conducted or would be
reasonably likely to result in a termination or acceleration of a Company
Lease. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries owns or leases all such
properties as are material to its operations as now conducted. Neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries owns any real property or has ever
owned any real property, nor is the Company or any of its Subsidiaries party
to any agreement to purchase or sell any real property. There are no parties
occupying, or with a right to occupy any Company Facilities other than the
Company and its Subsidiaries.

(t) _Material Contracts_. For purposes of this Agreement, a " _Material
Contract_ " means each of the following: (i) any "material contract" (as such
term is defined in Item 601(b)(10) of Regulation S-K under the Securities
Act); (ii) any Contract with any employee, individual consultant or
independent contractor that provides for annual compensation in excess of
$150,000 and is not immediately terminable by the Company or any of its

contemplated by this Agreement (including the Merger) or any Contract that is
entered into in connection with this Agreement; (iii) any collective
bargaining agreement or other Contract with a labor organization; (iv) any

business, (B) granting any exclusive rights, (C) containing a "most favored
nation" or similar provision, (D) prohibiting the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries (or, after the Effective Time, Parent) from engaging in
business with any Person or levying a fine, charge or other payment for doing
so or (E) otherwise prohibiting or limiting the right of the Company or its
Subsidiaries to develop, sell, distribute or manufacture any products or
services, other than such Contracts that may be cancelled without continuing
material obligations, restrictions or liabilities to the Company upon notice
of thirty (30) days or less; (vi) any Contract (A) relating to the license,
disposition or acquisition by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of a

material ownership interest in any other Person or other business enterprise
other than the Companys Subsidiaries; (vii) any Contract for the acquisition
or disposition of any business; (viii) any material dealer, distributor,
sales agency, joint marketing agreement, to jointly market any product,

develop any Intellectual Property Rights that will not be owned solely by the
Company or one of its Subsidiaries; (x) any joint venture agreements, material
development agreements, or material outsourcing arrangements (including
material Contracts to assemble, manufacture and package any Company Product);

case; (xiii) any Contract with the federal government, any foreign
government, any state or local government or any division, subdivision,
department, agency or instrumentality thereof; (xiv) any Lease of, or purchase
or sale Contract with respect to, any real property; (xv) any Contract with
any healthcare provider (e.g., doctors and contract research organizations) of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that may not be cancelled without

(xvi) any Contract that provides for payment obligations by the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries of $100,000 or more in any individual case and is not
disclosed pursuant to clauses (i) through (xv) above; and (xvii) any
Contract, the termination or breach of which would be reasonably expected to
have a Company Material Adverse Effect and is not disclosed pursuant to
clauses (i) through (xv) above. Other than Material Contracts filed as
an exhibit to the Company Reports, _Section 5.1(t)_ of the Company
Disclosure Letter contains a complete and accurate list of all Material
Contracts to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or which
bind or affect their respective properties or assets, and identifies each
subsection of _Section 5.1(t)_ that describes such Material Contract. The
Company has delivered or made available to Parent complete and correct copies
of each such Material Contract. To the knowledge of the Company, each
Material Contract is valid and binding on the Company (and/or each such
Subsidiary of the Company, as the case may be) and is in full force and
effect, and neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries party thereto,
nor, to the knowledge of the Company, any other party thereto, is in breach
of, or default under, in any material respect, any such Material Contract, and
to the knowledge of the Company no event has occurred that with notice or
lapse of time or both would constitute such a breach or default thereunder in
any material respect by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or, to the
knowledge of the Company, any other party thereto. Neither the Company nor any
of its Subsidiaries has received any written notice or other communication
regarding any actual or alleged violation or breach of or default under, or
intention to cancel or modify, any Material Contract. Neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries has entered into any standstill agreement with any
third party (or other agreement containing a standstill provision) that does
not automatically terminate upon the execution of this Agreement.

(u) _Product Liability_. No product liability claims have been asserted in
writing against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or, to the knowledge of
the Company, threatened against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
relating to any of their products or product candidates developed, tested,
manufactured, marketed, distributed or sold by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, except for claims that, individually or in the aggregate, are
not reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. There is no
judgment, order or decree outstanding against the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries relating to product liability claims or assessments.

 

(v) _Insurance_. The Company maintains for itself and its Subsidiaries
insurance policies covering the assets, business, equipment, properties,
operations, employees, directors and officers, and product warranty and
liability claims, and such other forms of insurance in such amounts, with such
deductibles and against such risks and losses as, in its judgment, are
reasonable for the business and assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries.
All such insurance policies are in full force and effect, all premiums due and
payable thereon have been paid, and the Company and its Subsidiaries are
otherwise in compliance in all material respects with the terms and
conditions of such policies and bonds.

 



35 (w) _Company Vote Required_. The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority
of the shares of Company Common Stock outstanding on the record date for such
vote and entitled to vote thereon (the " _Company Requisite Vote_ ") is the
only vote of the holders of any class or series of capital stock of the
Company that is or will be necessary for the adoption of this Agreement by
the Company or for the Company to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby (including, without limitation, the Merger).

 

(x) _Suppliers_. To the knowledge of the Company, there are no facts
concerning the Companys suppliers of active ingredients, bulk chemical
products and finished drug products that would reasonably be expected to
result in any material interruption (whether due to a regulatory, including
without limitation, customs, manufacturing, intellectual property or any other
issue) of the timely supply by such suppliers to the Company and its
Subsidiaries of any such materials. No such supplier has notified the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries in writing that it intends to terminate or
materially alter the terms of its relationship with the Company and its
Subsidiaries. To the knowledge of the Company, the conduct of the businesses
of such suppliers, at the locations from which products or ingredients are
produced for the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, are in compliance in all
material respects with all applicable Laws, including the regulations of the
FDA.

the businesses of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) any material
business dealings or a material financial interest in any transaction with the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries (other than compensation and benefits

Company or any of its Subsidiaries) or (iii) any material equity interest or
any other material financial or profit interest in any Person that has had

liability for any brokerage fees, commissions or finders fees to any broker
or finder employed or engaged thereby in connection with the Merger or the
other transactions contemplated in this Agreement. The Company has made
available to Parent a true and complete copy of its engagement letter

the Company Advisor to the effect that, as of its date and based upon and
subject to the limitations, qualifications and assumptions set forth therein,
the Merger Consideration is fair from a financial point of view to the
stockholders of the Company. As soon as practicable following the date
hereof, an executed copy of the aforementioned opinion will be made available
to Parent for informational purposes only.

 



36 (bb) _No Other Representations or Warranties_. Except for the representations
and warranties contained in this _Section 5.1_, neither the Company nor any
other Person makes any other express or implied representation or warranty on
behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

quarter ended September 30, 2012, or any of Parents Current Reports on Form

date hereof (excluding any disclosures set forth therein to the extent that
they do not relate to historical or existing facts, events, changes, effects,
developments, conditions or occurrences and excluding any disclosures set
forth therein to the extent that they are predictive, cautionary or forward-
looking in nature, including risk factor disclosure) and, for the avoidance of
doubt, without giving effect to any event occurring subsequent to the date
that any such public filing was filed, or (ii) the Parent Disclosure
Letter, Parent, Merger Sub and Sister Subsidiary each represents and
warrants, jointly and severally, to the Company that:

Sub, Sister Subsidiary and each of Parents other Subsidiaries is validly
existing and in good standing under the Laws of its respective jurisdiction of
organization and has all requisite corporate or similar power and authority
to own and operate its material properties and assets and to carry on its
business as currently conducted in all material respects and is qualified to
do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction where the ownership
or operation of its properties and assets or conduct of its business requires
such qualification, except where the failure to be so qualified or be in good
standing would not be reasonably likely to have, either individually or in
the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect or to prevent, materially
delay or materially impair the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby. Parent has made available to
the Company a complete and correct copy of the Organizational Documents of
Parent, Merger Sub and Sister Subsidiary, each as amended and in effect. The
Organizational Documents of Parent, Merger Sub and Sister Subsidiary so made
available to the Company are in full force and effect.

arising out of (i) any change, after the date hereof, in applicable Law or

relating specifically to this Agreement or the Merger; (vii) any failure by
Parent to meet published analysts estimates, internal or external
projections or forecasts of revenues, earnings or other financial or business
metrics, in and of itself (it being understood that the underlying cause(s) of
any such failure may be taken into account unless otherwise excluded by this
definition), (viii) any decline in the market price or change in the trading
volume of the Parent Common Stock, in and of itself (it being understood that
the underlying cause(s) of any such decline or change may be taken
into account unless otherwise excluded by this definition), except in the
case of the preceding clauses (i), (ii), and (iii) to the extent that such
effects have a disproportionate impact on Parent and its Subsidiaries taken as
a whole as compared to other companies in the same industry as Parent, or (y)
prevents, materially delays or materially impairs the ability of Parent or
Merger Sub to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Subsidiary of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby,
except for those that the failure to make or obtain would not be reasonably

(ii) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by Parent,
Merger Sub or Sister Subsidiary do not, and the consummation by Parent,

respects, the financial position of Parent and its Subsidiaries as of the date
thereof, and the results of operations and cash flows for the periods set

notes and normal year-end audit adjustments), in each case in conformity with
U.S. GAAP, except as may be noted therein. Any change by Parent in
the accounting principles, practices or methods used in such financial
statements of Parent and its Subsidiaries included in the Parent Reports has
been appropriately disclosed in such financial statements.

 



40 (iii) Parents disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in sections
13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) effectively enable Parent to
comply with, and the appropriate officers of Parent to make all certifications
required under, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act; and Parent has implemented a system of
internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of
the Exchange Act) sufficient to provide reasonable assurance regarding the

financial reporting.

any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make
the statements made therein not misleading or (ii) the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus will, at the date of mailing to holders of Company Common
Stock and at the time of the Company Stockholders Meeting to be held
in connection with the Merger, contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. When filed, the S-4
Registration Statement will comply as to form in all material respects with
the requirements of the Securities Act and the rules and regulations
thereunder. No representation or warranty is made by Parent with respect to
statements made or incorporated by reference therein based on information
supplied by the Company for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the
Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the S-4 Registration Statement.

investigations or material internal investigations pending, or to the

(i) Parent and each of its Subsidiaries owns, or is licensed or otherwise
possesses sufficient legally enforceable rights to use and enforce all
Intellectual Property Rights used in or necessary for the conduct of, and that
are material to the operations of, its business as currently conducted,
including without limitation all Intellectual Property Rights owned, licensed
to, or used by Parent or any of its Affiliates that are necessary for and
material to Parents and its Subsidiaries research, development, testing,
manufacturing, marketing or sale of all products currently commercialized by
Parent or its Subsidiaries (all such Intellectual Property Rights,
collectively " _Parent Intellectual Property Rights_ "). All Patents,
registered Trademarks, filed Trademark applications, registered copyrights and
filed copyright applications owned by Parent or its Subsidiaries
(collectively, " _Registered Parent Owned Intellectual Property_ ") are valid
and enforceable, and have been maintained in accordance with commercially
reasonable industry practices. To the knowledge of Parent, all Patents,
registered Trademarks, filed Trademark applications, registered copyrights and
filed copyright applications that are (A) licensed to Parent or its
Subsidiaries and (B) material to the operations of their
respective businesses, as currently conducted (collectively, " _Registered
Parent Licensed Intellectual Property_ "), are valid and enforceable, and have
been maintained in accordance with commercially reasonable industry practices.
The Registered Parent Owned Intellectual Property has been duly registered
with or applied for in the United States Patent and Trademark Office, United
States Copyright Office or other appropriate domestic or foreign filing
office, and such registrations and applications remain in full force and
effect (other than with respect to natural expiration). To the knowledge of
Parent, the Registered Parent Licensed Intellectual Property that is
exclusively licensed to Parent or its Subsidiaries (collectively, "
_Registered Parent Exclusively Licensed Intellectual Property"_ ) has been
duly registered with or applied for in the United States Patent and Trademark
Office, United States Copyright Office or other appropriate domestic or
foreign filing office, and such registrations and applications remain in full
force and effect (other than with respect to natural expiration).

(ii) To the knowledge of Parent, (A) the conduct of the respective businesses
of Parent and its Subsidiaries, as currently conducted, does not infringe
upon, constitute a misappropriation of, or otherwise violate any right,
title, interest in or to any, Intellectual Property Right of any third party,
(B) neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has received written notice of
any claim, nor is any such claim pending or, to the knowledge of Parent,
threatened, that any Registered Parent Owned Intellectual Property or
Registered Parent Exclusively Licensed Intellectual Property is invalid or
unenforceable, or conflicts with the asserted Intellectual Property Right of
any third party, and (C) neither the Registered Parent Owned Intellectual
Property nor the Registered Parent Exclusively Licensed Intellectual Property
is being infringed upon, misappropriated or otherwise violated by any third
party. To Parents knowledge, the manufacture, use, sale, offer for sale and
import of any product currently marketed by Parent or its Subsidiaries does
not infringe any claim of any issued Patent or published patent application of
any third party, except that of a licensor who has granted Parent or its
applicable Subsidiaries a license under such patent. No court has ruled or
otherwise held that any of the issued Patents owned by Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries are invalid or unenforceable, and, to

 



43  the knowledge of Parent, no court has ruled or otherwise held that any of
the issued Patents included in the Registered Parent Exclusively Licensed
Intellectual Property are invalid or unenforceable. There are no pending or,
to the knowledge of Parent, threatened, interference, re-examination,
opposition or cancellation proceedings involving, or other proceedings
challenging the validity, ownership or use of, the Registered Parent Owned
Intellectual Property. To the knowledge of Parent, there are no pending or
threatened, interference, re-examination, opposition or cancellation
proceedings involving, or other proceedings challenging the validity,
ownership or use of, the Registered Parent Exclusively Licensed Intellectual
Property. Parent or its applicable Subsidiaries have the sole and exclusive
right to bring actions for infringement or unauthorized use of the Registered
Parent Owned Intellectual Property. 

(iii) No Registered Parent Owned Intellectual Property will terminate or cease
to be a valid right of Parent by reason of the execution and delivery of this
Agreement by Parent, the performance by Parent of its obligations hereunder,
or the consummation by Parent of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. No Parent Intellectual Property Agreement will terminate or cease
to be a valid right of Parent by reason of the execution and delivery of this
Agreement by Parent, the performance of Parent of its obligations hereunder,
or the consummation by Parent of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

(iv) Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has entered into any consents,
judgments, orders, indemnifications, forbearances to sue, settlement
agreements, licenses or other arrangements in connection with the resolution
of any disputes or Litigation Claims which (A) materially restrict Parents or
any of its Subsidiaries right to use any Registered Parent Owned
Intellectual Property or Registered Parent Licensed Intellectual Property, or
(B) materially restrict Parents or any of its Subsidiaries businesses in any
manner in order to accommodate any third partys Intellectual Property Right.

(v) Parent and its Subsidiaries have caused each employee, contractor,
consultant and officer of Parent or its Subsidiaries that has made any
material contribution to the creation or development of Parent Intellectual
Property Rights to enter into Contracts to assign and transfer to Parent or
its Subsidiaries all Intellectual Property Rights created or developed by
such employees, contractors, consultants and officers in the course of their
employment or engagement by Parent or its Subsidiaries.

 

(vi) Parent and its Subsidiaries have taken commercially reasonable steps to
maintain the confidentiality of their material trade secrets, and, to
Parents knowledge, none of such trade secrets have been disclosed to any
other Person, except pursuant to written confidentiality obligations. To the
knowledge of Parent, there are no unauthorized uses, disclosures or
infringements of any such trade secrets by any Person, except where such use,
disclosure or infringement would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Parent Material Adverse Effect. Parent and its Subsidiaries have a
policy requiring employees and certain consultants and contractors to execute
a confidentiality and assignment agreement substantially in Parents standard
form previously provided to the Company.

 



44 (vii) To the knowledge of Parent: (A) all material Contracts as of the date
hereof (x) under which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries licenses any material
Intellectual Property Rights from a third party or (y) under which Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries has licensed to any third party the right to use
any material Intellectual Property Rights (such agreements, the " _Parent
Intellectual Property Agreements_ ") are in full force and effect, as the same
may have been amended prior to the date hereof, and (B) neither Parent,
its Subsidiaries nor any third party that is party to any Parent Intellectual
Property Agreement is in material breach thereof. Parent has not received
written notice of any pending disputes regarding the scope of any Parent
Intellectual Property Agreements, performance under the Parent Intellectual
Property Agreements, or with respect to payments made or received under any
Parent Intellectual Property Agreements.

(p) _Title to Properties_. Parent and each of its Subsidiaries has good and
valid title to all of its material properties and assets, free and clear of
all Liens, except for Permitted Liens and such Liens or other imperfections
of title, if any, that, individually or in the aggregate, are not reasonably
likely to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

(q) _Insurance_. Parent maintains for itself and its Subsidiaries insurance
policies covering the assets, business, equipment, properties, operations,
employees, directors and officers, and product warranty and liability claims,
and such other forms of insurance in such amounts, with such deductibles and
against such risks and losses as, in its judgment, are reasonable for the
business and assets of Parent and its Subsidiaries. All such insurance
policies are in full force and effect, all premiums due and payable thereon
have been paid, and Parent and its Subsidiaries are otherwise in compliance in
all material respects with the terms and conditions of such policies and
bonds. 

(r) _Brokers and Finders_. Except for J.P. Morgan Securities, LLC, the fees,
commissions and expenses of which will be paid by Parent, neither Parent,
Merger Sub nor any of their respective Affiliates has incurred any liability
for any brokerage fees, commissions or finders fees to any broker or finder
employed or engaged thereby in connection with the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated in this Agreement for which the Company (other than
the Final Surviving Entity from and after the Effective Time) would be liable.

(s) _Financial Capability; Parent Common Stock_. Parent will have at the
Effective Time, and taking into account the Companys resources, sufficient
funds available to pay the Cash Consideration and all amounts payable in lieu
of fractional shares pursuant to _Section 3.2(f)_. Parent will have at the
Effective Time sufficient authorized but unissued shares of Parent Common
Stock to issue the Stock Consideration pursuant to  _Section 3.1(c)(i)_.

(t) _Ownership of Shares_. None of Parent or any of Parents "Affiliates" or
"Associates" directly or indirectly "owns," and at all times during the three
(3) year period prior to the date of this Agreement, none of Parent or any of
Parents "Affiliates" or "Associates" has "owned," beneficially or otherwise,
any shares of Company Common Stock, and neither Parent, Merger Sub nor Sister
Subsidiary is, nor at any time during the three (3) year period prior to the
date hereof has been, an "interested stockholder," as those terms (in
quotation marks) are defined in Section 203 of the DGCL.

 



45 (u) _No Parent Vote Required_. No vote of the holders of shares of Parent
Common Stock is or will be necessary for the adoption of this Agreement by
Parent or for Parent to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby
(including, without limitation, the Merger).

 

(v) _No Other Representations or Warranties_. Except for the representations
and warranties contained in this  _Section 5.2_, neither Parent nor any
other Person makes any other express or implied representation or warranty on
behalf of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries.

to its executive officers, to its properties, books, contracts and records
and, during such period, each shall (and each shall cause its Subsidiaries to)
furnish promptly to the other all information concerning its business,
properties, personnel and Litigation Claims as may reasonably be requested

or (iii) the disclosure of trade secrets or other confidential information of
third party to whom such party owes a duty of confidentiality, _provided_ that

addition, the Company shall promptly request that each such Person promptly
return or destroy all confidential information heretofore furnished to such
Person by or on behalf of the Company. The Company and its Subsidiaries will
promptly inform the parties referred to in the first sentence of this

liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries, (ii) any sale, lease, exchange, mortgage, pledge,
transfer or purchase of the assets or equity securities of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries, in each case comprising 20% or more in value of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, in a single transaction or
series of related transactions, or (iii) any purchase or sale of, or tender
offer or exchange offer for, 20% or more of the voting power or outstanding
shares of Company Common Stock (any such proposal or offer (other than a
proposal or offer by Parent) being hereinafter referred to as an "
_Acquisition Proposal_ ").

its Affiliates, Subsidiaries and Representatives not to) directly or
indirectly, (i) participate in or engage in any negotiations concerning, or

respect to, an Acquisition Proposal or (v) publicly announce the intention to

Company Board or its Representatives from, prior to obtaining the Company
Requisite Vote, (x) furnishing information to a third party and
its Representatives in response to an unsolicited written Acquisition
Proposal by such third party pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement
with terms and conditions that are no less favorable to the Company than those
set forth in the Confidentiality Agreement (provided that such

 



52  confidentiality agreement may not include any provision granting any such
Person or group an exclusive right to negotiate with the Company) (an "
_Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement_ ") or (y) after receiving an executed
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, engaging in discussions or negotiations
with such third party and its Representatives with respect to such Acquisition
Proposal, in either case, if, and only if (A) the Company has not
intentionally and materially breached this _Section 7.2_, including, without
limitation, _Section 7.2(g)_, (B) prior to taking such action, the Company
Board concludes in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor

Proposal is a Superior Proposal or is likely to result in a Superior Proposal
and (C) prior to taking such action, the Company Board concludes in good
faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside counsel) that

Company may (i) withdraw, modify or amend in a manner adverse to Parent the
Company Board Recommendation in connection with such Acquisition Proposal,

obtained, (C) the Company Board concludes in good faith (after consultation
with its financial advisor and outside counsel) that such Acquisition Proposal
is a Superior Proposal, and (D) the Company Board concludes in good faith
(after consultation with its financial advisor and outside counsel) that
failing to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to
the Companys stockholders under Delaware Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the Company may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to clause (ii) above,
and any purported termination pursuant to clause (ii) above shall be void and
of no force or effect, unless in advance of, or concurrently with,
such termination, the Company pays the Company Termination Fee in the manner
provided for in _Section 9.5(b)_; _provided_ , _further_ , that neither the
Company nor the Company Board may terminate this Agreement pursuant to 
_Section 9.4(b)_, until at least three (3) Business Days ( _provided_ that
there are at least three (3) Business Days before the date scheduled for the
Company Stockholders Meeting) have passed following Parents receipt of
written notice from the Company advising Parent that the Company Board has
received such a Superior Proposal which it intends to accept (it being
understood and agreed that any amendment to the amount or form of
consideration of the Superior Proposal shall require a new notice and a new
two (2)-Business Day period ( _provided_ that there are at least two (2)
Business Days before the date scheduled for the Company Stockholders
Meeting)), specifying the terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal, and
Parent does not irrevocably undertake to make such adjustments to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement such that the Acquisition Proposal would no
longer constitute a Superior Proposal. The Company shall, upon the request of
Parent, negotiate in good faith with Parent to make any such adjustments, and
the Company Board shall promptly consider in good faith (in consultation with
its outside counsel and financial advisor) any such adjustments
irrevocably proposed by Parent.

(e) Notwithstanding _Section 7.2(d)_ above, the Company may withdraw, modify
or amend in a manner adverse to Parent the Company Board Recommendation other
than in connection with an Acquisition Proposal (it being understood and
agreed that any change of

 



53  Company Board Recommendation proposed in relation to an Acquisition Proposal
may only be made pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of 7.2(d)
above), if, and only if, prior to taking such action, (A) the Company
Requisite Vote shall not have been obtained, (B) a material fact, event,
change, development or set of circumstances occurs after the date of this
Agreement that was not known to or was not reasonably foreseeable by the
Company Board as of or prior to the date of this Agreement, (C) the Company
Board concludes in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor
and outside counsel) that failing to take such action would be inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties to the Companys stockholders under Delaware Law;
(D) the Company shall have given Parent at least three (3) Business Days
prior written notice of its intention to take such action ( _provided_ that
there are at least three (3) Business Days before the date scheduled for the
Company Stockholders Meeting) (which notice shall include a written
explanation of the Company Boards basis and rationale for proposing to effect
such withdrawal, modification or amendment to the Company Board
Recommendation) and (E) Parent has not irrevocably undertaken to make such
adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement that would obviate
the need for the Company to effect such withdrawal, modification or amendment
to the Company Board Recommendation. The Company shall, upon the request of
Parent, negotiate in good faith with Parent to make any such adjustments, and
the Company Board shall promptly consider in good faith (in consultation with
its outside counsel and financial advisor) any such adjustments irrevocably
proposed by Parent. For the purposes of this Agreement, the Company
acknowledges and agrees that (x) the FDA Approval of Augment (and
developments supporting or potentially leading to the FDA Approval of
Augment) are reasonably foreseeable and (y) the consideration contemplated by
this Agreement and the CVR Agreement is designed to compensate Company
stockholders upon FDA Approval of Augment.

(f) Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the Company Board
from taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by
Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that neither the Company nor the Company Board may make withdraw, modify or
amend in a manner adverse to Parent the Company Board Recommendation other
than in accordance with _Section 7.2(d)_ or _Section 7.2(e)_; _provided,
further_ , any public disclosure related to an Acquisition Proposal, other
than a "stop, look and listen" communication of the type contemplated by
Section 14d-9(f) of the Exchange Act, shall be deemed to be in a change of
Company Board Recommendation unless the Company Board expressly publicly
reaffirms the Company Board Recommendation in such communication.

(g) Neither the Company nor the Company Board shall exempt any Person from the
restrictions on takeover offers, business combinations, control share
acquisitions, fair price, moratorium or other similar provisions contained in
the DGCL, including Section 203 thereof (or any similar provisions), or
otherwise cause such restrictions not to apply (including without limitation
by approving a Person becoming an "interested shareholder" within the meaning
of Section 203 of the DGCL).

(h) The Company will promptly (and in any event within one (1) Business Day)
notify Parent in writing, of any Acquisition Proposal or the existence of any
proposal, discussion, negotiation, inquiry or request for information
received by the Company with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, and any
terms and conditions thereof (and shall promptly (and in any event within one
(1) Business Day of receipt thereof) provide to Parent copies of any written
materials (including electronic materials) received by the Company in
connection therewith), including

 



54  any financing commitments relating thereto (and where no copy is available,
a description of such Acquisition Proposal, proposal, inquiry or request for
information), and the identity of the Person making such Acquisition
Proposal, proposal, inquiry or request for information or with whom such
discussions or negotiations are taking place. The Company will provide to
Parent any nonpublic information concerning the Company that it intends to
deliver to any other Person that was not previously provided to Parent
contemporaneously with providing such information to such other Person.

(i) " _Superior Proposal_ " means a written Acquisition Proposal (on its most
recently amended or modified terms) that the Company Board determines in good
faith (after consultation with its outside counsel and financial advisor),
taking into account all of the terms and conditions of such proposal,
including, among other things, all legal and financial (including any break-up
fees payable) aspects of the proposal and the third party making the
proposal, (i) to be more favorable to the Companys stockholders from a
financial point of view than the Merger and any revised terms thereof
irrevocably proposed by Parent and (ii) is as reasonably likely to be
consummated without undue delay in accordance with its terms, taking into
account all legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects to the proposal as
compared to the Merger and any revised terms thereof irrevocably proposed by
Parent; _provided_ that for purposes of the definition of "Superior
Proposal", the references to "20% or more" in the definition of Acquisition
Proposal shall be deemed to be references to "50% or more."

 

(j) Any withdrawal, modification or amendment by a special committee of the
Company Board Recommendation and any approval, endorsement or recommendation
by a special committee of any Acquisition Proposal, and any public
announcement of an intention of a special committee with respect to any of the
foregoing, shall be deemed and treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
if such action were taken by the Company Board with respect to the Company
Board Recommendation or any such Acquisition Proposal, as applicable.

(k) Without limiting the foregoing, it is agreed that any action that would be
breach or violation by the Company of the provisions of this _Section 7.2_,
if taken by any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates or the Company Board,
whether or not such Person is purporting to act on behalf of the Company or
otherwise, shall be deemed to be a breach of this _Section 7.2_ by the
Company.

 

7.3 _Stockholders Meeting_.

(a) The Company shall take, in accordance with applicable Law and its
Organizational Documents, all action necessary to convene a meeting of holders
of shares of Company Common Stock (the " _Company Stockholders Meeting_ ") as
promptly as practicable after the Proxy Statement/Prospectus is mailed to its
stockholders to consider and vote upon the adoption of this Agreement. Except
as otherwise permitted by _Section 7.2_, the Company Board shall include the
Company Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus unless
withdrawn as permitted by _Section 7.2_ and take all lawful action to solicit
such approval and shall use reasonable best efforts to solicit from its
stockholders proxies in favor of such approval, including engaging a proxy
solicitation firm to assist in such solicitation.

 



55 (b) Once the Company Stockholders Meeting has been called, the Company will
not adjourn or postpone the Company Stockholders Meeting, without Parents
prior written consent except to the extent necessary (A) to provide any
necessary supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus to its
stockholders in advance of the vote to be held at such meeting, (B) if as of
the time for which the Company Stockholders Meeting is originally scheduled
(as set forth in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus) there are insufficient shares
of capital stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to approve such
matters thereat or to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of
such meeting or (C) if additional time is reasonably required to solicit
proxies in favor of approval of the matters to be voted upon at such meeting.

7.4 _Filings; Other Actions; Notifications; Third-Party Consents_.

 

(a) Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company will as promptly as practicable
make all filings, notices, petitions, statements, registrations, submissions
of information, applications or submissions of other documents required by any
Governmental Entity, including an appropriate filing of a Notification and
Report Form with the Federal Trade Commission and the Antitrust Division of
the Department of Justice as required by the HSR Act with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby (which HSR filing shall in any event be made
within fifteen (15) days after the execution of this Agreement) and to supply
as promptly as practicable any additional information and documentary
material that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act. Each of Parent and the
Company will use its reasonable best efforts to cause all documents that it is
responsible for filing with any Governmental Entity under this _Section 7.4_
to comply in all material respects with all applicable Law. Each party hereto
will use its reasonable best efforts to make such filings in a timely manner
and to respond as promptly as practicable to any requests for additional
information made by any such agency. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company will notify the other promptly upon the receipt of: (i) any comments
from any officials of any Governmental Entity in connection with any filings
made pursuant hereto and (ii) any request by any officials of any Governmental
Entity for amendments or supplements to any filings made pursuant to, or
information provided to comply in all material respects with, applicable Law.
Whenever any event occurs that is required to be set forth in an amendment or
supplement to any filing made pursuant to this _Section 7.4(a)_, Parent,
Merger Sub or the Company, as the case may be, will promptly inform the other
of such occurrence and cooperate in filing with the applicable Governmental
Entity such amendment or supplement. Subject to applicable Laws relating to
the exchange of information and the preservation of any applicable attorney-
client privilege, work-product doctrine, self-audit privilege or other
similar privilege, Parent and the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to
collaborate in reviewing and commenting on in advance, and to consult the
other on, information relating to Parent or the Company, as the case may be,
and any of their respective Subsidiaries, that appears in any filing made
with, or written materials submitted to, any third party and/or any
Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby. In connection with such collaboration, each of the
Company and Parent shall act reasonably and as promptly as practicable.

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing
contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to require Parent or any its
Subsidiaries or Affiliates to agree to 

 



56  any divestiture, by itself or any of its Affiliates or Subsidiaries, of
shares of capital stock or of any business, assets or property of Parent or
its Subsidiaries or Affiliates, or of the Company, or the imposition of any
limitation on the ability of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates
to conduct their respective businesses or to own or exercise control of such
assets, properties and stock.

 

(c) Subject to _Section 7.4(b)_, each of the parties hereto agrees to use
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to
do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in
doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make
effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including using reasonable
best efforts to accomplish the following: (i) the causing of the conditions
precedent set forth in _Article VI_ to be satisfied, (ii) the obtaining
of all Company Required Statutory Approvals and Parent Required Statutory
Approvals, (iii) the defending of any suits, claims, actions, investigations
or proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement
or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, including
seeking to have any stay, temporary restraining order or preliminary
injunction entered by any court or other Governmental Entity vacated or
reversed, and (iv) the execution or delivery of any additional instruments
necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by, and to fully carry
out the purposes of, this Agreement. In connection with and without limiting
the foregoing, the Company and the Company Board shall, if any takeover
statute or similar Law is or becomes applicable to the Merger, this Agreement,
the Voting Agreements or any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, use its reasonable best efforts to ensure that the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and
otherwise to minimize the effect of such Law on the Merger, this Agreement,
the Voting Agreements and the transactions contemplated hereby.

(d) In furtherance of the foregoing, subject to _Section 7.4(b)_, as soon
as practicable following the date hereof, Parent and the Company will each
use its reasonable best efforts to obtain any material third-party consents,
waivers and approvals required to be obtained in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ , that
neither this _Section 7.4(d)_ nor any other provision of this Agreement shall
obligate the Company to obtain any consents, waivers or approvals that are
conditioned upon any material payments or incurrence of other material
obligations by Parent, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries.

(e) Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company, and the Company shall
give prompt notice to Parent, of (i) any representation or warranty made by it
contained in this Agreement becoming untrue or inaccurate in any material
respect or (ii) the material failure by it to comply with or satisfy any
covenant, condition, or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under
this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such notification shall
affect the representations, warranties, covenants, or agreements of the
parties or the conditions to the obligations of the parties under this
Agreement; _provided_ , _further_ , that an unintentional failure to comply
with this  _Section 7.4(e)_ will not constitute the failure of any condition
set forth in _Article VIII_ to be satisfied unless the underlying inaccuracy
or breach would independently result in the failure of a condition set forth
in _Article VIII_ to be satisfied.

 



57 7.5 _Transaction Litigation_.

 

The Company shall provide Parent or its counsel with prompt notice of, and
copies of all pleadings and written correspondence relating to, any
proceeding against the Company, any of its Subsidiaries, or any of their
respective directors or officers by any stockholder of the Company
specifically relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. The Company shall give Parent the opportunity to participate
in the defense, settlement, or compromise of any such proceeding, and no such
settlement or compromise shall be agreed to without the prior written consent
of Parent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or
delayed. For purposes of this paragraph "participate" means that Parent will
be kept apprised of proposed strategy and other significant decisions with
respect to the proceeding by the Company (to the extent the attorney-client
privilege between the Company and its counsel is not undermined or otherwise
affected), and Parent may offer comments or suggestions with respect to the
proceeding but will not be afforded any decision making power or other
authority over the proceeding except for the settlement or compromise consent
set forth above.

7.6 _Proxy Statement/Prospectus; S-4 Registration Statement_.

(a) As promptly as practicable after the execution and delivery of
this Agreement (but in any event within twenty (20) Business Days), (i)
Parent and the Company shall cooperate in preparing and shall cause to be
filed with the SEC mutually acceptable proxy materials that shall constitute
the proxy statement/prospectus relating to the Merger and the issuance of the
shares of Parent Common Stock and CVRs to be issued in connection with the
Merger (the " _Proxy Statement/Prospectus_ "), (ii) Parent shall prepare and
file with the SEC the S-4 Registration Statement (in which the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus shall be included) in connection with the registration
under the Securities Act of the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in
connection with the Merger, and (iii) Parent shall use its reasonable best
efforts to, if required by Law, have the CVR Agreement become qualified under
the Trust Indenture Act. Each of Parent and the Company shall provide promptly
to the other such information concerning its business affairs and financial
statements as, in the reasonable judgment of the providing party or its
counsel, may be required or appropriate for inclusion in the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus and the S-4 Registration Statement, or in any
amendments or supplements thereto, and shall cause its counsel and auditors
to cooperate with the others counsel and auditors in the preparation and
filing of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and the S-4 Registration Statement.
Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause such S-4 Registration
Statement to become effective under the Securities Act as soon as practicable
after the date of such filing (and, in any event, within two (2) Business Days
of being informed by the SEC or its staff that it or they have no comments or
no further comments on such the S-4 Registration Statement) and to keep the
S-4 Registration Statement effective as long as is necessary to consummate the
Merger. The Proxy Statement/Prospectus shall include, among other things, (x)
the Company Board Recommendation, except to the extent that the Company Board
shall have withdrawn or modified its approval or recommendation as permitted
by _Section 7.2_, and (y) unless previously withdrawn or modified, the
opinion of the Company Advisor referred to in _Section 5.1(aa)_. The

 



58  Company shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus to be mailed to the holders of Company Common Stock as
promptly as practicable after the S-4 Registration Statement becomes
effective and, after the Proxy Statement/Prospectus shall have been so mailed,
promptly circulate amended, supplemental or supplemented proxy materials and,
if required in connection therewith, resolicit proxies. Parent and
the Company shall promptly provide to each other (A) notice of any oral
comments to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the S-4 Registration Statement
received from the SEC and (B) copies of any written comments to the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus and the S-4 Registration Statement received from the
SEC, and in each case shall consult with each other in connection with the
preparation of written responses to such comments.

 

(b) Parent shall make, and the Company shall cooperate in making, all
necessary filings with respect to the Merger and the
transactions contemplated hereby under the Securities Act and U.S. state
securities and "blue sky" laws. Each party shall advise the other, promptly
after receipt of notice thereof, of the time of the effectiveness of the S-4
Registration Statement, the filing of any supplement or amendment thereto,
the issuance of any stop order relating thereto, the suspension of the
qualification of Parent Common Stock issuable in connection with the Merger
for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, of any SEC request for an amendment
to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the S-4 Registration Statement, SEC
comments thereon and each partys responses thereto or SEC requests for
additional information, or of the issuance of any stop order or
the suspension of the qualification of the CVRs issuable in connection with
the Merger. Each of Parent and the Company shall cooperate and provide the
other (and its counsel) with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on
any amendment or supplement to the S-4 Registration Statement and Proxy
Statement/Prospectus prior to filing such with the SEC, and will promptly
provide each other with a copy of all such filings made with the SEC. No
amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the S-4
Registration Statement shall be filed without the approval of the Company and
Parent, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed. If, at any time prior to the Effective Time, any event occurs with
respect to Parent or the Company or its respective Subsidiaries, or any change
occurs with respect to any other information in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus
or the S-4 Registration Statement, or Parent or the Company should discover
any information relating to either party, or any of their respective
Affiliates, directors or officers, which should be set forth in an amendment
or supplement to the S-4 Registration Statement or the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus, so that the documents would not include any
misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading, the party that discovers such information shall
promptly notify the other party hereto and the parties shall cause an
appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information to be promptly
filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by Law, disseminated to the
stockholders of Parent and the Company. Each of the parties hereto shall
cause the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and the S-4 Registration Statement to
comply as to form and substance as to such party in all material respects with
the applicable requirements of (i) the Exchange Act, (ii) the Securities Act,
and (iii) the rules and regulations of The NASDAQ Global Select Market.

use its reasonable best efforts to agree on, any press releases or otherwise
making public announcements with respect to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby (including, without limitation, the Mergers) and will not
issue such press release or public announcement prior to such consultation
and (to the extent practicable) agreement, except as may be required by
applicable Law or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with or
rules of any securities exchange or securities market on which securities of
the Company or Parent are listed or traded; _provided_ , subject to _Section
7.2_, that this _Section 7.10_ shall not apply to any press release or other
public disclosure made or proposed to be made by the Company (a) related to
an Acquisition Proposal or (b) in connection with or following the Company
Board withdrawing, modifying or amending the Company Board Recommendation.

 



60 7.11 _Employee Benefits Matters_.

 

(a) Parent agrees that during the period commencing at the Effective Time and
ending on the first anniversary thereof, each employee of the Company and its
Subsidiaries shall (A) be paid an annual base salary or base wages at a rate
not lower than the rate in effect for such employee immediately prior to the
Effective Time and (B) be provided with incentive pay opportunities that are
no less favorable than those provided to such employee immediately prior to
the Effective Time.

(b) Parent agrees that as promptly as practicable following the Effective
Time it will pay each employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries any portion

(c) Parent agrees that, during the period commencing at the Effective Time and
ending on the first anniversary thereof, the current and former employees of
the Company and its Subsidiaries who are receiving benefits under the Company
Compensation and Benefit Plans immediately prior to the Effective Time ("
_Affected Employees_ ") will thereafter continue to be provided with benefits
under employee benefit plans that are no less favorable in the aggregate than,
in the sole discretion of Parent, either (i) those currently provided by the
Company and its Subsidiaries to such employees as of the Closing
Date, disregarding the cessation prior to the Closing Date of benefits
provided under any Company 401(k) Plan terminated pursuant to Section 7.11(f)
below (and with no obligation under this Section 7.11(c) to replace benefits
under any stock option or other equity-based plan, including the Company
Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or to replace any right under a Company 401(k)
Plan to receive contributions in the form of Company Common Stock, with
comparable equity-based or equity-related benefits) or (ii) those provided by
Parent and its Subsidiaries to similarly situated employees from time to time
during such period.

(d) Following the Effective Time, Parent shall cause service by Affected
Employees with the Company and its Subsidiaries (or any of their predecessors)
to be taken into account for purposes of eligibility to participate,
eligibility to commence benefits, vesting and, solely for purposes of
severance and vacation benefits, benefit entitlements (except to the extent
such treatment would result in duplicative of benefits for the same period of
service) under the Parent employee benefit plans (other than any defined
benefit pension plan) in which such employees participate.

 

(e) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall (i) use its reasonable
best efforts to cause to be waived any pre-existing condition limitations and
any waiting-period limitations under welfare benefit plans, policies or
practices of Parent or its Subsidiaries in which employees of the Company or
its Subsidiaries participate and (ii) use its reasonable best efforts to
cause to be credited any deductibles, co-payment amounts and out-of-pocket
expenses incurred by such employees and their beneficiaries and dependents
during the portion of the calendar year prior to participation in the Parent
employee benefit plans.

(f) Unless otherwise requested by Parent at least five (5) Business Days prior
to the Closing Date, the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of its ERISA
Affiliates shall take (or

 



61  cause to be taken) all actions necessary or appropriate to terminate,
effective no later than the day prior to the Closing Date, any Company
Compensation and Benefit Plan that contains a cash or deferred arrangement
intended to qualify under Section 401(k) of the Code (a " _Company 401(k)
Plan_ "). The Company shall provide to Parent prior to the Closing Date
written evidence of the adoption by the Company Board of resolutions
authorizing the termination of such Company 401(k) Plan(s) (the form and
substance of which resolutions shall be subject to the prior review and
approval of Parent, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed). 

The Company agrees to take all actions that are necessary to terminate each
Company Stock Incentive Plan effective as of the Effective Time. The Company
further agrees to use its reasonable best efforts by action taken no less than
five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, to facilitate the exercise
in full of each Company Option prior to the Closing Date, subject to
the condition that the holder of such Company Option irrevocably undertakes
to exchange pursuant to _Section 3.1(c)_ the shares of Company Common Stock
deliverable pursuant to such exercise. For the avoidance of doubt, the shares
of Company Common Stock deliverable pursuant to the exercise of any Company
Option that could have been exercised at the same time, in the same manner and
to the same extent without regard to the Company actions contemplated by the
preceding sentence shall not be subject to the condition set forth therein.
With respect to any portion of such Company Option that may be unvested as of
the Closing Date and that the Company causes to become exercisable prior to
the Closing Date, the Company shall cause the exercise of such unvested
portion of the Company Option to be expressly conditioned upon the Closing.
The Company shall take all necessary, advisable, or appropriate actions to
effectuate this Section 7.11(f), including but not limited to, (i)
accelerating the vesting of each Company Option, subject to the exercise
thereof either prior to the Closing Date or pursuant to an election to
exercise such Company Option on a net basis as described in Section
3.1(d); (ii) amending any Company Option to allow the holder thereof to
direct the Company to withhold that number of shares of Company Common Stock
(or a corresponding portion of the Merger Consideration, as described in
Section 3.1(d)) having an aggregate value equal to the sum of the aggregate
exercise price of such Company Option and, at the election of the holder, any
withholdings required in connection with the exercise of such Company Option;
and (iii) adopting all necessary resolutions, giving all timely notices, and
obtaining all necessary approvals and consents. The form and substance of any
such amendments, resolutions, notices, and consents shall be subject to review
and approval of Parent, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed.

(g) Nothing contained in this _Section 7.11_, express or implied: (i) shall
be construed to establish, amend or modify any benefit plan, program,
agreement or arrangement; (ii) shall alter or limit the ability of any of
Parent, the Company, the Merger Sub, the Final Surviving Entity or any of
their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates to amend, modify or terminate any
benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement at any time assumed,
established, sponsored or maintained by any of them; (iii) is intended to
confer upon any current or former employee any right to employment or
continued employment for any period of time by reason of this Agreement, or
any right to a particular term or condition of employment; or (iv) is intended
to confer upon any Person (including for the avoidance of doubt any employee)
any right as a third-party beneficiary of this Agreement.

 



62 7.12 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_.

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall indemnify and hold
harmless, as required pursuant to any applicable Organizational Documents of
the Company and its Subsidiaries and indemnity agreements of the Company
existing on the date hereof and disclosed to Parent (and Parent also shall
advance reasonable and documented attorneys fees and expenses as incurred
as required pursuant to such existing indemnity agreements of the Company,
_provided_ that the Person to whom expenses are advanced provides an
undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such
Person is not entitled to indemnification), each present and former director
and officer of the Company and its Subsidiaries (collectively, the "
_Indemnified Parties_ ") against any costs or expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees and expenses), judgments, fines, losses, claims, settlements,
damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, arising out of or pertaining to matters existing or occurring
at or prior to the Effective Time, including the transactions contemplated
hereby.

(b) For six (6) years from the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Final
Surviving Entity to maintain in effect for the benefit of the Companys
directors and officers an insurance and indemnification policy that provides
coverage for acts or omissions occurring on or prior to the Effective Time
(the " _D andO Insurance_") covering each such person currently covered by the
officers and directors liability insurance policies of the Company on terms
with respect to coverage and in amounts no less favorable than those of the
Companys directors and officers insurance policy in effect on the date of
this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Final Surviving Entity shall
not be required to pay an annual premium for the DandO Insurance in excess of
300% of the annual premium currently paid by the Company for such coverage;
and _provided_ , _further_ , that if any annual premium for such insurance
coverage exceeds 200% of such annual premium, Parent shall obtain a policy

Nominating, Compliance and Governance Committee of Parent to nominate as a
director of the Parent Board for election (and recommend such election) by its
stockholders at the 2013 annual meeting of its stockholders an individual

be a current independent director on the Company Board and shall be subject
to the consent of Parent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld

certain highly confidential and attorney-client privileged Parent Board
meetings (or portions thereof).

7.17 _Tax-Free Reorganization_.

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, each of Parent and the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the Mergers to qualify as a 368
Reorganization, and shall not take any action reasonably likely to cause the
Mergers not so to qualify. Parent shall not take, or cause the
Initial Surviving Company, the Sister Subsidiary or the Final Surviving
Entity to take, any action after the Effective Time reasonably likely to cause
the Mergers not to qualify as a 368 Reorganization.

 

(b) Parent and the Company shall cooperate with each other and use reasonable
commercial efforts to obtain the opinion of Ropes and Gray LLP, counsel to the
Company, and the opinion of Wilson Sonsini Goodrich and Rosati, P.C., counsel to
Parent (each such counsel, " _Tax Counsel_"), to the effect that the Mergers
will be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a reorganization
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and that the Company, Parent,
Merger Sub, Initial Surviving Corporation, the Sister Subsidiary and the Final
Surviving Entity will each be a party to that reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368(b) of the Code. It is agreed that Parent, Merger Sub,
the Initial Surviving Company, the Final Surviving Entity and the Company
shall each provide reasonable cooperation to each Tax Counsel in rendering
their opinions pursuant to this _Section 7.17(b)_, including the execution
and the delivery of customary representations of officers of Parent, Merger
Sub, the Initial Surviving Company, the Final Surviving Entity and the
Company, reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to each Tax Counsel,
and upon which such counsel shall be entitled to rely. For the

 



65  avoidance of doubt, it shall not be a condition to any partys obligation to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement that any tax
opinion referred to in this  _Section 7.17(b)_ has been obtained by either
the Company or Parent _._

10.9 _Entire Agreement; NO OTHER REPRESENTATIONS_.

This Agreement (including any exhibits hereto), the Company Disclosure Letter,
the Parent Disclosure Letter and the Confidentiality Agreement between Wright
Technology, Inc. and the Company dated October 1, 2010, as amended as of
September 26, 2012, and the

 



75  Confidentiality Agreement between Wright Technology, Inc. and the Company
dated November 2, 2010 (together, and as each may be amended from time to
time, the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), constitute the entire agreement
by and among the parties hereto, and supersede all other prior agreements,
understandings, representations and warranties both written and oral, among
the parties, with respect to the subject matter hereof. EACH PARTY HERETO
AGREES THAT, EXCEPT FOR THE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES CONTAINED IN THIS
AGREEMENT, NEITHER PARENT, MERGER SUB NOR THE COMPANY MAKES ANY OTHER
REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, AND EACH HEREBY DISCLAIMS ANY
OTHER REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES MADE BY ITSELF OR ANY OF ITS RESPECTIVE
OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AFFILIATES, AGENTS, FINANCIAL AND LEGAL
ADVISORS OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVES, WITH RESPECT TO THE EXECUTION AND DELIVERY
OF THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, NOTWITHSTANDING
THE DELIVERY OR DISCLOSURE TO THE OTHER OR THE OTHERS REPRESENTATIVES OF ANY
DOCUMENTATION OR OTHER INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO ANY ONE OR MORE OF THE
FOREGOING.

 

10.10 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_.

Other than with respect to (i) the rights of the holders of Company Common
Stock to receive the Merger Consideration and (ii) the matters set forth in
_Section 7.12_ (Indemnification; Directors and Officers Insurance), this
Agreement (and each document and instrument referred to in this Agreement) is
not intended to confer, and do not confer, upon any Person other than the
parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder. The rights of third-party
beneficiaries under _Section 7.12_ shall not arise unless and until the
Effective Time.

10.11 _Obligations of Parent and of the Company_.

Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, whenever this Agreement
requires a Subsidiary of Parent to take any action, such requirement shall be
deemed to include an undertaking on the part of Parent to cause such
Subsidiary to take such action. Whenever this Agreement requires a Subsidiary
of the Company to take any action, such requirement shall be deemed to include
an undertaking on the part of the Company to cause such Subsidiary to take
such action and, after the Effective Time, on the part of the Final Surviving
Entity to cause such Subsidiary to take such action.

10.12 _Severability_.

 

The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed severable and the invalidity
or unenforceability of any provision shall not affect the validity or
enforceability of the other provisions hereof. If any provision of this
Agreement, or the application thereof to any Person or any circumstance, is
invalid or unenforceable, (a) a suitable and equitable provision shall
be substituted therefor in order to carry out, insofar as may be valid and
enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid or unenforceable provision
and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and 

 



76  the application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances shall
not be affected by such invalidity or unenforceability, nor shall such
invalidity or unenforceability affect the validity or enforceability of such
provision, or the application thereof, in any other jurisdiction.

10.13 _Disclosure Letters_. 

Any information disclosed in any section of the Company Disclosure Letter or
the Parent Disclosure Letter shall be deemed to be disclosed on any other
section of the Company Disclosure Letter or the Parent Disclosure Letter,
respectively, where it is reasonably apparent that the disclosure contained in
such section of the Company Disclosure Letter or the Parent Disclosure Letter
is relevant to such other sections. The Company Disclosure Letter and the
Parent Disclosure Letter, respectively, and the information and disclosures
contained therein are intended only to qualify and limit the representations,
warranties and covenants of the Company or Parent and Merger Sub, as the case
may be, contained in this Agreement and shall not be deemed to expand in any
way the scope or effect of any of such representations, warranties or
covenants. No reference to or disclosure of any item or other matter in the
Company Disclosure Letter or the Parent Disclosure Letter shall be construed
to establish a standard of materiality. No reference to or disclosure of any
item or other matter in the Company Disclosure Letter or Parent Disclosure
Letter shall be construed as an admission or indication that (i) such item is
required to be referred to or disclosed in the Company Disclosure Letter or
Parent Disclosure Letter or (ii) any breach of any applicable Law or any
Contract exists or has actually occurred.

10.14 _Interpretation_.

 

(a) When a reference is made in this Agreement to an Article, a Section,
Exhibit or Schedule, such reference shall be to an Article of, a Section of,
or an Exhibit or Schedule to, this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The
table of contents and headings contained in this Agreement are for reference
purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of
this Agreement. Whenever the words "include", "includes" or "including" are
used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words
"without limitation". The words "hereof", "herein" and "hereunder" and words
of similar import when used in this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as
a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement. All terms
defined in this Agreement shall have the defined meanings when used in any
document made or delivered pursuant hereto unless otherwise defined therein.
The definitions contained in this Agreement are applicable to the singular as
well as the plural forms of such terms and to the masculine as well as to the
feminine and neuter genders of such term. Any agreement, instrument or statute
defined or referred to herein or in any agreement or instrument that is
referred to herein means such agreement, instrument or statute as from time
to time amended, modified or supplemented, including (in the case of
agreements or instruments) by waiver or consent and (in the case of statutes)
by succession of comparable successor statutes and references to all
attachments thereto and instruments incorporated therein. References to a
Person are also to its permitted assigns and successors.

(b) The parties hereto have participated jointly in the negotiation and
drafting of this Agreement and, in the event an ambiguity or question of
intent or interpretation arises, this

 



77  Agreement shall be construed as jointly drafted by the parties hereto and no
presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party
by virtue of the authorship of any provision of this Agreement.

10.15 _Assignment_.

 

This Agreement shall not be assignable without the prior written consent of
the other party; _provided_ , _however_ ; that each of Parent and Merger Sub
may (in its sole discretion), without the consent of any other party hereto,
assign (in whole or in part and whether by merger, operation of law or
otherwise) this Agreement and its rights and obligations hereunder to one
or more of its Affiliates; _provided_ , _further_ , that, in the event of any
such assignment pursuant to the immediately preceding proviso, Parent or
Merger Sub (as the case may be) shall remain fully liable for, and shall not
be released from, any of its obligations under this Agreement. Subject to the
preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit
of, and be enforceable by, the parties hereto and their respective successors
and permitted assigns. Any purported assignment not permitted under this
_Section 10.15_ shall be null and void.
