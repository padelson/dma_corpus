ARTICLE 2

MERGER



2.1 The Merger. Under the terms of this Agreement and subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article 7, at the
Effective Time, AIM will be merged with and into Heartland. Heartland, in its
capacity as the corporation surviving the Merger, is sometimes referred to
herein as the "Surviving Corporation." The Merger will be effected pursuant to
the provisions of, and with the effect provided in, Section 252 of the
Delaware General Corporation Law (the "DGCL") and Chapter 10, Subchapter A of
Title 1 of the Texas Business Organizations Code (the "TBOC").

2.2 Effect of Merger.

(a) At the Effective Time, AIM will be merged with and into Heartland, and the
separate existence of AIM will cease. The Charter and the Bylaws of Heartland,
as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, will be the Charter and
the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation, until the same may be amended as
provided therein and in accordance with applicable Law. The directors and
officers of Heartland immediately prior to the Effective Time will be the
directors and officers of the Surviving Corporation, in each case until their
respective successors are duly elected or appointed and will qualify.

(b) At the Effective Time and thereafter, the Surviving Corporation will be
responsible and liable for all the Liabilities, Indebtedness and penalties of
each of Heartland and AIM.

(c) At the Effective Time and thereafter, the Surviving Corporation will
possess all the rights, privileges, immunities and franchises, of a public as
well as of a private nature, of each of Heartland and AIM; all property, real,
personal and mixed, and all Indebtedness due on whatever account, and all and
every other interest, of or belonging to or due to each of Heartland and AIM,
will be taken and deemed to be transferred to and vested in the Surviving
Corporation without further act or deed; and the title to any real estate or
any interest therein, vested in Heartland or AIM, will not revert or be in any
way impaired by reason of the Merger.

(d) To effect the Merger, the parties hereto will cause a Certificate of
Merger substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit D (the "Delaware
Certificate of Merger") and a Certificate of Merger substantially in the form
attached hereto as Exhibit E (the "Texas Certificate of Merger") relating to the Merger to be
filed with the Secretary of State of Delaware and the Secretary of State of
Texas, respectively. The Merger will become effective upon the filing of the
Delaware Certificate of Merger and the Texas Certificate of Merger or at a
time designated in such filings. As used herein, the term "Effective Date"
will mean the date on which the Merger will become effective as provided in
the preceding sentence, and the term "Effective Time" will mean the time on
the Effective Date when the Merger will become effective. The Effective Date
and the Effective Time will take place on the Closing Date.

2.3 Conversion of AIM Common Stock.

(a) To effectuate the Merger, at the Effective Time, and without any further
action of Heartland, AIM or any AIM Shareholder, each issued and outstanding
share of AIM Common Stock (other than shares to be canceled pursuant to
Section 2.3(c) and Dissenting Shares) will be canceled and extinguished and be
converted into and become a right to receive (i) subject to Section 2.4, the
Cash Consideration, and (ii) subject to Section 2.5, 207.0 shares (the
"Exchange Ratio") of Heartland Common Stock (the "Stock Consideration" and,
together with the Actual Cash Consideration, the "Merger Consideration").

(b) No fractional shares of Heartland Common Stock will be issued for AIM
Converted Common Shares, and in lieu of any fractional share, Heartland will
pay to each holder of AIM Converted Common Shares who otherwise would be
entitled to receive a fractional share of Heartland Common Stock an amount of
cash (without interest) equal to the product of (i) the Heartland Closing Date
Stock Price multiplied by (ii) the fractional share interest to which such
holder would otherwise be entitled (the "Fractional Share Amount").

(c) Each share of AIM Common Stock held as treasury stock of AIM or held
directly or indirectly by Heartland, other than shares held in a fiduciary
capacity or in satisfaction of Indebtedness previously contracted, will be
canceled, retired and cease to exist, and no exchange or payment will be made
with respect thereto.

2.4 Adjustment to Cash Consideration for Changes in Adjusted Tangible Common
Equity. If the Adjusted Tangible Common Equity is less than $145,000,000 (the
"Bottom Threshold Amount"), the Cash Consideration will be reduced by an
amount equal to (a) the amount by which the Adjusted Tangible Common Equity is
below the Bottom Threshold Amount, divided by (b) the AIM Common Shares
Outstanding (the "Downwardly Adjusted Cash Consideration"). If the Adjusted
Tangible Common Equity is greater than $148,000,000, the Cash Consideration
will be increased by an amount equal to (i) the lesser of (x) $5,000,000, and
(y) the amount by which the Adjusted Tangible Common Equity is above
$148,000,000, divided by (ii) the AIM Common Shares Outstanding (the "Upwardly
Adjusted Cash Consideration"). In the event that the Effective Time occurs
prior to June 30, 2020, the Bottom Threshold Amount will be reduced by an
amount equal to the product of (A) $70,000, multiplied by (B) the number of
calendar days from the Effective Time through June 30, 2020. 2.5 Adjustments to Heartland Common Stock. In the event Heartland changes (or
establishes a record date for changing) the number of shares of Heartland
Common Stock issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Date as a result of
any stock split, recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of
shares, readjustment or similar transaction with respect to the outstanding
Heartland Common Stock, or Heartland declares a stock dividend or
extraordinary cash dividend, and the record date therefor will be prior to the
Effective Date, the Exchange Ratio will be proportionately adjusted.

2.6 Rights of Holders of AIM Common Stock; Capital Stock of Heartland.

(a) At and after the Effective Time and until surrendered for exchange, each
outstanding stock certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented the AIM Converted Common Shares will be deemed for all purposes to
evidence the right to receive the Stock Consideration and the Actual Cash
Consideration for each AIM Converted Common Share, and the record holder of
such outstanding stock certificate will, after the Effective Time, be entitled
to vote the shares of Heartland Common Stock into which such shares of AIM
Common Stock will have been converted on any matters on which the holders of
record of Heartland Common Stock, as of any date subsequent to the Effective
Time, will be entitled to vote. In any matters relating to such stock
certificates, Heartland may rely conclusively upon the record of shareholders
maintained by AIM containing the names and addresses of the holders of record
of AIM Common Stock at the Effective Time.

(b) At and after the Effective Time, each share of capital stock of Heartland
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will remain an
issued and existing share of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation and
will not be affected by the Merger.

2.7 Payment and Exchange of Certificates.

(a) Payment of Merger Consideration; Exchange of Certificates. Within 10
Business Days after the Closing, Heartland or a paying agent appointed by
Heartland will cause to be distributed to each AIM Shareholder a letter of
transmittal or other appropriate materials to facilitate the surrender of
certificates representing such shares in exchange for the Stock Consideration
and the Actual Cash Consideration for each AIM Converted Common Share (a
"Letter of Transmittal"). Within 10 Business Days after surrender to Heartland
or to a paying agent appointed by Heartland of any certificate which prior to
the Effective Date represented a share of AIM Common Stock, Heartland or such
paying agent will distribute to the Person in whose name such certificate is
registered, the Stock Consideration and the Actual Cash Consideration, and, if
applicable, cash in the amount of any Fractional Share Amount. The Stock
Consideration shall be issued in book entry form, unless otherwise requested
by an AIM Shareholder.

(b) Failure to Surrender Certificates. Following the return by a paying agent
appointed by Heartland, if any, to Heartland of the Merger Consideration held
by it, any former AIM Shareholder who has not complied with this Article 2
will thereafter look only to Heartland with respect to the payment of the
Merger Consideration, any Fractional Share Amount and any unpaid dividends and distributions on the
Heartland Common Stock deliverable in respect of each share of AIM Common
Stock held by such AIM Shareholder. If outstanding certificates formerly
representing AIM Converted Common Shares are not surrendered prior to the date
on which the Merger Consideration to which any AIM Shareholder is entitled as
a result of the Merger would otherwise escheat to or become the property of
any Governmental Entity, the unclaimed Merger Consideration will, to the
extent permitted by abandoned property and any other applicable Law, become
the property of Heartland (and to the extent not in Heartland's possession
will be paid over to Heartland), free and clear of any and all claims or
interest of any Person. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Heartland nor
any other Person will be liable to any former AIM Shareholder for any amount
delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property,
escheat or other similar Laws.

(c) Lost Certificates. In the event that any certificate representing AIM
Converted Common Shares will have been lost, stolen or destroyed, Heartland
will issue and pay in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate,
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof in form
reasonably satisfactory to Heartland's paying agent, the Merger Consideration
for each AIM Converted Common Share; provided, however, that Heartland or
Heartland's paying agent may, as a condition precedent to the issuance and
payment of the Merger Consideration to which the holder of such certificate is
entitled as a result of the Merger, require the owner of such lost, stolen or
destroyed certificate to deliver a bond in such sum as it may direct, not to
exceed the aggregate amount of such shareholder's portion of the Merger
Consideration, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against
Heartland, AIM or any other party with respect to the certificate alleged to
have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

(d) Dividends. Until outstanding certificates formerly representing AIM
Converted Common Shares are surrendered as provided in Section 2.7(a) and (c),
no dividend or distribution payable to holders of record of shares of
Heartland Common Stock will be paid to any holder of such outstanding
certificates, but upon surrender of such outstanding certificates by such
holder, there will be paid to such holder the amount of any dividends or
distributions (without interest) theretofore paid with respect to such whole
shares of Heartland Common Stock, but not paid to such holder, and which
dividends or distributions had a record date occurring on or subsequent to the
Effective Time.

(e) Full Satisfaction. The Merger Consideration issued and paid upon the
surrender for exchange of each AIM Converted Common Share in accordance with
the terms and conditions of this Agreement will be deemed to have been issued
and paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such AIM Converted
Common Share.

2.8 Dissenting Shares.

(a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, any
shares of AIM Common Stock held by a Person (a "Dissenting Shareholder") who
has demanded and perfected a demand for appraisal of his, her or its shares of
AIM Common Stock in accordance with Chapter 10, Subchapter H, of the TBOC,
and, as of the Effective Time, has neither effectively withdrawn nor lost his, her or its
right to such demand will not represent a right to receive Merger
Consideration for any share of AIM Common Stock pursuant to Sections 2.3(a),
2.4 and 2.5, but in lieu thereof the holder thereof will be entitled to only
such rights as are granted by Chapter 10, Subchapter H, of Title 1 of the
TBOC.

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 2.8(a), if any Dissenting
Shareholder demanding payment of fair value of such Dissenting Shareholder's
shares of AIM Common Stock ("Dissenting Shares") under the TBOC will
effectively withdraw or lose (through failure to perfect or otherwise) such
Dissenting Shareholder's rights and remedies granted by Chapter 10, Subchapter
H, of Title 1 of the TBOC, then, as of the Effective Time or the time of such
withdrawal or loss, whichever occurs later, each Dissenting Share will
automatically be converted into and represent only the right to receive the
Merger Consideration as provided in Sections 2.3(a), 2.4 and 2.5 upon
surrender of the certificate or certificates representing such Dissenting
Shares.

(c) AIM will give Heartland prompt notice of any written objection by a
Dissenting Shareholder to the Merger or any demands by a Dissenting
Shareholder for appraisal of his, her or its shares of AIM Common Stock
received by AIM in accordance with Chapter 10, Subchapter H, of Title 1 of the
TBOC, and Heartland will have the right, at its expense, to direct in all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. AIM will not,
except with the prior written consent of Heartland or as otherwise required by
Law, make any payment with respect to, settle, or offer to settle, any such
demands. Heartland will make any payments, settlement and offers of
settlements to Dissenting Shareholders with respect to demands made pursuant
to Chapter 10, Subchapter H, of Title 1 of the TBOC.

2.9 AIM Stock Options. At the Effective Time, each option to purchase shares
of AIM Common Stock (an "AIM Stock Option") which is outstanding and
unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time will be cancelled in
exchange for the right to receive from Heartland a single lump sum cash
payment equal to the product of (a) the number of shares of AIM Common Stock
subject to such AIM Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, and
(b) the excess of (i) an amount determined by (A) multiplying the Exchange
Ratio by the Heartland Closing Date Stock VWAP plus (B) the Actual Cash
Consideration, over (ii) the exercise price per share of such AIM Stock Option
(the amount determined by the foregoing formula, the "Option Consideration"),
less any applicable Taxes required to be withheld with respect to such payment
in accordance with Section 2.12. From and after the Effective Time, other than
as expressly set forth in this Section 2.9, no holder of an AIM Stock Option
will have any other rights with respect to such AIM Stock Option or the AIM
Equity Incentive Plan other than the right to receive the Option
Consideration. Subject to the foregoing, all AIM Stock Options will terminate
at the Effective Time, and the surrender of an AIM Stock Option to Heartland
in exchange for the Option Consideration will be deemed a release of any and
all rights the option holder had or may have had in respect of such AIM Stock
Option or the AIM Equity Incentive Plan. The Option Consideration paid in
accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement will be deemed to
have been issued and paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the AIM Stock Options. By way of example and for
clarification purposes only, a sample Option Consideration calculation is set
forth on Exhibit F.

2.10 Payment of Interbank Indebtedness. On the Closing Date, Heartland or AIM
(in the event Heartland, at its option, provides AIM with funds in the
aggregate amount of the Interbank Indebtedness) will pay the aggregate amount
of the Interbank Indebtedness (up to a maximum of $2,000,000), plus accrued,
but unpaid interest, to InterBank in accordance with the Payoff Letter. For
the avoidance of doubt, Heartland will be liable for all other Indebtedness of
AIM following the Effective Time pursuant to the Merger by operation of Law.

2.11 The Closing. The closing of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (the "Closing") will take place remotely via the exchange of
documents and signatures or at such other location mutually agreed upon by
Heartland and AIM. The Closing will take place as soon as practicable once the
conditions in Article 7 have been satisfied or waived but in any event within
10 Business Days after the date on which all such conditions have been
satisfied or waived, unless the parties otherwise agree (the "Closing Date").
The failure of the Closing will not ipso facto result in termination of this
Agreement and will not relieve any party of any obligation under this
Agreement.

(a) Subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, on the Closing
Date, AIM will deliver to Heartland:

(i) the certificate of AIM, dated the Closing Date, required by Section
7.3(c);

(ii) the certificate of AIM, dated the Closing Date, required by Section
7.3(d);

(iii) a certificate of AIM dated the Closing Date (A) stating the number of
shares of AIM Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time, (B) stating that there are no other shares of capital stock of AIM or
options, warrants, rights to acquire, or securities convertible into capital
stock of AIM outstanding as of the Closing Date other than the AIM Stock
Options, (C) the number of shares of AIM Common Stock issuable upon the
exercise of the AIM Stock Options immediately prior to the Effective Time and
(D) the number of the Dissenting Shares;

(iv) duly executed copies of all Required Consents;

(v) a certificate of the secretary or an assistant secretary of AIM, dated the
Closing Date, certifying as to a copy of the text of the resolutions adopted

AimBank, authorizing the Bank Merger;

development in the business of Heartland or its Subsidiaries that, taken
individually or as a whole, has had or would reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on Heartland or its Subsidiaries or on the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. As of the date hereof,

each report or other filing it was required to file with any federal or state
banking or bank holding company or other Governmental Entity having

Regulatory Report was true and correct in all material respects and complied
in all material respects with applicable Laws.

Governmental Authorizations required for the conduct of its business, except
where the failure to hold any such Governmental Authorization would not have a

written agreement or memorandum of understanding with, or a commitment letter
or similar submission to, or extraordinary supervisory letter from any Bank
Regulator, nor has Heartland adopted any policies, procedures or board

reasonably be expected to impair the ability of Heartland to obtain the Bank
Regulatory Approvals or to operate the Surviving Corporation in the Ordinary
Course of Business after the Closing Date.

(e) No Governmental Entity has initiated since January 1, 2017 or currently
has pending any proceeding or enforcement action against Heartland or any of

had a rating of "satisfactory" or better as of its most recent CRA
examination, and neither Heartland nor any such Subsidiary has been advised

regulation of banks or bank holding companies or engaged in the insurance of
bank deposits of lower than "satisfactory."

memorandum of understanding with, or is a party to any commitment letter or

would reasonably be expected to, impair the ability of Heartland to obtain the

Ordinary Course of Business after the Merger. Heartland has not received any
indication from any Governmental Entity that such Governmental Entity would
oppose or refuse to grant or issue its consent or approval, if required, with

approval to such transactions.

its Subsidiaries that would have or would reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on Heartland or its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

will be disallowed as a deduction under any other provision of the Code.

(y) No AIM Entity has taken or agreed to take any action, or knows of any
circumstances, that would prevent the acquisition contemplated by this

December 31, 2017, AIM also validly elected (or is so treated due to its
federal election) to be an "S corporation" in all states and local
jurisdictions which recognize such status and in which it would, absent such
an election, be subject to corporate income Tax. There has been no basis for
the revocation or other termination of AIM's "S corporation" election at any
time from January 1, 2007 through December 31, 2017. Neither AIM nor any other
Person has taken any action that would have caused AIM to cease being an "S
corporation" for federal, state or local Tax purposes at any time from January
1, 2007 through December 31, 2017.

(aa) A valid election was made for AimBank to be a "qualified subchapter S
subsidiary" within the meaning of Section 1361(b)(3)(B) of the Code for all
periods from January 1, 2007 through December 31, 2017. For all periods from
January 1, 2007 through December 31, 2017, a valid election was also made for
AimBank to be a "qualified subchapter S subsidiary" in all states and local
jurisdictions which recognize such status and in which it would, absent such
an election, be subject to corporate income Tax (or AimBank is so treated in
all such states and local jurisdictions due to its federal election). There
has been no basis for the revocation or other termination of AimBank's
"qualified subchapter S subsidiary" election at any time from January 1, 2007
through December 31, 2017, and neither AIM nor any other Person has taken any action
that would have caused AimBank to cease being a "qualified subchapter S
subsidiary" for federal, state or local Tax purposes at any time from January
1, 2007 through December 31, 2017.

for all periods on and after January 1, 2018.

subchapter S subsidiary" elections, any elections made under Sections 1361(d)

that has not been satisfied in full.

(ee) The Statutory Trust is, and has been at all times since its inception, a
grantor trust under subpart E, Part I of subchapter J of the Code, and not an
association or publicly traded partnership taxable as a corporation. All of
the AIM Entities have, at all relevant times since the formation of the
Statutory Trust, treated the Statutory Trust as a grantor trust for all U.S.
federal, state and local Tax purposes. The Statutory Trust has timely filed
(or has had timely filed on its behalf) each Return required to be filed or
sent by it in respect of any Taxes, each of which was correctly completed and
accurately reflected Liability for Taxes (if any) of the Statutory Trust in
all material respects. At all times since the issuance of the Statutory Trust
Securities that are Capital Securities of the Statutory Trust, the principal
amounts, interest and other amounts due and payable on such Capital Securities
have been paid in accordance with the terms of the relevant Statutory Trust
Indenture and other applicable agreements, without any deferral of interest
thereon.

litigation or other proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation will
include the retention and (upon the other party's reasonable request) the provision of records and information (including making
such records and information available for copying) which are reasonably
relevant to any such audit, litigation or other proceeding, the timely
provision to the other party of powers of attorney or similar authorizations
necessary to carry out the purposes of this Section 0, and making employees
available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and
explanation of any material provided hereunder. Heartland and each of the AIM
Entities agrees to retain all books and records with respect to Tax matters
pertinent to the AIM Entities relating to any taxable period which ends on or
prior to the Effective Date until the expiration of the statute of limitations
(and, to the extent notified by Heartland or its Affiliate, any extensions
thereof) of the respective taxable periods, and to abide by all record
retention agreements entered into with any Governmental Entity.

5.8 No Solicitation.

(a) AIM will not, and AIM will use its commercially reasonable efforts to
cause the other AIM Entities and the officers, directors, employees agents and
authorized representatives ("Representatives") of all AIM Entities not to,
directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate, encourage, induce or facilitate
the making, submission or announcement of any Acquisition Proposal or take any
action that would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal,
(ii) furnish any information regarding any AIM Entity to any Person in
connection with or in response to an Acquisition Proposal or an inquiry or
indication of interest that would reasonably be expected to lead to an
Acquisition Proposal, (iii) engage in discussions or negotiations with any
Person with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or that would reasonably be
expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, (iv) approve, endorse or
recommend any Acquisition Proposal or (v) enter into any letter of intent or
similar document or any Contract contemplating or otherwise relating to any
Acquisition Transaction; provided, however, that prior to the adoption of this
Agreement by the Required AIM Shareholder Vote, this Section 5.8(a) will not
prohibit AIM, the Board of Directors of AIM or any representative of AIM from
making any inquiries with respect to any Acquisition Proposal solely for the
purpose of clarifying such Acquisition Proposal to enable the Board of
Directors of AIM to make a determination that such Acquisition Proposal is a
Superior Proposal or from furnishing nonpublic information regarding the AIM
Entities to, or entering into discussions or negotiations with, any Person in
response to a Superior Proposal that is submitted to AIM by such Person (and
not withdrawn) if (1) neither AIM nor any other AIM Entities and any of their
respective Representatives have violated any of the restrictions set forth in
this Section 5.8(a), (2) the Board of Directors of AIM concludes in good
faith, after having consulted with and considered the advice of outside
counsel and financial advisors to AIM, that such action is required in order
for the Board of Directors of AIM to comply with its fiduciary obligations to
AIM's shareholders under applicable Law, (3) at least two Business Days prior
to furnishing any such nonpublic information to, or entering into discussions
with, such Person, AIM gives Heartland written notice of the identity of such
Person and of AIM's intention to furnish nonpublic information to, or enter
into discussions with, such Person, and AIM receives from such Person an
executed confidentiality agreement containing customary limitations on the use
and disclosure of all nonpublic written and oral information furnished to such Person by or on
behalf of AIM and (4) at least two Business Days prior to furnishing any such
nonpublic information to such Person, AIM furnishes such nonpublic information
to Heartland (to the extent such nonpublic information has not been previously
furnished by the AIM to Heartland). Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, AIM acknowledges and agrees that any violation of or the taking of
any action inconsistent with any of the restrictions set forth in the
preceding sentence by any AIM Entity or any of its Representatives will be
deemed to constitute a breach of this Section 5.8(a) by AIM.

(b) AIM will promptly (and in no event later than 24 hours after receipt of
any Acquisition Proposal, any inquiry or indication of interest that would
reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal or any request for
nonpublic information) advise Heartland orally and in writing of any
Acquisition Proposal, any inquiry or indication of interest that would
reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal or any request for
nonpublic information relating to any of the AIM Entities (including the
identity of the Person making or submitting such Acquisition Proposal,
inquiry, indication of interest or request, and the terms thereof) that is
made or submitted by any Person prior to the Closing Date. AIM will keep
Heartland fully informed with respect to the status of any such Acquisition
Proposal, inquiry, indication of interest or request and any modification or
proposed modification thereto.

(c) AIM will immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing
discussions with any Person that relate to any Acquisition Proposal.

(d) AIM will not release or permit the release of any Person from, or waive or
permit the waiver of any provision of, any confidentiality, "standstill" or
similar agreement to which AIM is a party, and will enforce or cause to be
enforced each such agreement at the request of Heartland. AIM will promptly
request each Person that has executed, within 12 months prior to the date of
this Agreement, a confidentiality agreement in connection with its
consideration of a possible Acquisition Transaction or equity investment to
return all confidential information heretofore furnished to such Person by or
on behalf of AIM.

5.9 Maintenance of Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses; Purchase Discounts.

(a) AIM will cause each AIM Entity to maintain its ALLL in compliance with
GAAP and Regulatory Accounting Principles and its existing methodology for
determining the adequacy of the ALLL, as well as the standards established by
all applicable Governmental Entities and the Financial Accounting Standards
Board. AIM agrees that the ALLL of each AIM Entity will be adequate under all
standards, and that the ALLL will be consistent with the historical loss
experience of the applicable AIM Entity. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, without the consent of Heartland or as set forth in Schedule
5.9, AIM will not permit any AIM Entity to reverse any amount of its
previously established ALLL or allow the ALLL to be less than $13,000,000. (b) AIM will cause each AIM Entity to maintain any purchase discounts relating
to loans at levels consistent with the requirements of GAAP and Regulatory
Accounting Principles.

5.10 Heartland Forbearances. Except as expressly permitted by this Agreement
or with the prior written consent of AIM (which will not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), during the period from the date of this
Agreement to the earlier of the Effective Time and the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with Article 8, Heartland will not, and will not
permit any of its Subsidiaries to, except as may be required by applicable
Law, any Governmental Order or policies imposed by any Governmental Entity,
(a) take any action that would reasonably be expected to prevent, materially
impede or materially delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, or (b) take, or omit to take, any action that is reasonably
likely to result in any of the conditions to the Merger set forth in Article 7
not being or becoming not being capable of being satisfied.

5.11 AIM Forbearances. Except as expressly permitted by this Agreement or with
the prior written consent of Heartland, during the period from the date of
this Agreement to the earlier of the Effective Time and the termination of
this Agreement in accordance with Article 8, AIM will not, and will not permit
any AIM Entity, except as may be required by applicable Law, any Governmental
Order or policies imposed by any Governmental Entity, (a) take any action that
would reasonably be expected to prevent, materially impede or materially delay
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or (b)
take, or omit to take, any action that is reasonably likely to result in any
of the conditions to the Merger set forth in Article 7 not being or becoming
not being capable of being satisfied.

ARTICLE 6

ADDITIONAL COVENANTS AND AGREEMENTS



6.1 Filings and Regulatory Approvals.

(a) Heartland and AIM will use all commercially reasonable efforts and will
cooperate with each other in the preparation and filing of, and Heartland will
file, promptly after the date of this Agreement, all applications, notices or
other documents required to obtain the Bank Regulatory Approvals and Heartland
will provide copies of the non-confidential portions of such applications,
filings and related correspondence to AIM. Prior to filing each application,
registration statement or other document with the applicable Governmental
Entity, each party will provide the other party with an opportunity to review
and comment on the non-confidential portions of each such application,
registration statement or other document and will discuss with the other party
which portions of this Agreement will be designated as confidential portions
of such applications. Each party will use all commercially reasonable efforts
and will cooperate with the other party in taking any other actions necessary
to obtain such regulatory or other approvals and consents, including
participating in any required hearings or proceedings. Subject to the terms
and conditions herein provided, each party will use all commercially
reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or
cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and
make effective as promptly as practicable the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. Heartland will pay, or will cause to be paid, any applicable fees and expenses
in connection with the preparation and filing of such regulatory filings
necessary to obtain the Regulatory Approvals.

(b) AIM and Heartland will use all commercially reasonable efforts and will
cooperate with each other in the preparation and filing of, and AIM will cause
AimBank, in consultation with Heartland, to file, promptly after the date of
this Agreement, all applications, notices or other documents required to
obtain the Dividend Payment Bank Regulatory Approvals, and AIM will provide
copies of the non-confidential portions of such applications, filings and
related correspondence to Heartland. Prior to filing each application,
registration statement or other document with the applicable Governmental
Entity, each party will provide the other party with an opportunity to review
and comment on the non-confidential portions of each such application,
registration statement or other document and will discuss with the other party
which portions of this Agreement will be designated as confidential portions
of such applications. Each party will use all commercially reasonable efforts
and will cooperate with the other party in taking any other actions necessary
to obtain such regulatory or other approvals and consents, including
participating in any required hearings or proceedings. Heartland will pay, or
will cause to be paid, any applicable fees and expenses in connection with the
preparation and filing of such regulatory filings necessary to obtain the
Dividend Payment Bank Regulatory Approvals. If the Dividend Payment Bank
Regulatory Approvals are obtained prior to Closing, AIM will cause AimBank to
declare and make dividend payments to the Surviving Corporation as of the
Effective Time, in the maximum amount as may be permitted by the Dividend
Payment Bank Regulatory Approvals (such dividend payments, the "Special
Dividend Payments"). The Special Dividend Payments will be made in cash.

6.2 Shareholder Meeting; Registration Statement.

(a) AIM will call a special meeting of its shareholders (the "AIM Shareholder
Meeting") for the purpose of voting upon this Agreement and the Merger, and
will schedule such meeting based on consultation with Heartland as soon as
practicable after the Registration Statement is declared effective. Subject to
a Change of AIM Board Recommendation, the Board of Directors of AIM will
recommend that the shareholders approve this Agreement and the Merger (the
"AIM Board Recommendation") and AIM will use its commercially reasonable
efforts (including soliciting proxies for such approval) to obtain the
Required AIM Shareholder Vote. The AIM Board Recommendation may not be
withdrawn or modified in a manner adverse to Heartland, and no resolution by
the Board of Directors of AIM or any committee thereof to withdraw or modify
the AIM Board Recommendation in a manner adverse to AIM may be adopted;
provided, however, that notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to the adoption
of this Agreement by the Required AIM Shareholder Vote, the Board of Directors
of AIM may withdraw, qualify or modify the AIM Board Recommendation or
approve, adopt, recommend or otherwise declare advisable any Superior Proposal
made after the date hereof and not solicited, initiated or encouraged in
breach of Section 5.8, if the Board of Directors of AIM determines in good
faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that failure to do so would be likely to result in a breach of
fiduciary duties under applicable law (a "Change of AIM Board
Recommendation"). In determining whether to make a Change of AIM Board
Recommendation in response to a Superior Proposal or otherwise, the Board of
Directors of AIM will take into account any changes to the terms of this
Agreement proposed by Heartland or any other information provided by Heartland
in response to such notice.

(b) For the purposes of (i) holding the AIM Shareholder Meeting and (ii)
registering Heartland Common Stock to be issued to shareholders of AIM in
connection with the Merger with the SEC and with applicable state securities
authorities, Heartland will prepare, with the cooperation of AIM (which will,
for the avoidance of doubt, be given the opportunity to participate in the
preparation of the Registration Statement and will have the right to approve
the content of the Registration Statement relating to the AIM Entities), a
registration statement on Form S 4 (such registration statement, together with
all and any amendments and supplements thereto, being herein referred to as
the "Registration Statement"), which will include a proxy statement/prospectus
satisfying all applicable requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act
and applicable Blue Sky Laws (such proxy statement/prospectus, together with
any and all amendments or supplements thereto, being herein referred to as the
"Proxy Statement/Prospectus").

(c) Heartland will furnish such information concerning Heartland and its
Subsidiaries as is necessary in order to cause the Proxy Statement/Prospectus
and the Registration Statement, insofar as they relate to Heartland and its
Subsidiaries, to be prepared in accordance with Section 0. Heartland agrees
promptly to notify AIM if at any time prior to the AIM Shareholder Meeting any
information provided by Heartland in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus becomes
incorrect or incomplete in any material respect, and to provide the
information needed to correct such inaccuracy or omission.

(d) AIM will promptly furnish Heartland with such information concerning AIM
or AimBank as is necessary in order to cause the Proxy Statement/Prospectus
and the Registration Statement, insofar as they relate to AIM or AimBank, to
be prepared in accordance with Section 6.2(b), including the opinion of
counsel as to Tax matters required to be filed as an exhibit thereto. AIM
agrees promptly to notify Heartland if at any time prior to the AIM
Shareholder Meeting any information provided by AIM in the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus becomes incorrect or incomplete in any material respect,
and to provide Heartland with the information needed to correct such
inaccuracy or omission.

(e) Heartland will promptly file the Registration Statement with the SEC and
applicable state securities agencies. Heartland will use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause (i) the Registration Statement to become effective
under the Securities Act and applicable Blue Sky Laws at the earliest
practicable date, and (ii) the shares of Heartland Common Stock issuable to
the shareholders of AIM to be authorized for listing on the NASDAQ Global
Select Market or other national securities exchange. At the time the
Registration Statement becomes effective, Heartland will use its commercially
reasonable efforts to ensure that the Registration Statement complies in all
material respects with the provisions of the Securities Act and applicable
Blue Sky Laws. AIM hereby authorizes Heartland to utilize in the Registration Statement the information concerning
the AIM Entities provided to Heartland for the purpose of inclusion in the
Proxy Statement/Prospectus. Heartland will advise AIM promptly when the
Registration Statement has become effective and of any supplements or
amendments thereto, and Heartland will furnish AIM with copies of all such
documents. Prior to the Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement,
each party will consult with the other with respect to any material (other
than the Proxy Statement/Prospectus) that might constitute a "prospectus"
relating to the Merger within the meaning of the Securities Act.

(f) None of the information relating to Heartland and its Subsidiaries that is
provided by Heartland for inclusion in: (i) the Proxy Statement/Prospectus,
any filings or approvals under applicable federal or state banking Laws or
regulations or state securities Laws, or any filing pursuant to the Securities
Act will, at the time of mailing the Proxy Statement/Prospectus to AIM's
shareholders, at the time of the AIM Shareholder Meeting and at the Effective
Time, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading; and (ii) the Registration Statement will, at the time the
Registration Statement and each amendment or supplement thereto, if any,
becomes effective under the Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading.

(g) None of the information relating to the AIM Entities that is provided by
AIM for inclusion in: (i) the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, any approvals under
applicable federal or state banking Laws or regulations or state securities
Laws, or any filing pursuant to the Securities Act will, at the time of
mailing the Proxy Statement/Prospectus to AIM's shareholders, at the time of
the AIM Shareholder Meeting and at the Effective Time, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading; and (ii) the
Registration Statement will, at the time the Registration Statement and each
amendment or supplement thereto, if any, becomes effective under the
Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading.

(h) Heartland will bear the costs of all SEC filing fees with respect to the
Registration Statement and the costs of qualifying the shares of Heartland
Common Stock under the Blue Sky Laws, to the extent necessary. Heartland will
also bear the costs of all NASDAQ listing fees with respect to listing the
shares of Heartland Common Stock on the NASDAQ Global Select Market or other
national securities exchange pursuant to this Agreement. Heartland will bear
all printing and mailing costs in connection with the preparation and mailing
of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus to AIM shareholders. Heartland and AIM will
each bear their own legal and accounting expenses in connection with the
preparation of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and the Registration Statement.

6.3 Establishment of Accruals. If requested by Heartland, on the Business Day
immediately prior to the Closing Date, AIM will cause AimBank, consistent with
GAAP, to establish such additional accruals and reserves as Heartland indicates are
necessary to conform its accounting and credit loss reserve practices and
methods to those of Heartland (as such practices and methods are to be applied
to AimBank from and after the Effective Time) and reflect Heartland's plans
with respect to the conduct of the business of AimBank following the Merger
and to provide for the costs and expenses relating to the consummation by AIM
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided, however, that
any such accruals and reserves will not affect the determination of Adjusted
Tangible Common Equity. No such accruals or reserves will of itself constitute
or be deemed to be a breach, violation or failure to satisfy any
representation, warranty, covenant, condition or other provision or constitute
grounds for termination of this Agreement or be an acknowledgment by AIM (a)
of any adverse circumstances for purposes of determining whether the
conditions to Heartland's obligations under this Agreement have been
satisfied; or (b) that such adjustment has any bearing on the Merger
Consideration or Option Consideration. In no event will any accrual, reserve
or other adjustment required or permitted by this Section 6.3 require any
prior filing with any Governmental Entity or violate any Law or Governmental
Order applicable to AimBank.

6.4 Employee Matters.

(a) General. At the request of Heartland, AIM agrees to terminate any Plans as
of the Effective Time on terms reasonably acceptable to Heartland. If any
Plans are not so terminated, after the Effective Time, Heartland will have the
right to continue, amend, merge or terminate any of such Plans in accordance
with the terms thereof and subject to any limitation arising under applicable
Law, including Tax qualification requirements. AIM agrees that, at the request
of Heartland, each of the AIM Entities and any Commonly Controlled Entity will
cease to be a participating employer of, and will cease making contributions
to or otherwise providing benefits under, any Plan, as of the Effective Time.
If, after the Effective Time, there are any Plans for which the Surviving
Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries continues to be a participating
employer, Heartland will have the right to discontinue such participation in
any of such Plans in accordance with the terms thereof and subject to any
limitation arising under applicable Law. However, until Heartland will take
such action, such Plans will continue in force for the benefit of present and
former employees of the AIM Entities who have any present or future
entitlement to benefits under any of the Plans.

(b) Termination of KSOP. Unless Heartland directs AIM otherwise in writing, no
later than five Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Board of
Directors of AIM will adopt resolutions, effective immediately prior to the
Effective Date, (i) permanently discontinuing contributions to and terminating
the KSOP and (ii) amending the KSOP, to the extent necessary, to comply with
all applicable Laws. Such resolutions will provide that, as soon as
administratively feasible following the Closing, but subject to any applicable
regulatory requirements and receipt of any necessary regulatory approvals, the
Surviving Corporation will direct the KSOP to distribute each participant's
vested account balance in a single cash lump sum, including vested accounts
already in pay status. AIM will also take such other actions in furtherance of
the termination of the KSOP as Heartland may reasonably require. (c) Participation in Heartland Benefit Plans. As of the Closing Date, each AIM
Employee will be eligible to participate in the health, vacation and other
non-equity based employee benefit plans of Heartland or its Subsidiaries (the
"Heartland Plans") to the same extent as similarly situated employees of
Heartland and to the extent permitted by the applicable Heartland Plan or
applicable Law; provided, however, that (i) in the case of the Heartland Plan
that is a 401(k) plan, AIM Employees will be able to participate in such plan
as of the first day of the month following the month in which the Closing
occurs, and (ii) nothing in this Section 6.4(c) or elsewhere in this Agreement
will limit the right of Heartland or any of its Subsidiaries to amend or
terminate a Heartland Plan at any time. With respect to the Heartland Plans,
Heartland will, or will cause the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries
to: (x) with respect to each Heartland Plan that is a medical/prescription,
dental or vision plan, (A) waive any exclusions for pre-existing conditions
under such Heartland Plan that would result in a lack of coverage for any
condition for which the applicable AIM Employee would have been entitled to
coverage under the corresponding Plan in which such AIM Employee was an active
participant immediately prior to his or her transfer to Heartland Plan, (B)
waive any waiting period under such Heartland Plan, to the extent that such
period exceeds the corresponding waiting period under the corresponding Plan
in which such AIM Employee was an active participant immediately prior to his
or her transfer to Heartland Plan (after taking into account the service
credit provided for herein for purposes of satisfying such waiting period),
and (C) so long as the insurance companies of the AIM Entities provide
information related to the amount of such credit that is available to
Heartland, provide each AIM Employee with credit for deductibles paid by such
AIM Employee prior to his or her transfer to a Heartland Plan (to the same
extent such credit was given under the analogous Plan prior to such transfer)
in satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under
such Heartland Plan for the plan year that includes such transfer and (y)
fully recognize service of the AIM Employees with any of the AIM Entities
(including any entities acquired by, or merged with, any AIM Entity) for
purposes of eligibility to participate and vesting credit, and, solely with
respect to vacation and severance benefits, benefit accrual in any Heartland
Plan in which the AIM Employees are eligible to participate after the Closing
Date, to the extent that such service was recognized for that purpose under
the analogous Plan prior to such transfer. Heartland will extend coverage to
AIM Employees for health care, dependent care and limited purpose health care
flexible spending accounts established under Section 125 of the Code to the
same extent as available to similarly situated employees of Heartland to the
extent permitted by the applicable Heartland Plan and applicable Law.
Heartland will give effect to any elections made by AIM Employees with respect
to such accounts under any flexible benefits cafeteria plan of any AIM Entity
to the extent permitted by applicable Law. AIM Employees will be credited with
amounts available for reimbursement equal to such amounts as were credited
under any flexible benefits cafeteria plan of either AIM or AimBank to the
extent permitted by such Heartland Plan and applicable Law. The foregoing will
not apply to the extent it would result in duplication of benefits.

(d) Terminated AIM Employees. To the extent that Heartland terminates the
employment of any employee of any of the AIM Entities without Cause at, or
within nine months after, the Effective Time, Heartland will offer such employee severance
benefits equal to one week of base compensation for each full year of service
to an AIM Entity (including any entities acquired by, or merged with, any AIM
Entity), with a minimum of two and a maximum of 12 weeks of severance pay,
plus any unused accrued vacation time of such employee up to a maximum of
three weeks, subject to the execution of a release of claims against
Heartland, the Surviving Corporation and all AIM Entities in a form reasonably
acceptable to Heartland.

(e) AIM Employee Retention Program. Prior to the Effective Time, AIM and
Heartland will mutually agree on and establish an employee retention bonus
program and will allocate pursuant to such program cash awards to certain
employees of the AIM Entities, as mutually determined by Heartland and AIM, to
facilitate the retention of such employees to remain in the employ of one of
the AIM Entities through the completion of the system integration process
between the AIM Entities on the one hand, and Heartland on the other hand.

(f) Affordable Care Act Reporting. As of the earlier of the Closing Date or
the applicable reporting deadline under the Affordable Care Act, each AIM
Entity and any Commonly Controlled Entity will accurately complete and timely
file with the IRS, and timely send to all covered individuals, as applicable,
any required IRS Forms 1094 B, 1095 B, 1094 C and 1095 C for the 2019 calendar
year with respect to each Plan that is subject to the Affordable Care Act.

(g) Limitation on Enforcement. This Agreement is an agreement solely between
AIM and Heartland. Nothing in this Agreement, including this Section 6.4,
whether express or implied, confers upon any employee of any AIM Entity, any
employee of Heartland or its Subsidiaries or any other Person, any rights or
remedies, including: (i) any right to employment or recall, (ii) any right to
continued employment for any specified period, or (iii) any right to any
particular compensation, benefit or aggregate benefits, or any other term or
condition of employment, of any kind or nature whatsoever.

6.5 Tax Treatment. Neither AIM nor Heartland will take any action that would
disqualify the Merger as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Code.

6.6 Updated Schedules. On a date 15 Business Days prior to the Effective Date
and on the Effective Date, AIM will modify any Schedule to this Agreement or
add any Schedule or Schedules for the purpose of making the representations
and warranties to which any such Schedule relates true and correct in all
material respects as of such date, whether to correct any misstatement or
omission in any Schedule or to reflect any additional information obtained by
AIM subsequent to the date any Schedule was previously delivered by AIM to
Heartland. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any updated Schedule will not have
the effect of making any representation or warranty contained in this
Agreement true and correct in all material respects for purposes of Section
7.3(a).

6.7 Indemnification; Directors' and Officers' Insurance. (a) Heartland agrees that all rights of the present and former directors and
officers of any of the AIM Entities to indemnification provided for in the
Charter or Bylaws of such AIM Entity, as applicable, as in effect on the date
hereof, or required under any applicable Law (including rights to advancement
of expenses and exculpation), will survive the Merger and continue in full
force and effect until expiration of the applicable statute of limitations
(each such director and officer being sometimes hereinafter be referred to as
an "Indemnified Party"). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
Heartland agrees that, following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
will indemnify any person made a party to any proceeding by reason of the fact
that such person was a director, officer, member or employee of any of the AIM
Entities at or prior to the Effective Time to the fullest extent provided in,
and will advance expenses in accordance with, the Charter and Bylaws of such
AIM Entity, as applicable, in the form previously provided to Heartland and
effective as of the date of this Agreement, in each case subject to all the
limitations set forth in such Charter and Bylaws. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in this Section 6.7, nothing contained in this
Agreement will require Heartland to indemnify, defend or hold harmless any
Indemnified Party to a greater extent than any AIM Entity may, as of the date
of this Agreement, indemnify, defend and hold harmless such Indemnified Party,
and any such indemnification provided pursuant to this Section 6.7 will be
provided only to the extent that such indemnification is permitted by any
applicable federal or state Laws.

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, AIM will or, if AIM is unable to, Heartland
as of the Effective Time will, obtain a "tail" insurance policy with a claims
period of at least six (6) years from and after the Effective Time with
respect to directors' and officers' liability insurance and fiduciary
liability insurance (collectively, "DandO Insurance") with benefits and levels
of coverage at least as favorable to the Indemnified Parties as the existing
policies of the AIM Entities with respect to matters existing or occurring at
or prior to the Effective Time (including in connection with this Agreement or
the transactions or actions contemplated hereby). Heartland will pay the
premium for such DandO Insurance tail policy; provided, however, that in no
event will Heartland be required to expend more than 200% of the current
amount expended on an annual basis by AIM and AimBank to procure their
existing DandO Insurance policies. If AIM or Heartland for any reason is unable
to obtain such tail DandO Insurance policy on or prior to the Effective Time,
Heartland will obtain as much as comparable DandO Insurance as is available at a
cost in the aggregate for such six-year period up to 200% of the current
annual premiums expended by the AIM Entities for their existing DandO Insurance
policies. Any insurance premium payments made by Heartland pursuant to this
Section 6.7(b) will be considered Transaction Expenses in accordance with the
definition of "Transaction Expenses" set forth in Article I.

(c) The provisions of this Section 6.7 are intended to be for the benefit of,
and will be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party as if he or she were a
party to this Agreement. The indemnification rights provided to each
Indemnified Party pursuant hereto will be in addition to all other
indemnification rights provided to such Indemnified Party under any Contract
between any of the AIM Entities and such Indemnified Party. 6.8 Statutory Trust. AIM, as the owner of the Statutory Trust Securities that
are common securities, will cause the Statutory Trust (a) to remain a
statutory trust, (b) to otherwise continue to be classified as a grantor trust
for federal income Tax purposes, and (c) to cause each holder of Statutory
Trust Securities that are capital securities to be treated as owning an
undivided beneficial interest in the Statutory Trust Debentures. Upon the
Effective Time, Heartland will assume AIM's obligations and acquire its rights
relating to the Statutory Trust, including AIM's obligations and rights under
the Statutory Trust Debentures, Statutory Trust Securities and the other
Statutory Trust Agreements. In connection therewith, AIM will assist Heartland
in assuming AIM's obligations and acquiring its rights under the Statutory
Trust, and will provide the documentation required to make such assumption of
obligations and acquisition of rights effective including any supplemental
indentures or certificates that may be required under the Statutory Trust
Agreements. Subject to the terms of the Statutory Trust Securities,
immediately prior to the Closing, AimBank will pay, or cause to be paid, to
the proper Persons all deferred and accrued but unpaid interest and any
outstanding fees relating to the Statutory Trust Debentures and the Statutory
Trust. Notwithstanding the second sentence of this Section 6.8, Heartland, in
lieu of assuming AIM's obligations and rights under the Statutory Trust
Indentures, may pay in full on the Closing Date all Liabilities of AIM under
the Statutory Trust Debentures, the Statutory Trust Securities and the other
Statutory Trust Agreements.

6.9 Determination of Adjusted Tangible Common Equity. As soon as practicable
after the Determination Date, AIM will prepare the AIM Determination Date
Balance Sheet. Within five (5) Business Days following the Determination Date,
AIM will prepare and deliver to Heartland its good faith determination of (a)
the Adjusted Tangible Common Equity, together with reasonable support therefor
(including the AIM Determination Date Balance Sheet), and (b) the AIM
Determination Date Transaction Expenses, together with reasonable support
therefor. If AIM and Heartland agree on the amount of the Adjusted Tangible
Common Equity, such amount will be final and conclusive. If Heartland and AIM
disagree as to such calculations and are unable to reconcile their differences
in writing within five (5) Business Days, unless otherwise agreed upon by the
parties, the items in dispute will be submitted to a mutually acceptable
independent national accounting firm in the United States for final
determination, and the calculations will be deemed adjusted in accordance with
the determination of the independent accounting firm and will become binding,
final and conclusive upon all of the parties hereto. The independent

ARTICLE 8

TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER

 8.1 Reasons for Termination. This Agreement, by written notice given to the
other party prior to or at the Closing, may be terminated:

(a) by mutual consent of the Boards of Directors of Heartland and AIM;

(b) by either party in the event a Law or Governmental Order will have been
enacted, entered, enforced, promulgated, issued or deemed applicable to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement by any Governmental Entity that
prohibits the Closing;

(c) by either party in the event any approval, consent or waiver of any
Governmental Entity required to permit the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement will have been denied and such denial has
become final and non-appealable (unless such denial arises out of, or results
from, a material breach by the party seeking to terminate this Agreement of
any representation, warranty or covenant of such party);

(d) by AIM if:

(i) the Closing has not occurred by September 30, 2020 (the "Termination
Date"); provided that AIM will not be entitled to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this clause (d)(i) if (x) AIM's failure to comply fully with its
obligations under this Agreement has prevented the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (y) AIM has refused, after
satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Sections 7.1 and 7.2, to close in
accordance with Section 2.11 or (z) the circumstances or events underlying the
termination rights set forth in clauses (d)(iii) or (d)(iv) of this Section
8.1 will have occurred;

(ii) Heartland will have breached any representation, warranty or agreement of
Heartland in this Agreement in any material respect and such breach cannot be
or is not cured within thirty (30) days after written notice of such breach is
given by AIM to Heartland;

(iii) at the AIM Shareholder Meeting, this Agreement will not have been duly
adopted by the Required AIM Shareholder Vote;

(iv) (A) AIM will have delivered to Heartland a written notice of the intent
of AIM to enter into a merger, acquisition or other agreement (including an
agreement in principle) to effect a Superior Proposal based on an Acquisition
Proposal received by it, (B) five Business Days have elapsed following
delivery to Heartland of such written notice by AIM, (C) during such five
Business Day period AIM has fully complied with the terms of Section 5.8,
including informing Heartland of the terms and conditions of such Acquisition
Proposal and the identity of the Person making such Acquisition Proposal, with
the intent of enabling Heartland to agree to a modification of the terms and
conditions of this Agreement so that the transactions contemplated hereby may
be effected, (D) at the end of such five business-day period the Board of Directors of AIM will
have continued reasonably to believe that such Acquisition Proposal
constitutes a Superior Proposal, (E) AIM pays to Heartland the termination fee
in accordance with Section 8.4, and (F) AIM will have entered into a merger,
acquisition or other agreement (including an agreement in principle) to effect
a Superior Proposal or the Board of Directors of AIM will have resolved to do
so;

(v) at any time during the period beginning five Business Days before the
anticipated Closing and ending three Business Days prior to the anticipated
Closing Date, but only if:

(x) the Heartland Closing Date Stock VWAP is less than the product of 0.85
multiplied by the Initial Heartland Stock Price; and

(y) the number obtained by dividing the Heartland Closing Date Stock VWAP by
the Initial Heartland Stock Price is less than the difference of the Index
Ratio less 0.15; provided, however, that a termination by AIM pursuant to this
Section 8.1(d)(v) will have no force and effect if Heartland agrees in writing
(within two Business Days after receipt of AIM's written notice of such
termination) to increase the Exchange Ratio to an amount equal to (i) (X) the
Exchange Ratio (determined without regard to the adjustment pursuant to this
clause), divided by (Y) the Heartland Closing Date Stock VWAP, multiplied by
(ii) the product of 0.85 multiplied by the Initial Heartland Stock Price.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary above, Heartland, at its option, may
elect to retain the original Exchange Ratio, and, in lieu of altering such
Exchange Ratio, increase the Actual Cash Consideration so that each holder of
AIM Common Stock is entitled to receive the same value as of the Effective
Time for each share of AIM Common Stock as such holder would have received had
the original Exchange Ratio been altered in accordance with the preceding
sentence; provided, that, such increase to cash does not affect the intended
tax treatment of the Merger. If within such five-Business Day period,
Heartland delivers written notice to AIM that Heartland intends to proceed
with the Merger by paying such additional consideration as contemplated by
this Section 8.1(d)(v), and notifies AIM in writing of the revised Exchange
Ratio or the revised Actual Cash Consideration, then no termination will occur
pursuant to this Section 8.1(d)(v), and this Agreement will remain in full
force and effect in accordance with its terms (except that the Exchange Ratio
or the Actual Cash Consideration will be modified in accordance with this
Section 8.1(d)(v)).

If Heartland or any company belonging to the Index declares or effects a stock
dividend, split-up, combination, exchange of shares or similar transaction
between the date of this Agreement and the Determination Date, the prices for
the common stock of such company will be appropriately adjusted for the
purposes of applying this Section 8.1(d)(v); or (vi) any of the conditions set forth in Sections 0 or 0 will have become
impossible to satisfy (other than through a failure of AIM to comply with its
obligations under this Agreement); or

(e) by Heartland if:

(i) the Closing has not occurred by the Termination Date; provided, that
Heartland will not be entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
clause (e)(i) if (x) Heartland's failure to comply fully with its obligations
under this Agreement has prevented the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or (y) Heartland has refused, after
satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Sections 7.1 or 7.3, to close in
accordance with Section 2.11;

(ii) AIM will have breached any representation, warranty or agreement in this
Agreement in any material respect and such breach cannot be or is not cured
within thirty (30) days after written notice of such breach is given by
Heartland to AIM;

(iii) at the AIM Shareholder Meeting, this Agreement will not have been duly
adopted by the Required AIM Shareholder Vote;

(iv) at any time during the period beginning five Business Days before the
anticipated Closing Date and ending three Business Days prior to the
anticipated Closing Date, but only if:

(x) the Heartland Closing Date Stock VWAP is above than the product of 1.15
multiplied by the Initial Heartland Stock Price; and

(y) the number obtained by dividing the Heartland Closing Date Stock VWAP by
the Initial Heartland Stock Price is greater than the sum of the Index Ratio
plus 0.15; provided, however, that a termination by Heartland pursuant to this
Section 8.1(e)(iv) will have no force and effect if AIM agrees in writing
(within five Business Days after receipt of Heartland's written notice of such
termination) to decrease the Exchange Ratio to an amount equal to (i) (X) the
Exchange Ratio (determined without regard to the adjustment pursuant to this
clause), divided by (Y) the Heartland Closing Date Stock VWAP, multiplied by
(ii) the product of 1.15 multiplied by the Initial Heartland Stock Price.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary above, AIM, at its option, may elect
to retain the original Exchange Ratio, and, in lieu of altering such Exchange
Ratio, decrease the Actual Cash Consideration so that each holder of AIM
Common Stock is entitled to receive the same value as of the Effective Time
for each share of AIM Common Stock as such holder would have received had the
original Exchange Ratio been altered in accordance with the preceding
sentence. If within such five-Business Day period, AIM delivers written notice
to Heartland that AIM intends to proceed with the Merger by decreasing the
Merger Consideration as contemplated by this Section 8.1(e)(iv)0, and notifies Heartland in writing of
the revised Exchange Ratio or the revised Actual Cash Consideration, then no
termination will occur pursuant to this Section 8.1(e)(iv), and this Agreement
will remain in full force and effect in accordance with its terms (except that
the Exchange Ratio or the Actual Cash Consideration will be modified in
accordance with this Section 8.1(e)(iv)).

If Heartland or any company belonging to the Index declares or effects a stock
dividend, split-up, combination, exchange of shares or similar transaction
between the date of this Agreement and the Determination Date, the prices for
the common stock of such company will be appropriately adjusted for the
purposes of applying this Section 8.1(e)(iv); or

(v) any of the conditions set forth in Sections 7.1 or 7.2 will have become
impossible to satisfy (other than through a failure of Heartland to comply
with its obligations under this Agreement).

8.2 Effect of Termination. Except as provided in Sections 5.2(d), 8.2, 8.3 and
8.4 and any provisions set forth herein that survive the termination of this
Agreement, if this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.1, this
Agreement will forthwith become void, there will be no Liability under this
Agreement on the part of Heartland, AIM or any of their respective
Representatives or Subsidiaries, and all rights and obligations of each party
hereto will cease; provided, however, that, subject to Sections 8.3 and 8.4,
nothing herein will relieve any party from Liability arising out of its own
fraud or willful breach of this Agreement.

8.3 Expenses. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, all Expenses
incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement will be paid by the party incurring such Expenses, whether
or not the Merger is consummated. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if this
Agreement is terminated pursuant to Sections 8.1(d)(iii), 8.1(e)(ii), or
8.1(e)(iii) then AIM will pay to Heartland, within five Business Days of
presentation by Heartland of reasonably detailed invoices for the same, all
Expenses reasonably incurred by Heartland, and, if this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to Section 8.1(d)(ii), then Heartland will pay to AIM,
within five Business Days of presentation by AIM of reasonably detailed
invoices for the same, all Expenses reasonably incurred by AIM; provided,
however, that neither party's reimbursement obligation hereunder will exceed
$750,000 in the aggregate. As used in this Agreement, "Expenses" will consist
of all out-of-pocket expenses (including all fees and expenses of counsel,
accountants, investment bankers, experts and consultants to a party hereto and
its Affiliates) incurred by a party in connection with or related to the
authorization, preparation, negotiation, execution and performance of this
Agreement, the solicitation of the approval of the Merger by holders of AIM
Common Stock and all other matters related to the consummation of the Merger.

8.4 AIM Termination Fee. If this Agreement is terminated by AIM pursuant to
Section 8.1(d)(iv), or by Heartland pursuant to Section 8.1(e)(ii) because of
a breach of any portion of Section 5.8 or Section 6.2(a), then AIM will pay to
Heartland (in lieu of any payment that may be due under Section 8.3), a
termination fee of $11,000,000 as the sole and exclusive remedy of Heartland (including any remedy for specific performance), as
agreed-upon liquidated damages.

8.5 Amendment. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in
writing approved by the parties to this Agreement and signed on behalf of each
of the parties hereto, provided, however, that Heartland may, in its sole
discretion, amend Sections 4.14 and 5.1. to increase any of the dollar
thresholds contained in those sections or to relax any other requirements in
those sections in order to obtain the Regulatory Approvals.

8.6 Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective Time, any party hereto may (a)
extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of
the other parties hereto or (b) waive compliance with any of the agreements of
any other parties or with any conditions to its own obligations, in each case
only to the extent such obligations, agreements and conditions are intended
for its benefit.

9.3 Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations under this Agreement may be assigned by any party to this
Agreement without the prior written consent of the other party to this
Agreement, except that Heartland may assign any of its rights under this
Agreement to one or more Subsidiaries of Heartland, so long as Heartland

9.5 Schedules.

(a) Prior to or simultaneous with the execution of this Agreement, AIM
delivered to Heartland the Disclosure Schedules, which set forth, among other
things, items the disclosure of which is necessary or appropriate either in
response to an express disclosure requirement contained in a provision hereof
or as an exception to one or more representations or warranties contained in
Article 4 or to one or more covenants contained herein (whether or not such
section of this Agreement expressly references a schedule thereto). Except as
set forth in the Disclosure Schedules, the information contained therein is
dated as of the date of this Agreement or, if delivered pursuant to Section
6.6, as of such date delivered. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, the mere inclusion of an item as an exception to a
representation or warranty will not be deemed an admission that such item
represents a material exception or material fact, event or circumstance or
that such item has had or would be reasonably likely to have a Material
Adverse Effect.

(b) For purposes of this Agreement, a Schedule relating to a certain section
may incorporate by reference disclosures made in other Schedules; provided,
however, that any disclosure with respect to a particular Schedule will be
deemed adequately disclosed in other Schedules to the extent it is readily
apparent from the nature of the disclosure that such disclosure also applies
to such other Schedules. Nothing in a Schedule is deemed adequate to disclose
an exception to a representation or warranty made in this Agreement unless the
Schedule identifies the exception with reasonable particularity.

9.6 Interpretation. The headings contained in this Agreement are for reference
purposes only and will not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of
this Agreement. References to this Agreement include the Exhibits, Schedules
and Annexes hereto. References to Sections and Articles refer to Sections and
