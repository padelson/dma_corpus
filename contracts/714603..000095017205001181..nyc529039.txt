                                      or Splitco will own or retain any rights
                                      to use any of the Splitco Proprietary
                                      Intellectual Property.

                            4.9.4.5   To the Knowledge of Parent, there will
                                      be no facts, circumstances, or
                                      conditions that could reasonably be
                                      expected to form the basis for a claim
                                      of infringement, misappropriation, or
                                      other violation of Intellectual Property
                                      rights against Splitco.

                  4.9.5     All Software included in the Splitco Proprietary
                            Intellectual Property (the "Splitco Proprietary
                            Software") will operate in substantial conformity
                            with its Documentation. Splitco and the Parent
                            Entities have used commercially reasonable
                            procedures in the development of the Splitco
                            Proprietary Software, and have been able to
                            maintain each system included therein as a viable
                            computer system for the functionality described in
                            the Documentation. The Splitco Proprietary
                            Software (a) does not contain any "hidden files",
                            "non-functional code", "access key", "back door",
                            "trapdoor", "booby trap", "time bomb", "drop dead
                            device", "data scrambling device", or similar
                            device which Splitco or any Parent Entity can
                            electronically or automatically activate to render
                            any system included therein inoperable or in any
                            way restrict use or access by Splitco, and (b) is
                            free of Disabling Code as of the date of delivery
                            by Splitco or the Parent Entities, as applicable.

                  4.9.6     None of the Splitco Proprietary Software is
                            subject to the terms of any general public
                            license, limited general public license, or other
                            similar agreement, the terms of which could (i)
                            require or condition the use or distribution of
                            such Software on the disclosure, licensing, or
                            distribution of any source code of any portion of
                            Splitco Proprietary Software, or (ii) otherwise
                            impose any limitation, restriction or condition on
                            the right of Splitco to distribute its products
                            and services.

                  4.9.7     Splitco has at all times complied, and is now in
                            compliance with, all applicable Laws, except where
                            the failure to so comply or be in such compliance
                            is not material to Splitco or the Business, as
                            well as its own rules, policies, and procedures
                            relating to privacy, data protection, and the
                            collection and use of personal information
                            collected, used, or held for use by Splitco in the
                            conduct of the Business. Except as set forth in
                            Section 4.9.7 of the Parent Disclosure Letter, no
                            claims have been asserted or, to the Knowledge of
                            Parent, threatened against Splitco alleging a
                            violation of any Person's privacy or personal
                            information or data rights and the consummation of
                            the transactions contemplated hereby will not
                            breach or otherwise cause any violation of any Law
                            or rule, policy, or procedure related to privacy,
                            data protection, or the collection and use of
                            personal information collected, used, or held for
                            use by Splitco in the conduct of the Business.
                            Splitco takes reasonable measures to ensure that
                            such information is protected against unauthorized
                            access, use, modification, or other misuse.

of Assets.

                  4.10.1    As of the Closing, Splitco shall have good and
                            valid title to, or a valid and binding leasehold
                            interest or license, or its reasonable equivalent
                            outside of the United States, (subject to the
                            terms of the relevant lease or license) in, the
                            Business Assets free and clear of any Encumbrances

                            Parent Disclosure Letter, as of the Closing, the
                            Business Assets, the Business Contracts, the
                            Leased Real Property, the Business Records and the
                            Business Employees will constitute, all of the
                            rights, assets, properties and interests, other

                            of the Parent Disclosure Letter, and (c) the
                            Employee Benefit Plans listed in Section 3.1 of

                            and sufficient for the continued operation and
                            conduct of the Business as a division of a
                            publicly held company, as the Business is

                                      the Business Assets are in compliance

                            which could subject any of the Employee Benefit

                            or instituted, and no set of circumstances exists
                            which may reasonably give rise to a claim or
                            lawsuit, against the Plans, any fiduciaries
                            thereof with respect to their duties to the Plans
                            or the assets of any of the trusts under any of
                            the Plans which could reasonably be expected to
                            result in any material liability of Parent, the
                            Parent Entities or Splitco to the Pension Benefit
                            Guaranty Corporation, the Department of Treasury,

                            "Financial Information").

                            The Financial Information has been derived from
                            the books and records of Parent and, collectively,

                            indicated therein and was prepared in accordance
                            with Parent's accounting procedures and policies
                            consistently applied during the period covered by
                            the Financial Information and (ii) has been
                            prepared in accordance with GAAP; provided,
                            however, that:

                            4.18.1.1  The results of operations for the
                                      interim period presented is not
                                      necessarily indicative of the results
                                      for the full year.

                            4.18.1.2  The Financial Information does not
                                      reflect the impact of many significant
                                      events and changes that will occur as a
                                      result of (i) the Reorganization,
                                      including, without limitation, the
                                      transfer of the Business Employees and
                                      certain assets to Splitco, or (ii) the
                                      separation from Parent at the Closing,
                                      including, without limitation, the
                                      creation of independent information
                                      technology, purchasing, banking,
                                      insurance, employee benefits and other
                                      programs.

                            4.18.1.3  Splitco is not a stand-alone business,
                                      and does not have its own
                                      infrastructure. The Financial
                                      Information includes allocations of
                                      expenses incurred by Parent to provide
                                      certain services to Splitco, including
                                      executive oversight and corporate
                                      headquarter functions, consolidation
                                      accounting, treasury, tax, legal, public
                                      affairs, human resources, benefits,
                                      information technology and other
                                      services. Although these allocations
                                      have been determined on bases that are
                                      consistent with allocations to Parent's
                                      other operations, it is possible that,
                                      following the Closing, Stockholder may
                                      not be able to provide these services to
                                      Splitco at the same costs or on the same
                                      terms and conditions.

                            4.18.1.4  The Financial Information as presented
                                      reflects assets, liabilities, and
                                      expenses that are as a result of
                                      intercompany transactions with Parent,
                                      including other current assets,
                                      intercompany payables to Parent, and
                                      fiscal transfers and other tax related
                                      items that do not reflect actual assets,
                                      liabilities, and expenses of Splitco
                                      post Closing.

                            4.18.1.5  The goodwill as presented in the
                                      Financial Information is specifically
                                      attributable to the Business, however,
                                      periodic reviews for impairment as
                                      required by GAAP are performed as part
                                      of the Parent consolidated group and not
                                      on a stand-alone basis.

                            4.18.1.6  The level of materiality used for all
                                      purposes in the preparation of the
                                      Financial Information is the level
                                      applicable under GAAP to Parent's
                                      consolidated financial statements, not
                                      the level that would be applicable under
                                      GAAP to stand-alone financial statements
                                      of Splitco.

                            The Financial Information may not reflect all
                            liabilities of Splitco, including undisclosed or
                            unasserted Customer claims and non-recorded
                            payables incurred in the Ordinary Course of
                            Business of which Parent has no Knowledge.

                            GAAP requires management to make estimates and
                            assumptions that affect the amounts reported in
                            the Financial Information. Actual results could
                            differ from those estimates including estimates
                            regarding allowances for doubtful accounts (no
                            allowance has been provided for the BC/BS
                            receivable disclosed in Section 4.12 of the Parent
                            Disclosure Letter) and revenue recognition on
                            fixed price contracts. Parent makes no
                            representation as to the accuracy of those
                            estimates other than that it has followed GAAP
                            guidance and Parent's accounting procedures and
                            policies in the creation thereof.

                            Splitco are subject to any Liabilities, other than

                            in Section 4.14 of the Parent Disclosure Letter or
                            (vi) liabilities incurred in the Ordinary Course

franchises, grants, authorizations, licenses, permits, easements, variances,
exemptions, consents, certificates, approvals and orders necessary to own,
lease and operate its properties and to carry on its business as it is now
being conducted, other than such franchises, grants, authorizations, licenses,
permits, easements, variances, exemptions, consents, certificates, approvals
and orders which the failure to hold would not, individually or in the
aggregate, result in a Material Adverse Effect on Splitco or the Business
(collectively, the "Permits"). Except as set forth in Section 4.19 of the
Parent Disclosure Letter (a) there is no material Action pending, or, to
Parent's Knowledge, threatened, regarding any of the Permits, (b) each such
Permit is in full force and effect and (c) the Parent Entities (with respect
to the Business) and Splitco are not in material default under, or in
violation of, any of the Permits.

                  4.20.1    As of the date hereof and the Closing Date,
                            Splitco does and will not own any real property.
                            Section 4.20 of the Parent Disclosure Letter sets
                            forth a list, complete and accurate in all
                            respects, of all real property used in the

                            operation of the Business. Parent has provided
                            Stockholder with true and correct copies of all
                            leases for the Leased Real Property.

                            Parent or any Parent Entity party thereto and the
                            other parties thereto in accordance with its
                            terms, and is in full force and effect.

                  4.20.3    To the Knowledge of Parent, Splitco, Parent or any
                            Parent Entity party thereto is not, and as of the
                            Closing will not be, in material default under, in

                            closing will occur, which, with due notice or
                            lapse of time, or both, would constitute such a
                            default.

                  4.20.4    There are no material leases or subleases to which

Indebtedness or other obligation of any Person.

a correct and complete Summary of Insurance for Splitco's current insurance
coverages (the "Insurance Policies"), including their commercial general
liability, property, automobile liability, and workers' compensation insurance

licensed to do business and in good standing in any other jurisdiction in
which the nature of the business conducted by it or the property it owns,
leases or operates requires it to so qualify, be licensed or be in good
standing, except where the failures to be so qualified, licensed or in good
standing, individually and in the aggregate, have not had and could not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Stockholder.

                  Section 5.2 Corporate Power and Authority. Stockholder has
all requisite corporate power and authority to enter into and deliver this

                            not reasonably be excepted to have a Material
                            Adverse Effect on Stockholder or (ii) would not
                            materially impair the ability of Stockholder to
                            timely consummate the transactions contemplated
                            hereby.

                  Section 5.4 Stockholder Parent Shares. As of the date
hereof, Stockholder owns a total of 7,128,772 shares of Parent Common Stock.
As of the Closing, Stockholder will have good and valid title to the
Stockholder Parent Shares, free and clear of all Encumbrances. Upon delivery
to Parent of the certificates representing the Stockholder Parent Shares at
the Closing, or evidence of a book-entry transfer of the Stockholder Parent
Shares to an account of Parent, Parent will acquire good and valid title to
such shares, free and clear of any Encumbrances, other than Encumbrances
created by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries.

                  Section 5.5 Litigation. As of the date hereof, there is no
material Action pending or threatened in writing, or, to Stockholder's
knowledge, otherwise threatened, against Stockholder that seeks, or could
reasonably be expected, to prohibit or restrain the ability of Stockholder to

contemplated hereby.

                  Section 5.6 No Material Adverse Effect. Since December 31,

of any Governmental Authority outstanding against Stockholder which could
reasonably be expected to prevent, prohibit, materially delay or enjoin the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

is receiving the Splitco Shares for its own account and not with a view
towards, or for resale in connection with, the public sale or distribution
thereof, except pursuant to sales registered or exempted under the Securities
Act. Stockholder is an "accredited investor," as that term is defined in
Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act. Stockholder acknowledges
that it can bear the economic risk and complete loss of its investment in the
Splitco Shares, and has such knowledge and experience in financial or business
matters that it is capable of evaluating the merits and risks of the
investment contemplated hereby.

                                 ARTICLE VI.
                           COVENANTS AND AGREEMENTS

                  Section 6.1 Access and Information. During the period from
the date of this Agreement to the Closing, except to the extent prohibited by
applicable Law, and subject to the obligations of Stockholder under the
Confidentiality Agreement with respect thereto, Parent will permit (and will
cause Splitco and each of the Parent Entities to permit) representatives of
Stockholder to have reasonable access during normal business hours and upon
reasonable notice to all premises, properties, personnel, books, records,
Contracts, commitments, reports of examination, and documents of or pertaining
to the Business, the Parent Entities (to the extent relating to the Business),
Splitco, the Business Assets, and the Liabilities related to the Business, and
reasonable opportunity upon prior notice and consultation with Parent to (i)
contact customers and employees of the Business regarding the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) communicate with employees of the
Business about matters relating to the integration of Splitco with and into
the business and operations of Stockholder and its Affiliates (provided that
Parent and Splitco shall have the right to be present by representative for
all such contacts between Stockholder and any customer or employee of the
Business, whether in person, telephonic or otherwise) as may be necessary to
permit Stockholder to, at its sole expense, make, or cause to be made, such
investigations thereof as are reasonably necessary in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and Parent
shall (and shall cause Splitco and the Parent Entities to) reasonably
cooperate with any such investigations. No investigation by Stockholder or its
representatives or advisors prior to or after the date of this Agreement
(including any information obtained by Stockholder pursuant to this Section
6.1) shall diminish, obviate or cure any breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement or any Ancillary
Agreement nor shall the conduct or completion of any such investigation be a
condition to any of Stockholder's obligations under this Agreement.

                  Section 6.2 Conduct of Business. Except (i) as contemplated
by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, (ii) as described in Section
6.2 of the Parent Disclosure Letter or (iii) with the prior written consent of
Stockholder (not to be unreasonable withheld), during the period from the date
hereof to the Closing Date, Parent shall, and shall cause each of Splitco and
the Parent Entities to, conduct the Business only in the Ordinary Course of
Business and, to the extent consistent therewith, with no less diligence and
effort than would be applied in the absence of this Agreement, and to seek to
preserve intact their current business organizations, keep available the
service of their current officers, employees and consultants (to the extent
such consultants provide services with respect to the Business) and preserve
their relationships with customers, suppliers and others having business
dealings with them to the end that their goodwill and the Business shall be
unimpaired on the Closing Date. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, except as otherwise contemplated by this Agreement or as described
in Section 6.2 of the Parent Disclosure Letter, prior to the Closing Date,
neither Splitco nor the Business will, without the prior written consent of

of the applicable license agreements, Parent shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates to, use commercially reasonable efforts to assign to Splitco, in
connection with the Reorganization, all Third Party Software used exclusively

enterprise or similar type license) that is used by both Splitco (or the
Business) and Parent (or one of its Affiliates other than Splitco) as of the
Closing Date (hereinafter collectively referred to as "Shared Material Third

Party Software as of the Closing Date. Parent shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to assist Stockholder or Splitco in obtaining the
independent, non-exclusive right to use Shared Material Third Party Software
licensed in the name of Parent and/or its Affiliates as of the Closing Date.
Section 6.4 of the Parent Disclosure Letter lists the Shared Material Third
Party Software, and the licensee thereof, identified by the parties hereto as
of the date hereof. Parent shall bear all costs and expenses associated with
Splitco's obtaining the right to use all Third Party Software, except for the
Shared Material Third Party Software set forth in Section 6.4 of the Parent
Disclosure Letter, which costs and expenses will be borne by Splitco;
provided, however, that Parent shall bear all costs and expenses of
partitioning and transferring to Splitco all Software licensed from Microsoft.

the Closing, execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, to
Stockholder, the documents or instruments described in Section 7.2 to be
delivered by Parent prior to or at the Closing. Stockholder shall, prior to or
at the Closing, execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered to

                            Agreement, each party hereto shall use reasonable
                            best efforts to take, or to cause to be taken, all
                            actions and to do, or to cause to be done, all
                            things necessary, proper or advisable as promptly
                            as practicable to satisfy the conditions set forth
                            in Article VII and to consummate the transactions
                            contemplated hereby. Each party shall cooperate in
                            all reasonable respects with the other party
                            hereto in assisting such party to comply with this
                            Section 6.6.

                  6.6.2     In the event that any Business Contract (including
                            any Real Property Lease) is not transferable
                            indirectly to Stockholder through the transfer of
                            the Splitco Shares, Parent shall, and shall cause

                            breach or cancellation by the third party thereto
                            or otherwise), or otherwise make arrangements

                            Splitco shall be responsible for performing the
                            obligations of Parent and the appropriate Parent
                            Entity under any such Contract or Permit or with
                            respect to such other Business Asset, in each
                            case, that Splitco would have been responsible for
                            had they been transferable directly to Splitco,
                            and only to the extent that the corresponding
                            benefits thereunder are provided to Splitco. From

                            estoppel certificates, in form and substance

                            Act.

                  6.7.2     Each of Stockholder and Parent shall use
                            reasonable best efforts to resolve such
                            objections, if any, as may be asserted by any
                            Governmental Authority with respect to the
                            transactions contemplated by this Agreement under
                            the HSR Act, the Sherman Act, as amended, the
                            Clayton Act, as amended, the Federal Trade
                            Commission Act, as amended, and any other United
                            States federal or state or foreign statutes,
                            rules, regulations, orders, decrees,
                            administrative or judicial doctrines or other Laws
                            that are designed to prohibit, restrict or
                            regulate actions having the purpose or effect of
                            monopolization or restraint of trade
                            (collectively, the "Antitrust Laws"). Each of
                            Stockholder and Parent shall use reasonable best
                            efforts to take such action as may be required to
                            cause the expiration of the notice periods under
                            the HSR Act with respect to such transactions as
                            promptly as possible after the execution of this
                            Agreement.

                  Section 6.8 Notification by the Parties. Each party hereto
shall use its reasonable best efforts to as promptly as practicable inform the
other parties hereto in writing if, prior to the consummation of the Closing,
it obtains Knowledge that any of the representations and warranties made by
such party in this Agreement ceases to be accurate and complete in any
material respect (except for any representation and warranty that is qualified
hereunder as to materiality or Material Adverse Effect, as to which such
notification shall be given if the notifying party obtains knowledge that such
representation and warranty ceases to be accurate and complete in any
respect). Each party hereto shall also use its reasonable best efforts to
promptly inform the other parties hereto in writing if, prior to the
consummation of the Closing, it becomes aware of any fact or condition that
constitutes, in its reasonable judgment, a breach of any covenant of such
party as of the date of this Agreement or that could reasonably be expected to
cause any of its covenants to be breached as of the Closing Date. Any such
notification shall not be deemed to have cured any breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made in this Agreement for any
purposes of this Agreement.

                  Section 6.9 Insurance Policies. Parent shall, and shall
cause the Parent Entities and Splitco to, use their commercially reasonable
efforts to maintain all Insurance Policies (or comparable policies providing
substantially similar coverage with respect to Splitco, the Business, the
Business Assets and the Liabilities related to the Business) in full force and
effect at all times up to and including the Closing Date and shall pay all
premiums, deductibles and retro-adjustment billings, if any, with respect
thereto covering all periods, and ensuring coverage of the Business, up to and
including the Closing Date.

                  Section 6.10 Confidentiality; Access to Records after
Closing.

                  6.10.1    The parties hereto agree that the provisions of
                            the Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in full
                            force and effect (and Splitco agrees to be bound
                            thereby to the same extent as Parent as if a party
                            thereto); provided, that as of the Closing Date,
                            the Confidentiality Agreement shall be deemed to
                            have terminated without further action by the
                            parties.

                  6.10.2    Parent recognizes that, after the Closing, it may
                            have documents, books, records, work papers and
                            information, whether in written, magnetic,
                            electronic or optical form (collectively,
                            "Records") which relate to the Business with
                            respect to the period or matters arising prior to
                            the Closing, including Records pertaining to the
                            Business Assets, the Liabilities related to the
                            Business and Splitco's respective employees,
                            assets and liabilities (the "Business Records") or
                            other Records relating to the Business. Parent
                            recognizes that Stockholder or its Affiliates may
                            need access to such Business Records and other
                            Records after the Closing. Upon Stockholder's or
                            Splitco's reasonable request Parent shall provide
                            Stockholder or Splitco and their respective
                            employees, representatives and agents access to,
                            and the right to photocopy (at Stockholder's or
                            Splitco's expense), during normal business hours
                            on reasonable advance notice, such reasonably
                            requested Records. Parent shall use reasonable
                            best efforts to maintain all such Records for the
                            same length of time that Parent maintains its own
                            Records, or, at Parent's discretion (at Parent's
                            expense) or (at any time) at Stockholder's or
                            Splitco's reasonable request (at Stockholder's or
                            Splitco's expense), transfer any such Records to
                            Stockholder or Splitco.

                  6.10.3    Notwithstanding any provision herein to the
                            contrary, from and after the Closing, Records
                            pertaining to Taxes shall be governed solely by
                            the Tax Sharing Agreement.

                            6.11.1.1  Prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall
                                      take all necessary and appropriate
                                      actions to cause Splitco to cease to
                                      sponsor, maintain, or contribute to any
                                      Employee Benefit Plans (including
                                      Multiemployer Plans), either directly or
                                      as a participating employer in any
                                      Employee Benefit Plans (including
                                      Multiemployer Plans) sponsored or
                                      maintained by Parent or any of the
                                      Parent Entities, as provided in Section
                                      4.13.1.

                            6.11.1.2  Parent shall, at its expense, make
                                      available to all Business Employees and
                                      dependants who incur a qualifying event
                                      at any time prior to the Closing or as a

                                      all Employee Benefit Plans in which any
                                      Business Employee participates
                                      immediately prior to Closing Date.

                            6.11.1.3  Stockholder shall amend its employee
                                      welfare benefit plans (as that term is

                            duration or scope of such provision, and in its

                            this Agreement and (ii) the effects of such Change
                            in Tax Law cannot be avoided by accelerating the

                  Section 7.4 Frustration of Closing Conditions. None of

efforts to cause the Closing to occur as required by Section 6.6.1.

                                 ARTICLE VIII.

                            notice to the other if the Closing shall not have

                            provided, that the right to terminate this
                            Agreement under this Section 8.1.2 shall not be
                            available to a party if such party's or such
                            party's Affiliate's failure to fulfill any
                            obligation under this Agreement (including such
                            party's obligations under Section 6.7) has been
                            the cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the
                            Closing to be consummated on or before the April
                            30, 2005;

                            any representation, warranty, covenant or
                            agreement contained in this Agreement which would
                            result in a failure of a condition set forth in
                            Section 7.2 and either cannot be cured prior to
                            April 30, 2005, or is not cured within 15 days
                            after Stockholder shall have given Parent written

                            terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section
                            8.1.3 and the basis for such termination;
                            provided, at the time of the delivery of such
                            notice, Stockholder shall not be in material
                            breach of its obligations under this Agreement;

                  8.1.4     by Parent upon written notice to Stockholder, if
                            there has been a breach by Stockholder of any

                            contained in this Agreement which would result in
                            a failure of a condition set forth in Section 7.3
                            and either cannot be cured prior to April 30,
                            2005, or is not cured within 15 days after Parent

                            of the delivery of such notice, Parent shall not
                            be in material breach of its obligations under
                            this Agreement; or

                            notice to the other, if there shall be in effect a

                  Section 9.3 Notice of Claims. Except in connection with
third person claims, which are covered by Section 9.4, any Purchaser
Indemnified Person or Seller Indemnified Person (the "Indemnified Person")
seeking indemnification hereunder shall, within the relevant limitation period
provided for in Section 9.5 below, give to the party obligated to provide
indemnification to such Indemnified Person (the "Indemnitor") a notice (a
"Claim Notice") within 30 days after it acquires knowledge of the fact, event
or circumstances giving rise to the claim for the Loss, describing in
reasonable detail the facts giving rise to any claims for indemnification
hereunder and shall include in such Claim Notice (if then known) the amount or
the method of computation of the amount of such claim, and a reference to the
provision of this Agreement upon which such claim is based; provided, that
failure to give such notice within such 30-day period shall not relieve any
Indemnitor of its obligations hereunder except to the extent it shall have
been prejudiced by such failure. The Indemnitor shall have a period of 30 days
after its receipt of such notice and such evidence to either (i) agree to the
payment of the Loss to the Indemnified Person or (ii) contest the payment of
the Loss. If the Indemnitor does not agree to or contest the payment of the
Loss within such 30 day period, the Indemnitor shall be deemed not to have
accepted the Loss and the parties shall negotiate in good faith to seek a
resolution of such dispute and, if not resolved through negotiations, such
dispute will be resolved in accordance with Section 10.4 of this Agreement. If
the Indemnitor agrees to the payment of the Loss within such 30 day period, it
shall, within 10 business days after such agreement, pay to the Indemnified
Person the amount of the Loss that is payable pursuant to, and subject to the
limitations set forth in, this Article IX.

                  Section 9.4 Third Party Claims.

                  9.4.1     If any Proceeding at Law or in equity is
                            instituted by a third party against an Indemnified
                            Person (each, a "Third Party Claim") with respect
                            to which an Indemnified Person intends to claim
                            indemnification for any Losses under this Article
                            IX, such Indemnified Person shall give written
                            notice to the Indemnitor within 30 days after it
                            has knowledge of a written assertion of liability
                            from the third party and shall not make any
                            admissions or acceptances; provided, however, that
                            the Indemnified Person shall not be foreclosed
                            from seeking indemnification pursuant to this
                            Article IX as a result of any failure to provide
                            timely notice of the existence of such Third Party
                            Claim to the Indemnitor except and only to the
                            extent that the Indemnitor has been materially
                            damaged or prejudiced as a result of such delay.

                  9.4.2     Except as otherwise provided herein, the
                            Indemnitor shall have the right to conduct and
                            control, at its own expense, through counsel of
                            its choosing (which counsel shall be reasonably
                            satisfactory to the Indemnified Person), the
                            defense of a Third Party Claim so long as the
                            Indemnitor notifies the Indemnified Person that it
                            has agreed to indemnify the Indemnified Person
                            (subject to the limitations on indemnification set
                            forth herein) for any and all Losses arising out
                            of or resulting from the Third Party Claim that it
                            is assuming the right to conduct and control the
                            defense of within 15 business days of its receipt
                            of the initial notice of the Third Party Claim,
                            and shall do so vigorously and in good faith;
                            provided, however, that the Indemnified Person may
                            participate at its own expense, with counsel of
                            its choosing, in the defense of such third party
                            action or suit although such action or suit shall
                            be controlled by the Indemnitor. Notwithstanding
                            the foregoing, in connection with any Third Party
                            Claim (other than the Third Party Claims for which
                            Parent is indemnifying Stockholder and its
                            affiliates, and each of their respective officers,
                            directors, employees, shareholders, partners and
                            agents pursuant to Section 9.2.1(e) hereof) as to
                            which the Indemnified Person shall reasonably
                            conclude that (i) there is a material conflict of
                            interest between the Indemnitor and the
                            Indemnified Person in the conduct of the defense
                            of such Third Party Claim, (ii) there are specific
                            defenses available to the Indemnified Person which
                            are different from or additional to those
                            available to the Indemnitor and which could be
                            materially adverse to the Indemnitor, (iii) the
                            Third Party Claim is for an amount greater than
                            the Cap or less than the Deductible or (iv) the
                            Third Party Claims seeks an order, injunction or
                            other equitable relief or relief for other than
                            money damages against the Indemnified Person, then
                            the Indemnified Person shall have the right, at
                            the expense of the Indemnitor, to conduct and
                            control, through counsel of its choosing, the
                            defense of such Third Party Claim and shall do so
                            in good faith; provided, however, that in each of
                            the forgoing cases the Indemnitor shall have the
                            same right to participate in the defense, subject
                            to the control of the Indemnified Person, at its
                            own expense.

                  9.4.3     Neither the Indemnified Person nor the Indemnitor
                            shall settle any Third Party Claim without the
                            consent of the other party, which consent shall
                            not be unreasonably withheld. Any compromise or
                            settlement of the Third Party Claim under this
                            Section 9.4 shall include as an unconditional term
                            thereof the giving by the claimant in question to
                            the Indemnitor and the Indemnified Person of a
                            release of all liabilities in respect of such
                            claims.

                  Section 9.5 Limitation on Indemnity.

                  9.5.1     Time Limitations. Claims for indemnification made
                            under Section 9.2.1(a) or Section 9.2.2(a) of this

                            such Deductible, and Stockholder will be liable to

                            excess of such Deductible, as the case may be);
                            provided, however, anything herein to the contrary
                            notwithstanding, where the aggregate amount of

                            "Minimum Claim Threshold"), such claim or series
                            of related claims shall not count towards the
                            Deductible as Losses for purposes of, or otherwise
                            be subject to indemnification under, this
                            Agreement; and provided further, however, that the
                            Deductible shall not apply to breaches of the

                            In addition, for the avoidance of doubt, the
                            Deductible shall not apply to any claims for
                            indemnification arising under the Tax Sharing
                            Agreement.

                            9.2.1(a), and Section 9.2.1(b) (except with
                            respect to breaches of the covenants and
                            agreements contained in Section 6.16) nor (ii) the
                            aggregate amount of all payments to be made by
                            Stockholder in satisfaction of claims for
                            indemnification pursuant to Section 9.2.1(a), (b)
                            and (c), shall exceed $20,000,000 (the "Cap");
                            provided, however, that the Cap shall not apply to
                            breaches of the Ownership Representations or
                            Section 4.11 hereof. In addition, for the
                            avoidance of doubt, the Cap shall not apply to any
                            claims for indemnification arising under the Tax
                            Sharing Agreement.

                  9.5.4     Reimbursable Claims. The Indemnified Persons shall

                            no less diligent than such party's past practice,
                            to obtain under any applicable Contract any
                            indemnification proceeds or other right of
                            reimbursement or recovery in respect of any claim
                            for which the Indemnified Person seeks
                            indemnification under this Article IX. The amount
                            of any indemnified Losses hereunder shall be
                            determined net of the amount, if any, of the
                            recovery actually received by the Indemnified
                            Person with respect to such indemnified Losses
                            under any such Contract or arrangement. In the
                            event that a recovery is received pursuant to any
                            such Contract or arrangement by an Indemnified
                            Person with respect to any Loss for which any
                            Indemnified Person has previously been indemnified
                            by the Indemnitor pursuant hereto, then such
                            Indemnified Person shall promptly make a refund to
                            the Indemnitor of an amount equal to the lesser of
                            (i) the total amount of such recovery, and (ii)
                            the amount previously paid by the Indemnitor to
                            the Indemnified Person as indemnification for such
                            Loss.

                  9.5.5     Insured Claims. The amount of any indemnified
                            Losses hereunder shall be determined, in the case
                            of the Seller Indemnified Persons, net of the
                            amount, if any, of the recovery actually received
                            by the Seller Indemnified Persons with respect to
                            such indemnified Losses under any insurance or
                            similar policy, and in the case of the Purchaser
                            Indemnified Persons, net of the amount, if any, of
                            the recovery actually received by the Purchaser
                            Indemnified Persons with respect to such
                            indemnified Losses under any insurance or similar
                            policy maintained by Parent, Splitco or any Parent
                            entity prior to the Closing and in place at the
                            Closing, in each case less (i) any reasonable
                            out-of-pocket collection costs; (ii) any amount
                            which is reimbursed by the Indemnified Person or
                            an affiliate thereof, directly or indirectly, that
                            is charged back to the Indemnified Person or an
                            affiliate thereof or that is not otherwise
                            received for the permanent benefit of the
                            Indemnified Person; and (iii) any other reasonable
                            out-of-pocket cost which may reasonably be borne
                            by the Indemnified Person or an affiliate thereof
                            as a result of such insurance claim or recovery,
                            whether as a result of any self-insurance
                            arrangement, retention amount, deductible amount
                            or otherwise; provided however that Losses of the
                            Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall not be reduced
                            or offset by any amount received by Stockholder or
                            Splitco under any insurance or similar policy
                            under which Stockholder or Splitco has obtained
                            coverage relating to the Business following the
                            Closing. Subject to the preceding sentence, the
                            Indemnitor shall be subrogated to the rights of
                            the Indemnified Person to recover amounts under
                            insurance policies or other rights of the
                            Indemnified Person with respect to such
                            indemnified amount and, in the event that an
                            insurance recovery is received by an Indemnified
                            Person with respect to any Loss for which any
                            Indemnified Person has previously been indemnified
                            by the Indemnitor pursuant hereto, then such
                            Indemnified shall promptly make a refund to the
                            Indemnitor an amount equal to the lesser of (i)
                            the total amount of such insurance recovery (net
                            of any reasonable out-of-pocket collection costs),
                            and (ii) the amount previously paid by the
                            Indemnitor to the Indemnified Person as
                            indemnification for such Loss.

                  Section 9.6 Exclusive Remedies. Except as otherwise
expressly provided in this Agreement, following the Closing, the remedies in
this Article IX shall be the exclusive remedies of the parties with respect to
any and all matters covered by this Agreement; provided, however, that no
party hereto shall be deemed to have waived any rights, claims, causes of
action or remedies if and to the extent such rights, claims, causes of action
or remedies may not be waived under Law or intentional fraud or willful
misconduct is proven on the part of a party by another party hereto. No party
hereto shall have any liability under any provision of this Agreement or

assignment shall be null and void. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and
permitted assigns. This Agreement shall be for the sole benefit of the parties
hereto, and their respective successors and permitted assigns and is not

hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns any legal or
equitable right, benefit, remedy or claim hereunder.

                  Section 10.7 Titles and Headings. The headings and table of

hereby shall be a joint press release approved in advance by Parent and
Stockholder and thereafter each of Parent and Stockholder shall consult with
the other prior to issuing any press releases or otherwise making public
announcements with respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby and prior to making any filings with any third party or any
Governmental Authority (including any national securities exchange or
interdealer quotation system) with respect thereto, except as may be required
by applicable Laws or the requirements of any national securities exchange or
interdealer quotation system on which the securities of Parent or Stockholder
are listed or quoted.

                  Section 10.10 Waiver. Any of the terms or conditions of this
Agreement may be waived at any time by the party or parties hereto entitled to
the benefit thereof, but only by a writing signed by the party or parties
waiving such terms or conditions.

                  Section 10.11 Severability. If any term, provisions,
covenant or restriction of this Agreement is held by a court of competent
jurisdiction or other authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the
remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this
Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be
affected, impaired or invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance
of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner
materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination, the parties shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order
that the transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as originally
contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

                  Section 10.12 No Strict Construction. Stockholder and Parent
each acknowledge that this Agreement has been prepared jointly by the parties
hereto and shall not be strictly construed against any party hereto.

                  Section 10.13 Entire Agreement. This Agreement (including
the Disclosure Letters, Schedules and Exhibits attached hereto or delivered in
connection herewith), the Ancillary Agreements and the Confidentiality
Agreement constitute the entire agreement among the parties hereto with
respect to the matters covered hereby and thereby, and supersede all previous
written, oral or implied understandings among them with respect to such
matters.
