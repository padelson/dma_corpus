directors shall be deemed to have granted to the Interim Surviving

or recordings required under the DGCL and DLLCA in order to consummate the
Second Merger. There shall be no conditions to the completion of the Second
Merger other than the completion of the First Merger. The Second Merger shall
become effective at the time the Second Certificate of Merger has been filed
with the Delaware Secretary of State. As a result of the Second Merger, the
separate corporate existence of the Interim Surviving Corporation shall cease
and Second Merger Sub shall continue its existence as a wholly owned
subsidiary of Parent under the laws of the State of Delaware. Second Merger
Sub, in its capacity as the entity surviving the Second Merger, is sometimes
referred to in this Agreement as the " _Surviving Company_."

of the Second Merger Sub in effect immediately prior to the effective time of

assignments or assurances in law or any other acts are necessary or desirable
to (i) vest, perfect or confirm, of record or otherwise, in the Surviving
Company its right, title or interest in, to or under any of the property,
rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Interim Surviving Corporation
or (ii) otherwise carry out the provisions of this Agreement, the Interim
Surviving Corporation and its officers and directors shall be deemed to
have granted to the Surviving Company an irrevocable power of attorney to
execute and deliver all such deeds, assignments or assurances in law and to
take all acts necessary, proper or desirable to 



 

-16-  vest, perfect or confirm title to and possession of such property, rights,
privileges, powers and franchises in the Surviving Company and otherwise to

effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares to the
Exchange Agent) in such form as Parent and the Company may reasonably agree,
for use in effecting delivery of shares of Company Common Stock to the
Exchange Agent, and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry
Shares in exchange for the Per Share Consideration. Exchange of any Book-Entry
Shares shall be effected in accordance with Parents customary procedures
with respect to securities represented by book entry.

(c) Each holder of shares of Company Common Stock that have been converted
into a right to receive the Per Share Consideration will be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor

 



 

-18-  (A) one or more shares of Parent Common Stock (which shall be in non-
certificated book-entry form unless a physical certificate is requested)
representing, in the aggregate, the whole number of shares of Parent Common
Stock, if any, that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section
3.01 (after taking into account all shares of Company Common Stock then held
by such holder) and/or (B) a check in the amount equal to the cash portion of
the Per Share Consideration that such holder has the right to receive pursuant
to Section 3.01 and this Article 3, including cash payable in lieu of
fractional shares pursuant to Section 3.03 and dividends and other
distributions pursuant to Section 3.02(g) (less any required Tax withholding).
Each holder of a Cashed Out Compensatory Award that has been converted into a
right to receive cash will be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a check
in the amount equal to the Cashed Out Award Consideration that such holder
has the right to receive pursuant to Section 3.06(a) and this Article 3 (less
any required Tax withholding). No interest shall be paid or accrued on any Per
Share Consideration or Cashed Out Award Consideration, cash in lieu of
fractional shares or on any unpaid dividends and distributions payable to
holders of Certificates or Company Stock Options. Until so surrendered, each
such Certificate shall, after the Effective Time, represent for all purposes
only the right to receive such Per Share Consideration.

(d) If any cash payment is to be made to a Person other than the Person in
whose name the applicable surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a
condition of such payment that the Person requesting such payment shall pay
any transfer Taxes required by reason of the making of such cash payment to a
Person other than the registered holder of the surrendered Certificate or
shall establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has
been paid or is not payable. If any portion of the Per Share Consideration is
to be registered in the name of a Person other than the Person in whose name
the applicable surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition
to the registration thereof that the surrendered Certificate shall
be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the
Person requesting such delivery of the Per Share Consideration shall pay to
the Exchange Agent any transfer Taxes required as a result of such
registration in the name of a Person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such
Tax has been paid or is not payable.

 

(e) After the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of
Transfers of shares of Company Common Stock. From and after the Effective
Time, the holders of Certificates representing shares of Company Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any
rights with respect to such shares of Company Common Stock except as
otherwise provided in this Agreement or by Applicable Law. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Exchange Agent, the Interim
Surviving Corporation or Parent, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the
consideration provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set forth,
in this Article 3\.

(f) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the holders of
shares of Company Common Stock or holders of Cashed Out Compensatory Awards
after the one-year anniversary of the Effective Time shall be returned to
Parent, upon demand. Any holder of shares of Company Common Stock who has not
exchanged his shares of Company Common Stock for the Per Share Consideration
in accordance with this Section 3.02 and any holder of a Cashed Out

 



 

-19-  Compensatory Award who has not received the Cashed Out Award Consideration
in accordance with Section 3.06(a) prior to that time shall thereafter look
only to Parent for delivery of the Per Share Consideration or Cashed Out
Award Consideration in respect of such holders shares of Company Common Stock
or Cashed Out Compensatory Award. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither
Parent, the Company nor the Interim Surviving Corporation shall be liable to
any Company Common Stock or holder of Cashed Out Compensatory Awards for any
Per Share Consideration or Cashed Out Award Consideration properly delivered
to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property laws. Any
Per Share Consideration or Cashed Out Award Consideration remaining unclaimed
by holders of shares of Company Common Stock or holders of Cashed Out
Compensatory Awards immediately prior to such time as such amounts would
otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Authority shall,
to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, become property of Parent free and
clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

 

(g) No dividends or other distributions with respect to shares of Parent
Common Stock issued in the First Merger shall be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered Certificates or Book-Entry Shares until such Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares are surrendered as provided in this Section 3.02. Following
such surrender, subject to the effect of escheat, Tax or other
Applicable Law, there shall be paid, without interest, to the record holder
of the shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange therefor (i) at the
time of such surrender, an amount equal to all dividends and other
distributions payable in respect of such shares of Parent Common Stock with a
record date after the Effective Time and a payment date on or prior to the
date of such surrender and not previously paid and (ii) at the appropriate
payment date, an amount equal to the dividends or other distributions payable
with respect to such shares of Parent Common Stock with a record date after
the Effective Time but with a payment date subsequent to such surrender. For
purposes of dividends or other distributions in respect of shares of Parent
Common Stock, all shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the
First Merger (the " _Stock Issuance_ ") and all shares of Parent Common Stock
to be issued pursuant to Section 3.06(a) shall be entitled to dividends
pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence as if issued and outstanding as
of the Effective Time.

(h) Any portion of the Per Share Consideration deposited with the Exchange
Agent pursuant to this Section 3.02 to pay for shares for which appraisal
rights shall have been perfected shall be returned to Parent, upon demand.

 

(i) All Per Share Consideration or Cashed Out Award Consideration issued and
paid upon conversion of the Company Common Stock or the Cashed Out
Compensatory Awards, respectively, in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement (including any cash paid pursuant to Section 3.03), shall be deemed
to have been issued and paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to
such Company Common Stock or Cashed Out Compensatory Awards, respectively.

Section 3.03 Fractional Shares. No fractional shares of Parent Common Stock
shall be issued in connection with the First Merger, and no certificates or
scrip for any such fractional shares shall be issued. Any holder of Company
Common Stock who would otherwise be entitled to receive a fraction of a share
of Parent Common Stock (after aggregating all fractional shares of Parent



 

-20-  Common Stock issuable to such holder) shall, in lieu of such fraction of a
share and upon surrender of such holders Company Stock Certificates, be paid
in cash the dollar amount (rounded to the nearest whole cent), without
interest, determined by multiplying such fraction by the closing price of a
share of Parent Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange on the date the
First Merger becomes effective.

 

Section 3.04 Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by Parent or the Surviving Company, the posting by such Person of a
bond, in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Company may direct, as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate the Per Share Consideration to be paid in respect of
the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificate as
contemplated by this Article 3\.

Section 3.05 Withholding Rights. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Interim
Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause the
Exchange Agent to deduct and withhold, from the consideration otherwise
payable to any Person pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as it is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
pursuant to the Code or under any provision of federal, state, local or
foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld by
Parent, Merger Sub, the Interim Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent,
as the case may be, such deducted or withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made.

Section 3.06 Treatment of Company Compensatory Awards and Restricted
Stock Awards.

(a) At the Effective Time by virtue of the First Merger and without any action
on the part of the holders thereof, (1) each Company Compensatory Award that
is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that has a per
share exercise price that is less than the Cash-Out Per Share Consideration,
and which pursuant to its terms was and/or shall become vested as of the
Effective Time (each a " _Vested Compensatory Award_ "), (2) each Additional
Cashed Out Award (if any) and (3) unless determined otherwise by Parent, each
Company Compensatory Award that is held by a person who is not an employee
of, or a consultant to, the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company
immediately prior to the Effective Time (the " _Non-Employee Compensatory
Award_ " and together with the Vested Compensatory Awards and the Additional
Cashed Out Awards each a " _Cashed Out Compensatory Award_ "), shall not be
assumed by Parent pursuant to this Section 3.06 and shall, immediately prior
to the Effective Time, be cancelled and extinguished and the vested portion
thereof shall automatically be converted, as applicable, into the right to
receive an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the
aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock that were issuable
upon exercise or settlement of such Cashed Out Compensatory Award immediately
prior to the Effective Time and (y) the Cash-Out Per Share Consideration, less
any per share exercise price of such Cashed Out Compensatory Award (the 



 

-21-  " _Cashed Out Award Consideration_ "). If any Non-Employee Compensatory
Award has a per share exercise price greater than the Cash-Out Per Share
Consideration, such Non-Employee Compensatory Award, shall be cancelled and
no longer outstanding and each holder of such an award shall cease to have any
rights with respect thereto. In the event any Cashed Out Compensatory Award is
subject to Section 409A of the Code, as reasonably determined by Parent, the
payment of the amount of cash with respect thereto shall be delayed to the
extent necessary to comply with Section 409A of the Code.

 

(b) At the Effective Time by virtue of the First Merger and without any action
on the part of the holders thereof, each Company Compensatory Award that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, and which is not a Cashed
Out Compensatory Award, shall be assumed by Parent and converted automatically
at the Effective Time into an option, restricted stock unit award, or other
equity-based award, as the case may be, denominated in shares of Parent Common
Stock and which has other terms and conditions substantially similar to those
of the related Company Compensatory Award except that (i) the number
of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to each such award shall be
determined by multiplying the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject
to such Company Compensatory Award immediately prior to the Effective Time by
the Compensatory Award Exchange Ratio (rounded down to the nearest whole
share) and (ii) if applicable, the exercise or purchase price per share of
Parent Common Stock (rounded upwards to the nearest whole cent) shall equal
(x) the per share exercise or purchase price for the shares of Company Common
Stock otherwise purchasable pursuant to such Company Compensatory Award
immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by (y) the Compensatory Award
Exchange Ratio; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no case shall the exchange
of a Company Stock Option be performed in a manner that is not in compliance
with the adjustment requirements of Section 409A of the Code. It is the
intention of the parties that each Company Stock Option so assumed by Parent
shall qualify following the Effective Time as an incentive stock option as
defined in Section 422 of the Code to the extent permitted under Section 422
of the Code and to the extent such Company Stock Option qualified as an
incentive stock option prior to the Effective Time.

(c) At the Effective Time by virtue of the First Merger and without any
action on the part of the holders thereof, each Company Restricted Stock Award
shall be treated in accordance with Section 3.01 hereof, _provided_ ,
_however_ , that any consideration payable or issuable to the holder of
such Company Restricted Stock Award shall be subject to, and payable or
issuable to the holder of such Company Restricted Stock Award, in accordance
with the vesting schedule applicable to such Company Restricted Stock Award as
in effect immediately prior to Effective Time.

(d) Subject to Parents compliance with this Section 3.06 and Section 3.01,
the parties agree that, following the Effective Time, no holder of a Company
Compensatory Award or a Company Restricted Stock Award or any participant in
any Company Stock Plan, or other Company Employee Plan or employee benefit
arrangement of the Company or under any employment agreement shall have any
right hereunder to acquire any capital stock or other equity interests
(including any "phantom" stock or stock appreciation rights) in the Company,
any of its Subsidiaries or the Surviving Company.



 

-22- Section 3.07 Dissenting Shares.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, with respect
to each share of Company Common Stock as to which the holder thereof shall
have (i) not voted in favor of the First Merger nor consented thereto in
writing, (ii) properly complied with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL
as to appraisal rights, or (iii) not effectively withdrawn or lost its rights
to appraisal (each, a " _Dissenting Share_ "), if any, such holder shall be
entitled to payment, solely from the Surviving Company, of the appraisal value
of the Dissenting Shares to the extent permitted by and in accordance with
the provisions of section 262 of the DGCL; _provided_ , _however_ , that (x)
if any holder of Dissenting Shares, under the circumstances permitted by and
in accordance with the DGCL, affirmatively withdraws or loses (through
failure to perfect or otherwise) the right to dissent or its right for
appraisal of such Dissenting Shares, (y) if any holder of Dissenting Shares
fails to establish his entitlement to appraisal rights as provided in the DGCL
or (z) if any holder of Dissenting Shares takes or fails to take any action
the consequence of which is that such holder is not entitled to payment for
his shares under the DGCL, such holder or holders (as the case may be) shall
forfeit the right to appraisal of such shares of Company Common Stock and
such shares of Company Common Stock shall thereupon cease to constitute
Dissenting Shares, and each such share of Company Common Stock shall, to the
fullest extent permitted by the law, thereafter be deemed to have been
converted into and to have become, as of the Effective Time, the right to
receive, without interest thereon, the Per Share Consideration.

 

(b) The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any demands received by the
Company for appraisal of shares of Company Common Stock, and Parent shall
have the right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect
to such demands. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent
of Parent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed),
(A) voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal for
Dissenting Shares, (B) offer to settle any such demands, (C) waive any failure
to timely deliver a written demand for appraisal in accordance with the DGCL,
or (D) agree to do any of the foregoing.

Section 3.08 Effect of Second Merger on Capital Stock. At the effective time
of the Second Merger, by virtue of the Second Merger and without any action on
the part of Parent, Second Merger Sub, the Interim Surviving Corporation or
any holder of the capital stock thereof, each issued and outstanding share of
common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Interim Surviving Corporation
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable unit of membership interest in the Surviving Company.

bound to compensate any employee for excise taxes paid pursuant to Section

occurs. No condition exists that would prevent any Acquired Company or
any ERISA Affiliate from amending or terminating any Employee Plan that is an
"employee welfare benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA and
neither any Acquired Company nor such Employee Plan will be subject to any
surrender fees or service fees upon termination except for any reasonable
administrative fees associated with the termination of such plan.

 

(i) There has been no amendment to, written interpretation or announcement
(whether or not written) by any Acquired Company, or change in employee

2009. 

(j) No Acquired Company or any ERISA Affiliate currently maintains or has any
material liability with respect to any self-insured plan that provides

Code).

(o) All Company Compensatory Awards have been appropriately authorized by

its Representatives to any Acquired Company or any Representative of any
Acquired Company or transmitted on behalf of any Acquired Company or any
Representative of any Acquired Company to the Other Interested Party or any of
its Representatives (including any communications related to the
proposed amount or form of consideration, financing terms, if any, and
closing conditions), in each case, to the extent such communication
constitutes a material development with respect to an Acquisition Proposal or
a potential Acquisition Proposal. Without limiting the foregoing, the Company
shall promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) notify Parent orally and in
writing if the Company determines to begin providing information or to engage
in discussions or negotiations concerning an Acquisition Proposal pursuant to
Section 6.03(d).

(d) Notwithstanding Section 6.03(b), if at any time prior to the adoption
of this Agreement by the Required Company Stockholder Approval, (i) the
Company has received a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal from a third
party, (ii) neither any Acquired Company nor any of their respective
Representatives shall have directly or indirectly violated any of the
restrictions set forth in Section 6.03 in a manner that resulted in the
submission of such Acquisition Proposal, (iii) the Company Board of Directors
determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and
outside counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or is reasonably
likely to lead to a Superior Proposal and (iv) after consultation with its
outside counsel, the Company Board of Directors determines in good faith that
such action is necessary to comply with its fiduciary duties to the
stockholders of the Company under Applicable Law, then the Company may take
the following actions: (A) furnish information with respect to the
Acquired Companies to the Person making such Acquisition Proposal and (B)
participate in discussions or negotiations with the Person making such
Acquisition Proposal regarding such Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ that the
Company (x) shall not, and shall not allow any other Acquired Company or any
Representative of any Acquired Company to, disclose any information to such
Person without first entering into a confidentiality agreement containing
customary limitations on the use and disclosure of all nonpublic written and
oral information furnished to such Person by or on behalf of any of the
Acquired Companies, _provided_ that such confidentiality agreement shall not
be required to contain a 



 

-61-  "standstill" provision and (y) shall promptly provide to Parent or its
Representatives any information concerning the Acquired Companies provided to
such other Person which was not previously provided to Parent.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 6.02(b) or
this Section 6.03, at any time prior to the adoption of this Agreement by the
Required Company Stockholder Approval, the Company Board of Directors may make
a Change of Board Recommendation for a reason unrelated to an Acquisition
Proposal (it being understood and agreed that any Change of Board
Recommendation proposed to be made in relation to an Acquisition Proposal may
only be made pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of Section 6.03(f))
if the Company Board of Directors has determined in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel, that, in light of facts, events
or circumstances that have developed since the date of this Agreement that
were not foreseen or reasonably foreseeable to the Company as of the date of
this Agreement (an " _Intervening Event_ ") and taking into account the
results of any negotiations with Parent as contemplated by subsection (ii)
below and any offer from Parent contemplated by subsection (iii) below, that
such action is necessary to comply with the fiduciary duties owed by the
Company Board of Directors to the stockholders of the Company under Applicable
Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company Board may not withdraw, modify
or amend the Company Board Recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent
pursuant to the foregoing unless:

 

(i) the Company shall have provided prior written notice to Parent, at least
four Business Days in advance (the " _Intervening Event Notice Period_ "), of
the Companys intention to make a Change of Board Recommendation (it being
understood that the delivery of such notice and any amendment or update
thereto and the determination to so deliver such notice, update or amendment
shall not, by itself, constitute a Change of Board Recommendation or otherwise
give rise to a Triggering Event), which notice shall specify the Company Board
of Directors reason for proposing to effect such Change of
Board Recommendation;

(ii) prior to effecting such Change of Board Recommendation, the Company
shall, and shall cause the Company Representatives to, during the Intervening
Event Notice Period negotiate with Parent in good faith (to the extent Parent
desires to negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of
this Agreement in such a manner that would obviate the need for the Company
Board of Directors to effect such Change of Board Recommendation; and

(iii) Parent shall not have, within the aforementioned four Business Day
period, made a written, binding and irrevocable (through the expiration of
such period) offer to modify the terms and conditions of this Agreement, which
is set forth in a definitive written amendment to this Agreement delivered to
the Company and executed on behalf of Parent and Merger Sub, and Second Merger
Sub that the Company Board of Directors has in good faith determined (after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and its financial advisor) would
obviate the need for the Company Board of Directors to effect such Change of
Board Recommendation.

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 6.02(b) or
this Section 6.03, if the Company receives an Acquisition Proposal that the
Company Board of Directors

 



 

-62-  determines in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel and its
financial advisors, constitutes a Superior Proposal, after giving effect to
all of the adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement that
have been delivered to the Company by Parent in writing during the Notice
Period provided pursuant to Section 6.03(f), that are binding and have been
irrevocably committed to by Parent in writing, the Company Board of Directors
may at any time prior to the adoption of this Agreement by the Required
Company Stockholder Approval, if the Company Board of Directors determines in
good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that such action
is necessary to comply with the fiduciary duties owed by the Company Board of
Directors to the stockholders of the Company under Applicable Law, take the
following action: (y) effect a Change of Board Recommendation with respect to
such Superior Proposal or (z) terminate this Agreement to enter into a
definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Company shall not terminate this Agreement pursuant to
the foregoing clause (z), and any purported termination pursuant to the
foregoing clause (z) shall be void and of no force or effect, unless in
advance of or concurrently with such termination the Company complies with the
provisions of Section 9.01(f) and Section 9.03; and _provided_ _further_ that
the Company Board may not withdraw, modify or amend the Company Board
Recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent pursuant to the foregoing clause
(y) or terminate this Agreement pursuant to the foregoing clause (z) unless:

(i) the Company shall have provided prior written notice to Parent, at least
four Business Days in advance (the " _Notice Period_ "), of the Companys
intention to take such action with respect to such Superior Proposal (it being
understood that the delivery of such notice and any amendment or update
thereto and the determination to so deliver such notice, update or amendment
shall not, by itself, constitute a Change of Board Recommendation or otherwise
give rise to a Triggering Event), which notice shall specify the
material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal, (including the
identity of the party making such Superior Proposal) and shall have
contemporaneously provided a copy of the relevant proposed transaction
agreements with the party making such Superior Proposal, including the
definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal (the "
_Alternative Acquisition Agreement_ "); and

 

(ii) prior to effecting such Change of Board Recommendation or terminating
this Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such
Superior Proposal, the Company shall, and shall cause the Company
Representatives to, during the Notice Period, negotiate with Parent in good
faith (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) to make such adjustments in
the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such Acquisition Proposal
ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal. In the event of any material
revisions to the Superior Proposal, the Company shall be required to deliver a
new written notice to Parent and to comply with the requirements of this
Section 6.03(f) with respect to such new written notice; _provided_ that the
Notice Period for any subsequent notice shall be shortened from four Business
Days to two Business Days.).

 

(g) The Company agrees that any action or inaction of any of the Acquired
Companies or their respective Representatives that is inconsistent with the
provisions set forth in this Section 6.03 shall be deemed to be a breach of
this Agreement (including this Section 6.03) by the Company; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that no such action or inaction shall be taken into account for



 

-63-  purposes of Section 9.01(e) or Section 9.01(g)(ii) unless the Company shall
have permitted (with respect to its officers, directors and employees) or
shall have knowingly permitted (with respect to any Representative of the
Company who is not a Company officer, director or employee) such action or
inaction to occur, and such action or inaction is materially inconsistent with
this Section 6.03.

 

Section 6.04 Access to Information. From the date of this Agreement until the
Effective Time, upon reasonable advanced notice and during normal business
hours, the Company shall and shall cause each other Acquired Company to (i)
give Parent and its Representatives reasonable access to the offices,
properties, books and records of the Acquired Companies, (ii) furnish to
Parent and its Representatives such financial and operating data and other
information relating to the Acquired Companies as such Persons may reasonably
request and (iii) instruct the employees, counsel and financial advisors of
the Acquired Companies to cooperate with Parent in its investigation of the
Acquired Companies; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company may restrict or
otherwise prohibit access to any documents or information to the extent that
(a) any Applicable Law requires the Company to restrict or otherwise prohibit
access to such documents or information, (b) access to such documents or
information would, in the Companys good faith opinion after consultation
with outside legal counsel, result in the loss of attorney-client privilege,
work product doctrine or other applicable legal privilege applicable to such
documents or information or (c) access to a Contract to which the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries is a party or otherwise bound would violate or cause
a default under, or give a third party the right terminate or accelerate the
rights under, such Contract. In the event that any of the Company or its
Subsidiaries does not provide access or information in reliance on the
preceding sentence, it shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
communicate the applicable information to Parent in a way that would not
violate the applicable Law, Contract or obligation or waive such a privilege.
The terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement shall apply to any
information obtained by Parent or any of its financial advisors, business
consultants, legal counsel, accountants and other agents and representatives
in connection with any investigation conducted pursuant to the access
contemplated by this Section 6.04. Any investigation pursuant to this Section
6.04 shall be conducted in such manner as not to interfere unreasonably with
the conduct of the business of the Acquired Companies and any access to the
property of any Acquired Company must comply with Companys reasonable
security and insurance requirements, may not unreasonably interfere with any
Acquired Companys use of the property. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent
shall not have access to personnel records of the Acquired Companies relating
to individual performance or evaluation records, medical histories or other
information which in the Companys good-faith opinion is sensitive or the
disclosure of which could subject the Company to risk of liability.

 

Section 6.05 Termination of Employee Plans. Unless Parent directs the Company
otherwise in writing no later than five Business Days prior to the Effective
Time, the Company Board of Directors (or the board of directors of the
applicable Acquired Company) shall adopt resolutions terminating, effective at
least one day prior to the Effective Time, any Employee Plan qualified under
Section 401(a) of the Code and containing a Code Section 401(k) cash or
deferred arrangement (each, a " _401(k) Plan_ "). Prior to the Effective Time,
the Company shall provide Parent with executed resolutions of its Board of
Directors (or the board of directors of the applicable Acquired Company)
authorizing such termination and amending any such 401(k) Plan

 



 

-64-  commensurate with its termination to the extent necessary to comply with all
Applicable Laws. The Company shall also take (and shall cause each applicable
Acquired Company to take) such other actions in furtherance of the
termination of each 401(k) Plan as Parent may reasonably require, including
such actions as Parent may reasonably require prior to the Effective Time to
support Parent obtaining a determination letter with respect to the
termination of each 401(k) Plan following the Effective Time.

Section 6.06 Notices of Certain Events. 

(a) From the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time, the Company
shall promptly notify Parent of:

 

(i) any material written notice or written communication from any Governmental
Authority indicating that a Permit is revoked or about to be revoked, which
revocation or failure to obtain has had or would reasonably be expected to
have a Company Material Adverse Effect;

 

(ii) any actions, suits, claims, investigations or proceedings commenced
against the Acquired Companies that would have or reasonably be expected to
have a Company Material Adverse Effect;

(iii) any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation, warranty or covenant
contained in this Agreement if such inaccuracy or breach would cause the
condition in Section 8.02(a) (with respect to representations and warranties)
and Section 8.02(b) (with respect to covenants) to fail to be satisfied at
the Effective Time;

(iv) any actions, suits, claims or proceedings commenced against the Acquired
Companies relating to or involving this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby.

(b) From the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time, Parent shall
promptly notify the Company of:

(i) any actions, suits, claims, investigations or proceedings
commenced against Parent or its Subsidiaries that would have or reasonably be
expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect;

(ii) any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation, warranty or covenant
contained in this Agreement if such inaccuracy or breach would cause the
condition in Section 8.03(a) (with respect to representations and warranties)
and Section 8.03(b) (with respect to covenants) to fail to be satisfied at
the Effective Time; and

(iii) any actions, suits, claims or proceedings commenced against Parent
relating to or involving this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby.



 

-65- No such notice shall be deemed to supplement or amend the Company Disclosure
Schedule or the Parent Disclosure, as the case may be, for the purpose of
determining whether any of the conditions set forth in Article 8 have been
satisfied.

 

Section 6.07 Tax Matters.

 

(a) Each of Parent, Merger Sub, Second Merger Sub and the Company intends, and
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause, the First Merger and
the Second Merger, taken together, to qualify as a "reorganization" within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and the Parties hereto adopt this
Agreement as a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning of Treasury
Regulations Section 1.368-2(g).

(b) Unless otherwise required pursuant to a "determination" within the
meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code, each of Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company shall report the First Merger and the Second Merger, taken together,
as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

(c) Each of Parent, Merger Sub, Second Merger Sub and Company shall cooperate
and use their commercially reasonable efforts in order for the Company to
obtain the opinion of Wilson Sonsini Goodrich and Rosati P.C. in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to the Company, dated as of the Closing Date,
to the effect that, on the basis of the facts, representations and
assumptions set forth or referred to in such opinion, for federal income tax
purposes, the First Merger and the Second Merger, taken together, will
constitute a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Code. As a condition precedent to the rendering of such opinions, Parent (and
Merger Sub and Second Merger Sub) and the Company shall, as of the Closing
Date, execute and deliver to Wilson Sonsini Goodrich and Rosati P.C. tax
representation letters, dated and executed as of the dates of such opinions
(the " _Tax Representation Letters_ "), in substantially the forms attached to
this Agreement as Exhibit C-1 and Exhibit C-2, respectively. Notwithstanding
anything in Section 8.03 to the contrary, the obligation to deliver the
opinion referred to in this Section 6.07 shall not be waivable after receipt
of any Required Company Stockholder Approval, unless further stockholder
approval is obtained with appropriate disclosure.

in connection with any filing, analysis, appearance, presentation,
memorandum, brief, argument, opinion or proposal made or submitted in
connection with the Transaction or any of the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. In addition, each party will provide the other party an
opportunity to review and comment on any communication given by it to a
Governmental Authority and, except as may be prohibited by any Governmental
Authority or by any Applicable Law, in connection with any such request,
inquiry, investigation, action or legal proceeding, each party hereto will

Governmental Authority with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement pursuant to the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Laws with respect to
which any such filings have been made, then such party shall use its
reasonable best efforts to make, or cause to be made, as soon as reasonably

sell, hold separate or otherwise dispose of or conduct their business in a
specified manner, or agree to sell, hold separate or otherwise dispose of or
conduct their businesses in a specified manner, or enter into or agree to
enter into a voting trust arrangement, proxy arrangement, "hold separate"
agreement or arrangement or similar agreement or arrangement with respect to
the assets, operations or conduct of their business in a specified manner, or

Parent, the Company or their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates or (ii)
contest, defend or appeal any Proceedings brought by a Governmental Authority,

prohibit the consummation of the Merger or seeking to compel any divestiture
by Parent, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries of shares of
capital stock or of any business, assets or property, or to impose any
limitation on the ability of any of them to conduct their businesses or to
own or exercise control of such assets, properties or stock to avoid or
eliminate any impediment under any Antitrust Law.

 

Section 7.02 Registration Statement; Prospectus/Proxy Statement.

 

(a) As promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement, Parent and
the Company shall prepare and cause to be filed with the SEC the
Prospectus/Proxy Statement and Parent shall prepare and cause to be filed with
the SEC the Registration Statement, in which the Prospectus/Proxy Statement
will be included as a prospectus. Each of Parent and the Company shall use all
reasonable efforts to cause the Registration Statement and the
Prospectus/Proxy Statement to comply with the rules and regulations
promulgated by the SEC, to respond promptly to any comments of the SEC or its
staff and to have the Registration Statement declared effective under the
Securities Act as promptly as practicable after it is filed with the SEC, and
to keep the Registration Statement effective as long as is necessary to
consummate the First Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby. The
Company will use all reasonable efforts to cause the Prospectus/Proxy
Statement to be mailed to the Companys stockholders as promptly as
practicable after the Registration Statement is declared effective under the
Securities Act. Each of Parent and the Company shall provide promptly to the
other such information concerning it, its holders of capital stock, its
business affairs and financial statements as, in the reasonable judgment of
the providing party or its counsel, may be required or appropriate for
inclusion in the Prospectus/Proxy Statement and the Registration Statement
pursuant to this Section 7.02, or in any amendments or supplements thereto,
and shall cause its counsel and auditors to cooperate with the others
counsel and auditors in the preparation of the Prospectus/Proxy Statement and
the Registration Statement.

(b) Each of Parent and the Company will notify the other promptly upon the
receipt of any comments from the SEC or its staff in connection with the
filing of, or amendments or supplements to, the Registration Statement and/or
the Prospectus/Proxy Statement. Parent shall



 

-69-  promptly inform the Company if, at any time prior to the Effective Time, any
event or circumstance relating to Parent, any Subsidiary of Parent or Merger
Sub, or any of their respective officers or directors, is discovered by
Parent that should be set forth in an amendment or a supplement to the
Prospectus/Proxy Statement or the Registration Statement. The Company shall
promptly inform Parent if, at any time prior to the Effective Time, any event
or circumstance relating to the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company, or
any of their respective officers or directors, is discovered by the Company
that should be set forth in an amendment or a supplement to the
Prospectus/Proxy Statement or the Registration Statement. Except in
connection with any Change of Board Recommendation (which Parent shall include
in the Prospectus/Proxy Statement at the Companys request) and other than
pursuant to Rule 425 of the Securities Act with respect to releases made in
compliance with Section 7.03 of this Agreement, no amendment or supplement to
the Prospectus/Proxy Statement or the Registration Statement, nor any response
to any comments or inquiry from the SEC with respect to such filings, will be
made by the Company or Parent without the approval of the other party, which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed (it being
understood that it shall be unreasonable to withhold consent with respect to
any amendment or supplement to the Prospectus/Proxy Statement or Registration
Statement to the extent such amendment or supplement is required to be
included therein so that the Prospectus/Proxy Statement or Registration
Statement will not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which
they are made, not misleading as may be required by Rule 10b-5 or Rule 14a9
under the Exchange Act or Section 11 or Section 12 of the Securities Act.) The
Company and Parent each will advise the other promptly after it receives
notice of the time when the Registration Statement has become effective or
any supplement or amendment has been filed, of the issuance of any stop order,
the suspension of the qualification of Parent Common Stock issuable in
connection with the First Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or
any request by the SEC for amendment of the Prospectus/Proxy Statement or the
Registration Statement or comments thereon and responses thereto or requests
by the SEC for additional information. Each of the parties hereto shall
cause the Prospectus/Proxy Statement and the Registration Statement to comply
as to form and substance as to such party in all material respects with the
applicable requirements of (i) the Exchange Act, (ii) the Securities Act,
and (iii) the rules and regulations of Nasdaq or the NYSE.

(c) Without limiting Parents obligations set forth in this Section 7.02,
prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to obtain all regulatory approvals needed to ensure that the Parent Common
Stock to be issued in the First Merger will be registered or qualified
under the securities law of every jurisdiction of the United States in which
any registered holder of Company Common Stock has an address of record on the
record date for determining the stockholders entitled to notice of and to vote
at the Company Stockholder Meeting; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent
shall not be required (i) to qualify to do business as a foreign corporation
in any jurisdiction in which it is not now qualified or (ii) to file a general
consent to service of process in any jurisdiction.

directly or indirectly in connection with Companys relationship with Parent
in any media interview, advertisement, news release, press release or
professional or trade publication, or in any print media, whether or not in

Section 7.04 Form S-8; ESPP; Assumption of Company Compensatory Awards and
Company Restricted Stock Awards.

3.06, Parent shall prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement on
Form S-8 with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable upon
exercise of the assumed Company Compensatory Awards promptly following the
Effective Time, but in no event later than 10 business days following
the Effective Time. The Company and its counsel shall cooperate with and
assist Parent in the preparation of such registration statement. For the
avoidance of doubt, the Form S-8 registration statement shall not cover any
Cashed Out Compensatory Awards. 

(b) The Company shall take such action as may be necessary to (i) establish a
New Exercise Date (as defined under the Company ESPP) on the last day of the
payroll period ending immediately prior to the Effective Time (but in all
events at least ten Business Days prior to the Effective Time) with respect to
the Offering Period (as defined in the Company ESPP) otherwise then in effect
(the " _Final Exercise Date_ "); (ii) provide that no further Offering Periods
shall commence under the Company ESPP on or following the Final Exercise Date;
and (iii) terminate the 



 

-71-  Company ESPP as of the Final Exercise Date, contingent upon the Effective
Time. Each outstanding option under the Company ESPP on the Final Exercise
Date shall be exercised on such date for the purchase of Company Common Stock
in accordance with the terms of the Company ESPP. The Company shall provide
timely notice of the setting of the Final Exercise Date and termination of the
Company ESPP in accordance with Section 18(c) of the Company ESPP.

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board (or, if appropriate, any
committee administering the Company Stock Plans) shall adopt such resolutions
that are necessary for the assumption and conversion of the Company
Compensatory Awards and Company Restricted Stock Awards and for the treatment
of Cashed Out Compensatory Awards as set forth in Section 3.06.

Section 7.05 Continuing Employee Compensation.

 

(a) For a period of at least one (1) year following the Effective Time, Parent
shall, or shall cause the Surviving Company to, compensate each Company
employee who continues his or her employment with Parent or the Surviving
Company following the Effective Time (a " _Continuing Employee_ ") with cash
compensation, including base salary rate and target bonus opportunity, on
terms in the aggregate no less favorable than the total cash compensation
opportunity provided to the Continuing Employee immediately prior to the
Effective Time. Nothing herein shall (i) require Parent to continue
the employment of any Continuing Employee or (ii) limit Parents ability and
discretion to change or amend the total cash compensation opportunity to which
a Continuing Employee may be entitled provided that, following such change
or amendment, the total cash compensation opportunity payable to such
Continuing Employee is on terms in the aggregate no less favorable than the
total cash compensation opportunity provided to the Continuing Employee
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(b) As of and following the Effective Time, Parent will either (a) continue
the Employee Plans, (b) permit Continuing Employees and, as applicable, their
eligible dependents, to participate in the employee benefit plans, programs or
policies (including without limitation any plan intended to qualify within the
meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code and any vacation, sick, per personal
time off plans or programs) of Parent, in each case on terms substantially no
less favorable in the aggregate than those provided to similarly situated
employees of Parent, including with respect to geographical location, or (c)
a combination of clauses (a) and (b).

(c) To the extent Parent elects to have Continuing Employees and their
eligible dependents participate in its employee benefit plans, program or
policies following the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Company to, treat, and cause the applicable benefit plans in which
Continuing Employees are entitled to participate to treat, the service of
Continuing Employees with the Company or any subsidiary of the Company (or any
predecessor or employer of a Continuing Employee of the Company or any Company
subsidiary, to the extent such service with such predecessor employer is
recognized by the Company or the applicable Company subsidiary) attributable
to any period before the Effective Time as service rendered to Parent, the
Surviving Company or any subsidiary of Parent for purposes of eligibility to
participate, level of benefits,



 

-72-  vesting and for other appropriate benefits including the applicability of
minimum waiting periods for participation, but excluding benefit accrual
(including minimum pension amount), and equity incentive plans or as would
otherwise result in a duplication of benefits.

(d) Without limiting the foregoing, with respect to Continuing Employees who
are employed by Parent or a Subsidiary of Parent in the United States, Parent
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause any pre-existing conditions
or (actively at work or similar) limitations, eligibility waiting periods,
evidence of insurability requirements or required physical examinations under
any health or similar plan of Parent to be waived with respect to Continuing
Employees and their eligible dependents; provided, however, that with
respect to preexisting conditions, such conditions shall be waived only to
the extent waived under the corresponding plan in which Continuing Employees
participated immediately prior to the date Continuing Employees and their
eligible dependents are transitioned to Parents health or similar plans.
With respect to Continuing Employees who are employed by Parent or a
subsidiary of Parent in the United States, Parent shall also use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause any deductibles paid by Continuing Employees
under any of Companys or its Subsidiaries health plans in the plan year in
which the Effective Time occurs to be credited towards deductibles under the
health plans of Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent. 

(e) Following the Closing, Parent shall adopt or shall cause to be adopted by
the Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent employing the Continuing Employees, a
policy consistent with the terms set forth on Schedule 7.05(f).

(f) The Company and Parent acknowledge and agree that all provisions
contained in this Section 7.05 with respect to employees are included for the
sole benefit of the respective parties and shall not create any right in any
other Person, including any employees, former employees, any participant in
any Employee Plans or any beneficiary thereof or any right to continued
employment with the Surviving Company, Parent or any Subsidiary of Surviving
Company or Parent, shall not be construed to establish, amend, or modify an
Employee Plan or any other benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement and
shall not require any Acquired Company, Parent, the Surviving Company or any
Subsidiary of an Acquired Company, Parent or the Surviving Company to
continue or amend any particular benefit plan after the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement for any employee or former
employee of an Acquired Company, and any such plan may be amended or
terminated in accordance with its terms and Applicable Law.

Section 7.06 Indemnification of Officers and Directors.

 

(a) Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to indemnification under any
Contracts existing as of the Effective Time between the Acquired Companies
and any of their respective current or former directors and officers and any
person who becomes a director or officer of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time (the " _Indemnified Persons_ ")
shall survive the Transaction and shall continue in full force and effect in
accordance with their terms following the Effective Time. Parent shall, and
shall cause the Surviving Company and its 



 

-73-  Subsidiaries to, honor and fulfill in all respects the obligations of the
Acquired Companies under any and such indemnification Contracts with the
Indemnified Persons. In addition, during the period commencing at the
Effective Time and ending on the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the
Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries shall (and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries to) cause the certificate
of incorporation and bylaws (and other similar organizational documents) of
the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries to contain provisions with respect
to indemnification, exculpation and the advancement of expenses, covering acts
and omissions of directors and officers (and any other employees or agents
who otherwise would be entitled to similar benefits thereunder pursuant to the
terms thereof in effect on the date hereof), in each case in their respective
capacities as such, occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, to the
fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law and during such six-year period,
such provisions shall not be repealed, amended or otherwise modified in any
manner except as required by applicable Law.

 

(b) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall obtain and fully pay for "tail"
insurance policies with a claims period of at least six years from the
Closing Date from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating
as the Companys current insurance carrier with respect to directors and
officers liability insurance in an amount and scope at least as favorable as
the Companys existing policies with respect to matters existing or occurring
at or prior to the Closing Date. In the event that the Company purchases such
a "tail" policy prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Company
shall maintain such "tail" policy in full force and effect and continue to
honor their respective obligations thereunder, for so long as such "tail"
policy shall be maintained in full force and effect. If for any reason such
"tail" policy is no longer effective or does not apply to any claim that would
be covered under the Companys directors and officers liability insurance
prior to the Effective Time, during the period commencing at the Effective
Time and ending on the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, Parent and the
Surviving Company shall maintain in effect a directors and officers
liability insurance (" _D andO Insurance_") in respect of acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, covering each person covered by
the Companys current directors and officers liability insurance policy, on
terms with respect to the coverage and amounts that are equivalent to those
of the Companys current directors and officers liability insurance policy;
_provided_ , _however_ , in satisfying its obligations under this Section
7.06(b), Parent and the Surviving Company shall not be obligated to pay
annual premiums in excess of 250% of the amount paid by the Company for
coverage for its last full fiscal year (such 250% amount, the " _Maximum
Annual Premium_ ") (which premiums the Company represents and warrants to be
as set forth in Section 7.06(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter), provided
that if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount,
Parent and the Surviving Company shall be obligated to obtain a policy with
the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding the Maximum Annual
Premium.

(c) If Parent or the Surviving Company or any of its successors or assigns
shall (i) consolidate with or merge into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or Surviving Company or entity of such consolidation or merger, or
(ii) transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
Person, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so that
the successors and assigns of the Surviving Company shall assume all of the
obligations of Parent and the Surviving Company set forth in this Section
7.06.



 

-74- (d) The obligations set forth in this Section 7.06 shall not be terminated,
amended or otherwise modified in any manner that adversely affects any
Indemnified Person (or any other person who is a beneficiary under the DandO
Insurance or the "tail" policy referred to in Section 7.06(b) (and their heirs
and representatives)) without the prior written consent of such affected
Indemnified Person or other person who is a beneficiary under the DandO
Insurance or the "tail" policy referred to in Section 7.06(b) (and their heirs
and representatives). The provisions of this Section 7.06 shall survive the
Closing and are intended to be for the benefit of, and enforceable by, each
Indemnified Person of the Company and his or her heirs and personal
representatives with full rights of enforcement as if a party hereto, and
nothing in this Agreement shall affect any indemnification rights that any
such current director or officer and his or her heirs and personal
representatives may have under the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of
the Company or any contract or Applicable Law.

Section 7.07 Letter of the Companys Accountants. The Company shall use all
reasonable efforts to cause to be delivered to Parent a letter of SingerLewak
LLP, dated no more than two business days before the date on which the
Registration Statement becomes effective (and reasonably satisfactory in form
and substance to Parent), that is customary in scope and substance for letters
delivered by independent public accountants in connection with registration
statements similar to the Registration Statement.

 

Section 7.08 Listing. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall use all
reasonable efforts to obtain authorization for listing on the New York Stock
Exchange of the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable and required to be
reserved for issuance in connection with the First Merger, subject to official
notice of issuance.

 

Section 7.09 Section 16 Matters. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall take such reasonable steps as are required to cause the disposition of
Company Common Stock and Company Options in connection with the First Merger
by each individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section
16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company to be exempt from
Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act pursuant to Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange
Act. If the Company delivers the Section 16 Information (as defined below) to
Parent at least 30 days prior to the Effective Time, then, prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall take such reasonable steps as are required to
cause the acquisition of Parent Common Stock, options to purchase shares of
Parent Common Stock in connection with the First Merger by each individual
who, immediately after the Effective Time, will become subject to the
reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to
Parent to be exempt from Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act pursuant to Rule
16b-3 under the Exchange Act. For purposes of this Section 7.09, " _Section
16 Information_" means the following information for each individual who,
immediately after the Effective Time, will become subject to the reporting
requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to Parent: (a)
the number of shares of Company Common Stock held by such individual and
expected to be exchanged for shares of Parent Common Stock in the First

expected to be converted into options to purchase shares of Parent Common
Stock in connection with the First Merger; and (c) the number of other
derivative securities (if any) with respect to Company Common Stock held by
such individual and



 

-75-  expected to be converted into shares of Parent Common Stock or derivative
securities with respect to Parent Common Stock in connection with the First
Merger.

 

Section 7.10 Board Composition. Parent shall appoint one member of the Company
Board of Directors who is not an employee of the Company, which individual
shall be mutually and reasonably agreed to by the parties, as a member of the
Parent Board of Directors effective as of the Effective Time.

 

Section 7.11 FIRPTA Certificate. If the Company Common Stock is not traded on
NASDAQ immediately before the Effective Time, at or prior to Closing, the
Company shall deliver to Parent an affidavit stating, under penalty of
perjury, that the Company is not, and has not been during the applicable
period described in Section 897(c)(1)(A)(ii) of the Code, a "United States
real property holding corporation", dated as of the Closing Date and in form
and substance as required under Treasury Regulation Section 1.897-2(h).

the other party of its rights under this Section 9.03, and (ii) such party

Company be required to pay the Company Termination Fee on more than one
occasion.

have any right or obligation hereunder (whether by virtue of any other oral
or written agreement or other communication). The exchange of a fully
executed Agreement (in counterparts or otherwise) by electronic transmission

with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including each of the
Exhibits, the Company Disclosure Schedule and the Parent Disclosure Schedule,
