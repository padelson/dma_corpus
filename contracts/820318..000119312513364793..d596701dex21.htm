Any amount by which the Closing Date Net Working Capital is less than the Net
Working Capital Target will reduce the Purchase Price, and any amount by which

5 CONFIDENTIAL

 



 

(c) The Purchaser will notify the Seller in writing of any objections to the
Sellers computation of Closing Date Net Working Capital within 15 calendar
days after the Purchaser receives the statement of Closing Date Net Working
Capital. If the Purchaser does not notify the Seller of any such objections by
the end of that 15-day period, then the Closing Date Net Working Capital will
be considered final at the end of the last day of that 15-day period. If the
Purchaser does notify the Seller of any such objections by the end of that
15-day period and the Purchaser and the Seller are unable to resolve their
differences within 15 calendar days thereafter, then the Purchaser and the
Seller will instruct their respective accountants to use commercially
reasonable efforts to resolve such disputed items to their
mutual satisfaction and to deliver a final Closing Date Net Working Capital
to the Purchaser and the Seller as soon as reasonably possible. If the
Purchasers accountants and the Sellers accountants are unable to resolve any
such disputed items within 15 calendar days after receiving such
instructions, then the remaining disputed items and the value attributable to
them by each of the Purchaser and the Seller will be submitted to a nationally
recognized accounting firm mutually agreed by the Purchaser and the Seller
(the " _Accounting Arbiter_ ") for resolution, and the Accounting Arbiter will
be instructed to determine the final Closing Date Net Working Capital to the
Purchaser and the Seller as soon as possible. The Accounting Arbiter will
consider only those items and amounts in the Purchasers and the Sellers
respective calculations of the Closing Date Net Working Capital that are
identified as being items and amounts to which the Purchaser and the Seller
have been unable to agree. In resolving any disputed item, the Accounting
Arbiter may not assign a value to any item greater than the greatest value for
such item claimed by either party or less than the smallest value for such
item claimed by either party. The Accounting Arbiters determination of the
Closing Date Net Working Capital will be based solely on the Audited Financial
Statements and the written materials submitted by the Purchaser and the Seller
(i.e., not on independent review) and on the definition of Net Working
Capital included herein. The determination of the Accounting Arbiter will be
final, conclusive and binding upon the parties hereto. Neither the Purchaser
nor the Seller will have any right to, and will not, institute any Proceeding
challenging such determination or with respect to the matters that are the
subject of this _Section 1.6_, except that the foregoing will not preclude a
Proceeding to enforce such determination. If the Accounting Arbiters
determination of Closing Date Net Working Capital is closer to the value
initially asserted by the Purchaser to the Accounting Arbiter, then the Seller
will pay the costs of the Accounting Arbiter. If the Accounting Arbiters
determination of Closing Date Net Working Capital is closer to the value
initially asserted by the Seller to the Accounting Arbiter, then the Purchaser
will pay the costs of the Accounting Arbiter. Each of the Seller and the
Purchaser and their respective Affiliates will cooperate with and assist the
Accounting Arbiter to determine the final Closing Date Net Working Capital,
including by making available and granting reasonable access to records and
employees. The terms of engagement of the Accounting Arbiter for the purposes
of this _Section 1.6(c)_ shall be such reasonable commercial terms as shall
be agreed between the Seller and the Purchaser consistently with the
provisions of this  _Section 1.6_. If the Seller and the Purchaser fail to
agree on terms of engagement for the Accounting Arbiter within 5 calendar
days, the Seller and the Purchaser agree that each of them will execute the
standard form of the Accounting Arbiters terms of engagement as proposed by
the Accounting Arbiter for its appointment.

(d) Within five (5) business days after the final determination of the
Closing Date Net Working Capital in accordance with this _Section 1.6_:

(i) if the Closing Date Net Working Capital is greater than the Net Working
Capital Target, the Purchaser will cause (X) the amount by which the Closing
Date Net Working Capital exceeds the Net Working Capital Target plus (Y) the
entire Working Capital Holdback Fund to be paid to the Seller by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by the
Seller; and

 



6 CONFIDENTIAL

 



 

(ii) if the Closing Date Net Working Capital is less than the Net Working
Capital Target: (A) the Purchaser shall retain from the Working Capital
Holdback Fund the amount by which the Net Working Capital Target exceeds the
Closing Date Net Working Capital (the " _Shortfall_ "), (B) if the amount of
the Shortfall is less than the Working Capital Holdback Fund, the Purchaser
shall cause the amount by which the Working Capital Holdback Fund exceeds the
Shortfall to be paid to the Seller by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to an account designated by the Seller, and (C) if the amount of the
Shortfall exceeds the amount of the Working Capital Holdback Fund, the Seller
will pay to the Purchaser the amount of the Shortfall that is in excess of the
Working Capital Holdback Fund by wire transfer of immediately available funds
to an account designed by the Purchaser.

1.7 Transfer Taxes. To the extent any sales (including bulk sales), value
added, use, transfer, ad valorem, privilege, gross receipts, registration,
conveyance, excise, license, goods and services, stamp or similar Taxes and
documentary charges, recording fees or other charges or fees that arise out
of, in connection with or are attributable to the sale of the Shares and the
Transferred Assets to the Purchaser or any of the other Transactions
(collectively, the " _Transfer Taxes_ ") are imposed, such Transfer Taxes
shall be the responsibility of, and timely paid by, both the Purchaser and
the Seller in equal proportions. Seller shall, at its own expense, timely file
any Tax Return or other document with respect to such Taxes or fees for the
Business operations prior to or in connection with the Closing (and Purchaser
shall cooperate with respect thereto as necessary). At the time any of the
Shenzhen Equipment is transferred, Seller will promptly pay (or cause to be
paid) all taxes and costs related to the transfer of such Shenzhen Equipment,
including without limitation any import customs duties, import-value-added
taxes, value-added taxes, stamp duties, business taxes and local surtaxes
(collectively, " _Shenzhen Transfer Taxes_ "); provided, that Purchaser or
one of its Affiliates shall promptly (upon receipt of written demand therefor)
reimburse Seller for any Shenzhen Transfer Taxes incurred by Seller up to an
amount of $1,000,000. Subject to the conditions set forth in the Bills of
Sale in respect of the Shenzhen Equipment, Seller will promptly pay (or cause
to be paid) all Shenzhen Transfer Taxes, if any, which exceed $1,000,000. The
Purchaser and the Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to minimize
Transfer Taxes, if any, arising out of or relating to the Transactions,
including by Purchaser accepting delivery of software assets located in the
State of California by electronic transmission from Sellers or Sellers
Affiliates place of business to Purchasers computers in accordance with
California Sales and Use Tax Regulation 1502(f)(1)(D), with Seller and its
Affiliates having no obligation to deliver any tangible assets in connection
with the delivery of such software.

 

1.8 Allocation. The Seller and the Purchaser shall cooperate in good faith to
reach an agreement as to the allocation of the Purchase Price attributable to
the Transferred Assets for U.S. federal income tax purposes in accordance with
Section 1060 of the Code and for tax purposes and Legal Requirements of other
applicable jurisdictions. If such agreement is achieved by the Seller, on the
one hand and the Purchaser, on the other hand, then the Seller and the
Purchaser shall, to the extent applicable, prepare and file Internal Revenue
Service Form 8594 on a basis consistent with such agreement and shall take no
contrary position except to the extent required by applicable Legal
Requirements. If such agreement is not achieved by the Seller, on the one hand
and the Purchaser, on the other hand, then the Seller and the Purchaser shall
allocate the Purchase Price attributable to the applicable Transferred Assets
in accordance with their separate determinations.

1.9 Closing. The closing of the sale of the Shares and the Transferred Assets
and the assumption of the Assumed Liabilities pursuant to this Agreement (the
" _Closing_ ") shall take place on the date of this Agreement and be held at
the offices of Sherrard, German and Kelly, P.C. in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, or
at such other time or place as Buyer and Sellers mutually agree in writing.
For

 



7 CONFIDENTIAL

 



 

 purposes of this Agreement, " _Closing Date_ " shall mean the date on which
the Closing actually takes place.

 

1.10 Third Party Consents. To the extent that rights of Seller or any
Affiliate of Seller under any Contract or Governmental Authorization
constituting a Transferred Asset, may not be assigned to Purchaser without the
consent of another Person which has not been obtained, this Agreement shall
not constitute an agreement to assign the same if an attempted assignment
would constitute a breach thereof or be unlawful, and Seller or its Affiliate
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any such required
consent(s) as promptly as possible. The expenses incurred by Seller and its
Affiliate(s) to obtain any such consent(s) shall be borne by Seller. If any
such consent shall not be obtained or if any attempted assignment would be
ineffective or would impair Purchaser or its Affiliates rights under the
Transferred Asset in question so that Purchaser or an Affiliate of Purchaser
would not in effect acquire the benefit of all such rights, Seller shall (or
cause its Affiliate to), to the maximum extent permitted by Legal Requirement
and the Transferred Asset, (i) act after the Closing as Purchasers agent in
order to obtain for it the benefits thereunder; and (ii) cooperate with the
Purchaser in any other reasonable arrangement designed to provide such
benefits to Purchaser or its Affiliate; _provided_ , _that_ to the extent
such benefits are provided to Purchaser or any Affiliate of Purchaser,
Purchaser shall be responsible for all corresponding Liabilities arising after
the Closing but only to the extent that such Liabilities do not relate to any
failure to perform, improper performance, warranty or other breach, default
or violation by Seller or an Affiliate of Seller on or prior to the Closing.

 

1.11 Shenzhen Equipment. All of the Shenzhen Equipment, including record title
thereto, free and clear of any Encumbrance, will be transferred after the
Closing Date as provided in the Bills of Sale with respect to the Shenzhen
Equipment (which shall be in form and substance mutually agreeable to the
Purchaser and the Seller). " _Shenzhen Equipment_ " shall mean the
Transferred Equipment located in Shenzhen, Peoples Republic of China.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parties acknowledge that the purchase price
allocated to the Shenzhen Equipment is being paid in full by the Purchaser on
the Closing Date and the Seller and its Affiliates have conveyed equitable
title pursuant to this Agreement.

applicable laws or regulations, but save in the event of fraud, the Purchaser
agrees that, following the date of this Agreement, it will have no right
(including any right under common law) to terminate or rescind this Agreement
and will not be entitled to treat the Seller as having repudiated this
Agreement.

 

(c) The only remedy of the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates for or in
respect of any claim hereunder will be damages for breach of contract and the
Purchaser for itself and on behalf of each of its Affiliates, waives any other
remedy that it might but for this clause have in respect of any claim
hereunder (whether in tort or otherwise), including under the
Misrepresentation Act 1967. 

8.6 Holdback. A Purchaser Indemnitee shall be paid from the Indemnification
Holdback Fund the amount of any Damage for which it has been finally
determined in accordance with _Part 10.9(d)_ of the Disclosure Letter that
such Purchaser Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification pursuant to this
_Section _8, promptly after such final determination. So long as any of the
Indemnification Holdback Amount remains in the Indemnification Holdback Fund,
the Indemnification Holdback Fund shall be the sole source of recovery for any
Damage incurred by a Purchaser Indemnitee under _Section 8.2_ of
this Agreement. The period during which claims for indemnification from the
Indemnification Holdback Fund may be initiated shall commence on the Closing
Date and terminate at 5:00 p.m., Pacific Time, on December 31, 2014 (the "
_Indemnification Holdback Claim Period_ "). Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, on the date of expiration of the Indemnification
Holdback Claim Period, such portion of the Indemnification Holdback Fund as
may be necessary, in the reasonable judgment of Purchaser, to satisfy any
then unresolved or unsatisfied claims for Damages (to the extent specified in
any Claims Notice delivered to the Seller pursuant to _Section 8.2_ prior to
the expiration of the Indemnification Holdback Claim Period) shall remain in
the Indemnification Holdback Fund until such claims for Damages have been
resolved or satisfied in accordance with this _Section 8_. Within three
business days

 after the date of expiration of the Indemnification Holdback Claim Period,
the Indemnification Holdback Fund, less any amount determined pursuant to the
previous sentence, shall be paid by the Purchaser to the Seller.

8.7 Defense of Third Party Claims. In the event of the assertion or
commencement by any Person of any Proceeding with respect to which any
Indemnitee may be entitled to indemnification pursuant to this _Section 8_,
the Indemnitor shall have the right, at its election, to proceed with the
defense (including settlement or compromise) of such Proceeding on its own
with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnitee; _provided, however,_
that the Indemnitor may not settle or compromise any such Proceeding without
the prior written consent of the Indemnitee. The Indemnitee shall give the
Indemnitor prompt notice after it becomes aware of the commencement of any
such Proceeding against the Indemnitee; _provided, however,_ any failure on
the part of the Indemnitee to so notify the Indemnitor shall not limit any of
the obligations of the Indemnitor, or any of the rights of the Indemnitee,
under this _Section 8_ (except to the extent such failure prejudices the
defense of such Proceeding). If the Indemnitor elects to assume and control
the defense of any such Proceeding: (a) at the request of the Indemnitor, the
Indemnitee shall make available to the Indemnitor any material documents and
materials in the possession of the Indemnitee that may be necessary to the
defense of such Proceeding; (b) the Indemnitor shall keep the Indemnitee
reasonably informed of all material developments relating to such Proceeding;
and (c) the Indemnitee shall have the right to participate in the defense of
such Proceeding at its own expense. If the Indemnitor does not elect to
proceed with the defense of any such Proceeding, the Indemnitee may proceed
with the defense of such Proceeding with counsel of its own choice.

 

8.8 _Contract (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999_. Each Indemnitee shall have

in which any Transferred Employee will be eligible to participate following
Closing, including but not limited to, the Sellers and its Affiliates
applicable welfare benefit plans, employee pension plans, vacation,
disability, sick leave, paid time off and severance benefit plans, programs
and arrangements.

For purposes of this Agreement, the portion of any Taxes for a Straddle
Period that are allocable to the Pre-Closing Period shall be:

be payable if the taxable year or period ended on the Closing Date.

documentation that may be necessary to enable the other to comply with any

Transactions.

(b) After the Closing, if the Seller or any Affiliate of the Seller receives
any payment, refund or other amount that is a Transferred Asset or is
otherwise properly due and owing to the Purchaser or any Affiliate of the
Purchaser in connection with the Transactions, the Seller shall promptly
remit or shall cause to be remitted such amount to the Purchaser or to such
Affiliate of the Purchaser. After the Closing, if the Purchaser or any
Affiliate of the Purchaser receives any payment, refund or other amount that
is properly due and owing to the Seller or any Affiliate of the Seller in

jurisdiction of the courts of England and Wales in connection with any such
Proceeding; 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (ii) | irrevocably agrees that the courts of England and Wales
will have exclusive jurisdiction in relation to any claim, dispute or

---|---|--- 

A judgment, order or decision of the courts of England and Wales in respect of
any such Proceeding or dispute may be recognized or enforced by any courts of

such other state); and/or

 

(ii) any relief or remedy which, if it (or its equivalent) were granted by the
courts of England and Wales, would not be enforceable in such other state.

10.10 Successors and Assigns; Parties in Interest. 

(a) This Agreement shall be binding upon: the Seller and its successors and
assigns (if any); and the Purchaser and its successors and assigns (if any).

of this Agreement is intended to provide any rights or remedies to any Person
other than the parties to this Agreement and their respective successors and

10.12 Waiver. No failure on the part of any Person to exercise any power,
right, privilege or remedy under this Agreement, and no delay on the part of
any Person in exercising any power, right, privilege or remedy under this
Agreement, shall operate as a waiver of such power, right, privilege or
remedy; and no single or partial exercise of any such power, right, privilege
or remedy shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof or of any
other power, right, privilege or remedy. No Person shall be

 



45 CONFIDENTIAL

 



 

 deemed to have waived any claim arising out of this Agreement, or any power,
right, privilege or remedy under this Agreement, unless the waiver of such
claim, power, right, privilege or remedy is expressly set forth in a written
instrument duly executed and delivered on behalf of such Person; and any such
waiver shall not be applicable or have any effect except in the specific
instance in which it is given.

supplemented other than by means of a written instrument duly executed and

_Section 8_ or otherwise expressly provided for in this Agreement, the
Parties do not intend that any term of this Agreement is enforceable under
the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 by a person who is not a
party to this Agreement and the consent of any person who is not a party to
this Agreement shall not be required for the amendment, variation, rescission
or termination of the same, but this does not affect any right or remedy of a
third party which exists or is available apart from that Act.

10.14 Severability. In the event that any provision of this Agreement, or the
application of any such provision to any Person or set of circumstances, shall
be determined to be invalid, unlawful, void or unenforceable to any extent it
shall to that extent be deemed not to form part of this Agreement but, the
remainder of this Agreement, and the application of such provision to Persons
or circumstances other than those as to which it is determined to be invalid,
unlawful, void or unenforceable, shall not be impaired or otherwise affected
and shall continue to be valid and enforceable to the fullest extent permitted
by any Legal Requirements. Without limiting the foregoing, if, at the time of
enforcement of the covenants contained in Sections 4.3 and 4.10 (the
"Restrictive Covenants"), a court shall hold that the duration, scope or area
restrictions stated herein are unreasonable under circumstances then existing,
the Parties agree that the maximum duration, scope or area reasonable under
such circumstances shall be substituted for the stated duration, scope or area
and that the court shall be allowed and directed to revise the restrictions
contained herein to cover the maximum period, scope and area permitted by
Legal Requirements.

10.15 Entire Agreement. The Transactional Agreements and the NDA set forth the
entire understanding of the parties relating to the subject matter thereof
and supersede all prior agreements and understandings among or between any of
the parties relating to the subject matter thereof.

 

10.16 Disclosure Letter. The Disclosure Letter shall be arranged in separate
parts corresponding to the numbered and lettered sections contained herein;
_provided, however_ , that any information disclosed in any numbered or
lettered part shall be deemed to relate to and to qualify any other
representation or warranty or numbered or lettered section where such
disclosure would reasonably be deemed to apply.
