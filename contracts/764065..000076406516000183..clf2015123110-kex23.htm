ARTICLE II.

PURCHASE AND SALE; CONSIDERATION; CLOSING



Section 2.1 Purchase and Sale. On the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, at the Closing, Seller shall sell to Purchaser, and
Purchaser shall purchase from Seller, all of the right, title and interest of
Seller in and to the Units, free and clear of all Liens.



Section 2.2 Consideration. Purchaser shall, as consideration for the Units,
subject to adjustment after Closing in accordance with the terms of Section
2.3, (a) assume the Liabilities of CNAC and the Companies and (b) enter into
the Override Right Agreement in favor of Seller (as so adjusted, the
"Consideration"). 



Section 2.3 Adjustments to Consideration. All adjustments to the Consideration
shall be determined and (if applicable) paid as set forth in this Section 2.3.

(a)The Consideration shall be increased by the amount, if any, by which the
Specified Current Assets are greater than the Specified Current Liabilities
(such excess amount, if any, the "Specified Net Current Asset Difference").

(b)Within 90 days after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall prepare and deliver
to Parent Purchaser's calculation of the Specified Current Assets and the
Specified Current Liabilities (such delivery, the "Purchaser Calculation").
Without limiting any other obligation of Parent or Seller under this
Agreement, Parent and Seller will make available or cause to be made available
to Purchaser and its Representatives upon reasonable notice and at reasonable
times all personnel and information necessary to assist Purchaser and its
Representatives in connection with the preparation of the Purchaser
Calculation. Parent shall have 45 days from the date Purchaser delivers the
Purchaser Calculation to Parent (such period, the "Dispute Period") to notify
Purchaser, in writing, as to whether Parent agrees or disagrees with the
Purchaser Calculation, which such notice shall identify in reasonable detail
those items and amounts to which Parent objects, the reasons therefor and
Parent's proposed calculation of the Specified Current Assets and the
Specified Current Liabilities and the portion, if any, of the Purchaser
Calculation that Parent does not dispute (such written notice, the "Dispute
Notice"). During the Dispute Period, Parent and its accountants shall be
permitted to review (during regular business hours and upon reasonable prior
notice) the working papers of Purchaser and (where applicable) Purchaser's
accountants to the extent relating to the matters set forth in the Purchaser
Calculation, in each case as is reasonably requested in writing by Parent. If
Parent fails to deliver a Dispute Notice to Purchaser during the Dispute
Period, Purchaser's calculation of the Specified Current Assets and the
Specified Current Liabilities shall be deemed to be final and correct and
shall be binding upon all parties. If Parent delivers a Dispute Notice to
Purchaser with respect to some, but not all, of the amounts or items included
in the Purchaser Calculation during the Dispute Period, then Parent shall be
deemed to have agreed with Purchaser's calculations of all amounts set forth
in such Purchaser Calculation that were not disputed in such duly and timely
delivered Dispute Notice.

(c)If Parent delivers a Dispute Notice to Purchaser during the Dispute Period,
Parent and Purchaser shall, for a period of 30 days from the date the Dispute
Notice is delivered to Purchaser (such period, the "Resolution Period"),
negotiate in good faith and use commercially reasonable efforts to amicably
resolve the items in dispute. Any items so resolved shall be deemed to be
final and correct as so resolved and shall be binding upon each of the parties
hereto.

(d)If Parent and Purchaser are unable in good faith to resolve all of the
items in dispute during the Resolution Period, then, upon the expiration of
the Resolution Period or such earlier date as Purchaser and Parent mutually
agree, either Purchaser or Parent may refer the items remaining in dispute in
writing to the Independent Accounting Firm and shall deliver to the
Independent Accounting Firm, at the time of such referral, the Purchaser
Calculation and the Dispute Notice. Within five Business Days after referral
of the matter to the Independent Accounting Firm, Purchaser and Parent shall
agree on the procedures to be followed by the Independent Accounting Firm
(including procedures with regard to presentation of evidence). Such
procedures shall not alter the accounting policies, practices and principles
to be applied to the calculation of the Specified Current Assets and the
Specified Current Liabilities, which will be those required by this Agreement.
If Purchaser and Parent are unable to agree upon such procedures before the
end of five Business Days after referral of the dispute to the Independent
Accounting Firm, the Independent Accounting Firm shall establish such
procedures giving due regard to the intention of Purchaser and Parent to
resolve disputes as quickly, efficiently and inexpensively as possible, which
procedures may be, but need not be, those proposed by Purchaser or Parent. The
parties shall also furnish the Independent Accounting Firm with such other
information and documents as the Independent Accounting Firm may reasonably
request in order for it to resolve the items in dispute. Parent and Purchaser
shall also, within 20 days of the date the items in dispute are referred to
the Independent Accounting Firm, provide the Independent Accounting Firm with
a written statement (a "Position Statement") describing in reasonable detail
their respective positions on the items in dispute (copies of which will be
provided by the Independent Accounting Firm to the other party after such
time, if any, that both parties have delivered a Position Statement to the
Independent Accounting Firm). If any party fails to timely deliver its
Position Statement to the Independent Accounting Firm, the Independent
Accounting Firm shall resolve the items in dispute solely upon the basis of
the information otherwise provided to it. The Independent Accounting Firm
shall resolve all disputed items in a written determination to be delivered to
Purchaser and Parent within 30 days after such matter is referred to it;
provided, however, that any delay in delivering such determination shall not
invalidate such determination or deprive the Independent Accounting Firm of
jurisdiction to resolve the items in dispute; provided, further, that, in
resolving any disputed item, the Independent 

Accounting Firm shall adhere to the definitions contained in this Agreement
and the practices and other principles referred to herein. In no event shall
the Independent Accounting Firm assign a value to the Specified Net Current
Asset Difference that is greater than the highest or less than the lowest
calculation thereof proposed by Purchaser in the Purchaser Calculation and
Parent in the Dispute Notice. The decision of the Independent Accounting Firm,
acting as an expert and not as an arbitrator, shall be final and binding upon
the parties hereto and shall not be subject to judicial review. The fees and
expenses of the Independent Accounting Firm shall be borne by Parent, on the
one hand, and Purchaser, on the other hand, in equal portions, unless the
Independent Accounting Firm decides, based on its determination with respect
to the reasonableness of the respective positions of the parties, that the
fees and expenses shall be borne in unequal proportions.

(e)Within seven days after the final determination of the Specified Current
Assets and the Specified Current Liabilities and the calculation of any
Specified Net Current Asset Difference (whether through failure of Parent to
timely deliver a Dispute Notice, agreement of the parties or determination of
the Independent Accounting Firm), if there is a positive Specified Net Current
Asset Difference, then Purchaser shall pay such Specified Net Current Asset
Difference to Seller in immediately available funds via wire transfer (in
which case there shall be an immediate upward adjustment of the Consideration
in such amount); provided, however, that Purchaser shall pay any portion of
such Specified Net Current Asset Difference (i) not earlier than the final
determination of such Specified Net Current Asset Difference, (ii) only after
such time that CNAC and its Subsidiaries have received payment of trade
accounts receivable of CNAC and its Subsidiaries reflected in the Specified
Current Assets up to the dollar amount whereby the Specified Net Current Asset
Difference would have been zero (such dollar amount, the "Base Receivables")
and (iii) once the threshold in Section 2.3(e)(ii) is met, only as and when
(and to the extent) CNAC and its Subsidiaries have received payment of trade
accounts receivable of CNAC and its Subsidiaries reflected in the Specified
Current Assets in an amount exceeding the Base Receivables (such amount
exceeding the Base Receivables, the "Collected Receivables"). In order to
effectuate the payment of any Specified Net Current Asset Difference,
Purchaser agrees (A) to use efforts to collect such Collected Receivables that
are not materially less than the efforts it otherwise employs to collect the
Base Receivables or other trade accounts receivable of the Business, (B) that,
with respect to any amounts collected by CNAC and its Subsidiaries from any
payor that has trade accounts receivable reflected in the Specified Current
Assets, for purposes of this Section 2.3, such amounts shall, unless otherwise
expressly provided by the payor, be attributable to the Specified Current
Assets prior to being attributed to any trade accounts receivable that are not
Specified Current Assets, (C) to remit to Seller, on a weekly basis commencing
the week following the final determination of any Specified Net Current Asset
Difference, the amount of the Base Receivables and the Collected Receivables,
and (D) to provide to Seller, concurrent with any such remittance of Collected
Receivables, a list setting forth in respect of such Collected Receivables (x)
the payor of each portion of such Collected Receivables and (y) the amount of
Collected Receivables paid by each such payor.

(f)The dispute resolution procedures set forth in this Section 2.3 are the
sole and exclusive means and remedy for determining and calculating the
Specified Current Assets, the Specified Current Liabilities and any Specified
Net Current Asset Difference and the components thereof, other than in the
event of fraud or willful misconduct, in which case the aggrieved party shall
be entitled to such other rights and remedies as are permitted by applicable
Law.



Section 2.4 Allocation of Consideration. Purchaser and Parent shall mutually
agree in good faith upon an allocation of the Consideration and other
consideration (including any Liabilities treated as assumed for Tax purposes),
if any, among the assets of CNAC and its Subsidiaries in accordance with the
U.S. Treasury regulations promulgated under Section 1060 of the Code;
provided, however, that if Purchaser and Parent are unable to agree upon such
allocation within 30 days after the final determination of the Consideration
pursuant to Section 2.3, such allocation shall be determined by the
Independent Accounting Firm, with such determination being binding on the
parties hereto, in which case the costs, fees and expenses of the Independent
Accounting Firm in connection therewith shall be borne equally by Purchaser
and Parent. Parent and Purchaser shall act in accordance with the allocation
determined pursuant to this Section 2.4, whether through mutual agreement or
determination by the Independent Accounting Firm, in the preparation and
filing of any Tax Return and in all communications with any Governmental
Authority relating to Taxes.



Section 2.5 Closing. The closing of the transactions contemplated hereby (the
"Closing") will take place effective as of the close of business on the
Closing Date (New York City time) on the date hereof. At the Closing, there
shall be delivered to Seller and Purchaser, as applicable, the documents to be
delivered pursuant to Article VII. 



ARTICLE III.

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES RELATING TO PARENT AND SELLER

Each of Parent and Seller, jointly and severally, represents and warrants to
Purchaser as follows:



Section 3.1 Organization and Authority. Each of Parent and Seller is a
corporation or limited liability company, respectively, duly incorporated or
formed, respectively, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of
the State of Ohio or the State of Delaware, respectively. Each of Parent and
Seller has the full legal right and power and all authority required by Law to
enter into this Agreement, to carry out its obligations hereunder and to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been duly
authorized, executed and delivered by or on behalf of Parent and Seller, and
(assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by Purchaser) this
Agreement constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of each of
Parent and Seller, enforceable against each in accordance with its terms,
subject to the effect of any applicable bankruptcy, reorganization,
insolvency, moratorium, fraudulent conveyance or similar Laws affecting
creditors' rights generally and subject, as to enforceability, to the effect
of general principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is
considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).



Section 3.2 No Conflict. Assuming all consents, approvals, authorizations and
other actions described in Section 3.3 have been obtained, and except as may
result from any facts or circumstances relating solely to Purchaser, the
execution and delivery of and performance of obligations under this Agreement
by each of Parent and Seller and the consummation by each of Parent and Seller
of the transactions contemplated hereby do not and will not violate or
conflict with the organizational documents of Parent or Seller or any Law
applicable to Parent or Seller, except for any such violations or conflicts of
any Law as would not materially delay the ability of Parent or Seller to
perform its respective material obligations under this Agreement or consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby.



Section 3.3 Consents and Approvals. Except as set forth in Section 3.3 of the
Disclosure Schedule, the execution and delivery of this Agreement by each of
Parent and Seller do not, and the performance by each of Parent and Seller of
its obligations hereunder will not, require any consent, approval,
authorization or other action by, or filing with or notification to, any
Governmental Authority or other Person, except (a) where failure to obtain
such consent, approval, authorization or action, or to make such filing or
notification, would not prevent Parent or Seller from performing any of its
respective material obligations under this Agreement or consummating the
transactions contemplated hereby or (b) as may be necessary as a result of any
facts or circumstances relating solely to Purchaser.



Section 3.4 Ownership of the Units. Seller is the lawful owner of the Units.
Upon the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, Purchaser will
acquire title to the Units being sold by Seller, free and clear of all Liens.
The Units are uncertificated.



Section 3.5 Legal Proceedings. There are no Actions pending or, to the
Knowledge of Parent, threatened against, relating to or affecting Parent or
Seller that would reasonably be expected to result in the issuance of a
Governmental Order restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting or making
illegal the consummation of any of the transactions contemplated hereby.



Section 3.6 Permitting. None of Parent, Seller, CNAC, any Subsidiary of CNAC
or any Person that, together with any Affiliate of Parent, Seller, CNAC or any
Subsidiary of CNAC, owns 10% or more of the equity interests of Parent,
Seller, CNAC or any Subsidiary of CNAC has been subject to any bond
forfeiture, permit suspension or revocation instituted by any Governmental
Authority that would prohibit the transfer of any Environmental Authorizations
to Purchaser. None of Parent, Seller, CNAC, any Subsidiary of CNAC or any
Person "owned or controlled" by Parent, Seller, CNAC, any Subsidiary of CNAC
has been notified by the Federal Office of Surface Mining or the agency of any
state administering the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act (or any
comparable state statute) that it is currently (a) ineligible to receive
additional surface mining permits or (b) under investigation to determine
whether its eligibility to receive such permits should be revoked, i.e.,
"permit blocked". 



ARTICLE IV.

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES RELATING TO CNAC AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES

Each of Parent and Seller, jointly and severally, represents and warrants to
Purchaser as follows:



Section 4.1 Organization and Authority. CNAC is a limited liability company
duly formed, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the State
of Delaware and has full limited liability company power and authority to
conduct its business as and to the extent now conducted and to own, use and
lease its assets and properties. CNAC is duly qualified, licensed or admitted
to do business and is in good standing in those jurisdictions set forth in
Section 4.1 of the Disclosure Schedule, which are the only jurisdictions in
which the ownership, use or leasing of its assets and properties, or the
conduct or nature of its business, makes such qualification, licensing or
admission necessary, except for those jurisdictions in which the failure by
CNAC to be so qualified, licensed or admitted and in good standing would not
have a Material Adverse Effect.



Section 4.2 Subsidiaries. Each Subsidiary of CNAC and each such Subsidiary's
jurisdiction of formation is set forth in Section 4.2(a) of the Disclosure
Schedule. Each Subsidiary of CNAC is a limited liability company duly formed,
validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of its jurisdiction of
formation and has full limited liability company power and authority to
conduct its business as and to the extent now conducted and to own, use and
lease its assets and properties. Each Subsidiary of CNAC is duly qualified,
licensed or admitted to do business and is in good standing in those
jurisdictions set forth in Section 4.2(b) of the Disclosure Schedule, which
are the only jurisdictions in which the ownership, use or leasing of its
assets and properties, or the conduct or nature of its business, makes such
qualification, licensing or admission necessary, except for those
jurisdictions in which the failure by such Subsidiary to be so qualified,
licensed or admitted and in good standing would not have a Material Adverse
Effect. All of the outstanding equity interests or other voting securities of
each Subsidiary of CNAC are owned directly by CNAC free and clear of all
Liens. Other than the Companies, CNAC does not own, directly or indirectly,
any equity interest in any Person, nor is CNAC a partner or member of any
partnership, limited liability company or joint venture. Beard Pinnacle's
assets were sold in 2008 such that the operations of Beard Pinnacle have
ceased and it no longer is a going concern.



Section 4.3 No Conflict. Assuming all consents, approvals, authorizations and
other actions described in Section 3.3 have been obtained, and except as set
forth in Section 4.3 of the Disclosure Schedule or as may result from any
facts or circumstances relating solely to Purchaser, the execution and
delivery of and performance of obligations under this Agreement by each of
Parent and Seller and the consummation by each of Parent and Seller of the
transactions contemplated hereby do not and will not (a) violate or conflict
with the certificate of formation (or equivalent) or limited liability company
agreement (or equivalent) of CNAC or any Subsidiary of CNAC, (b) violate or
conflict with any Law applicable to CNAC or any Subsidiary of CNAC or (c)
result in any material breach of, or constitute a material default (or event
that with the giving of notice or lapse of time, or both, would become a
material default) under, or give to any Person any rights of termination,
amendment, acceleration or cancellation of, or result in the creation of any
Lien (other than a Permitted Lien) on any of the assets or properties of CNAC
or any Subsidiary of CNAC pursuant to, any Contract to which CNAC or any
Subsidiary of CNAC is a party or by which any of their respective assets or
properties are bound.



Section 4.4 Capitalization. Section 4.4 of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth
the entire authorized equity interests of CNAC and the total percentage of
issued and outstanding limited liability company units, all of which are
owned, of record and beneficially, by Seller. The Units are validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable, and none of the Units are subject to any
preemptive rights. There are no outstanding options, warrants, calls, rights
or other Contracts or instruments of any character (including any member,
limited liability company or operating agreement, buy-sell agreement or other
similar agreement) requiring, and there are no securities of CNAC outstanding
that upon conversion or exchange would require, the issuance, sale or transfer
of any additional membership interests, units or other equity securities of
CNAC or other securities convertible into, exchangeable for or evidencing the
right to subscribe for or purchase membership interests, units or other equity
securities of CNAC. None of the Units were issued, or, since issuance, have
been transferred, in violation of Law or Contract, including any preemptive
right, right of first refusal or other similar right of any Person. There are
no restrictions on the transfer of the Units as contemplated in this
Agreement. 



Section 4.5 Financial Statements and Condition; No Undisclosed Liabilities;
Absence of Certain Facts or Events.

(a)Prior to the execution of this Agreement, Parent has made available to
Purchaser copies of the unaudited consolidated balance sheets of the Business
as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 and the related unaudited consolidated
statements of income for the years then ended (the "Financial Statements").
Except as set forth in the notes thereto, the Financial Statements have been
prepared in accordance with GAAP consistently applied throughout the periods
indicated and present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
financial position (and changes in financial position, if any) of the Business
as of the dates and for the periods referred to therein, all in accordance
with GAAP.

(b)Prior to the execution of this Agreement, Parent has made available to
Purchaser copies of the unaudited consolidated balance sheet of the Business
as of November 30, 2015 (the "Interim Balance Sheet") and the related
unaudited consolidated statements of income for the eleven-month period then
ended (the "Interim Financial Statements"). Subject to normal (as to type and
amount) year-end adjustments and the absence of disclosure normally made in
footnotes, the Interim Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance
with GAAP consistently applied throughout the periods indicated and present
fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position (and
changes in financial position, if any) of the Business as of the date and for
the period referred to therein, all in accordance with GAAP.

(c)Except as set forth in Section 4.5(c) of the Disclosure Schedule and except
for the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the transactions to take
place pursuant hereto on or prior to the Closing Date, since September 30,
2015, the Business has been operated in all material respects in the ordinary
course and there has not been any Material Adverse Effect.

(d)Except as set forth in Section 4.5(d) of the Disclosure Schedule or in the
Interim Financial Statements, neither CNAC nor any of its Subsidiaries had at
the date of the Interim Financial Statements, or since that date has incurred,
any Liabilities of any nature, whether absolute, accrued, contingent or
otherwise and whether due or to become due, except Liabilities:

(i)that are accrued or reserved against in the Interim Financial Statements or
reflected in the notes thereto;

(ii)that were incurred after the date of the Interim Financial Statements in
the ordinary course of business;

(iii)that have been fully discharged or paid before the date of this
Agreement; or

(iv)that, in the aggregate, would not have a Material Adverse Effect.



Section 4.6 Absence of Litigation. Except as set forth in Section 4.6 of the
Disclosure Schedule, as of the date hereof, (a) there are no Actions pending
or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened against CNAC or any Subsidiary of
CNAC or any of their respective assets or properties that would have a
Material Adverse Effect or would prevent Parent or Seller from consummating
the transactions contemplated hereby and (b) none of CNAC, any Subsidiary of
CNAC or any of their respective assets or properties are subject to any
outstanding Governmental Order. None of the Actions or Governmental Orders set
forth in Section 4.6 of the Disclosure Schedule are reasonably likely to
prevent Parent or Seller from consummating the transactions contemplated
hereby.



Section 4.7 Compliance with Laws. Except as set forth in Section 4.7 of the
Disclosure Schedule or for Environmental Laws (which are addressed in Section
4.12) or for Employment and Labor Laws (which are addressed in Section 4.14),
the Business is currently being operated in compliance in all material
respects with all currently applicable Laws that apply to the Business, and no
written or oral notice, charge, claim, Action or assertion has been received
by Parent, Seller, CNAC or any Subsidiary of CNAC or, to the Knowledge of
Parent, has been filed, commenced or threatened against CNAC or any Subsidiary
of CNAC alleging any violation of any of the foregoing, in each case except
(a) for citations issued by the Mine Safety and Health Administration or any
similar state regulatory agency that can be reasonably abated without material
cost or expense to CNAC or any of its Subsidiaries in the ordinary course 

of CNAC's and its Subsidiaries' continuing operations or (b) for violations
the existence of which would not have a Material Adverse Effect.



Section 4.8 Material Contracts.

(a)Section 4.8 of the Disclosure Schedule contains a list of each of the
following Contracts (other than the Leases) to which CNAC or a Subsidiary of
CNAC is a party:

(i)all Contracts (other than the Employee Plans) providing for a commitment of
employment or consultation services;

(ii)all Contracts with any Person containing any provision or covenant
prohibiting or limiting the ability of CNAC or a Subsidiary of CNAC to engage
in any business activity or compete with any Person or prohibiting or limiting
the ability of any Person to compete with CNAC or a Subsidiary of CNAC (other
than restrictions on other parties pursuant to agreements pertaining to
Business Combinations or acquisitions);

(iii)all partnership, joint venture, shareholders' or other similar Contracts
with any Person;

(iv)all Contracts relating to Indebtedness of CNAC or a Subsidiary of CNAC;

(v)all Contracts granting any right of first refusal or right of first offer
or similar right or that materially limit or purport to materially limit the
ability of CNAC or any Subsidiary of CNAC to own, operate, sell, transfer,
pledge or otherwise dispose of the properties or assets of its business;

(vi)all material Contracts providing for the indemnification by CNAC or any
Subsidiary of CNAC of any Person in connection with the Business;

(vii)all Contracts providing for any payments by CNAC or any Subsidiary of
CNAC that are conditioned, in whole or in part, on a Change of Control of CNAC
or any of its Subsidiaries or transactions of the type contemplated hereby;

(viii)any collective bargaining agreement;

(ix)any employment agreement with, or any agreement or arrangement that
contains any guaranteed compensation, equity commitments, commission or other
production bonuses, severance pay or post-employment liabilities or
obligations (other than as required by Law) to, any current or former
employees, non-employee directors or officers or other Persons that have
performed or are performing consulting or other independent contractor
services for CNAC or any Subsidiary of CNAC;

(x)any Contract with an Interested Party; and

(xi)all other Contracts (other than the Employee Plans) that require the
payment pursuant to the terms of any such Contract by or to CNAC or a
Subsidiary of CNAC of more than $1,000,000.

(b)Each Contract required to be disclosed in Section 4.8 of the Disclosure
Schedule is in full force and effect and constitutes a legal, valid and
binding agreement, enforceable, in all material respects, in accordance with
its terms, of CNAC or the applicable Subsidiary and, to the Knowledge of
Parent, of each other party thereto, other than Contracts that have expired by
their terms. Neither CNAC nor the applicable Subsidiary nor, to the Knowledge
of Parent, any other party to such Contract is in violation or breach of or
default under any such Contract (or with notice or lapse of time, or both,

Section 4.9 Real Property.

(a)Section 4.9(a) of the Disclosure Schedule contains a true and complete list
of all of the leases, licenses, subleases, agreements containing easements or
subsidence rights in favor of CNAC or any of its Subsidiaries, 

and all other similar occupancy agreements, including all amendments or other
modifications thereto (collectively, the "Leases"), pursuant to which CNAC or
any of its Subsidiaries leases, licenses, subleases or otherwise occupies real
property (such real property, collectively, the "Leased Real Property"). The
Leased Real Property is the only real property leased, subleased, licensed or
otherwise occupied by CNAC or any of its Subsidiaries that is used in
connection with the Business, other than the Owned Real Property and any real
property occupied or otherwise used by CNAC or any of its Subsidiaries
pursuant to appurtenant easements and similar rights that constitute Permitted
Liens. CNAC or the applicable Subsidiary has a good and valid leasehold
interest in all of the Leased Real Property, free and clear of any Liens
(other than Permitted Liens). The Leases are in full force and effect. Neither
CNAC nor the applicable Subsidiary nor, to the Knowledge of Parent, any other
party to any Lease is in material default under the Leases. To the Knowledge
of Parent, no event has occurred that, with notice or lapse of time, or both,
would constitute a material breach or default by CNAC or such Subsidiary or
any other party to any Lease under any of the Leases. Parent has made
available to Purchaser or its Representatives copies of the Leases and all
certificates of occupancy, title reports, title insurance policies,
preliminary mining title opinions, surveys and similar documents with respect
to the Leased Real Property that are in the possession of Parent, Seller, CNAC
or any of the Subsidiaries of CNAC, and the copies of the Leases made
available by Parent are true, correct and complete in all material respects.
Neither the use of the Leased Real Property by CNAC or the applicable
Subsidiary nor, to the Knowledge of Parent, the Leased Real Property itself
contravenes or violates any building, zoning, administrative, occupational
safety and health or other applicable Law in any material respect.

(b)Section 4.9(b)(i) of the Disclosure Schedule contains a true and complete
list of all real property owned by CNAC or any of its Subsidiaries (the "Owned

Schedule, reasonable access to that portion of the Owned Real Property on
which CNAC or any of its Subsidiaries are currently conducting mining,
processing or reclamation operations is available through publicly dedicated
streets or a validly existing easement, which access is consistent with past
practice. Except as would not have a Material Adverse Effect, CNAC or the
applicable Subsidiary has good and valid title to all of the Owned Real
Property, free and clear of any Liens (other than Permitted Liens). None of
the Owned Real Property, or the use thereof, contravenes or violates any
building, zoning, administrative, occupational safety and health or other
applicable Law in any material respect. Parent has made available to Purchaser
or its Representatives copies of all deeds, leases, mortgages, deeds of trust,
certificates of occupancy, title insurance policies (including the Existing
Title Insurance Policies), title reports, surveys and documents evidencing
recorded and unrecorded easements, rights-of-way and similar restrictions and
rights (and all amendments thereto) with respect to the Owned Real Property,
to the extent the same are in the possession of Parent, Seller, CNAC or a
Subsidiary of CNAC. Other than the Farming and Residential Leases and other
than as set forth in Section 4.9(b)(iii) of the Disclosure Schedule, neither
CNAC nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any lease, license, sublease,
agreement containing easements or subsidence rights in favor of CNAC or any of
its Subsidiaries or similar occupancy agreement under which it leases,
licenses, subleases or otherwise makes any of the Owned Real Property
available for occupancy by any third party (other than an Affiliate). All of
the Farming and Residential Leases are terminable by CNAC or the applicable
Subsidiary without cost to CNAC or such Subsidiary upon not more than 90 days'
prior notice.

(c)CNAC and its Subsidiaries, as applicable, have obtained all easements and
rights of way required to use and operate the Owned Real Property and the
Leased Real Property in all material respects in connection with the Business
and to comply with applicable Law (other than any non-compliance that would
not have a Material Adverse Effect). Neither CNAC nor any Subsidiary of CNAC
is in material default under any document evidencing such easement or right of
way and, to the Knowledge of Parent, (i) all such documents are in full force
and effect, (ii) the other party to each such document is not in material
default thereunder and (iii) no event has occurred that, with notice or lapse
of time, or both, would constitute a material breach or default by CNAC or
such Subsidiary or the other party under any such document.

(d)Parent has made available to Purchaser or its Representatives all studies
relating to the coal reserves associated with the Business's mines that were
prepared by, or at the request of, and that are in the possession of, Parent,

Disclosure Schedule as are necessary to conduct the Business as currently
conducted. CNAC and its Subsidiaries own and have good and exclusive title to

subject to any Action or Governmental Order restricting in a material respect
the use, transfer or licensing thereof by CNAC or any of its Subsidiaries or
affecting in a material respect the validity, use or enforceability of such

company duly formed, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of
the State of Delaware. Purchaser has the full legal right and power and all
authority required by Law to enter into this Agreement, to carry out its
obligations hereunder and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.

behalf of Purchaser, and (assuming due authorization, execution and delivery
by Parent and Seller) this Agreement constitutes the legal, valid and binding
obligation of Purchaser, enforceable against Purchaser in accordance with its
terms, subject to the effect of any applicable bankruptcy, reorganization,
insolvency, moratorium, fraudulent conveyance or similar Laws affecting
creditors' rights generally and subject, as to enforceability, to the effect
of general principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is
considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).



Section 5.2 No Conflict. Assuming all consents, approvals, authorizations and
other actions described in Section 5.3 have been obtained, and except as may
result from any facts or circumstances relating solely to Parent or Seller,
the execution and delivery of and performance of obligations under this
Agreement by Purchaser and the consummation by Purchaser of the transactions
contemplated hereby do not and will not violate or conflict with the
organizational documents of Purchaser or any Law applicable to Purchaser,
except for any such violations or conflicts of any Law as would not materially
delay the ability of Purchaser to perform its material obligations under this
Agreement or consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.



Section 5.3 Consents and Approvals. The execution and delivery of this
Agreement by Purchaser do not, and the performance by Purchaser of its
obligations hereunder will not, require any consent, approval, authorization
or other action by, or filing with or notification to, any Governmental
Authority or other Person, except (a) where failure to obtain such consent,
approval, authorization or action, or to make such filing or notification,
would not prevent Purchaser from performing any of its material obligations

circumstances relating solely to Parent or Seller.



Section 5.4 Legal Proceedings. There are no Actions pending or, to the actual
knowledge of the executive officers of Purchaser after reasonable inquiry,

brokerage, finder's or other fee or commission in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement based upon arrangements made by or
on behalf of Purchaser.



Section 5.8 Due Diligence; Reliance on Experts.

(a)Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that it has made its own inquiry and
investigation into, and, based thereon, has formed an independent judgment
concerning, the Business, and, in connection with such inquiries and
investigations, Purchaser has relied on its own financial, legal and other

of Parent reasonable access (including the right to make, at Parent's expense,
photocopies) for reasonable and necessary business purposes, during normal
business hours, to such books and records.



Section 6.2 Confidentiality Agreement Termination. The Confidentiality
Agreement dated as of November 3, 2015 between Parent and Thomas M. Clarke and
the obligations of the parties thereunder are hereby terminated, other than
with respect to any Confidential Information (as defined therein) of Parent

Section 6.3 Consents and Related Matters. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, each party hereto shall use its
respective commercially reasonable efforts promptly: (a) to take, or to cause
to be taken, all actions, and to do, or to cause to be done, and to assist and
cooperate with the other parties hereto in doing, all things necessary, proper
or advisable under applicable Law or otherwise, to consummate and make
effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (b) to obtain from
any Governmental Authority or third parties any actions, non-actions,
clearances, waivers, consents, approvals, authorizations, permits or orders
required to be obtained by any party hereto or any of their respective
Affiliates in connection with the authorization, execution and delivery of and

any application or other filing to be made pursuant to any applicable Law or
any applicable regulations of any Governmental Authority in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to supply promptly any
additional information and documentary material that may be requested in
connection with such filings or applications.



Section 6.4 Employee Matters.

(a)From and after the Closing Date until the one-year anniversary of the
Closing Date, Purchaser shall cause each employee of CNAC and its Subsidiaries
(to the extent each such employee continues to be employed by Purchaser, CNAC
or any Subsidiary of CNAC following the Closing) who is not covered by a
collective bargaining agreement as of the Closing Date to be given full credit
for all service with CNAC or any Subsidiary of CNAC (and any predecessor
entity, to the extent CNAC or a Subsidiary of CNAC gives service credit for
service with such predecessor entity) before the Closing Date for purposes of
eligibility and vesting under any employee benefit plans or arrangements of
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (other than CNAC or any Subsidiary of CNAC)
in which such employee participates on or after the Closing Date, to the same
extent such service is recognized by CNAC or any of its Affiliates immediately
prior to the Closing Date (except to the extent that the crediting of such
service would result in duplication of benefits). In the event that such an
employee shall participate in any employee welfare benefit plans of Purchaser
or its Affiliates (other than CNAC or any Subsidiary of CNAC) in the calendar
year containing the Closing Date and such participation commences other than
at the expiration of the plan year under the corresponding welfare benefit
plan maintained for such employee by CNAC or any Affiliate of CNAC immediately
prior to such participation, Purchaser shall, or shall cause its Affiliates
(other than CNAC or any Subsidiary of CNAC) to, (i) waive all limitations as
to pre-existing condition exclusions and waiting periods with respect to such
employee under such employee welfare benefit plans of Purchaser or its
Affiliates, other than to the extent limitations or waiting periods that are
already in effect with respect to such employee under such corresponding
welfare benefit plan maintained for such employee by CNAC or any Affiliate of
CNAC immediately prior to such participation have not been satisfied as of
such participation date, and (ii) provide each such employee with credit for
any co-insurance and deductibles paid in the calendar year of the Closing
prior to such participation date in satisfying any deductible or out-of-pocket
requirements under such employee welfare benefit plans of Purchaser or its
Affiliates.

(b)Commencing January 1, 2016, and continuing through at least December 31,
2016, Purchaser shall provide, or to cause to be provided, to each employee of
CNAC and its Subsidiaries (to the extent each such employee continues to be
employed by Purchaser, CNAC or any Subsidiary of CNAC following the Closing)
who is not covered by a collective bargaining agreement as of the Closing
Date, employee benefit and compensation programs 

that are no less favorable than those provided to such employees immediately
prior to the Closing Date (except for the "Pension Plan for Employees of
Cliffs Natural Resources Inc. and its Associated Employers" described in
Section 6.4(c)).

(c)Effective as of the Closing Date, the active participation of each employee
of CNAC and its Subsidiaries who is not covered by a collective bargaining
agreement as of the Closing Date in the "Pension Plan for Employees of Cliffs
Natural Resources Inc. and its Associated Employers" will cease and otherwise
terminate, and each such employee will have the options provided to such
employee as provided and set forth in such "Pension Plan for Employees of
Cliffs Natural Resources Inc. and its Associated Employers".

(d)Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent will continue to provide medical,
dental, vision and prescription drug coverages under its existing Employee
Plans through December 31, 2015; provided, however, that Purchaser agrees (i)
that it is solely responsible for any and all claims made under any such
Parent Employee Plan after the Closing Date and (ii) to reimburse, in full,
Parent for any claims paid by Parent. To that end, Purchaser agrees to
reimburse Parent within five (5) Business Days after Parent's delivery to
Purchaser of evidence of each such claim paid under the Parent Employee Plans
per sub-clause (i) above.

(e)Nothing herein shall require Purchaser to continue employment of any
employee for any period of time or, except as otherwise specifically provided
in this Section 6.4, on any specific terms or conditions after the Closing.



Section 6.5 Tax Matters; Straddle Period.

(a)Purchaser and Parent agree to share equally the payment of all sales, use,
value added, documentary, stamp, gross receipts, registration, transfer,
conveyance, excise, recording, license and other similar taxes and fees
arising out of or in connection with or attributable to the transactions
effected pursuant to this Agreement ("Transfer Taxes"). Parent shall prepare
and in a timely manner file all Tax Returns in respect of Transfer Taxes. The
parties hereto shall reasonably cooperate with each other in attempting to
minimize Transfer Taxes.

(b)Purchaser shall prepare and file, or cause to be prepared and filed, all
Tax Returns for each of CNAC and the Companies for all periods ending after
the Closing Date, which Tax Returns shall be consistent with past practice. In
the case of Tax Returns for periods starting on or before the Closing Date and
ending after the Closing Date (a "Straddle Period"), Purchaser shall provide
Parent with an opportunity to review and comment on such Tax Returns no less
than 30 days prior to the due date thereof. Purchaser shall make, or cause to
be made, any changes to such Tax Returns reasonably requested by Parent so
long as none of such changes result in any additional Taxes to Purchaser, CNAC
or any of the Companies. Parent shall prepare and file, or cause to be
prepared and filed, all Tax Returns required to be filed by CNAC and its
Subsidiaries for all periods ending on or before the Closing Date (a "Pre-
Closing Period"). As soon as practicable, but in any event within 15 days
after Parent's or Purchaser's request, as the case may be, Purchaser shall
deliver to Parent, or Parent shall deliver to Purchaser, as the case may be,
such information and other data relating to the Tax Returns and Taxes of CNAC
and its Subsidiaries, and shall provide such other assistance as may
reasonably be requested, to cause the completion and filing of all Tax Returns
or to respond to audits by any taxing authorities with respect to any Tax
Returns or taxable periods or to otherwise enable Parent or Purchaser to
satisfy their accounting or Tax requirements.

(c)In the case of Taxes that are payable with respect to a taxable period that
begins before and ends after the Closing Date, the portion of any such Taxes
that are attributable to a Pre-Closing Period shall be:

(i)in the case of Taxes (A) based upon, or related to, income, receipts,
profits, wages, capital or net worth, (B) imposed in connection with the sale,
transfer or assignment of property or (C) required to be withheld, deemed to
be the amount that would be payable if the taxable year ended with the Closing
Date; and

(ii)in the case of all other Taxes, deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for
the entire period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the
number of days in the period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of
which is the number of days in the entire period.

(d)Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement to the contrary, in the
event Purchaser, CNAC or any Subsidiary of CNAC undertakes one or more
corporate actions or similar actions (including any transfer of ownership
interests or any merger or recapitalization) or makes after the Closing any
election on or effective as of the 

Closing Date involving (directly or indirectly) CNAC or any Subsidiary of
CNAC, such transactions shall be deemed to have occurred on the day
immediately following the Closing Date for all purposes, and no Taxes
resulting therefrom shall be borne by Parent or Seller. In no event shall any
Taxes resulting from any amendment or restatement of the governing documents
of CNAC or the Companies made after the Closing Date be borne directly or
indirectly by Parent or Seller. Purchaser agrees that Parent and Seller are to
have no liability for any Tax resulting from any action of Purchaser, CNAC or
any Company (from and after the Closing).

(e)After the Closing, without the prior written consent of Parent, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, neither
CNAC nor any Company shall (and Purchaser shall not permit CNAC or any Company
to), to the extent it may affect or relate to Parent or Seller, make, change
or rescind any Tax election, amend any Tax Return, take any position on any
Tax Return, take any other action, omit to take any action or enter into any
other transaction that would have the effect of increasing the Tax Liability
or reducing any Tax asset of CNAC or any Company in respect of any Pre-Closing
Period or portion of any Straddle Period allocable to a Pre-Closing Period.

(f)After the Closing, Purchaser shall give written notice to Parent of the
receipt of any written notice by Purchaser, CNAC or any Company that involves
any assessment of Taxes, notice of Tax deficiency, adjustment of Taxes, audit
or examination of any Tax Returns or the assertion of any claim or the
commencement of any litigation relating to the Taxes or Tax Returns of CNAC or
any Company in respect of any Pre-Closing Period or Straddle Period (a "Tax
Claim"). At Parent's discretion, Parent shall, at its own cost, have the right
to control the contest or resolution of any such Tax Claim insofar as the Tax
Claim relates to the Pre-Closing Period or the portion of any Straddle Period
allocable to a Pre-Closing Period.

(g)Any Tax refunds (including all interest thereon) for any Pre-Closing Period
or Straddle Period (to the extent allocable to a Pre-Closing Period) that are
received by CNAC or any Company after the Closing and any credits or other
items derived from any Pre-Closing Period or Straddle Period (to the extent
allocable to a Pre-Closing Period) that reduce Purchaser's, CNAC's or any
Company's Tax Liability for any period shall be for the account of Parent, and
Purchaser shall (and Purchaser shall cause CNAC or any Company, as applicable,
to) pay over to Parent any such refund or the amount of any such credit or
other item within 30 days after such receipt or reduction in Tax Liability (as
appropriate); provided, however, that Purchaser shall in any event have the
right to use any net operating loss carryforwards (to the extent that such net
operating losses constitute an attribute of Purchaser after the Closing Date).

(h)After the Closing Date, the parties hereto shall provide each other with
such cooperation and information relating to the Business as such other
parties may reasonably request in writing in (i) filing any Tax Return or
amended Tax Return or claim for Tax refund, (ii) determining any Tax Liability
or right to refund of Taxes, (iii) conducting or defending any Action in
respect of Taxes, (iv) preparing any related tax forms (including Forms K-1)
or (v) effectuating the terms of this Agreement. The parties hereto shall
retain all Tax Returns, schedules and work papers, and all material documents
relating thereto with respect to the Business, until the expiration of the
applicable statute of limitation (and, to the extent notified by any party
hereto to the others, as applicable, any extensions thereof) with respect to
the Tax periods to which such Tax Returns and other documents relate and,
unless such Tax Returns and other documents are offered and delivered to the
other parties hereto, as applicable, until the final determination of any Tax
in respect of such periods. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no party hereto
shall be unreasonably required to prepare any document, or determine any
information, not then in its possession in response to a request under this
Section 6.5(h).



Section 6.6 Public Announcements. Any press releases, public announcements or
other disclosures regarding the transactions contemplated hereby shall be made
only with the mutual consent of Parent and Purchaser, except as required by
Law or by a stock exchange or automated quotation system, in which case the
party hereto required to make the release, announcement or disclosure shall
allow the other parties hereto reasonable time to comment on such release,
announcement or disclosure in advance of such release, announcement or
disclosure.



Section 6.7 Labor Agreement.

(a)Purchaser acknowledges that PMC, PLC, OGR and OGLC (the "Signatory
Companies") are signatory to collective bargaining agreements with the United
Mine Workers of America (the "Wage Agreements") as disclosed on Section
4.14(a) of the Disclosure Schedule (as any such Wage Agreement shall be
amended, restated, reformed, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to
time). Purchaser agrees that the Signatory Companies 

will, on and after the Closing Date, comply with all of the terms of the Wage
Agreements, including the obligation to contribute to the 1974 UMWA Pension
Plan, in accordance with the terms of the Wage Agreements. In the event that
any of the Signatory Companies withdraws from the 1974 UMWA Pension Plan at
any time on or after the Closing Date, Purchaser and the Signatory Companies
will be solely responsible for satisfaction of any withdrawal liability due to
the 1974 UMWA Pension Plan pursuant to ERISA and for timely making any and all
periodic or other payments of withdrawal liability required by Law, and none
of Purchaser, any of the Signatory Companies or any Affiliate of or related to
the Signatory Companies shall have any claim against Parent or Seller for
payment of all or any portion of any withdrawal liability assessed against
Purchaser, any of the Signatory Companies or any Affiliate thereof to
Purchaser; provided, however, that this does not relieve or waive any
obligations of Parent or Seller under their express representations,
warranties and covenants in this Agreement or any breach by Parent or Seller
thereof.

(b)In the event of complete or partial withdrawal from the 1974 UMWA Pension
Plan by Purchaser takes place after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall pay or
cause the Signatory Companies to pay each installment of withdrawal liability
applicable to the Signatory Companies on or after the Closing Date prior to
the due date of each such payment and shall provide Parent with notice of each
installment payment. In the event of any breach by Purchaser of any of its
obligations under this Section 6.7(b), Parent shall have the right to seek
injunctive relief or to take any action necessary to prevent or cure any
actual or threatened default by Purchaser.



Section 6.8 Further Action.

(a)For a period of 12 months from and after the Closing Date, each of the
parties hereto shall (i) execute and deliver such documents and other papers,
(ii) furnish or cause to be furnished to each other and their Representatives
access (including the ability to make copies), during normal business hours,
to such information and assistance relating to the Business (to the extent
within the control of such party or any of its Affiliates), provided that any
such assistance shall be furnished in such manner as to minimize disruptions
to the continuing business of Parent and Seller, only to the extent Parent or
Seller have personnel reasonably available to them to perform such assistance,
and that any out-of-pocket costs attributable to such assistance shall be
borne by Purchaser, and (iii) take such further actions, in each case as may
be reasonably required to carry out the provisions of this Agreement and give
effect to the transactions contemplated hereby, including as is reasonably
necessary for financial reporting, Tax and accounting matters and for defense
or prosecution of any Actions.

(b)Without limitation of the foregoing, to the extent Purchaser's payroll
service provider is unable to timely provide its usual payroll services
(including remission of pay and furnishing of year-end tax-related
documentation (such as Forms W-2) to employees), solely for the period
following the Closing Date through December 31, 2015, Parent and Seller shall
(i) cooperate with Purchaser to cause such payroll service provider to provide
such services using, if necessary, the payroll systems in use for the Business
prior to Closing, (ii) fund the payroll (including, for the avoidance of
doubt, accrued vacation) (and provide evidence of such funding to Purchaser),
and (iii) if necessary, cause customary information to be inputted into such
payroll systems to effectuate such usual payroll services; provided, however,
that Purchaser acknowledges and agrees to reimburse Parent $2,000,000 of such
payroll funding paid per sub-clause (ii) no later than December 31, 2016. The
Parties further agree that neither Parent nor Seller shall be required to
provide any payroll services or funding after December 31, 2015.

(c)In addition to the requirements set forth in Section 6.1 above, upon
reasonable advance written notice from Parent, Purchaser agrees, and agrees to
cause CNAC and the Subsidiaries, as applicable, to make site personnel (in
particular the local accountants and controllers) available to Parent for a
reasonable period, not to exceed six (6) months, following the Closing Date in
order to provide information to Parent and Seller to assist in closing out
Parent's and Seller's books.

(d)With respect to that certain Storage and Handling Agreement, dated July 1,
2010, between CNAC and IC Railmarine Terminal Co. (as assigned to Raven
Energy, LLC on June 15, 2011), as disclosed in Sections 4.8(vi) and (xi) of
the Disclosure Schedule, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein,
Parent agrees to pay, on behalf of CNAC, upon the written request of
Purchaser, up to a maximum of $2,206,250, any liquidated damages assessed in
connection with and pursuant to Section 4.1(a) of such Storage and Handling
Agreement; provided, that to the extent that Purchaser shall confirm in
writing at any time that such maximum amount shall be irrevocably reduced
(without payment of the amount of such reduction by Parent), then Purchaser
shall be entitled to apply the amount of such reduction on a dollar-for-dollar
basis against Purchaser's payment obligation pursuant to the proviso to
Section 6.8(b). To accomplish the foregoing, promptly upon Parent's receipt of
such invoice, whether directly or from Purchaser 

or CNAC if received by them (in which event, Purchaser shall or shall cause
CNAC to forward such invoice to Parent), Parent will pay the invoice when due
in accordance with its terms.

that for Tax purposes the purchase of Units pursuant to this Agreement will be
treated as the direct taxable purchase by Purchaser of the assets of CNAC and
the Companies from Seller.

in Section 6.10(a) of the Disclosure Schedule, from and after the Closing

be sent in accordance with the instructions provided in Section 6.10(b) of the
Disclosure Schedule.

replacement surety bonds with the applicable Governmental Authority and cause
the release of Parent's Bonds within 45 days from the Closing Date or (ii)
obtain assignments of such Bonds to Purchaser, in either case with the
reasonable assistance of Parent and Seller. Purchaser shall reimburse Parent
for (x) the pro rata portion of the annual premiums and (y) the monthly letter
of credit interest charges, in each case related to the Bonds, starting from
the date that is 45 days after the Closing Date and ending at such time that
Purchaser obtains the release and replacement or assignment of the Bonds.



Section 6.12 Dismissal from Certain Pending Actions. From and after the
Closing, Purchaser agrees to cooperate with Parent, at Parent's expense, to
cause Parent and any Affiliate of Parent (other than CNAC or a Subsidiary of
CNAC) to be dismissed as a party to any Action for which CNAC or a Subsidiary
of CNAC is, or Purchaser as of the Closing becomes, responsible, including all
Actions set forth in Section 4.6 of the Disclosure Schedule (without giving
effect for this purpose to any portions of Section 4.6 of the Disclosure
Schedule that cross-reference other sections of the Disclosure Schedule) (such
Actions set forth in Section 4.6 of the Disclosure Schedule (without giving
effect for this purpose to any portions of Section 4.6 of the Disclosure
Schedule that cross-reference other sections of the Disclosure Schedule) being
the "Pending Actions").



Section 6.13 Proceeds from Sale of Lucchini Account Receivable. With respect
to the account receivable disclosed in Section 6.13 of the Disclosure Schedule
(the "Lucchini Receivable"), to the extent that, after the Closing Date, any
proceeds are received by Purchaser, CNAC or a Company relating to the sale,
prior to the Closing, of the Lucchini Receivable, such recipient agrees to
forward to Parent, promptly after such receipt of the same, any and all
payments received in respect of the Lucchini Receivable (which Lucchini
Receivable, the parties hereto agree, will not be included in the calculation
of the Specified Current Assets, since it is fully reserved for in the
Financial Statements).

shall be paid by Purchaser.



Section 6.15 No Disparagement. After the Closing Date, (a) neither Parent nor

their respective equity owners or Representatives and (b) Purchaser will not
disparage Parent, Seller or any of their respective Affiliates (other than
CNAC or any Subsidiaries of CNAC) or Representatives.



Section 6.16 Deposits. For the avoidance of doubt, Purchaser will retain all
deposits of CNAC and its Subsidiaries for utilities and other purchased goods
and services.



Section 6.17 Use of Cliffs Name. After the Closing, neither Purchaser nor CNAC

names confusingly similar to such names), 

provided that CNAC shall be able to continue to use "Cliffs" in its legal name
and shall be permitted to exhaust any existing supplies of marketing,
packaging and similar materials for a reasonable period of time following the
Closing not to exceed 30 calendar days, after which time Purchaser shall cause
CNAC to change CNAC's legal name with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware.



Section 6.18 Equity Certificates. Within five Business Days following the
Closing, Parent and Seller shall deliver or cause to be delivered to Purchaser

following such notice thereof to Purchaser, Purchaser shall use commercially

doubt, "commercially reasonable efforts" for purposes of this Section 6.19

CNAC or any of its Subsidiaries for any Pre-Closing Period (or portion of any
Straddle Period allocable to a Pre-Closing Period under Section 6.5(c));

(d)any claims of any broker, finder or other Person acting in a similar
capacity on behalf of Parent, Seller or any of their respective Affiliates in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby based upon arrangements
made by or on behalf of Parent, Seller or any of their respective Affiliates;
and

(e)any and all Actions incident to any of the foregoing or such
indemnification.



Section 8.3 Indemnification by Purchaser. Parent and Seller and their
respective Affiliates (other than CNAC and the Subsidiaries of CNAC),
successors and assigns (each, a "Seller Indemnified Party") shall, solely to
the extent provided herein, be indemnified and held harmless by Purchaser (a
"Purchaser Indemnifying Party") for and against any and all Losses arising out
of or resulting from:

(a)the breach of any representation or warranty made by Purchaser contained in
this Agreement, determined in each case without regard to qualification by
Material Adverse Effect or materiality or similar exceptions or
qualifications;

(b)the breach of any covenant or agreement of Purchaser contained in this
Agreement;

(c)any of the Pending Actions (but which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall
not impact or offset any obligations pursuant to the Override Right Agreement
or the Escrow Agreement);

(d)the Bonds as provided for in Section 6.11 and the Guarantees as provided
for in Section 6.19 (notwithstanding whether any such Bonds or Guarantees are
released and replaced or remain in effect after the Closing Date);

(e)any claims of any broker, finder or other Person acting in a similar
capacity on behalf of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates in connection with
the transactions contemplated hereby based upon arrangements made by or on
behalf of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates; and

(f)any and all Actions incident to any of the foregoing or such
indemnification.



Section 8.4 Limits on Indemnification. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, except for claims based on fraud, which
shall not be subject to the limitations in this Section 8.4:

(a)no amount of indemnity shall be payable as a result of any claim in respect
of a Loss arising under Section 8.2(a) or Section 8.3(a) unless the Purchaser
Indemnified Party or the Seller Indemnified Party, as the case may be, has
given the Seller Indemnifying Party or the Purchaser Indemnifying Party, as
the case may be, a Claim Notice with respect to such claim prior to the
applicable Cut-Off Date; and

(b)the sole source of funds for the payment of any claims against the Seller
Indemnifying Party pursuant to this Article VIII shall be payments (if any)
made or to be made to the Escrow Account (and available after disbursement of
monies from the Escrow Account for any matters set forth in the Escrow
Agreement other than obligations covered by this Article VIII), which payments
(if any) derive from the Override Right Agreement (and, accordingly, the
Seller Indemnifying Party shall not be required to make any payments pursuant
to this Article VIII in excess of the amounts (if any) provided by the Escrow
Account via the Override Right Agreement (and available after disbursement of
monies from the Escrow Account for any matters set forth in the Escrow
Agreement other than obligations covered by this Article VIII)).



Section 8.5 Notice of Loss; Claims.

(a)An Indemnified Party shall promptly, and in any event within 30 calendar
days, or, in the case of any Third Party Claim, within ten calendar days,
after the Indemnified Party has in good faith determined that an 

event has occurred that would be reasonably expected to give rise to a right
of indemnification under this Article VIII, notify the Indemnifying Party in
writing of the matter that the Indemnified Party has in good faith determined
gives rise or is reasonably expected to give rise to such right of
indemnification under this Agreement (including a pending or threatened claim
or demand asserted by a third party against the Indemnified Party, such claim
being a "Third Party Claim"), stating the amount of the Loss, if known, and
method of computation thereof, describing in reasonable detail the facts and
circumstances with respect to such matter and containing a reference to the
provisions of this Agreement in respect of which such right of indemnification
is claimed or arises (a "Claim Notice"); provided, however, that the failure
to provide such notice shall not release the Indemnifying Party from any of
its obligations under this Article VIII except to the extent that the
Indemnifying Party is prejudiced by such failure. Anything in this Article
VIII to the contrary notwithstanding, notices for claims in respect of a
breach of a representation or warranty must be delivered before the expiration
of the survival period, if any, for such representation or warranty as
specified in Section 8.1 (the "Cut-Off Date").

(b)At any time after the receipt of a Claim Notice from an Indemnified Party
pursuant to Section 8.5(a) regarding a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying
Party shall be entitled to assume and control the defense of such Third Party
Claim with all expenses to be paid by the Indemnifying Party and through
counsel of its choice (provided that such counsel is not reasonably objected
to by the Indemnified Party) if it gives notice of its intention to do so to
the Indemnified Party and the proceeding or claim involves money damages and
not an injunction or other equitable relief that could have an adverse effect
on the Business; provided, however, that the Indemnifying Party shall
reimburse the Indemnified Party's expenses incurred in the defense of such
Third Party Claim prior to the date (if any) the Indemnifying Party ultimately
does assume such defense; provided, further, that if (i) there exists or is
reasonably likely to exist a conflict of interest that would make it
inappropriate in the reasonable judgment of the Indemnified Party for the same
counsel to represent both the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party or
(ii) the Indemnifying Party fails to provide reasonable assurance to the
Indemnified Party of the Indemnifying Party's financial capacity to defend
such Third Party Claim and provide indemnification with respect to such Third
Party Claim, then the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to retain its own
counsel, at the expense of the Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnifying Party
exercises the right to undertake any such defense against any such Third Party
Claim as provided above, the Indemnified Party shall cooperate with the
Indemnifying Party in such defense. Whether or not the Indemnifying Party has
exercised such right, the Indemnified Party shall make available to the
Indemnifying Party, at the Indemnifying Party's expense, all witnesses,
pertinent records, materials and information in the Indemnified Party's
possession or under the Indemnified Party's control relating thereto as is
reasonably requested by the Indemnifying Party; provided, however, that any
access to employees shall be conducted in such a manner as not to interfere
unreasonably with the operations of the business of the Indemnified Party and
its Affiliates. Similarly, in the event the Indemnified Party is, directly or
indirectly, conducting the defense against any such Third Party Claim, the
Indemnifying Party shall cooperate with the Indemnified Party in such defense
and make available to the Indemnified Party, at the Indemnifying Party's
expense, all such witnesses, records, materials and information in the
Indemnifying Party's possession or under the Indemnifying Party's control
relating thereto as is reasonably required by the Indemnified Party; and in
such event, the Indemnified Party shall consult with, and give due
consideration to the advice of, the Indemnifying Party as may be reasonably
requested by the Indemnifying Party regarding the defense of such Third Party
Claim. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Article VIII, the
Indemnifying Party shall not have the obligation to indemnify any Loss with
respect to a Third Party Claim for which the Indemnified Party is conducting
the defense if the Indemnified Party has failed to consult with the
Indemnifying Party after the Indemnifying Party has requested, in writing,
such consultation regarding such Third Party Claim. If the Indemnifying Party
assumes the defense in accordance with this Section 8.5(b), the Indemnified
Party shall have the right to participate in the defense thereof and to employ
counsel (not reasonably objected to by the Indemnifying Party), at its own
expense, separate from the counsel employed by the Indemnifying Party, it
being understood that the Indemnifying Party shall control such defense.
Whether or not the Indemnifying Party shall have assumed the defense of a
Third Party Claim, neither the Indemnifying Party nor the Indemnified Party
shall admit any Liability with respect to, or compromise, discharge or settle,
such Third Party Claim without the other's prior written consent (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); provided,
that, if the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of such Third Party Claim,
no such consent shall be required if (A) there is no finding or admission of
any violation of Laws or any violation of the rights of any Person, (B) the
sole relief provided is monetary damages that are paid in full by the
Indemnifying Party and (C) the Indemnified Party shall have no Liability with
respect to any compromise or settlement of such Third Party Claims effected
without its consent. If notice is given to an Indemnifying Party of the
assertion of any Third Party Claim and the Indemnifying Party does not, within
20 Business Days after the Indemnified Party's notice is given, give notice to
the Indemnified Party of its election to assume the defense of such Third
Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party will be bound by any determination made in
such Third Party Claim or any compromise or settlement effected by the
Indemnified Party. 

(c)At any time after the receipt of a Claim Notice from an Indemnified Party
pursuant to Section 8.5(a) regarding a non-Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying
Party shall have 30 Business Days from the date of receipt of such Claim
Notice in which to either pay the amount of the non-Third Party Claim or give
written notice of its intent to dispute the non-Third Party Claim, in which
case the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall then be required
to negotiate in good faith for a period not to exceed 15 Business Days to
attempt to resolve the non-Third Party Claim. If the non-Third Party Claim is
not disputed in a timely fashion as set forth above, the non-Third Party Claim
shall be immediately due and payable upon expiration of the 30 Business Day
notice period. If the non-Third Party Claim is timely disputed but not
resolved within the 15 Business Day negotiation period, the non-Third Party
Claim shall be resolved pursuant to Section 9.10.



Section 8.6 Nature of Payments. Any indemnity payments made under this Article
VIII shall be treated for Tax purposes as an adjustment of the Consideration.



Section 8.7 Exclusive Remedy. Except in the case of fraud and except as
provided in Section 2.3 and Section 2.4 and any Actions for injunctive relief
or specific performance as set forth in this Agreement, any Action (whether
such claim sounds in tort, contract or otherwise and including statutory
rights and remedies) based upon, relating to or arising out of this Agreement
must be brought by the parties hereto in accordance with the indemnification
provisions and applicable limitations of this Article VIII, which shall
constitute the sole and exclusive remedy of all parties hereto and their
Affiliates, successors and assigns for any such Actions.

all other terms and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in
full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the

consent of the other parties hereto, except that Purchaser may, without such

other state or federal court located in the State of Delaware, preserving,
however, all rights of removal to such federal court under 28 U.S.C. 1441.
Each party hereto hereby waives the right to any other jurisdiction or venue
for any litigation arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or the

taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement. Delivery of an
executed counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by electronic
transmission (including email) shall be effective as delivery of a manually
executed counterpart of this Agreement.



Section 9.13 Waiver. The rights and remedies of the parties to this Agreement
are cumulative and not alternative. Any of the terms or conditions of this
Agreement that may be lawfully waived may be waived in writing at any time by
each party hereto that is entitled to the benefits thereof. Any waiver of any
of the provisions of this Agreement by any party hereto, including the waiver
of any failure of another party hereto to comply with any of its covenants,
obligations or agreements herein contained, shall be binding only if set forth
in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such waiving party. No failure

Agreement or any part hereof or the right of any party hereto thereafter to
enforce each and every such provision, and no waiver of any of the provisions
of this Agreement shall be deemed to or shall constitute a waiver of any other
