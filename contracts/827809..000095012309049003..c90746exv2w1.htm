exercise any remedy under, or to cancel or modify or terminate, any such
insurance policy, and, to the Knowledge of Seller, there is no such default.
To SellerÂ’s Knowledge, such policies are sufficient to protect the Included
Assets and the business of QLT USA against the risks of the sort
normally insured by similar businesses. Since the Atrix Acquisition Date,
there has not been any lapse of coverage with respect to the matters covered
by any such policy. 

  

(c) Since the Atrix Acquisition Date, QLT USA has not received any written
notice or other written communication regarding any actual or possible (i)
cancellation or invalidation of any insurance policy, (ii) refusal of any
coverage or rejection of any claim under any insurance policy or (iii)
adjustment in the amount of any premium payable with respect to any insurance
policy, except for adjustment in connection with the renewal of such
policies. There is no pending or, to the Knowledge of Seller, threatened
claim under any insurance policy that does, or would reasonably be expected
to, result in, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. 

  

4.15 _Related Party Transactions_. Neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates,
directors, officers or Subsidiaries is party to any Contract with, or is
involved in any other business arrangement or relationship with, QLT
USA. Neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates, directors, officers or
Subsidiaries owns, leases or licenses any Asset which is owned, leased or
licensed by QLT USA or is used in the operation of business conducted or
proposed to be conducted by QLT USA. 

  

4.16 _Real Property_. QLT USA does not own or lease any real property.

ARTICLE VII 
 COVENANTS 

   

7.1  _Conduct of the Business Post-Closing_. 

  

(a) From and after the Closing Date, until such time as payments to Seller in
respect of Post-Closing Royalty Amounts have been paid in full under _Section
2.2(b)(iii)_, Purchaser shall (i) operate the Product Line Business under the
Sanofi Agreement and MediGene Agreement in substantially the same manner as
the Product Line Business was conducted thereunder as of the Closing Date
(provided that the development, manufacture, distribution, marketing,
licensing or sale of a Future Product shall not constitute a failure to
operate the Product Line Business under the Sanofi Agreement or MediGene
Agreement, as applicable, in substantially the same manner) and in compliance
with all applicable laws, rules and regulations, (ii) not terminate the Sanofi
Agreement or MediGene Agreement, (iii) not take any action as may cause to be
terminated the Sanofi Agreement or MediGene Agreement, (iv) not amend the
Sanofi Agreement or MediGene Agreement in a manner that could reasonably be
expected to adversely affect the likelihood of the payment of the Post-
Closing Royalty Amounts to Seller under _Section 2.2(b)(iii)_ and (v) not
engage in any action with the intent to, directly or indirectly, adversely
impact or materially delay, or which would reasonably be expected to have the
effect of adversely impacting or materially delaying, the payment of the
Post-Closing Royalty Amounts to Seller under _Section 2.2(b)(iii)_;
_provided, however_ , that (1) the foregoing clauses (i), (iii) and (v) shall
not prevent Purchaser from complying with any order or decree of any
Governmental Authority with respect to the Product Line Business, (2)
Purchaser shall not be deemed to have breached the foregoing clause (i) to the
extent its failure to operate the Product Line Business under the Sanofi
Agreement and MediGene Agreement is caused by or results from (A) events
beyond the reasonable control of Purchaser, including war (declared or
undeclared), riot, terrorism, political insurrection, fire, snow, flood,
explosion, earthquake or tornadoes or (B) an interruption or delay by any
supplier or third party service provider in the provision of any materials,
products or services relevant to the Product Line Business that results in
PurchaserÂ’s inability to sell at least substantially the same quantity of the
Product as was sold prior to the Closing Date, and (3) the foregoing clauses
(iii) and (v) shall not prevent Purchaser from operating the Product Line
Business under the Sanofi Agreement and MediGene Agreement in substantially
the same manner as the Product Line Business was conducted thereunder as of
the Closing Date, as required by the foregoing clause (i). 

  

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event either the Sanofi Agreement or
the MediGene Agreement is terminated before all of the payments to be made to
Seller under _Section 2.2(b)(iii)_ have been made and any other agreement is
entered into by Purchaser or an Affiliate thereof with respect to the Product
in the territory set forth in the Sanofi Agreement or the MediGene Agreement,
respectively, or Purchaser or an Affiliate thereof elects to sell the
Product in such territory directly, then Seller and Purchaser shall work
together in good faith to determine the terms pursuant to which the
calculation of each payment to be made to Seller under  _Section
2.2(b)(iii)_ will be adjusted based on payments received pursuant to any such
other agreement entered into with respect to the Product or from the sale of
the Product directly in such territory by Purchaser or an Affiliate thereof,
as applicable. Seller and Purchaser each acknowledge that it is the intention
of the Parties under this Section 7.1(b) to agree to commercially reasonable
terms that approximate as much as possible both the frequency and the amount
of the payments that would have been made under Section 2.2(b)(iii) if the
termination of the MediGene Agreement or Sanofi Agreement, as applicable, had
not occurred. 

  

7.2 _Required Approvals and Consents_. The Parties shall make all filings
required to be made in order to consummate the Transaction prior to the
Closing. The Parties shall also cooperate with each other with respect to all
filings that Purchaser elects to make. Seller shall, and shall cause QLT USA
to, use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all third party
consents to be obtained under this Agreement.

7.3 _Further Assurances; Further Documents_. On and after the Closing Date,
and without additional consideration, each of Purchaser and Seller shall, at
the reasonable request of the other Party, provide assistance to such other
Party, including, but not limited to, executing and delivering to such other
Party all such further instruments, assignments, assurances and other
documents as such other Party may reasonably request in connection with the
carrying out of this Agreement and the Transaction. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, for a period of twelve (12) months following
the Closing Date, Seller shall: (a) notify Purchaser of any Intellectual
Property exclusively related to the Product or otherwise necessary for the
Product Line Business identified by Seller following the Closing Date as
owned, licensed to or otherwise held in whole or in part by Seller or any of
its Subsidiaries and take such action as is reasonably required to enable
Purchaser to procure, maintain, perfect and enforce the full and exclusive
benefit, enjoyment, right, title and interest, on a worldwide basis, in
PurchaserÂ’s name and for PurchaserÂ’s benefit, in and to all such Intellectual
Property and (b) to the extent commercially reasonable, make available to
Purchaser (or a representative of Purchaser) during normal business hours and
upon reasonable agreed-upon times, to the extent reasonably requested,
personnel employed by Seller at the time of any such request who
were responsible for preparing or maintaining information, records, filings,
submissions, responses to official actions and documents with respect to the
QLT USA Intellectual Property prior to the Closing. Purchaser acknowledges
and agrees that for purposes of clause (b) above, as of and following the
Closing Date, QLT USA and its personnel and representatives (and not Seller
and its personnel and representatives) will be responsible for preparing and
maintaining all such information, records, filings, submissions, responses to
official actions and documents with respect to the QLT USA Intellectual
Property. 

  

7.4 _Noncompetition_. 

  

(a) Except as otherwise explicitly permitted in _Section 7.4(b)_, from the
Effective Time and continuing until the [*] anniversary of the Closing Date
(the " _Noncompete Period_ "), neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates,
directly or indirectly through any licensee thereof, shall (i) engage in any
Seller Competitive Activity, or (ii) cause or actively assist any other
Person to engage in any Seller Competitive Activity. Except as otherwise
explicitly permitted in _Section 7.4(b)_, during the Noncompete Period,
neither Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates, directly or indirectly through
any licensee thereof, shall (i) engage in any Purchaser Competitive Activity,
or (ii) cause or actively assist any other Person to engage in any
Purchaser Competitive Activity. 

  

(b) If, during the Noncompete Period, Seller or any of its Affiliates acquires
an Entity that engages in any Seller Competitive Activity, or all or
substantially all of the assets of an Entity that engages in any Seller
Competitive Activity and such assets include a Seller Competitive Product,
Seller or such Affiliate shall have [*] from the acquisition date in which to
divest itself of such Seller Competitive Product or to otherwise cease such
Seller Competitive Activity, and Seller shall not be in breach of _Section
7.4(a)_ if it or the Affiliate, as the case may be, so divests such Seller
Competitive Product or ceases such Seller Competitive Activity within such
[*] period. If, during the Noncompete Period, Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates acquires an Entity that engages in any Purchaser Competitive
Activity, or all or substantially all of the assets of an Entity that
engages in any Purchaser Competitive Activity and such assets include a
Purchaser Competitive Product, Purchaser or such Affiliate shall have [*]
from the acquisition date in which to divest itself of such Purchaser
Competitive Product or to otherwise cease such Purchaser Competitive
Activity, and Purchaser shall not be in breach of _Section 7.4(a)_ if it or
the Affiliate, as the case may be, so divests such Purchaser Competitive
Product or ceases such Purchaser Competitive Activity within such [*]
period. 

  

[*] Certain information in this document has been omitted and
filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Confidential treatment has been requested with respect to the omitted
portions. 

  

    ##### 

  

  

(c) Because of the difficulty of measuring economic losses to Purchaser or
Seller, as applicable, as a result of a breach of the restrictive covenants
set forth in this _Section 7.4_ , and because of the immediate and
irreparable damage that would be caused to Purchaser or Seller, as applicable
for which monetary damages would not be a sufficient remedy, the
Parties agree that Purchaser or Seller, as applicable, will be entitled to
seek specific performance, temporary and permanent injunctive relief, and
such other equitable remedies to which it may then be entitled against Seller
or Purchaser, as applicable, or any of its respective Affiliates with respect
to any such breach. This _Section 7.4_ shall not limit any other legal or
equitable remedies that Purchaser or Seller, as applicable, may have against
Seller or any of its Affiliates or Purchaser or any of its Affiliates, as
applicable, for violation of the restrictions of this  _Section 7.4_. The
Parties agree that Purchaser or Seller, as applicable, shall have the right
to seek relief for any violation or threatened violation of this _Section
7.4_ by Seller or any of its Affiliates or Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates, as applicable, from any court of competent jurisdiction in any
jurisdiction authorized to grant the relief necessary to prohibit the
violation or threatened violation of this _Section 7.4_. 

  

(d) In no event shall the ownership by Seller (or an Affiliate thereof) or
Purchaser (or an Affiliate thereof) of less than five percent (5%) of the
equity securities of a publicly-traded company constitute a Seller
Competitive Activity or a Purchaser Competitive Activity, as applicable. 

  

7.5 _HSR Fees_. Purchaser and Seller have paid the required HSR Act filing
fees, with each of Purchaser and Seller paying one-half of such filing
fees. 

  

7.6 _Product Reports_. From and after the Closing Date, until such time as
payments to Seller in respect of Post-Closing Royalty Amounts have been paid
in full under _Section 2.2(b)(iii)_ , Purchaser shall furnish to Seller (i) a
copy of the quarterly written report required to be furnished to QLT USA by
Section 4.05(a) of the Sanofi Agreement and Section 4.05(a) of the MediGene
Agreement, respectively, promptly following the date on which such report
is furnished to QLT USA and (ii) any other written report received with
respect to the Post-Closing Royalty Amounts from Sanofi or MediGene. 

  

7.7 _Name Change_. Promptly following the Closing (and in any event within 30
calendar days following the Closing), Purchaser shall take all actions
reasonably necessary to change the QLT USA name to a name that does not
include the word "QLT" or any variation thereof. Thereafter, Purchaser shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts to cease using the QLT USA name and
shall promptly file or cause to be filed (and in any event within one year
following the Closing shall have filed or caused to be filed), on behalf of
QLT USA, any and all documents required to be filed to reflect the name
change with each applicable Governmental Authority, including patent
and trademark authorities.

relate to taxable periods or portions thereof ending on or before the Closing
Date that are due after the Closing Date and have not been filed prior to the
Closing, on a basis consistent with past practice (except as may be required
by Law). Prior to filing any Tax Returns described in this _Section 9.4(a)_
for periods or portions thereof beginning prior to the Closing Date,
Purchaser shall deliver to Seller a draft of each such Tax Return and the
associated work papers at least thirty (30) days prior to the date such Tax
Return is to be filed, and shall permit Seller to review and comment on such
Tax Returns and shall make such revisions to such Tax Returns as are
reasonably requested by Seller. 

  

(b) Notwithstanding _Section 9.4(a)_, Seller shall prepare or cause to be
prepared, prior to the Closing Date and on a basis consistent with past
practice (except as may be required by Law), all U.S. federal, state, local
and foreign income Tax Returns for QLT USA that are due (taking into account
all applicable extensions) after the Closing Date and have not been
filed prior to the Closing and that relate to taxable periods ending on or
before December 31, 2008 and shall deliver any such Tax Return to Purchaser
at least thirty (30) days prior to the date such Tax Return is to be filed.
Purchaser shall timely file or cause to be filed such Tax Returns. If, prior
to filing, Purchaser desires to make any revisions to any such Tax Return as
prepared by Seller, then Purchaser shall deliver to Seller any such revisions
and the associated work papers at least twenty (20) days prior to the date
such Tax Return is to be filed for SellerÂ’s review and approval, which Seller
shall consider in good faith. 

  

(c) The Parties shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably
requested by another Party, in connection with the filing of Tax Returns
pursuant to this Agreement. 

  

(d) All Transfer Taxes, if any, shall be paid by Purchaser when due. Purchaser
will, at its own expense, file all necessary Tax Returns and other
documentation with respect to all such Transfer Taxes. If required by
applicable Law and requested by Purchaser, Seller will, and will cause its
Affiliates to, join in the execution of any such Tax Returns and other
documentation. Purchaser shall provide Seller with evidence reasonably
satisfactory to Seller that such Transfer Taxes have been paid by
Purchaser.

(e) At such time as reasonably requested by Purchaser, Seller shall execute
and deliver to Purchaser a completed replacement IRS Form W-8BEN, completed
by Seller as reasonably requested by Purchaser to establish that the payments
by Purchaser to Seller pursuant to _Sections 2.2(b)(ii)_ and _2.2(b)(iii)_
(the "Deferred Payments") are exempt from withholding. 

  

(f) Purchaser agrees to take no position on any Tax Return or otherwise that
is inconsistent with treating the payments by Purchaser to Seller hereunder
(including the Deferred Payments) as payments for the Shares, which payments
are not subject to withholding under current applicable United States Tax
Law, other than any imputed interest (to the extent required by Law) with
respect to the Deferred Payments, which interest would be exempt from
withholding provided Seller delivers an IRS Form W-8BEN in accordance with
_Section 3.2(a)(ii)_ or _9.4(e)_ , as applicable. 

  

ARTICLE X 
 TERMINATION 

   

10.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time by mutual
written consent of Purchaser and Seller. 

  

10.2 _Automatic Termination_. Unless terminated pursuant to _Section 10.1_,
this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect until the earlier of
(i) such time as Purchaser is no longer obligated to make any payment of the
Purchase Price pursuant to _Section 2.2(b)(iii)_ and (ii) the
fifteenth (15th) anniversary of the Closing Date, if the cumulative Post-
Closing Royalty Amounts paid to QLT USA and/or any successor or permitted
assignee thereto (as set forth in _Section 2.2(b)(iii)_ ), up to and
including such anniversary date, is less than $250.0 million, at which point
this Agreement shall automatically terminate, except with respect to any
rights that shall have accrued prior to such termination; _provided,
however,_ that if this Agreement is terminated pursuant to the preceding
clause (i) due to a prepayment by Purchaser as permitted under  _Section
2.2(c)_, such termination shall not affect in any way any period of time
under  _ARTICLE XI_ or any right of Purchaser under _ARTICLE XI_ , and such
time periods and such rights shall remain in effect until otherwise
terminated in accordance with their respective terms. Termination of this
Agreement shall not relieve any party of liability in respect of breaches
under this Agreement by any party on or prior to termination. 

  

10.3 _Consequences of Termination_. Termination of this Agreement pursuant to
this _ARTICLE X_ shall terminate all outstanding obligations and liabilities
among the Parties arising from this Agreement except those described in: (i)

11.1 _Survival of Representations and Warranties and Covenants_. The
representations, warranties and covenants contained herein shall survive the
Effective Time for the applicable respective periods set forth in this
_Section 11.1_ (each a " _Survival Period_ "), and any and all claims and
causes of action for indemnification under this _ARTICLE XI_ arising out of
the inaccuracy or breach of any representation, warranty or covenant of a
Party must be made prior to the termination of the applicable Survival Period.
If a notice for indemnification is given, the Survival Period for such claim

of the representations, warranties and covenants of the Parties contained in
this Agreement and any and all claims and causes of action for
indemnification under this _ARTICLE XI_ shall survive as follows: 

  

(a) all representations and warranties of the Parties set forth in _ARTICLE
IV_ (other than _Sections 4.3_ and _4.8)_ , _ARTICLE V_ (other than
_Sections 5.1, 5.2_ and _5.6)_ and _ARTICLE VI_ (other than _Sections 6.1_
and _6.2_ ) shall survive for twelve (12) months after the Closing Date, all
representations and warranties of the Parties set forth in _Sections 4.3,
5.1, 5.2, 5.6, 6.1_ and _6.2_ shall survive until the expiration of the
applicable statute of limitations period and the representations
and warranties set forth in _Section 4.8_ shall survive until the earlier of

(b) all covenants, agreements and obligations required to be performed at or
before the Effective Time shall terminate at the Effective Time, if so
performed, otherwise they shall survive until performed; 

  

(c) except as otherwise provided herein, all post-Closing covenants of
Purchaser and Seller shall survive until performed; and 

  

(d) any claim for or based on any intentional or willful misrepresentation in
any representation or warranty of Seller in this Agreement or any Other
Transaction Document or involving fraud or willful misconduct shall survive
indefinitely from and after the Effective Time. 

  

11.2 _Indemnification_. 

   

(a) Subsequent to the Closing, subject to the limitations described in
_Section 11.5_: 

   

(i) Seller shall indemnify and reimburse Purchaser, for itself and on behalf
of its respective Affiliates and each of their respective officers,
directors, employees, stockholders and agents, (the " _Purchaser Indemnified
Parties_ ") from and against any and all damages, claims, losses, costs,
liabilities or expenses, including interest, penalties, reasonable attorneysÂ’
fees and expenses of investigation, response action, removal action or
remedial action (collectively, " _Damages_ ") asserted against, suffered,
sustained, accrued or incurred by such Purchaser Indemnified Party arising
out of or relating to (A) any breach of any representation or warranty made
by Seller in this Agreement or in any certificate delivered to Purchaser at
Closing; (B) any failure to perform any covenant made by, or any obligation
of, Seller in or pursuant to this Agreement; (C) any Excluded Asset or (D)
any Excluded Liability. 

   

(ii) Purchaser shall indemnify and reimburse Seller, for itself and on
behalf of its respective Affiliates and each of their respective officers,
directors, employees, stockholders and agents, (the " _Seller Indemnified
Parties_ " and collectively with the Purchaser Indemnified Parties, the "
_Covered Parties_ ") from and against any and all Damages asserted against,
suffered, sustained, accrued or incurred by such Seller Indemnified Party
arising out of or relating to (A) any breach of any representation or
warranty made by Purchaser in this Agreement or in any certificate delivered
to Seller at Closing; (B) any failure to perform any covenant made by, or any
obligation of, Purchaser in or pursuant to this Agreement; (C) any Included
Asset, with respect to any claims arising following the Closing; or (D) any
Included Liability, with respect to any claims arising following
the Closing.

(b) The term "Damages" as used in this _ARTICLE XI_ is not limited to matters
asserted by third Persons against the Covered Parties, but includes Damages
incurred or sustained by such Persons in the absence of third-Person claims,
and payments by a Covered Party shall not be a condition precedent to
recovery. The amount of any Damages under this _ARTICLE XI_ sustained by a
Covered Party shall be reduced by any amount received by such Covered Party
with respect thereto under any insurance coverage and by the amount of any
Tax benefit realized by such Covered Party in the year of the indemnification
payment with respect to the Damages (which realization, for the avoidance of
doubt, shall not include an increase in tax attributes to the extent
such attributes cannot be utilized in such year). The Covered Parties shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to collect any amounts available under
such insurance coverage and to realize any such Tax benefit with respect to
the Damages. In addition, if at any time subsequent to any
indemnification payment made pursuant to this _ARTICLE XI_ , a Covered Party
realizes a Tax benefit or receives an amount under insurance coverage with
respect to Damages sustained, then such Covered Party shall promptly
reimburse the applicable Indemnifying Party for any payment made or
expense incurred by such Indemnifying Party in connection with providing such
indemnification up to such amount realized or received by the Covered Party
(but not in excess of the indemnification payments actually received from the
Indemnifying Party in connection therewith). In furtherance of the foregoing
(and, for the avoidance of doubt, without duplication of any reimbursement
pursuant to the preceding sentence), following an indemnity payment pursuant
to this _ARTICLE XI_ by Seller to a Purchaser Indemnified Party, to the
extent the Damages giving rise to such payment result in a new or increased
tax attribute (including, without limitation, a net operating
loss carryforward) that may be utilized to reduce taxable income of such
Purchaser Indemnified Party or an Affiliate thereof in a later taxable
period: 

   

(i) to the extent the timing of the utilization of such attribute
is discretionary, in determining when the Tax benefit is realized for
purposes of this Section 11.2(b), such attribute shall be deemed to have been
utilized at the earliest permissible time, and 

   

(ii) if such Damages equal or exceed $1.0 million, such Purchaser
Indemnified Party shall (or shall cause such Affiliate to) provide Seller or
SellerÂ’s designated representative with access to review from time to time as
reasonably requested by Seller all relevant Tax Returns and financial
information of such Purchaser Indemnified Party or Affiliate until such time
as such attributes have been utilized or have expired. 

  

(c) Nothing in this Agreement shall limit any Covered PartyÂ’s obligation under
applicable law to mitigate the amount of any Damages for which it is entitled
to seek indemnification under this  _ARTICLE XI_ , and the Indemnifying Party
shall not be required to make any payment to a Covered Party in respect of
such Damages to the extent such Covered Party has failed to comply with such
obligation. 

  

11.3 _Notice of Claims_. 

  

(a) Any Party seeking indemnification hereunder (the " _Indemnified Party_ ")
shall, within the Survival Period, give to the Party which is obligated
pursuant to this _ARTICLE XI_ to provide indemnification as set forth herein
(the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") a notice (a " _Claim Notice_ ") describing in
reasonable detail the facts giving rise to any claims for indemnification
hereunder and shall include in such Claim Notice (if then known) the amount or
the method of computation of the amount of such claim, and a reference to the
provision of this Agreement or any agreement, certificate or instrument
executed pursuant hereto or in connection herewith upon which such claim is
based; _provided_ , that a Claim Notice in respect of any claim in law or
equity by or against a third Person as to which indemnification will be sought
shall be given promptly after the claim is commenced; and _provided further_
, that failure to give such notice shall not affect such Indemnified PartyÂ’s
right to indemnification hereunder except to the extent the Indemnifying
Party shall have been materially prejudiced by such failure. 

  

[*] Certain information in this document has been omitted and

    ##### 

  

  

(b) The Indemnifying Party shall have thirty (30) days after receipt of any
Claim Notice pursuant hereto to (i) agree to the amount or method of
determination set forth in the Claim Notice to pay such amount to the
Indemnified Party in immediately available funds or (ii) to provide
such Indemnified Party with notice that they disagree with the amount or
method of determination set forth in the Claim Notice (the " _Dispute Notice_
") and thereafter comply with the dispute resolution provisions set forth in
_Section 11.3(c)_. 

  

(c) If the Indemnifying Party provides a Dispute Notice, Purchaser and Seller
agree to hold a meeting, attended by the Chief Executive Officer or President
of each Party, or their executive level designees, to attempt in good faith
to attempt to resolve the matters raised in such Dispute Notice. If, within
fifteen (15) days after such initial meeting, the Parties have not succeeded
in negotiating a resolution of the matters raised in such Dispute Notice,
such matters shall be submitted to final and binding arbitration under the
then current Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration
Association (" _AAA_ ") relating to voluntary arbitrations, as more fully set
forth in _Section 12.8_. 

  

11.4 _Third Person Claims_. If a claim by a third Person is made against a
Covered Party, and if the relevant Indemnified Party intends to seek
indemnity with respect thereto under this _ARTICLE XI_ , such Indemnified
Party shall promptly notify the Indemnifying Party in writing of such
claims, setting forth such claims in reasonable detail. The Indemnifying
Party shall be relieved of their indemnification obligations hereunder to the
extent that a Claim Notice is not delivered promptly and the Indemnifying
Party is materially prejudiced thereby. The Indemnifying Party shall
have twenty (20) days after receipt of such Claim Notice to deliver to the
Indemnified Party a written acknowledgement that such claim is an
indemnifiable claim under this _ARTICLE XI_ , that it will undertake, conduct
and control (in accordance with the terms hereof), through counsel of
their own choosing ( _provided_ that such counsel must be reasonably
acceptable to the Indemnified Party) and at their own expense, the settlement
or defense thereof, and the Indemnified Party shall cooperate with them in
connection therewith; _provided_ that the Indemnified Party may participate
in such settlement or defense through counsel chosen by such Indemnified
Party and paid at its own expense, _provided further_ that, if in the
reasonable opinion of counsel for Indemnifying Party, there is a reasonable
likelihood of a conflict of interest between the Indemnifying Party and the
Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying Party shall be responsible for reasonable
fees and expenses of one counsel to such Indemnified Party in connection with
such defense. So long as the Indemnifying Party is reasonably contesting any
such claim in good faith, the Indemnified Party shall not pay or settle any
such claim without the consent of the Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnifying
Party does not notify the Indemnified Party within thirty (30) days after
receipt of the Indemnified PartyÂ’s Claim Notice hereunder that it elects
to undertake the defense thereof, the Indemnified Party shall have the right
to undertake, at the Indemnifying PartyÂ’s cost, risk and expense, the
defense, compromise or settlement of the claim but shall not thereby waive
any right to indemnity therefor pursuant to this Agreement. The Indemnifying
Party shall not, except with the consent of the Indemnified Party, enter into
any settlement that is not exclusively monetary and shall be paid entirely by
the Indemnifying Party and does not include as an unconditional term thereof
the giving by the Person or Persons asserting such claim to all Covered
Parties of an unconditional release from all liability with respect to such
claim or consent to entry of any judgment.

11.5 _Limitation on Indemnity_. Notwithstanding anything expressed or implied
in this _ARTICLE XI_ to the contrary, no Indemnified Party shall be entitled
to make a claim for indemnification pursuant to _Sections 11.2(a)(i)(A)_ or
_11.2(a)(ii)(A)_ of this Agreement unless and until the aggregate of
all Damages suffered by such Indemnified Party and its applicable Covered
Parties hereunder exceeds $150,000 (the " _Basket Amount_ "), whereupon,
_provided_ the other requirements of this  _ARTICLE XI_ have been complied
with, all subsequent Damages (not including the Basket Amount) shall become
due and payable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Basket Amount shall
apply to any Indemnified PartyÂ’s claim for indemnification hereunder to the
extent such claim results from (a) any breach of a representation or warranty
of Seller set forth in _Section 4.3_ (Capitalization), _5.1_ (Organization;
Due Authorization), _5.2_ (No Conflicts; Enforceability), _5.5_ (BrokersÂ’
Fees), or _5.6_ (Shares), (b) any breach of any representation or warranty of
Purchaser set forth in _Sections 6.1_ (Organization; Due Authorization) or
_6.2_ (No Conflicts; Enforceability), or (c) any intentional or
willful misrepresentation or fraud. In calculating the amount of Damages of
the Covered Parties, if the Damages for a claim, together with all other
Damages for any other claim(s) arising out of the same or similar events,
facts or circumstances or series of related events, facts or
circumstances, total less than $20,000, such Damages shall be excluded in
their entirety (and such items shall not be aggregated for purposes of
calculating the Basket Amount), and no Indemnified Party shall have any
recourse against any Indemnifying Party for such Damages. Notwithstanding
anything express or implied in this _ARTICLE XI_ to the contrary, (1) the
aggregate liability of Seller or Purchaser, as the case may be, to an
Indemnified Party with respect to any and all Damages arising under any
breach of any representation or warranty (other than as set forth in _Section
4.8_ (Taxes), with respect to which the following clause (2) shall apply, or
in _Sections 4.3_ (Capitalization), _5.1_ (Organization; Due Authorization),
_5.2_ (No Conflicts; Enforceability), _5.5_ (BrokersÂ’ Fees), _5.6_ (Shares),
_6.1_ (Organization; Due Authorization) or _6.2_ (No Conflicts;
Enforceability) or any intentional or willful misrepresentation, with respect
to which the following clause (3) shall apply or any fraud, with respect to
which the following clause (4) shall apply) made by Seller or Purchaser, as
the case may be, in this Agreement or in any certificate delivered to
Purchaser or Seller, as the case may be, at Closing shall not exceed ten
percent (10%) of the amount actually paid to Seller pursuant to  _Sections
2.2(b)_ and _2.2(c)_ of this Agreement (the " _10% Indemnity Cap_ "), (2) the
aggregate liability of Seller to an Indemnified Party with respect to any and
all Damages arising under any breach of any representation or warranty set
forth in _Section 4.8_ (Taxes) made by Seller in this Agreement shall not
exceed fifteen percent (15%) of the amount actually paid to Seller pursuant
to _Sections 2.2(b)_ and _2.2(c)_ of this Agreement (the " _15% Indemnity
Cap_ "), (3) the aggregate liability of Seller or Purchaser, as the case may
be, to an Indemnified Party with respect to any and all Damages arising under
any breach of any representation or warranty set forth in _Sections
4.3_ (Capitalization), _5.1_ (Organization; Due Authorization), _5.2_ (No
Conflicts; Enforceability), _5.5_ (BrokersÂ’ Fees), _5.6_ (Shares), _6.1_
(Organization; Due Authorization) or _6.2_ (No Conflicts; Enforceability)
made by Seller or Purchaser, as the case may be, in this Agreement or any
intentional or willful misrepresentation shall be limited to the amount
actually paid to Seller pursuant to _Sections 2.2(b)_ and _2.2(c)_ of
this Agreement and (4) the aggregate liability of Seller or Purchaser, as the
case may be, to an Indemnified Party with respect to any and all Damages
arising from fraud shall not be limited. The 10% Indemnity Cap and 15%
Indemnity Cap shall be cumulative, such that to the extent Damages are paid
under the 10% Indemnity Cap, the 15% Indemnity Cap shall be reduced by the
amount of such Damages, so that in no event shall the amount of Damages paid
with respect to any breach of any representation or warranty set forth in
_Section 4.8_ (Taxes) made by Seller in this Agreement, when aggregated with
Damages paid with respect to any breach of any representation or warranty set
forth in _ARTICLE IV_ or _ARTICLE V_ (other than _Sections
4.3_ (Capitalization), _5.1_ (Organization; Due Authorization), _5.2_ (No
Conflicts; Enforceability), _5.5_ (BrokersÂ’ Fees), _5.6_ (Shares)) or any
intentional or willful misrepresentation or fraud), exceed fifteen percent
(15%) of the amount actually paid to Seller pursuant to _Sections 2.2(b)_
and _2.2(c)_ of this Agreement. 

  

11.6 _Remedies_. The remedies in this _ARTICLE XI_ shall be the sole and
exclusive remedies of the parties with respect to any breach of the
respective representations, warranties, covenants and agreements pursuant to
this Agreement or otherwise arising out of this Agreement, regardless of
the theory or cause of action pled, except for the remedies of specific
performance, injunction and other equitable relief; _provided, however_ ,
that no Party hereto shall be deemed to have waived any right, claim, cause
of action or remedy if and to the extent actual fraud is proven on the part
of a Party by another Party hereto or such right, claim, cause of action or
remedy may not be waived under applicable Law.

11.7 _Limitation on Liabilities_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, no Person shall, in any event, be liable under this _ARTICLE XI_ to
any other Person for, and the term "Damages" shall not include, any
consequential, incidental, indirect, special or punitive damages suffered or
alleged to be suffered by such other Person; _provided, however_ , that if
any Covered Party is required to indemnify or otherwise pay any third party
that is not a Covered Party for any of the foregoing items, the foregoing
limitation shall not prevent the applicable Party from seeking
indemnification therefor under this Agreement so long as such Party is
entitled to be indemnified for such payment pursuant to Section 11.2. 

  

11.8 _Knowledge_. Seller acknowledges that the Purchaser Indemnified PartiesÂ’
rights to indemnification for any breach of representation, warranty,
covenant or obligation of Seller contained in this Agreement, and the rights
and remedies that may be exercised by any Purchaser Indemnified Party, are
part of the basis of the bargain contemplated by this Agreement, and
the Purchaser Indemnified PartiesÂ’ rights to indemnification under this
Agreement shall not be limited, waived or otherwise affected by virtue of
(and Purchaser shall be deemed to have relied on the express representations
and warranties set forth in this Agreement) any knowledge on the part
of Purchaser of any inaccuracy of any such representation or warranty of
Seller set forth in this Agreement, regardless of whether such knowledge was
obtained through PurchaserÂ’s own investigation or otherwise (including
disclosure by Seller or any of its Representatives), and regardless
of whether such knowledge was obtained before or after the execution and
delivery of this Agreement. 

  

11.9 _No Set-off_. Neither Seller, on the one hand, nor Purchaser, on the
other hand, shall have any right to set-off any Damages under this _ARTICLE
XI_ against any payments to be made by such Party or Parties pursuant to this
Agreement or any other agreement among the Parties. 

  

11.10 _Treatment of Indemnification Payments_. Any payments made to any party
pursuant to this _ARTICLE XI_ shall constitute an adjustment of the Purchase
Price for Tax purposes and shall be treated as such by Purchaser and Seller
on their Tax Returns to the extent permitted by applicable Law. 

  

ARTICLE XII 
 MISCELLANEOUS 

   

12.1 _Assignment; Binding Effect_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of the Parties hereto and their respective successors
and assigns; _provided_ , _however_ , that Purchaser may not sell,
transfer, assign, license, sublicense, delegate, pledge or otherwise dispose
of, whether voluntarily, involuntarily, by operation of Law or otherwise,
this Agreement or any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement
(including by operation of law) without the prior written consent of
Seller, which consent may be granted, withheld or conditioned at SellerÂ’s
sole and absolute discretion;  _provided, further,_ that (a) as long as it
would not cause any adverse Tax consequence to QLT Inc. (or its successors or
permitted assigns), Purchaser may freely, without the prior written
consent of Seller, sell, transfer, assign, license, sublicense, delegate,
pledge or otherwise dispose of this Agreement and any or all of its rights
and obligations hereunder (i) to one or more of PurchaserÂ’s Affiliates or
(ii) to any third party in connection with any sale by Purchaser of all or
substantially all of its assets and (b) any permitted assignment shall
preserve SellerÂ’s rights under this Agreement. To the extent Seller makes a
sale, transfer, assignment or other disposition of this Agreement or any of
its rights or obligations under this Agreement to a party outside the United
States without the prior written consent of Purchaser and such sale, transfer,
assignment or other disposition gives rise to a withholding tax obligation on
the payments for Shares hereunder, such withholding shall be permitted
(notwithstanding Section 9.4(f) or anything else in this Agreement to the
contrary); _provided, however_ , that prior to making any such withholding,
Purchaser shall give Seller reasonable notice of its intention to withhold
and the basis for such withholding, and shall (both prior to and after such
withholding) reasonably cooperate with Seller in its efforts to eliminate or
minimize such withholding obligations and/or to obtain credit for payment
thereof.

other right in excess of those existing without reference to this
Agreement.

controversy arising out of or relating to this Agreement) shall be governed
by the law of the State of New York without regard to conflict of

of such arbitrator. The decision of the arbitrator shall be final, binding
and conclusive on the Parties. The fees and expenses of the arbitrator shall
be shared equally by both Parties. Each Party shall initially bear its own

any matters arising out of the other PartyÂ’s performance of its obligations
under this Agreement. Each Party agrees that in the event the other Party
institutes an appropriate Action seeking injunctive/equitable relief for
specific performance under this Agreement, the Party seeking such relief
shall not be required to provide the other Party with service of process of a
complaint and summons under the procedures set forth in any Canadian or other
non-United States judicial process or system. Under such circumstances, the
Party seeking such relief need only provide the other Party with two copies
of a true, correct and lawfully issued summons and complaint, via Federal
Express (priority delivery).
