THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this " _Agreement_ ") is entered into as of
September 29, 2006, by and among Lumigen, Inc., a Michigan corporation (the "
_Company_ "), Beckman Coulter, Inc., a Delaware corporation (" _Buyer_ "), and
NLAcqCo Inc., a Michigan corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Buyer ("
_Buyer Sub_ "), the undersigned Shareholders of the Company and A. Paul
Schaap as the Shareholders Representative. Buyer, Buyer Sub, the Company and
the Shareholders are sometimes individually referred to as a " _Party_ " and
collectively referred to as the " _Parties_."

_RECITALS_

The Parties desire that Buyer Sub merge with and into the Company, with the
Company being the surviving corporation, so that the separate existence of
Buyer Sub will cease, and the Company will assume by operation of law all
assets and liabilities of Buyer Sub and thereafter continue as the surviving
corporation.

Each of the respective Boards of Directors of Buyer, Buyer Sub, and the
Company have approved this Agreement and the Merger.

The Company has only issued Common Stock. 

The undersigned Shareholders represent collectively no less than 648,000 of
the issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock of the Company and have

2\. EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK.

2.1 _Effect on Capital Stock of Buyer Sub_. As of the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any further action on the part of the holder
of any shares of capital stock of the Company, Buyer or Buyer Sub, each share

fully paid and non-assessable share of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation.

2.2 _Effect on Capital Stock of Company: Payment of Total Merger
Consideration_. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without
any further action on the part of the holder of any shares of capital stock of
the Company, Buyer or Buyer Sub, but subject to _Section 2.3_, each share of
common stock of the Company, whether voting or nonvoting (" _Common Stock_ ")
that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (a "
_Share_ " or the " _Shares_ ") shall be cancelled and extinguished and
converted, upon surrender of the certificate representing such Share ("
_Certificate_ "), into the right to receive an amount of Total Merger
Consideration as set forth in _Schedule 2.2_ (" _Merger Consideration_ ").

The " _Total Merger Consideration_ " means the Closing Merger Consideration,
as adjusted pursuant to _Section 3.4_ and _Section 11.8_. The " _Closing

_minus_ the Estimated Working Capital Deficiency, if any, each as described
in _Section 3.1_ below.

2.3 _Payment of Closing Merger Consideration_.

(a) Promptly following the Effective Time, Buyer shall deposit into an escrow
with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (the " _Escrow Agent_ ") cash in

Amount_ "), by wire transfer to an account specified by the Escrow Agent,
which is to be held to secure Shareholders obligations under _Section
3.4(a)_ and _Article 11_ below. The Escrow Amount shall be held and released
by the escrow agent in accordance with an escrow agreement in the form of
_Exhibit B_ (the " _Escrow Agreement_ ") to be executed at the Closing by
Buyer, the Shareholders Representative and the Escrow Agent.

(b) Promptly following the receipt by Buyer after the Effective Time of a
certificate representing Shares held by a Shareholder, Buyer shall deliver to
such Shareholder by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
designated by such Shareholder, an amount equal to such Shareholders portion
of the Closing Merger Consideration, minus such Shareholders portion of the
Escrow Amount, each as set forth on _Schedule 2.2_.

2.4 _Lost Certificates_. If any certificate representing Shares shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact
by the Shareholder claiming such certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed,
and an agreement by such Shareholder to indemnify against any claim that shall
be made against the Surviving Corporation or Buyer with respect to  



 

-3-  such certificate, Buyer will deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed certificate the consideration to be paid in respect of the
Shares represented by such certificate as contemplated by this Agreement.

2.5 _Stock Books_. Immediately prior to the Closing Date, the stock transfer
books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further
registration of transfers of shares of Common Stock on the records of the
Company. From and after the Closing Date, the Shareholders shall cease to have
any rights with respect to the Shares except as otherwise provided for
herein.

2.6 _Stock Options_. Hashem Akhavan-Tafti is the sole holder of all
outstanding options and other Commitments. Mr. Akhavan-Tafti holds options to
purchase 90,000 shares of unissued Common Stock. Mr. Akhavan-Tafti and the
Company agree that at or before the Closing, Mr. Akhavan-Tafti will (i)
exercise the Options as to 67,500 shares of Common Stock of the Company for
$57.78 each and pay to the Company said exercise price, and (ii) will
surrender for cancellation his remaining balance of the Options and deliver to
the Company an executed general release with respect to the cancelled portion
of the Options. Immediately upon exercise of such Options, and as a condition
to the issuance and delivery of the 67,500 shares of Common Stock of the
Company underlying such Options, Mr. Akhavan-Tafti will pay to the Company
the amount necessary to satisfy the Companys obligations to collect and pay
over all applicable Taxes to the proper Governmental Authorities required by
reason of such exercise. All Options and Commitments that are not exercised
prior to the Closing shall be cancelled, retired, and extinguished and shall
terminate and expire as of the Effective Time and the Company shall take all
actions necessary to timely effectuate such termination. Neither Buyer nor
the Surviving Corporation shall assume, become responsible for or otherwise
assume any obligations with respect to, any outstanding options, warrants or
other Commitments to purchase or otherwise acquire capital stock of the
Company, and no consideration shall be delivered or deliverable in respect
thereof.

2.7 _Shares of Dissenting Shareholders_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, as and if applicable, Shares that are issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and which are held by
Shareholders who did not vote in favor of the Merger (the " _Dissenting
Shares_ "), which Shareholders comply with all of the relevant provisions of
the applicable Legal Requirements (the " _Dissenting Shareholders_ "), shall
not be converted into or be exchangeable for the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, unless and until such holders shall have failed to perfect or
shall have effectively withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal under
applicable Legal Requirements. The Company shall give Buyer (a) prompt notice
of any demands for appraisal of any Shares or attempted withdrawals of such
demands and any other instruments served pursuant to applicable Legal
Requirements and received by the Company relating to the Dissenting
Shareholders rights of appraisal, and (b) the opportunity to direct, in its
reasonable business judgment, all negotiations and proceedings with respect to
demands for appraisal under applicable Legal Requirements. Neither the Company
nor the Surviving Corporation shall, except with the prior written consent of
Buyer, voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to
settle, any such demand for payment. If any Dissenting Shareholder shall have
failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such right,
such holders Shares shall thereupon be converted into the right to receive,
as of the Effective Time, its pro rata portion of the Closing Merger
Consideration pursuant to this Agreement.



 

-4- 3\. WORKING CAPITAL ADJUSTMENT.

3.1 _Determination of Closing Merger Consideration; Initial Adjustment_

(a) On or before a date not less than seven (7) days prior to the Closing
Date, the Company shall prepare and deliver to Buyer (i) an estimated balance
sheet as of the close of business on the date immediately preceding the
Closing Date (the " _Estimated Closing Balance Sheet_ ") and (ii) a good
faith estimate of the Working Capital as of the Closing Date (the " _Estimated
Closing Working Capital_ "), calculated in a manner consistent with 
_Schedule 3.1_. The Estimated Closing Balance Sheet will be prepared in
accordance with GAAP using the same accounting methods, policies, practices
and procedures, with consistent classifications and estimation methodologies,
as were used in the preparation of the Balance Sheet, to the extent
applicable, and will not include any changes in assets or liabilities as a
result of purchase accounting adjustments arising from or resulting as a
consequence of the transactions contemplated hereby.

(b) On the Closing Date, (i) if the Estimated Closing Working Capital is less
than the Target Working Capital, Buyer shall reduce the Closing Merger
Consideration by the dollar amount of the shortfall (the " _Estimated Working
Capital Deficiency_ "), and (ii) if the Estimated Closing Working Capital
exceeds the amount of Four Million Dollars ($4,000,000) (the " _Target
Working Capital_ "), Buyer shall increase the Closing Merger Consideration by
the dollar amount of the excess, but in no event by more than Fifteen Million
Dollars ($15,000,000) of such excess (the " _Estimated Working Capital
Surplus_ "). Buyer shall not be entitled to seek indemnification under
_Article 11_ of this Agreement with respect to any facts specifically
identified in making an adjustment under this  _Section 3.1_ to the extent
of the dollar amount of such adjustment.

3.2 _Closing Balance Sheet_. Within the sixty (60) day period following the
Closing Date, Buyer shall prepare and deliver to the Shareholders
Representative a balance sheet of the Company as of the close of business on
the Closing Date (the " _Closing Balance Sheet_ ") and a working capital
statement (the " _Closing Working Capital Statement_ ") setting forth Buyers
calculation of the Working Capital as of the close of business on the Closing
Date (the " _Closing Working Capital_ "). In connection with the review of
the Closing Balance Sheet, Buyer shall provide to the Shareholders
Representative reasonable access to all relevant books and records and
personnel of the Company.

3.3 _Disagreement and Resolution_.

(a) If the Shareholders Representative disagrees with the determination of the
Closing Working Capital as shown on the Closing Working Capital Statement, the
Shareholders Representative shall notify Buyer in writing of such
disagreement within forty-five (45) days after delivery of the Closing Working
Capital Statement to the Shareholders Representative, which notice shall
describe the nature of any such disagreement in reasonable detail, identify
the specific items involved and the dollar amount of each such disagreement
and provide reasonable supporting documentation for each such disagreement.
After the end of such forty-five (45) calendar day period, neither Buyer nor
the Shareholders Representative may introduce additional disagreements with
respect to any item in the Closing Working Capital Statement or  



 

-5-  increase the dollar amount of any disagreement, and any item not so
identified shall be deemed to be agreed to by the Shareholders Representative
and will be final and binding upon the Parties except to the extent that
corollary adjustments thereto are necessarily required as a result of
resolution of the disputed items that were so identified. If Shareholders
Representative does not so notify Buyer of a disagreement within such forty-
five (45) day period, then the Closing Working Capital delivered by Buyer
pursuant to _Section 3.2_ shall be deemed to be final and binding on Buyer
and Shareholders.

(b) Buyer and Shareholders Representative shall negotiate in good faith to
resolve any such disagreement. If Buyer and the Shareholders Representative
are unable to resolve all disagreements properly identified by the
Shareholders Representative pursuant to _Section 3.3(a)_ within fifteen (15)
days after delivery to Buyer of written notice of such disagreements, then
such disagreements shall be submitted for final and binding resolution to an
independent accounting firm of nationally recognized standing to resolve such
disagreements (the " _Accounting Arbitrator_ "). The Accounting
Arbitrator shall be an independent accounting firm of nationally recognized
standing selected by mutual agreement of Buyer and the Shareholders
Representative; provided, that (i) if, within five (5) business days after the
Shareholders Representative have delivered the notice of disagreement to
Buyer pursuant to _Section 3.3(a)_, the Parties are unable to agree on such
independent accounting firm to act as Accounting Arbitrator, Buyer and the
Shareholders Representative shall each select an independent accounting firm
of nationally recognized standing and such firms together shall select the
independent accounting firm that will act as the Accounting Arbitrator, and
(ii) if either Buyer or the Shareholders Representative does not select such
independent accounting firm within five (5) days of written demand therefor by
the other Party, the independent accounting firm selected by the other Party
shall act as the Accounting Arbitrator. Each of Buyer and the Shareholders
Representative may present a supporting brief to the Accounting Arbitrator (in
which case the presenting Party shall provide a copy thereof to the other
Party) within ten (10) days of appointment of the Accounting
Arbitrator. Within ten (10) days of receipt of a supporting brief, the
receiving Party may present a responsive brief to the Accounting Arbitrator
(in which case it shall provide a copy thereof to the other Party). Each of
Buyer and the Shareholders Representative may make an oral presentation to
the Accounting Arbitrator (in which case it shall provide prompt prior notice
of such presentation to the other Party) within twenty (20) days of
appointment of the Accounting Arbitrator. The Accounting Arbitrator will only
consider such briefs and presentations and those items and amounts set forth
in the Closing Working Capital Statement as to which Buyer and the
Shareholders Representative have disagreed within the time periods and on the
terms specified in this _Section 3.3_ and shall not conduct an independent
review. The Accounting Arbitrator shall deliver to Buyer and the Shareholders
Representative, as promptly as practicable and in any event within sixty (60)
days after such Accounting Arbitrators appointment, a written report setting
forth the resolution of any such disagreement determined in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement. The Accounting Arbitrator shall select the
position of either Buyer or the Shareholders Representative as a resolution
for each item of disagreement and may not impose an alternative resolution.
The determination of the Accounting Arbitrator shall be final and binding and
may be entered as a judgment in a court of competent jurisdiction. The fees,
expenses and costs of the Accounting Arbitrator shall be borne equally by
Buyer and Shareholders.



 

-6- 3.4 _Total Merger Consideration Adjustment_.

(a) If the Closing Working Capital as finally determined in accordance with
_Section 3.3_ is less than the Estimated Closing Working Capital (the
difference between such amounts, the " _Negative Working Capital Adjustment_
"), then, within seven (7) days following the final determination of the
Closing Working Capital, Shareholders shall pay to Buyer the Negative Working
Capital Adjustment. If the Negative Working Capital Adjustment has not been
paid in cash by Shareholders to Buyer within such seven (7) day period, Buyer
may, in its sole discretion, withdraw from the Escrow Amount any of
the unpaid portion of the Negative Working Capital Adjustment plus interest
payable under Section 3.4(c) below; provided however, that the amount Buyer
may withdraw may not exceed the amount by which (i) the Escrow Amount plus any
interest earned thereon, exceeds (ii) the amounts payable to Shareholders on
interest earned on the Escrow Amount as of such date of withdrawal pursuant to
Section 5.4 of the Escrow Agreement. In the event Buyer withdraws any amounts
from the Escrow Amount pursuant to the preceding sentence, within seven (7)
days after such withdrawal, Shareholders jointly and severally shall restore
the Escrow Amount to the amount thereof immediately prior to Buyers
withdrawal from such account by depositing with the Escrow Agent, for credit
to the Escrow Amount, an amount equal to the amount so withdrawn.

(b) If the Closing Working Capital as finally determined in accordance with
_Section 3.3_ is more than the Estimated Closing Working Capital (the
difference between such amounts, the " _Positive Working Capital Adjustment_
") then, within seven (7) days following such final determination, Buyer shall
pay to Shareholders an amount in cash equal to each Shareholders pro rata
portion thereof according to the respective number of Shares held by each
Shareholder immediately prior to the Closing. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
in no event shall the aggregate amounts (if any) paid by Buyer pursuant to (i)
this _Section 3.4_, and (ii) the Estimated Working Capital Surplus, exceed
Fifteen Million Dollars ($15,000,000).

(c) If Buyer on the one hand or Shareholders on the other hand do not pay any
of the amounts owed to the other pursuant to this _Section 3.4_, if any,
within ten (10) days of when such payment is due, then such amounts shall
incur interest at a rate of twelve percent (12%) per annum from the due date
for such amount through the actual payment date for such amount.

(d) All payments made pursuant to this  _Section 3.4_ shall be treated for
all purposes as an adjustment to the Total Merger Consolidation.

4\. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY AND SHAREHOLDERS. The
Company and Shareholders each hereby represent and warrant to Buyer as

any other equity investment or other interest in, directly or indirectly, any
corporation, joint venture, partnership, association or other Person or

(b) Prior to the date hereof, the Company has delivered, or made available to
Buyer in the online data room established by the Company for purposes of the
Contemplated Transactions (the " _Data Room_ "), copies of the Organizational
Documents of the Company as currently in effect. The Organizational Documents
do not and neither the Companys board of directors nor the shareholders have
taken any action or entered into any agreement that would grant any
shareholder "dissenters rights" or "appraisal rights" beyond those available
under applicable Legal Requirements.

4.2 _Authority; No Conflict_.

the Shareholders named as parties to the NexGen Company Agreement, (iii) by
the Shareholders of the Non-competition Agreements and (ii) by the
Shareholders Representative of the Escrow Agreement, (collectively, the

enforceable against such parties thereto in accordance with their respective
terms. Each Shareholder and the Shareholders Representative, as the case may
be, has the absolute and unrestricted right, power, authority, and capacity
to execute and deliver this Agreement and the Shareholder Closing Documents to
which they are named as parties and to perform its obligations under this
Agreement and the Shareholder Closing Documents.

(b) Except as set forth in _Part 4.2_ of the Disclosure Letter, the execution
and delivery of this Agreement by the Company, each Shareholder and the
Shareholders Representative, as applicable, and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby does not and will not (i) violate any
provision of, or result in the breach of the Organizational Documents of
the Company, By-laws of the Company, or any resolution of the shareholders or
directors or the Company in effect at the Closing; (ii) conflict with, result
in a breach of or constitute a default under, terminate or result in the

to accelerate, terminate, modify or cancel, or require any notice under any
Applicable Contract, (iii) violate or breach any applicable law, rule,
regulation, injunction, order, judgment, ruling, charge, decree or other
restriction of any Governmental Body, (iv) result in the creation of any
Encumbrance upon any of the properties or assets of the Company, or constitute
an event which, after notice or lapse of time or both, would result in any
such violation, breach, termination or creation of an Encumbrance or result in
a violation or  



 

-8-  revocation of any required license, permit or approval from any Governmental
Body or other third Party, (v) cause Buyer or the Company to become
subject to, or to become liable for the payment of, any Tax; (vi) cause any

declare a default or exercise any remedy under, or to accelerate the maturity
or performance of, or to cancel, terminate, or modify any Business Agreement.

4.3 _Capitalization_. The authorized equity securities of the Company consist
of one million shares of Common Stock, ten cents par value, 720,000 of which
are issued and outstanding as of the date of this Agreement. Other than
the Shares and options to purchase 90,000 shares of Common Stock of the
Company held by Mr. Akhavan-Tafti (the "Options"), there are no authorized or
issued and outstanding equity securities of the Company or any Commitments.
Except as set forth in _Part 4.3_ of the Disclosure Letter, the Shareholders
named in _Part 4.3_ of the Disclosure Letter are and will be on the Closing
Date the only record and beneficial owners and holders of the Shares and
Options, free and clear of all Encumbrances. Except as set forth in _Part
4.3_ of the Disclosure Letter, no other Person has ever held any beneficial or
record ownership of any Shares, Options or Commitments. No legend or other
reference to any purported Encumbrance appears upon any certificate
representing the Shares or Options. All the Shares and Options have been duly
authorized and validly issued and all the Shares are fully paid and
nonassessable. All Shares issued upon exercise of the Options in accordance
therewith will be duly authorized and validly issued and fully paid and
nonassessable. None of the Shares was issued in violation of the Securities
Act or any other Legal Requirement. Except for a 19.9% equity interest in
NexGen, the Company does not own, or have any Contract to acquire, any equity
securities or other securities of any Person or any direct or indirect equity
or ownership interest in any other business.

4.4 _Financial Statements_. The Company and Shareholders have delivered to
Buyer: (a) audited consolidated balance sheets of the Company as at December
31, in each of the years 2003 through 2005 (as at December 31, 2005, the
"Balance Sheet"), and the related audited consolidated statements of income,
changes in stockholders equity, and cash flow for each of the fiscal years
then ended, including in each case the notes thereto, together with the report
thereon of Plante and Moran, PLLC, independent certified public accountants, and
(b) the unaudited consolidated balance sheet of the Company as at August 31,
2006 prepared by the Company (the "Interim Balance Sheet") and the related
unaudited consolidated statements of income, changes in stockholders equity,
and cash flow for the eight (8) month period then ended. Such financial
statements and notes fairly present in all material respects the financial
condition and the results of operations, changes in stockholders equity, and
cash flow of the Company as at the respective dates of and for the
periods referred to in such financial statements, all in accordance with
GAAP, subject, in the case of interim financial statements, to normal
recurring year-end adjustments (the effect of which will not, individually or
in the aggregate, be materially adverse to the Company) and the absence of
notes (that, if presented, would not differ materially from those included in
the Balance Sheet); the financial statements referred to in this _Section
4.4_ reflect the consistent application of such accounting principles
throughout the periods involved. No financial statements of any Person other
than the Company is required by GAAP to be included in the consolidated
financial statements of the Company.



 

-9- 4.5 _Books And Records; Disclosure Controls_.

(a) The books of account, minute books, stock record books, and other records
of the Company, all of which have been made available to Buyer, are complete
and correct and have been maintained in accordance with sound business
practices including the maintenance of an adequate system of internal
controls. At the Closing, all of those books and records will be in the
possession of the Company.

(b) The minute books of the Company contain accurate and complete records of
all meetings held of, and corporate action taken by, the shareholders, the
Board of Directors, and committees of the Board of Directors of the Company,
and no meeting of any such shareholders, Board of Directors, or committee has
been held for which minutes have not been prepared and are not contained in
such minute books. At the Closing, all of those books and records will be in
the possession of the Company.

4.6 _Title To Properties; Encumbrances_. _Part 4.6_ of the Disclosure Letter
contains a complete and accurate list of all real property, leaseholds, or
other interests therein owned by the Company. The Company owns (with good
and marketable title in the case of real property, subject only to the
matters permitted by the following sentence) all its properties and assets
(whether real, personal, or mixed and whether tangible or intangible) that it
purports to own, including all of the properties and assets reflected in the
Balance Sheet and the Interim Balance Sheet (except for personal property sold
since the date of the Balance Sheet and the Interim Balance Sheet, as the case
may be, in the Ordinary Course of Business), and all of the properties and
assets purchased or otherwise acquired by the Company since the date of the
Balance Sheet and the Interim Balance Sheet (except for personal property
acquired and sold since the date of the Balance Sheet and the Interim Balance
Sheet, as the case may be, in the Ordinary Course of Business and consistent
with past practice), which subsequently purchased or acquired properties and
assets (other than inventory and short term investments) are listed in  _Part
4.6_ of the Disclosure Letter. For avoidance of doubt, the real property
described in the first paragraph of section 2 of _Part 4.6_ of the Disclosure
Letter (the " _Livonia Property_ ") which will be contributed to NexGen as
described in _Section 6.10_, will not comprise part of the real property
owned by the Company as of the Closing Date; provided, however, that
notwithstanding anything else the Livonia Property shall be treated as part of
the owned real property of the Comany for purposes of this _Section 4.6_.
All material properties and assets reflected in the Balance Sheet and the
Interim Balance Sheet are free and clear of all Encumbrances and are not, in
the case of real property, subject to any rights of way, building use

Except for remedies that cannot be waived by Legal Requirement, claims of
fraud or willful misconduct and injunctive and provisional relief, the
remedies provided in this _Article 11_, shall be the exclusive remedy
available to Buyer and the other Indemnified Persons for matters described in
this  _Section 11.2_.

11.3 _Indemnification And Payment Of Damages By Buyer_. Buyer will indemnify
and hold harmless Shareholders, and will pay to Shareholders the amount of
any Damages arising, directly or indirectly, from or in connection with (a)
any breach of any representation or warranty made by Buyer in this Agreement
or in any certificate delivered by Buyer pursuant to this Agreement, (b) any
breach by Buyer of any covenant or obligation of Buyer in this Agreement, or
(c) any claim by any Person for brokerage or finders fees or commissions or
similar payments based upon any agreement or understanding alleged to have
been made by such Person with Buyer (or any Person acting on its behalf) in
connection with any of the Contemplated Transactions.

11.4 _Limitations on Indemnification_.

(a) _Threshold Amount_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, Indemnifying Shareholders will not be liable for any
indemnification under _Section 11.2(a)_ unless the amount of such
indemnification for which Indemnifying Shareholders would, but for the
provisions of this _Section 11.4_, be liable exceeds, on an aggregate basis,
Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000) (the " _Threshold Amount_ "), in which case
Indemnifying Shareholders shall be liable for all such indemnification,
including the Threshold Amount, which will be due and payable in accordance
with this _Article 11_.

(b) _Cap on Damages_. Subject to _Section 11.4(c)_, the aggregate liability
of Indemnifying Shareholders for (i) any indemnification obligations pursuant
to _Section 11.2(a)_ (other than for any Environmental Breach) shall not
exceed Fifteen Million Dollars ($15,000,000) (the " _Liability Cap_ "), and
(ii) any indemnification obligations pursuant to Section 11.2(a) with respect
to _Section 4.19_ (Environmental Matters) (an " _Environmental Breach_ ")
shall not exceed the amount equal to seventy-five percent (75%) of the
dividends paid by the Company to Shareholders between September 15, 2006 and
the Closing Date (including the Closing Date).

(c)  _No Threshold Amount; No Limitation_. Notwithstanding anything else, the
Threshold Amount and Liability Cap shall not apply to any indemnification
obligations of Indemnifying Shareholders arising, directly or indirectly, from
or in connection with any claim relating to Dissenting Shares or Dissenting
Shareholders. In addition, the Threshold Amount and Liability Cap shall not
apply to any indemnification obligations of Indemnifying Shareholders  



 

-43-  arising, directly or indirectly, from or in connection with any claim
relating to or any breach of any representation, warranty or covenant made by
the Company or Shareholders in _Section 4.1_ (Organization and Good
Standing), _Section 4.2_ (Authority; No Conflict), _Section 4.3_
(Capitalization), _Section 4.9_ (Taxes), _Section 4.26_ (Brokers
or Finders) and _Section 6.10_ (Permitted Actions) unless a Disclosure
Notice is provided with respect thereto, in which case, such indemnification
obligations shall be subject to the Threshold Amount and the Liability Cap.

11.5 _Escrow_.

(a)  _Payment From Escrow Amount_. Any indemnification payments made by
Indemnifying Shareholders pursuant to _Section 11.2(a)_ shall be paid from
the Escrow Amount as set forth in the Escrow Agreement; _provided_ , _however_
, that the rights of Buyer to seek indemnification for (i) those items listed
in _Section 11.4(c)_ hereunder, or (ii) any Environmental Breach, shall not
be limited to the Escrow Amount or in any other respect (other than
the limitation set forth in _Section 11.4(b)(ii)_ above). All fees and
expenses set forth in the Escrow Agreement shall be shared equally by Buyer on
the one hand and Shareholders on the other hand. Neither the exercise of, nor
the failure to exercise, Buyers rights under this _Article 11_ will
constitute an election of remedies or limit Buyer in any manner in the
enforcement of any other remedies that may be available to it hereunder.

(b) _Escrow Reimbursement_. Buyer may seek indemnification for (i) those items
listed in _Section 11.4(c)(i)_ hereunder, or (ii) any Environmental Breach,
directly from Indemnifying Shareholders or from the Escrow Amount; provided,
however, that Buyer shall first seek such indemnification from the Escrow
Amount. In the event that any indemnification payments are paid from the
Indemnity Escrow, within seven (7) days after such withdrawal, Shareholders
jointly and severally shall restore the Indemnity Escrow to the amount thereof
immediately prior to such withdrawal by depositing with the Escrow Agent, for
credit to the Indemnity Escrow, an amount equal to the amount so withdrawn.

11.6 _Procedure For Indemnification  Third Party Claims_.

(a) Promptly after receipt by an Indemnified Person or Shareholder (each in
this context, an " _Indemnified Party_ ") of notice of the commencement of
any Proceeding against it for which such Person may seek indemnification
against a Shareholder (under _Section 11.2)_ or Buyer (under _Section 11.3_)
(each in this context, and " _Indemnifying Party_ "), respectively, such
Indemnified Party will, if a claim is to be made against an Indemnifying Party
under such Section, give written notice to the Indemnifying Party of the
commencement of such claim, but the failure to notify the Indemnifying Party
will not relieve it of any liability that it may have to any Indemnified
Party, except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party demonstrates that the
defense of such Proceeding is prejudiced by the Indemnifying Partys failure
to give such notice (it being understood, however, that where any of the
Shareholders would otherwise be an Indemnified Party or Indemnifying Party,
all references to such term as used in the procedural provisions of this
_Section 11.6_ and in _Section 11.7_ shall instead refer to the Shareholders
Representative).



 

-44- (b) If any Proceeding referred to in _Section 11.6(b)_ is brought against
an Indemnified Party and it gives notice to the Indemnifying Party of the
commencement of such Proceeding, the Indemnifying Party will, unless the claim
involves Taxes, be entitled to participate in such Proceeding and, to the
extent that it wishes (unless (i) the Indemnifying Party is also a party to
such Proceeding and the Indemnified Party determines in good faith that joint
representation would be inappropriate, or (ii) the Indemnifying Party fails to
provide reasonable assurance to the Indemnified Party of its financial
capacity to defend such Proceeding and provide indemnification with respect to
such Proceeding), to assume the defense of such Proceeding with counsel
reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party and, after notice from the
Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party of its election to assume the
defense of such Proceeding, the Indemnifying Party will not, as long as it
diligently conducts such defense, be liable to the Indemnified Party
under this _Article 11_ for any fees of other counsel or any other expenses
with respect to the defense of such Proceeding, in each case subsequently
incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with the defense of such
Proceeding, other than reasonable costs of investigation. If the Indemnifying
Party assumes the defense of a Proceeding, (i) it will be conclusively
established for purposes of this Agreement that the claims made in that
Proceeding are within the scope of and subject to indemnification and that
the Indemnifying Party is solely and irrevocably responsible for the claims
made in that Proceeding; (ii) no compromise or settlement of such claims may
be effected by the Indemnifying Party without the Indemnified Partys consent
unless (A) there is no finding or admission of any violation of Legal
Requirements or any violation of the rights of any Person and no effect on any
other claims that may be made against the Indemnified Party, and (B) the sole
relief provided is monetary damages that are paid in full by the Indemnifying
Party; and (iii) the Indemnified Party will have no liability with respect to
any compromise or settlement of such claims effected without its consent. If
notice is given to an Indemnifying Party of the commencement of any Proceeding
and the Indemnifying Party does not, within ten days after the Indemnified
Partys notice is given, give written notice to the Indemnified Party of
its election to assume the defense of such Proceeding, the Indemnifying Party
will be bound by any determination made in such Proceeding or any compromise
or settlement effected by the Indemnified Party.

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an Indemnified Party determines in good
faith that there is a reasonable probability that a Proceeding may adversely
affect it or its affiliates other than as a result of monetary damages for
which it would be entitled to indemnification under this Agreement, the
Indemnified Party may, by notice to the Indemnifying Party, assume
the exclusive right to defend, compromise, or settle such Proceeding, but the
Indemnifying Party will not be bound by any determination of a Proceeding so
defended or any compromise or settlement effected without its consent (which
may not be unreasonably withheld).

(d) Each Indemnifying Party hereby consents to the non-exclusive jurisdiction
of any court in which a Proceeding is brought against any Indemnified Party
for purposes of any claim that an Indemnified Party may have under this
Agreement with respect to such Proceeding or the matters alleged therein, and
agree that process may be served on any Indemnifying Party with respect to
such a claim anywhere in the world.



 

-45- 11.7 _Procedure For Indemnification  Other Claims_. A claim for
indemnification for any matter not involving a third-party claim may be
asserted by notice to the party from whom indemnification is sought.

11.8 _Adjustment to Purchase Price_. Any indemnification payments made
pursuant to this _Article 11_ shall be treated for Tax purposes as an
adjustment to the Total Merger Consideration.

12\. TAX MATTERS.

12.1 _Tax Matters_. The following provisions shall govern the allocation
of responsibility as between Buyer and Shareholders for certain tax matters
following the Closing Date:

(a) To the extent such Taxes are not reflected in the Closing Balance Sheet
as current liabilities or are not accounted for in the Closing Working Capital
as finally determined pursuant to _Section 3.3_, Shareholders shall pay any
and all federal, state, local and other Taxes imposed or assessed at any time
upon the Company or any Subsidiary, or on any of its or their assets, or with
respect to any receipts, income, sales, transactions or other business
activities of the Company or any Subsidiary (including without limitation the
transfer of the Companys interest in the Future Technology to NexGen as
provided in _Section 6.10_ above), with respect to the Pre-Closing Period.
Any amount owed by Shareholders pursuant to the immediately preceding
sentence shall be paid within the later of fifteen (15) days after Buyers
request for such payment and ten (10) days prior to the date of which the
Buyer is required to pay or cause to be paid any such Tax. The Shareholders
Representative, at the expense of the Shareholders, shall prepare or cause to
be prepared and file or cause to be filed all Tax Returns for the Company for
all period ending on or prior to the Closing Date that are filed after
the Closing Date. The Tax Returns referred to in the immediately preceding
sentence shall be prepared in a manner consistent with past practice, unless a
contrary treatment is required by an intervening change in Legal Requirement.
To the extent such Taxes are not reflected in the Closing Balance Sheet as
current liabilities or are not accounted for in the Closing Working Capital as
finally determined pursuant to _Section 3.3_, Shareholders shall timely pay
and discharge all Taxes shown to be due by the Company on such Tax Returns.
No later than thirty (30) business days prior to the due date of such Tax
Return. The Shareholders Representative shall provide Buyer with a copy of
each income, franchise and single business Tax Return in the form proposed to
be filed for Buyers review and approval, which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, neither the Shareholders Representative nor any Shareholder
shall file, or permit the Company to file, any amended income, franchise or
single business Tax Return relating to the Company (or otherwise change such
Tax Returns to make an election) with respect to taxable periods ending on
or prior to the Closing Date without the written consent of Buyer if such
amendment adversely affects Buyer or the Company, unless required to do so by
Legal Requirement. The Company shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file
or cause to be filed all Tax Returns of the company and its Subsidiaries
required to be filed with respect to any Straddle Period. Buyer shall permit
the Shareholders Representative to review and comment (within fifteen (15)
days following delivery) on each income, franchise and single business Tax
Return described in the immediately preceding sentence prior to filing;
provided, that the adoption of such comments shall be subject  



 

-46-  to the consent of Buyer, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.
Shareholders shall not be responsible for the payment of any Taxes
attributable to pre-closing activities of the Company that are properly
reflected as deferred Tax liabilities on the Closing Balance Sheet and which
Taxes were not required to be reported on a Tax Return for the Company for any
period ending on or prior to the Closing Date.

(b) _Apportionment of Taxes_. In order to apportion appropriately any Taxes of
the Company or any Subsidiary relating to any Straddle Period, the Parties
hereto will, to the extent permitted under applicable Legal Requirement, elect
with the relevant taxing authority to treat for all purposes the Closing Date
as the last day of the taxable year or period of the Company. In any case
where applicable Legal Requirement does not permit the Company to treat the
Closing Date as the last day of the taxable year or period with respect to
Taxes that are payable with respect to a Straddle Period, the allocation of
Taxes shall be made as follows:

(i) in the case of Taxes based upon income, gross receipts (such as
sales Taxes) or specific transactions involving Taxes other than Taxes based
upon income or gross receipts, the amount of Taxes attributable to any Pre-
Closing Period or Post-Closing Period included in the Straddle Period shall be
determined by closing the books of the Company or such Subsidiary as of the
close of business on the Closing Date and by treating each of such Pre-Closing
Period and Post-Closing Period as a separate taxable year, except that
exemptions, allowances or deductions that are calculated on an annual basis
shall be apportioned on a per diem basis; and

(ii) in the case of Taxes that are determined on a basis other than income,
gross receipts or specific transactions, the amount of Taxes attributable to
any Pre-Closing Period included in the Straddle Period shall be equal to the
amount of such Taxes for the Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the number of days in the Pre-Closing Period included in
the Straddle Period and the denominator of which is the total number of days
in the Straddle Period, and the amount of such Taxes attributable to
any Post-Closing Period included in a Straddle Period shall be the excess of
the amount of the Taxes for the Straddle Period over the amount of Taxes
attributable to the Pre-Closing Period included in such Straddle Period.

(iii) In the event that a dispute arises between the Shareholders
Representative or any Shareholder and Buyer as to the apportionment of Taxes
or indemnification or any matter relating to Taxes attributable to the
Company, the Parties shall attempt in good faith to resolve such dispute, and
any agreed upon amount shall be paid to the appropriate Party. If such dispute
is not resolved thirty (30) calendar days thereafter, the Parties shall
submit the dispute to the Accounting Arbitrator for resolution, which
resolution shall be final, conclusive, and binding on the Parties.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the fees and
expenses of the Accounting Arbitrator in resolving this dispute shall be borne
equally by the Shareholders and Buyer.

(c) Shareholders shall be responsible for, and shall pay to Buyer, the sum of
(i) the amount by which any anticipated Tax benefits from any Tax losses which
may be carried forward to a Post-Closing Period, to the extent included in
Working Capital as current assets on the Closing Balance Sheet, exceed the
actual Tax benefits realized by the Company and its  



 

-47-  affiliates from such Tax losses carried forward to a Post-Closing Period,
and (ii) the amount by which any refundable Taxes or Tax benefits for
any Pre-Closing Period, to the extent included in Working Capital as current
assets on the Closing Balance Sheet, exceed the actual Tax refunds received by
the Company and its affiliates for any Pre-Closing Period. Any amount owed by
Shareholders pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence shall be paid to
Buyer within fifteen (15) days after Buyers request for such payment or, if
within five (5) days after receipt of such request Shareholders submit the
matter to the Accounting Arbitrator for resolution, within ten (10) days
after the Accounting Arbitrator has made its final determination

12.2  _Cooperation on Tax Matters_.

(a) Buyer, Shareholders, the Shareholders Representative and the Company shall
cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other
Party, in connection with the filing of Tax Returns pursuant to this _Section
12.2_ and any audit, litigation or other proceeding with respect to Taxes.
Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the other Partys
request) the provision of records and information which are potentially
relevant to any such audit, litigation or other proceeding and making
employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional
information and explanation of any material provided hereunder. The Company
and Shareholders agree (A) to retain all books and records with respect to Tax
matters pertinent to the Company relating to any taxable period beginning
before the Closing Date until the expiration of the statute of limitations
(and, to the extent notified by Buyer or Shareholders, any extensions thereof)
of the respective taxable periods, and to abide by all record retention
agreements entered into with any taxing authority, and (B) to give the other
Party reasonable written notice prior to transferring, destroying or
discarding any such books and records and, if the other Party so requests, the
Company, as the case may be, shall allow the other Party to take possession
of such books and records.

(b) Buyer and Shareholders further agree, upon request, to use their best
efforts to obtain any certificate or other document from any Governmental Body
or any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any
Tax that could be imposed.

12.3 _Audits_. The Company and the Subsidiaries shall provide the Shareholders
Representative with notice of any written inquires, audits, examinations or
proposed adjustments by the Internal Revenue Services or any other
Governmental Body that relates to any Pre-Closing Tax Periods within thirty
(30) days of receipt of such notice. The Shareholders Representative shall
represent the interests of the Company and the Subsidiaries in any Tax audit
or other proceedings relating to any taxable periods ending on or prior to the
Closing Date, employing counsel of its choice at the expense of the
Shareholders, and shall settle any issues and to take any other action sin
connection with such proceedings relating to such taxable periods; provided,
however, that the Shareholders Representative shall keep Buyer informed of the
status of any such proceedings, shall provide Buyer with copies of any
pleadings, correspondence, and other documents, as Buyers may reasonably
request, shall consult with Buyer prior to the settlement of any such
proceedings and shall obtain the prior written consent of Buyer prior to the
settlement of any such proceedings that could adversely affect Buyer, the
Company or any Subsidiary in any taxable period ending after the Closing Date;
and provided further, however, that Buyer and counsel of its own choosing
shall have the right to participate in  



 

-48-  the prosecution of defense of such proceedings at Buyers sole expense.
Buyer shall control all other Tax audits or proceedings of the Company and
the Subsidiaries.

12.4 _Tax Sharing Agreements_. All Tax sharing agreements or similar
agreements with respect to or involving the Company shall be terminated as of
the Closing Date and, after the Closing Date, the Company shall not be bound
thereby or have any liability thereunder.

12.5 _Certain Taxes and Fees_. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,
registration and other such Taxes, and all conveyance fees, recording charges
and other fees and charges (including any penalties and interest) incurred in
connection with the consummation of the Transactions shall be borne by
Shareholders.

13\. GENERAL PROVISIONS.

13.1 _Shareholders Post-Closing Release_. Effective as of the Closing Date,
each Shareholder hereby releases and discharges the Company, its Subsidiaries
and NexGen (whether in such Shareholders capacity as a shareholder, director,
officer, employee or otherwise) from any and all claims, demands and causes of
action, whether known or unknown, liquidated or contingent, relating
to, arising out of or in any way connected with the dealings of the Company,
its Subsidiaries or NexGen, and such Shareholder from the beginning of time
through the Closing, it being understood, however, that such release shall not
operate to release the Company or Buyer from any indemnity obligations, if
any, under _Article 11_. Each Shareholder acknowledges that the Legal
Requirements of many states provide substantially the following: "A GENERAL
RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT
TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH IF
KNOWN BY HIM OR HER MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER SETTLEMENT WITH
THE DEBTOR." Each Shareholder acknowledges that such provisions are designed
to protect a party from waiving claims which it does not know exist or may
exist. Nonetheless, each Shareholder agrees that, effective as of the Closing,
such Shareholder shall be deemed to waive any such provision. Each
Shareholder further agrees that such Shareholder shall not (i) institute a
Proceeding based upon, arising out of, or relating to any of the released
claims, (ii) participate, assist, or cooperate in any such Proceeding, or
(iii) encourage, assist and/or solicit any third party to institute any such
Proceeding.

13.2 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement,
each Party to this Agreement will bear its respective expenses incurred in
connection with the preparation, execution, and performance of this Agreement
and the Contemplated Transactions, including all fees and expenses of agents,
representatives, counsel, and accountants. The Shareholders shall bear such
costs incurred by the Company. In the event of termination of this Agreement,
the obligation of each Party to pay its own expenses will be subject to any
rights of such Party arising from a breach of this Agreement by another Party.

13.3 _Public Announcements_. The Shareholders Representative, the Company and
Buyer have agreed to the text of the press release announcing the signing of
this Agreement and the Contemplated Transactions contemplated hereby. The
Shareholders Representative and Buyer shall provide to each other any
subsequent press releases related to this Agreement and the  



 

-49-  Transactions and shall consult with each other before issuing or making any
such release and neither Buyer on the one hand nor Shareholders Representative
or any Shareholder on the other hand will issue any such press release or
make any such public statement without the prior written consent of the other
(it being understood that the Shareholders Representative shall have the right
to grant consents on behalf of the Shareholders). Buyer may, without
obtaining the prior consent of Shareholders, issue such press release or make
such public statements as Buyer determines in good faith, following
consultation with legal counsel, are required by Legal Requirements or the
rules and regulations of the New York Stock Exchange, if it has used all
reasonable efforts to consult with the Shareholders Representative. Buyer,
Shareholders, the Company and the Shareholders Representative shall, and
shall cause their respective Representatives, to comply with this _Section
13.3_.

13.4 _Confidentiality_.

(a) Between the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date, Buyer,
Shareholders Representative and Shareholders will maintain in confidence, and
will cause the directors, officers, employees, agents, and advisors of Buyer
and the Company and NexGen to maintain in confidence, and not use to the
detriment of Buyer, Company, NexGen or another party any written
information stamped "confidential" when originally furnished by another party
or NexGen in connection with this Agreement or the Contemplated Transactions,
unless (1) such information is already known to such party or to others not
bound by a duty of confidentiality or such information becomes publicly
available through no fault of such party, (2) such information is
independently developed by such party without use of such information of the
other party, (3) the use of such information is necessary or appropriate in
making any filing or obtaining any consent or approval required for the
consummation of the Contemplated Transactions, or (4) the furnishing or use of
such information is required by or necessary or appropriate in connection
with legal proceedings.

(b) If the Contemplated Transactions are not consummated, each Party
will return or destroy as much of such written information as the other Party
may reasonably request. Notwithstanding anything else and whether or not the
Closing takes place, Shareholders waive, and will upon Buyers request cause
the Company, its Subsidiaries and NexGen to waive, any cause of action,
right, or claim arising out of the access of Buyer or its representatives to
any trade secrets or other confidential information of the Company its
Subsidiaries or NexGen except for the intentional competitive misuse by Buyer
of such trade secrets or confidential information.

(c) Each Shareholder shall hold, and shall use reasonable commercial efforts
to cause its Representatives after the Closing to hold in strict confidence
all confidential information relating to the business of Buyer, the Company
and each of the Companys Subsidiaries, including without limitation the
Intellectual Property Assets, except as required by Legal Requirement or
administrative process and except for information that is publicly available
on the Closing Date or thereafter becomes publicly available, in each case,
other than as a result of a breach of this _Section 13.4_.

13.5 _Notices_. All notices, consents, waivers, and other communications
under this Agreement must be in writing and will be deemed to have been duly
given when (a) delivered by hand (with written confirmation of receipt), (b)
sent by telecopier (with written confirmation of  



 

-50-  receipt), provided that a copy is mailed by registered mail, return receipt
requested, or (c) when received by the addressee, if sent by a
nationally recognized overnight delivery service (receipt requested), in each
case to the appropriate addresses and telecopier numbers set forth below (or
to such other addresses and telecopier numbers as a Party may designate by
notice to the other Parties):

11.6(d)_ herein, any action or proceeding seeking to enforce any provision
of, or based on any right arising out of, this Agreement solely may be brought
against any of the Parties in the state or federal courts located in the State
of Delaware and each of the Parties consents to the jurisdiction of such
courts (and of the appropriate appellate courts) in any such action or
proceeding and waives any objection to venue laid therein. Process in any
action or proceeding referred to in the preceding sentence may be served on
any Party anywhere in the world.

13.7 _HSR Act_.

(a) Each of Buyer, Company and Shareholders undertake and agree to file as
soon as practicable, and in any event shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to file prior to five (5) business days after the date hereof, a
Notification and Report Form and documentary materials in respect of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement that substantially comply with
the provisions of the HSR Act, and the rules thereunder, with the United
States Federal Trade Commission and the Antitrust Division of the United
States Department of Justice (and shall file as soon as practicable any form
or report required by any other Governmental Body relating to antitrust
matters) if such filing is required. Each of Buyer, Company and Shareholders
shall (i) respond as promptly as practicable to any inquiries or requests
received from any Governmental Body for additional information or
documentation, (ii) not extend any waiting period under the HSR Act or enter
into any agreement with any Governmental Body not to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except with the prior written
consent of the other Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld
or delayed, (iii) use reasonable commercial efforts to obtain an early
termination of the applicable waiting period under the HSR Act, (iv) make
any further filings or information submissions pursuant thereto that may be
reasonably necessary or advisable and (v) promptly make any filings or
submissions required under any applicable foreign antitrust or trade
regulation Legal Requirements. No Party will be obligated (except as provided
in the foregoing sentence) to take any action to obtain any clearance under
the HSR Act or to resolve any objections that may be asserted by the
applicable Governmental Body, including (without limitation) any obligation
to execute agreements, assert or defend through litigation any claim asserted
in any court, or sell, license or otherwise deal with any of its assets or
contractual rights. Each of Buyer, Company and Shareholders shall (A)
promptly notify the other Party of any written communication to that Party or
its Affiliates  



 

-52-  from any Governmental Body and, subject to applicable Legal Requirement,
permit the other Party to review in advance any proposed written communication
to any of the foregoing, (B) not agree to participate, or to permit its
affiliates to participate, in any substantive meeting or discussion with any
Governmental Body (other than telephone inquiries in the Ordinary Course of
Business) in respect of any filings, investigation or inquiry concerning the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement unless it consults with the other
Party in advance and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Body, gives
the other Party the opportunity to attend and participate thereat, and (C) to
the extent permitted under applicable Legal Requirement, furnish the other
Party with copies of all correspondence and written communications between
such Party and its affiliates and their respective representatives, on the
one hand, and any Governmental Body, on the other hand, with respect to this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (unless the furnishing of
such information would (1) violate the provisions of any applicable Legal
Requirement or any confidentiality agreement or (2) cause the loss of the
attorney-client privilege with respect thereto; _provided_ that each such
Party shall use its reasonable commercial efforts to promptly communicate to
the other Party the substance of any such communication, whether by redacting
parts of such material communication or otherwise, so that such communication
would not violate applicable Legal Requirement or cause the loss of the
attorney-client privilege with respect thereto). Notwithstanding the above
provisions, neither Party shall be required to provide the other with a copy
of the Notification and Report Form filed pursuant to this provision or of the
