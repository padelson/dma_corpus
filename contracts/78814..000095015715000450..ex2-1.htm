A. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, Purchaser
has agreed to commence a cash tender offer (as it may be extended and amended
from time to time as permitted under this Agreement, the "Offer") to acquire
all of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock ("Shares") for $14.00
per share of Company Common Stock (such amount, or any different amount per

being the "Offer Price"), net to the seller in cash, without interest.

  


 

  

B. Following the consummation of the Offer, upon the terms and conditions set
forth herein and in accordance with Section 251(h) of the DGCL, Purchaser will
be merged with and into the Company (the "Merger") with the Company as the

D. Concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and as a
condition and inducement to Parent's and Purchaser's willingness to enter into
this Agreement, Parent and Purchaser have entered into agreements with certain
stockholders of the Company, pursuant to which, among other things, such
stockholders have irrevocably agreed to tender the Shares beneficially owned
by such Persons in the Offer (each, a "Support Agreement" and, collectively,

E. The Board of Directors of Parent has, on the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth herein, approved this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated herein.

  


 

  

F. The Board of Directors of Purchaser has determined that, on the terms and

herein.

  

     


 

  

G. The Merger shall be governed by and effected pursuant to Section 251(h) of
the DGCL and shall be effected as soon as practicable following the
consummation (within the meaning of Section 251(h) of the DGCL) of the Offer

Agreement

  


 

  

The parties to this Agreement, intending to be legally bound, agree as
follows:

  


 

  

ARTICLE 1 
  
 THE OFFER

  


 

  

1.1 _The Offer_.

  


 

  

(a) Provided that this Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance
with _Article 8_ and that the Company has complied with its obligations under
_Section 1.1(f)_ and _Section 1.2_ , as promptly as practicable after the date
of this Agreement but in no event more than ten (10) business days after the
date of this Agreement, Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to)
commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) the Offer.

  


 

  

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and to the
satisfaction or waiver by Purchaser of the conditions set forth in _Annex I_
(collectively, the "Offer Conditions") as of the Expiration Date in accordance
with _Section 1.1(c)_ , Purchaser shall promptly on or after the Expiration
Date accept for payment (such time of acceptance for payment, the "Offer
Acceptance Time") and pay for all Shares validly tendered and not properly
withdrawn pursuant to the Offer that Purchaser becomes obligated to purchase
pursuant to the Offer. Parent shall provide or cause to be provided to
Purchaser, on a timely basis, the funds necessary to purchase any Shares that
Purchaser becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to the Offer. The Company
shall register (and shall instruct its transfer agent to register) the
transfer of the Shares accepted for payment by Purchaser effective as promptly
as practicable after the Offer Acceptance Time.

  


 

  

(c) The Offer shall be made by means of an offer to purchase (the "Offer to
Purchase") in accordance with the terms set forth in this Agreement, the
Minimum Condition and the other Offer Conditions. Purchaser expressly reserves
the right to (i) increase the Offer Price, (ii) waive any Offer Condition
other than the Minimum Condition and (iii) make any other changes in the terms
and conditions of the Offer not inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement;
provided, however, that unless otherwise provided by this Agreement, without
the prior written consent of the Company, Purchaser shall not (A) decrease the
Offer Price, (B) change the form of consideration payable in the Offer, (C)
decrease the maximum number of Shares sought to be purchased in the Offer, (D)
impose conditions to the Offer in addition to the Offer Conditions, (E) amend,
modify or supplement any of the Offer Conditions in a manner that adversely
affects holders of Shares generally, (F) amend, modify or waive the Minimum
Condition, or (G) extend or otherwise change the Expiration Date in a manner
other than as required or permitted by this Agreement. The Offer may not be
terminated prior to the Expiration Date, unless this Agreement is terminated
in accordance with _Article 8_.

  

  

  

    


 

  

(d) Unless extended pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, the Offer shall expire at midnight (New York City time) on the date
that is twenty (20) business days following the commencement (within the
meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) of the Offer (the "Initial
Expiration Date") or, in the event the Initial Expiration Date has been
extended pursuant to and in accordance with this Agreement, the date and time
to which the Offer has been so extended (the Initial Expiration Date, or such
later date and time to which the Initial Expiration Date has been extended
pursuant to and in accordance with this Agreement, is referred to as the
"Expiration Date").

  


 

  

(e) Subject to the parties' respective rights to terminate the Agreement
pursuant to _Article 8_ , Purchaser shall, and Parent shall cause Purchaser
to, extend the Offer from time to time as follows: (i) if on the scheduled
Expiration Date, the Minimum Condition has not been satisfied or any of the
other Offer Conditions has not been satisfied, or waived by Parent or
Purchaser if permitted hereunder, then Purchaser shall extend the Offer for
one (1) or more occasions in consecutive increments of ten (10) business days
each (or such shorter period as may be agreed to by Parent and the Company) in
order to permit the satisfaction of such Offer Conditions (subject to the
right of Parent or Purchaser to waive any Offer Condition, other than the
Minimum Condition); provided, however, that Purchaser shall not be required to
extend the Offer and the Expiration Date to a date later than the End Date;
and (ii) Purchaser shall extend the Offer for the minimum period required by
applicable Law, interpretation or position of the SEC or its staff or the
NASDAQ Stock Market ("NASDAQ") or its staff; provided, however, that Purchaser
shall not be required to extend the Offer and the Expiration Date to a date
later than the End Date.

  


 

  

(f) The Offer Price shall be adjusted appropriately and proportionately to
reflect the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend
(including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Company
Common Stock), reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification,
combination, exchange of shares or other like change with respect to Company
Common Stock occurring on or after the date hereof and at or prior to the
Offer Acceptance Time, and such adjustment to the Offer Price shall provide to
the holders of Company Common Stock the same economic effect as contemplated
by this Agreement prior to such action; provided that nothing in this _Section
1.1(f)_ shall be construed to permit the Company to take any action with
respect to its securities that is prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

  


 

  

(g) In the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to the terms
hereof, Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to) as promptly as
practicable irrevocably and unconditionally terminate the Offer, shall not
acquire any Shares pursuant to the Offer and shall cause any depository acting
on behalf of Purchaser to return, in accordance with applicable Law, all
tendered Shares to the registered holders thereof.

  


 

  

(h) As promptly as practicable on the date of commencement of the Offer
(within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act), Parent and
Purchaser shall (i) file with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO
with respect to the Offer (together with all amendments and supplements
thereto and including exhibits thereto, the "Schedule TO") that will contain
or incorporate by reference the Offer to Purchase and form of the related
letter of transmittal and (ii) cause the Offer to Purchase and related
documents to be disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case as and to the
extent required by applicable Law. Parent and Purchaser agree that they shall
cause the Schedule TO, together with all documents included therein pursuant
to which the Offer will be made (collectively and with any supplements or
amendments thereto, the "Offer Documents") filed by either Parent or Purchaser
with the SEC to comply in all material respects with the Exchange Act and the
rules and regulations thereunder and other applicable Law. Each of Parent,
Purchaser and the Company agrees to promptly correct any information provided
by it for use in the Offer Documents if and to the extent that such
information shall have become false or misleading in any material respect, and
Parent further agrees to use all reasonable efforts to promptly cause the
Offer Documents as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and to promptly be
disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case as and to the extent required
by applicable Law. The Company shall promptly furnish or otherwise make
available to Parent, Purchaser or Parent's legal counsel any information
concerning the Acquired Corporations and the Company's stockholders that is
required in connection with any action contemplated by this _Section 1.1(h)_.
The Company and its counsel shall be given reasonable opportunity to review
and comment on the Offer Documents prior to the filing thereof with the SEC.
Parent and Purchaser agree to provide the Company and its counsel with any
comments (including a summary of any oral comments) that Parent, Purchaser or
their counsel may receive from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer
Documents promptly after receipt of such comments. Each of Parent and
Purchaser shall respond promptly to any comments of the SEC or its staff with
respect to the Offer Documents or the Offer.

  

  

  

    


 

  

(i) For purposes of this Agreement, and the Offer, unless otherwise mutually
agreed to by the Company and Purchaser, any Shares subject to notices of
guaranteed delivery shall be deemed not to be validly tendered into the Offer
unless and until the Shares underlying such notices of guaranteed delivery are
delivered to Purchaser or to an agent of Purchaser.

  


 

  

(j) Without limiting the generality of _Section 9.11_, Parent shall cause to
be provided to Purchaser all of the funds necessary to purchase any Shares
that Purchaser becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to the Offer, and shall
cause Purchaser to perform, on a timely basis, all of Purchaser's obligations
under this Agreement. Parent and Purchaser shall, and each of Parent and
Purchaser shall ensure that all of their respective controlled Affiliates
shall, tender any Shares held by them into the Offer.

  


 

  

(k) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Parent and Purchaser
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold (or cause the Paying Agent to deduct
and withhold) from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to the Offer
such amounts as it is required by any Law to deduct and withhold with respect
to Taxes and any amounts so withheld shall be promptly remitted to the
appropriate Governmental Body. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and
paid to the appropriate Governmental Body in accordance with all applicable
Law, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement
as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made.

  


 

  

1.2 _Company Actions_

  


 

  

(a) The Company hereby approves of and consents to the Offer and represents
that its Board of Directors, at a meeting duly called and held, has
unanimously (i) determined that this Agreement and the Offer, the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated herein are in the best interests of the
Company's stockholders, (ii) approved and declared advisable this Agreement,
the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated herein in
accordance with the requirements of the DGCL and (iii) resolved to recommend
that stockholders of the Company accept the Offer and tender their Shares
pursuant to the Offer (such recommendation set forth in this clause (iii) the
"Company Board Recommendation"). Subject to _Section 5.4_ , the Company hereby
consents to the inclusion of a description of the Company Board Recommendation
(including the reasons therefor) in the Offer Documents.

  

  

  

    


 

  

(b) As promptly as practicable on the day that the Offer is commenced, the
Company shall, concurrently with or following the filing of the Schedule TO,
file with the SEC and disseminate to holders of Shares, in each case as and to
the extent required by applicable Law, a Tender Offer
Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 (together with any
exhibits, amendments or supplements thereto, the "Schedule 14D-9") that,
subject to _Section 5.4_ , shall contain the Company Board Recommendation. The
Company agrees that it will cause the Schedule 14D-9 to comply in all material
respects with the Exchange Act and other applicable Law. The Schedule 14D-9
shall also contain the notice of appraisal rights required to be delivered by
the Company under Section 262(d)(2) of the DGCL in connection with a merger
effected pursuant to Section 251(h) of the DGCL at the time the Company first
files the Schedule 14D-9 with the SEC. The Company agrees to respond promptly
to any comments of the SEC or its staff and each of Parent, Purchaser and the
Company agrees to promptly correct any information provided by it for use in
the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent that such information shall have
become false or misleading in any material respect, and the Company further
agrees to use all reasonable efforts to cause the Schedule 14D-9 as so
corrected to promptly be filed with the SEC and to promptly be disseminated to
holders of Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable
Law. Parent and its counsel shall be given reasonable opportunity to review
and comment on the Schedule 14D-9 and any amendment thereto prior to the
filing thereof with the SEC. The Company agrees to provide Parent and its
counsel with any comments (including a summary of any oral comments) the
Company or its counsel may receive from the SEC or its staff with respect to
the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after receipt of such comments. The Company shall
respond promptly to any comments of the SEC or its staff with respect to the
Schedule 14D-9.

  


 

  

(c) In connection with the Offer, the Company shall (or shall cause its
transfer agent to) promptly furnish Parent with a list of its stockholders,
mailing labels and any available listing or computer file containing the names
and addresses of all record holders of Shares and lists of securities
positions of Shares held in stock depositories as of the most recent
practicable date and shall provide to Parent such additional information
(including updated lists of stockholders, mailing labels and lists of
securities positions) and such other assistance as Parent may reasonably
request in connection with the Offer. Parent and Purchaser and their agents
shall hold in confidence the information contained in any such labels,
listings and files, shall use such information only in connection with the
Offer and the Merger and, if this Agreement shall be terminated, shall, upon
request, deliver, and shall use their reasonable efforts to cause their agents
to deliver, to the Company or destroy all copies and any extracts or summaries
from such information then in their possession or control.

conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the Effective Time, Purchaser shall
be merged with and into the Company and the separate corporate existence of

appropriate action to cause the Merger to become effective as soon as

2.5 _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws; Directors and Officers_. Unless
otherwise agreed to by the Company and Parent prior to the Effective Time:

  


 

  

(a) the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be
amended and restated in its entirety to be identical to the certificate of

Time, except that the name of the Surviving Corporation shall be Borderfree,
Inc.;

  

  

  

    


 

  

(b) the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated as

(c) From and after the Effective Time, until successors are duly elected or
appointed and qualified or until the earlier of resignation or removal of such
director or officer, (i) the directors of Purchaser immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation and (ii)
the officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
the officers of the Surviving Corporation.

  


 

  

2.6 _Conversion of Shares_.

  


 

  

(a) At the Effective Time, as a result of the Merger and without any action on
the part of the Company, Parent, Purchaser or the holder of any capital stock
of Parent, Purchaser or the Company:

  


 

  

(i) Each Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
other than (A) Shares that are cancelled pursuant to clause (iv) or (v) below
and (B) Shares that are owned by stockholders ("Dissenting Stockholders") who
have properly demanded in compliance in all respects with Section 262 of the
DGCL and not withdrawn a demand for, or lost their right to, appraisal
pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to such Shares ("Excluded
Shares"), shall be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal
to the Offer Price (the "Merger Consideration") without interest. At the
Effective Time, all of the Shares shall cease to be outstanding, shall be
cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each certificate (a "Certificate")
formerly representing any of the Shares (other than Excluded Shares) and each
non-certificated Share represented by book entry (a "Book Entry Share") (other
than Excluded Shares) shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the
Merger Consideration, without interest, and each Certificate formerly
representing Shares or Book Entry Shares owned by Dissenting Stockholders
shall thereafter only represent the right to receive the payment to which
reference is made in _Section 2.8_.

  


 

  

(ii) Each Dissenting Share shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of the holder thereof, cease to be outstanding, shall be
cancelled without payment of any consideration therefor and shall cease to
exist, subject to any rights the holder of such Dissenting Share may have
under _Section 2.8_.

  


 

  

(iii) At the Effective Time, each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per
share, of Purchaser issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be converted into one share of common stock, par value $0.001 per
share, of the Surviving Corporation.

  


 

  

(iv) Any Shares then held by the Company in the Company's treasury shall be
canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be
delivered in exchange therefor.

  

  

  

    


 

  

(v) Any Shares then held by Purchaser that were accepted for payment by
Purchaser in the Offer shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist,
and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

  


 

  

(b) Without duplication of any adjustment made pursuant to _Section 1.1(e)_,
the Merger Consideration shall be adjusted appropriately and proportionately
to reflect the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend
(including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Company
Common Stock), reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification,
combination, exchange of shares or other like change with respect to Company
Common Stock occurring on or after the date hereof and at or prior to the
Effective Time, and such adjustment to the Merger Consideration shall provide
to the holders of Company Common Stock the same economic effect as
contemplated by this Agreement prior to such action; provided that nothing in
this _Section 2.6(b)_ shall be construed to permit the Company to take any
action with respect to its securities that is prohibited by the terms of this
Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, the Merger Consideration, as adjusted
pursuant to this _Section 2.6(b)_ , shall equal the Offer Price, as adjusted
pursuant to _Section 1.1(f)_.

  


 

  

2.7 _Surrender of Certificates; Stock Transfer Books_.

  


 

  

(a) Prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, Parent shall designate a bank or trust
company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as agent (the "Paying
Agent") for the holders of Shares to receive the funds to which holders of
such Shares shall become entitled pursuant to this Agreement. Without limiting
the generality of _Sections 1.1(j)_ and _9.11_ , as and when needed after each
of the Offer Acceptance Time and Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall take
all steps necessary to enable and cause Purchaser to, deposit with the Paying
Agent all of the funds necessary to purchase any Shares that Purchaser becomes
obligated to purchase pursuant to the Offer and the aggregate Merger
Consideration to be paid in respect of the Shares, as applicable (the "Payment
Fund"). To the extent the Payment Fund diminishes for any reason below the
level required to make prompt payment of the amounts described in the
preceding sentence, Parent and Purchaser shall promptly replace or restore the
lost portion of such fund so as to ensure that it is, at all times, maintained
at a level sufficient to make such payments. The Payment Fund shall be
invested by the Paying Agent as directed by Parent; provided, that (i) no such
investment or losses thereon shall relieve Parent from making the payments
required by this _Article 2_ or affect the amount of Merger Consideration
payable in respect of the Shares and following any losses Parent shall
promptly provide additional funds to the Paying Agent in the amount of any
such losses, (ii) no such investment shall have maturities that could prevent
or delay payments to be made pursuant to this Agreement, and (iii) such
investments shall be in short-term obligations of the United States of America
with maturities of no more than thirty (30) days or guaranteed by, and backed
by the full faith and credit of, the United States of America. Any and all
interest or other amounts earned with respect to such funds shall become part
of the Payment Fund, and any amounts in excess of the amounts payable under
_Section 2.6(a)_ shall be promptly returned to either Parent or the Surviving
Corporation. The Payment Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. The
Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to) pay all charges and expenses, including those of the Paying Agent, in
connection with the exchange of Shares and the payment of the Merger
Consideration in respect of the Shares.

  

  

  

    


 

  

(b) Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall cause to be mailed to each Person who was, at the Effective Time, a
holder of record of Shares entitled to receive the Merger Consideration
pursuant to _Section 2.6_ (i) a form of letter of transmittal (which shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the
Paying Agent) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates or non-certificated Shares represented by Book Entry Shares
pursuant to such letter of transmittal. Upon surrender to the Paying Agent of
Certificates or Book Entry Shares, together with such letter of transmittal,
duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions
thereto, and such other documents as may be required pursuant to such
instructions, the holder of such Certificates or Book Entry Shares shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration for each
Share formerly evidenced by such Certificates or Book Entry Shares, and such
Certificates and Book Entry Shares shall then be cancelled. No interest shall
accrue or be paid on the Merger Consideration payable upon the surrender of
any Certificates or Book Entry Shares for the benefit of the holder thereof.
If the payment of any Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other
than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificates formerly evidencing
Shares is registered on the stock transfer books of the Company, it shall be a
condition of payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall be endorsed
properly or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the Person
requesting such payment shall have paid all transfer and other similar Taxes
required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person
other than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, or shall have
established to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Taxes
either have been paid or are not applicable. Payment of the applicable Merger
Consideration with respect to Book Entry Shares shall only be made to the
Person in whose name such Book Entry Shares are registered.

  


 

  

(c) At any time following the one hundred and eightieth (180th) day after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the
Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds which had been made available to the
Paying Agent and not disbursed to holders of Certificates or Book Entry Shares
(including all interest and other income received by the Paying Agent in
respect of all funds made available to it), and, thereafter, such holders
shall be entitled to look to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned
property, escheat and other similar Law) only as general creditors thereof
with respect to any Merger Consideration that may be payable upon due
surrender of the Certificates or Book Entry Shares held by them.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Surviving Corporation nor the
Paying Agent shall be liable to any holder of Certificates or Book Entry
Shares for any Merger Consideration delivered in respect of such share to a
public official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or other similar
Law.

  


 

  

(d) No dividends or other distributions with respect to capital stock of the
Surviving Corporation with a record date on or after the Effective Time shall
be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificates or Book Entry Shares.

  


 

  

(e) At the close of business on the day of the Effective Time, the stock
transfer books of the Company with respect to Shares shall be closed and
thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of Shares on
the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of
Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have
any rights with respect to such Shares except as otherwise provided herein or
by applicable Law. If, after the Effective Time, any Certificate or Book Entry
Share is presented to the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent
for transfer, it shall be cancelled and exchanged for the cash amount in
immediately available funds to which the holder thereof is entitled pursuant
to this _Section 2.7_. No Merger Consideration shall be paid to the holder of
any unsurrendered Certificate or Book Entry Share until the surrender of such
Certificate or Book Entry Share in accordance with this _Section 2.7_.

  

  

  

    


 

  

(f) The Surviving Corporation, Parent and Purchaser shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold (or cause the Paying Agent to deduct and withhold) from
the Merger Consideration payable to any holder of Shares such amounts as it is
required by any Law to deduct and withhold with respect to Taxes and any
amounts so withheld shall be promptly and properly remitted to the appropriate
Governmental Body. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid to the
appropriate Governmental Body in accordance with all applicable Law, such
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the holder of Shares in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made.

  


 

  

(g) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the making of an effective affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, which shall include an
agreement to indemnify and defend and hold harmless Parent, the Surviving
Corporation and the Paying Agent from and against any and all costs, claims,
losses, judgments, damages, counsel fees, expenses and liabilities whatsoever
which each may suffer, sustain or incur in connection with the failure of any
statement, representation or warranty set forth in such affidavit, any payment
for or transfer, exchange or delivery of such Certificate and such Person's
inability to locate such Certificate, and, if required by Parent, the posting
by such Person of a bond in customary amount as indemnity against any claim
that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent
will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate a check
in the amount (after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as
provided in _Section 2.7(f)_) equal to the number of Shares represented by
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate that have been surrendered
multiplied by the per Share Merger Consideration.

  


 

  

(h) None of Parent, Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent
shall be liable to any Person in respect of any cash from the Payment Fund
delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate or Book Entry Share has not been
surrendered prior to the 24-month anniversary of the Effective Time (or, if
earlier, immediately prior to the date on which the Merger Consideration in
respect of such Certificate or Book Entry Share would otherwise escheat to or
become the property of any Governmental Body), any such Merger Consideration
in respect of such Certificate or Book Entry Share shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation,
free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled
thereto.

  


 

  

2.8 _Dissenters ' Rights_. The Shares outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and held by a holder who is entitled to demand and properly
demands appraisal for such Shares in accordance with, and who complies in all
respects with, Section 262 of the DGCL (the "Dissenting Shares") shall not be
converted into the right to receive Merger Consideration and shall entitle
such holder only to payment for such Dissenting Shares in accordance with and
to the extent provided by Section 262 of the DGCL, unless such holder fails to
perfect or waives, withdraws or otherwise loses such holder's right to
appraisal of its Shares. If after the Effective Time such holder fails to
perfect or waives, withdraws or loses such holder's right to appraisal, each
such Share shall be treated as if it had been converted as of the Effective
Time into a right to receive the Merger Consideration without any interest
thereon (less any amounts entitled to be deducted or withheld pursuant to
_Section 2.7(f)_). The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any demands
received by the Company for appraisal of Shares, and Parent shall have the
right to participate in and, after the Offer Acceptance Time, direct all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. The Company shall
not, without the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with
respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands. Parent shall not,
except with the prior written consent of the Company, require the Company to
make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal or offer to settle
or settle any such demands.

  

  

  

    


 

  

2.9 _Further Action_. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further
action is reasonably determined by Parent to be necessary or desirable to
carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation
with full right, title and possession of and to all rights and property of
Purchaser and the Company, the officers and directors of the Surviving
Corporation and Parent shall be fully authorized (in the name of Purchaser, in
the name of the Company and otherwise) to take such action.

(a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of: (i) 200,000,000

stock of the Company have been issued, are reserved for issuance or are
outstanding. Except as set forth in _Section 3.3(c)_, there is no: (i)

3.4 _SEC Filings; Financial Statements_.

  


 

  

(a) Since January 1, 2014, the Company has filed or furnished, as applicable,
on a timely basis all reports, schedules, forms, statements and other
documents (including exhibits and all other information incorporated therein)
required to be filed or furnished, as applicable, with the SEC by the Company
(such documents, the "Company SEC Documents"). As of their respective dates
(and in the case of any registration statements, as of the effective dates
thereof), the Company SEC Documents complied, or if filed or furnished or to
become effective subsequent to the date of this Agreement, will comply, as to
form in all material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act, the
Exchange Act, and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended (together with
the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the "Sarbanes-Oxley Act"),
as the case may be. Except to the extent that information contained in any
Company SEC Document has been revised, amended, modified or superseded by a
later Company SEC Document, (i) none of the Company SEC Documents when filed
or furnished (and in the case of any registration statements, as of the
effective dates thereof) contained any untrue statement of a material fact or
omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading and (ii) any Company SEC Document filed
or furnished with the SEC subsequent to the date of this Agreement will not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. No executive officer of the Company has failed in any respect
to make the certifications required of him or her under Section 302 or 906 of
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

  


 

  

(b) The audited consolidated financial statements and unaudited consolidated
interim financial statements of the Company included in the Company SEC
Documents (i) complied as to form, as of their respective filing dates with
the SEC, in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements
and the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, (ii)
were prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting
principles ("GAAP") applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved

outstanding defaults or circumstances which, upon the giving of notice or
passage of time or both, would constitute a default or breach by the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries under any Lease Agreement. The Company has made

3.16 _Employee Matters; Benefit Plans_.

  


 

  

(a) Part 3.16(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a true and
complete list of each material Employee Plan and separately identifies (i)
each such plan that is maintained primarily for the benefit of Company
Associates in the United States (each, a "U.S. Employee Plan") and (ii) each
such plan that is maintained primarily for the benefit of Company Associates
outside the United States (each, an "International Employee Plan"). The
Company has made available to Parent or Parent's Representatives on or prior
to the date of this Agreement with respect to each material Employee Plan, to
the extent applicable: (A) all plan documents (or, with respect to any such
unwritten Employee Plan, written descriptions thereof) and amendments thereto,
and all related trust agreements, insurance contracts or other funding
documents, (B) the most recent determination or opinion letter issued by the
IRS or the United States Department of Labor ("DOL"), (C) the most recent
audited financial statement, actuarial valuation and annual report, including
Form Series 5500 and all schedules and financial statements attached thereto,
(D) the most recent summary plan descriptions and any material modifications
thereto, and (E) all material correspondence to or from the IRS, the DOL, or
any other Governmental Body for the last three years.

  

  

  

    


 

  

(b) None of the Acquired Corporations nor any of their ERISA Affiliates have
ever maintained a U.S. Employee Plan that (i) is or was subject to Title IV of
ERISA, Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA or (ii) is or was a
"multiemployer plan" as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA. None of the
Acquired Corporations have any material unfunded liability with respect to any
International Employee Plan.

  


 

  

(c) Each of the U.S. Employee Plans that is intended to be qualified under
Section 401(a) of the Code has obtained a favorable determination letter (or
opinion letter, if applicable) as to its qualified status under the Code and
to the knowledge of the Company, nothing has occurred that would be reasonably
expected to result in the loss of such qualification or exemption, except for
such events that can be remedied without material liability to the Acquired
Corporations. Each of the Employee Plans is and for the last three years has
been operated in compliance with its terms and all applicable Law (including,
in the case of the U.S. Employee Plans, ERISA and the Code), except where the
failure to operate such Employee Plan in accordance with its terms and
applicable Law did not and could not, individually or in the aggregate, result
in any material liability to any Acquired Corporation. No litigation or
governmental administrative proceeding, investigation, audit or other
proceeding (other than those relating to routine claims for benefits) is, or
during the last three years has been, pending or, to the knowledge of any
Acquired Corporation, threatened in writing with respect to any Employee Plan,
and, to the knowledge of any Acquired Corporation, there is no reasonable
basis for any such litigation or proceeding, except as has not had, and would
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a
Material Adverse Effect. All payments and/or contributions required to have
been made with respect to all Employee Plans either have been made or have
been accrued in accordance with the terms of the applicable Employee Plan and
applicable Law, except as would not result in any material liability to any
Acquired Corporation.

  


 

  

(d) No Acquired Corporation, Company Associate or, to the knowledge of the
Company, any trustee, administrator or other third-party fiduciary and/or
party-in-interest thereof, has engaged in any breach of fiduciary
responsibility or any "prohibited transaction" (as such term is defined in
Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code) to which Section 406 of
ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code applies and which could subject any Acquired
Corporation or any of their ERISA Affiliates, any trustee, administrator or
other third-party fiduciary and/or party-in-interest thereof to a material tax
or penalty on prohibited transactions imposed by Section 4975 of the Code.

  


 

  

(e) Except as set forth on Part 3.16(e) of the Company Disclosure Letter, none
of the Employee Plans provide health care or any other non-pension benefits to
any Company Associates after their employment is terminated (other than as
required by Part 6 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA or similar U.S. state law
or other applicable foreign Law) and the Company has never promised to provide
such post-termination benefits.

  

  

  

    


 

  

(f) With respect to each U.S. Employee Plan that is a "nonqualified deferred
compensation plan" (as defined for purposes of Section 409A(d)(l) of the
Code), (i) such plan has been operated in all material respects in good faith
compliance with Section 409A of the Code and all applicable IRS guidance
promulgated thereunder to the extent such plan is subject to Section 409A of
the Code and so as to avoid any Tax, interest or penalty thereunder and (ii)
the document or documents that evidence each such plan have complied with the
provisions of Section 409A of the Code and the final regulations under Section
409A of the Code in all material respects since January 1, 2009. No payments
on account of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement would cause any
material liability to an Acquired Corporation under Section 409A of the Code.

  


 

  

(g) Except as set forth on Part 3.16(g) of the Company Disclosure Letter,
neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the shareholder approval
of this Agreement, nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby could (either alone or in conjunction with any other event) (i) result
in, or cause the accelerated vesting payment, funding or delivery of, or
increase the amount or value of, any payment or benefit to any Company
Associate, or trigger any other material liability under any Employee Plan;
(ii) limit the right of any Acquired Corporation to amend, merge or terminate,
or result in a violation or default under, any Employee Plan or related trust;
(iii) result in any "parachute payment" as defined in Section 280G(b)(2) of
the Code (whether or not such payment is considered to be reasonable
compensation for services rendered); or (iv) result in a requirement to pay
any tax "gross-up" or similar "make-whole" payments to any Company Associate.
With respect to each "disqualified individual" of the Company (as such term is
defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.280G-1) who is a U.S. taxpayer, the
Company has made available to Parent or Parent's Representatives (A) a
schedule that sets forth (1) the Company's reasonable, good faith estimate of
all payments or benefits (including any accelerated vesting) that could be
provided to such disqualified individual as a result of any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (alone or in combination with any
other event), and (2) the "base amount" (as defined in Section 280G(b)(3) of
the Code) for each such individual, and (B) the underlying data and
documentation on which such schedule is based. The Company shall make such

including charges of unfair labor practices (including equal employment
opportunity laws), terms and conditions of employment, occupational safety and
health, affirmative action, terms and conditions of employment, applicant and
employee background checking, visa, immigration and required documentation,
employee privacy or harassment complaints. The Acquired Corporations are in
material compliance with any affirmative action plans and requirements. The
Acquired Corporations are in material compliance with all applicable Law
respecting labor, employment, fair employment practices (including equal
employment opportunity laws), terms and conditions of employment, workers'
compensation, occupational safety and health, affirmative action, employee
privacy, notice and other requirements under the Worker Adjustment and
Retraining Notification Act of 1988 ("WARN") and any other similar applicable
foreign, state, or local statutes or regulations of any jurisdiction relating
to any plant closing or mass layoff (or similar triggering event), and wages
and hours.

  

  

  

    


 

  

(c) None of the Acquired Corporations is delinquent in payments to any Company
Associate for any wages, salaries, commissions, bonuses or other direct

freelancer/independent contractors.

incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
State of Delaware and has all corporate powers required to carry on its
business as now conducted. Each of Parent and Purchaser is duly qualified to
do business as a foreign corporation and is in good standing in each
jurisdiction where such qualification is necessary, except for those
jurisdictions where failure to be so qualified would not reasonably be
expected to, individually or in the aggregate, materially and adversely affect

other transactions contemplated herein.

  

  

  

    


 

  

4.2 _Purchaser_. Purchaser was formed solely for the purpose of engaging in
the transactions contemplated hereby and has not engaged in any business
activities or conducted any operations other than in connection with the

and the consummation by the Parent and Purchaser of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby have been duly authorized by all necessary
corporate action on the part of Parent and Purchaser. This Agreement
constitutes a valid and binding agreement of Parent and Purchaser enforceable
against Parent and Purchaser in accordance with its terms, except as such
enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium and other
similar applicable Law affecting creditors' rights generally and by general
principles of equity.

  


 

  

4.4 _Non-Contravention; Consents_. The execution, delivery and performance by

provision of the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of Parent or
Purchaser, (ii) assuming that stockholder approval (if required by applicable
Law) is obtained, contravene, conflict with or result in a violation or breach
of any provision of any applicable Law or Order; or (iii) with or without

or change or loss of rights pursuant to, any Contract, in each case that would
be binding upon Parent or Purchaser or to which any of its properties are
subject, with such exceptions, in the case of each of clauses (ii) and (iii),
as would not reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate,
materially and adversely affect Parent's or Purchaser's ability to consummate
the Offer, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated herein. No vote

data and information regarding the Acquired Corporations' business,
properties, prospects and personnel, as Parent may reasonably request;
provided, however, that any such access shall be conducted at Parent's
expense, at a reasonable time, under the supervision of appropriate personnel
of the Company, and in such a manner as to not to interfere unreasonably with
the normal operation of the business of the Company. With respect to the
information disclosed pursuant to this _Section 5.1_, Parent shall comply

any such communications shall be conducted in such a manner as to not
interfere with the normal operation of the business of the Company.

Parent if such disclosure would, in the Company's reasonable judgment after
consultation with outside legal counsel, (i) jeopardize any attorney client or

information regarding the factual basis underlying any circumstances that
resulted in the preparation of such privileged analyses so long as such

Law, fiduciary duty or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of
this Agreement, including any confidentiality agreement to which the Company
or its Affiliates is a party (provided, that the Company shall use its

bona fide written Acquisition Proposal from a Third Party, (ii) such
Acquisition Proposal did not result from a breach of _Section 5.3_ , and (iii)
the Board of Directors of the Company or any committee thereof determines in
good faith, after consultation with the Company's financial advisor and
outside legal counsel, that (x) such Acquisition Proposal constitutes, or
would reasonably be expected to lead to, a Superior Proposal and (y) the
failure to do so would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Board
of Directors of the Company under applicable Law, then the Company may (A)
furnish information and data with respect to the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries to the Third Party making such Acquisition Proposal and afford
such Third Party access to the businesses, properties, assets and personnel of
the Company and its Subsidiaries, and (B) enter into, maintain and participate

Parent, prior to the time any such information or data is provided or made

to Parent. The Company shall notify Parent prior to furnishing any non-public
information, providing access to its businesses, properties, assets and

Acceptance Time, following the receipt of an Acquisition Proposal from a Third
Party that did not result from a breach of _Section 5.3_ , contact such Third
Party solely to refer them to the terms of this _Section 5.3_. For the
avoidance of doubt, a Person who has previously entered into a confidentiality
agreement with the Company relating to an Acquisition Proposal shall not be
required to enter into a new or revised confidentiality agreement if such
existing confidentiality agreement constitutes an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement.

  

  

  

    


 

  

(c) From and after the date of this Agreement, the Company shall as promptly
as practicable (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours) notify Parent
of any Acquisition Proposal, or any request for information or inquiry that
could reasonably be expected to lead to or contemplates an Acquisition
Proposal, which notification shall include (i) a copy of the applicable
written Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry (or, if oral, the material
terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry)
(including in each case any subsequent material amendments or other material
modifications thereto) and (ii) the identity of the Third Party making such
Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry. Commencing upon the provision of any
notice referred to above, the Company (or its outside counsel) shall (A) on a
daily basis at mutually agreeable times, advise and confer with Parent (or its
outside counsel) regarding the progress of negotiations concerning any
Acquisition Proposal, the material resolved and unresolved issues related
thereto and any other matters identified with reasonable specificity by Parent
(or its outside counsel) and the material details (including amendments or
proposed amendments as to price and other material terms) of any such
Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry and (B) promptly upon receipt or
delivery thereof, provide Parent (or its outside counsel) with copies of all
documents and written and electronic communications (other than any immaterial
documents or communications) relating to any such Acquisition Proposal
(including the financing thereof), request or inquiry exchanged between the
Company, any of its controlled Affiliates or any of its or their respective
Representatives, on the one hand, and the Third Party making such Acquisition
Proposal, any of its Affiliates or any of its or their respective
Representatives, on the other hand. The Company agrees that it and its
controlled Affiliates will not enter into any agreement with any Person which
prohibits the Company from providing any information to Parent in accordance
with, or otherwise complying with, this _Section 5.3_.

  


 

  

(d) The Company shall not, and shall cause its controlled Affiliates not to,
release any Person from, or waive, amend or modify any provision of, or grant
any permission under, (A) any standstill provision or similar provision with
respect to any capital stock of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in any
agreement to which the Company or any of its controlled Affiliates is a party
or (B) any confidentiality provision in any agreement to which the Company or
any of its controlled Affiliates is a party, provided that this clause (B)
shall not prohibit any waiver, amendment, modification or permission under a
confidentiality provision that does not, and would not be reasonably likely
to, facilitate, encourage or relate in any way to a possible Acquisition
Proposal; provided, further, that the Board of Directors of the Company shall
be permitted to grant waivers of, and not enforce, any standstill provision to
the extent that (x) such provision would otherwise prohibit the counterparty
thereto from making a confidential Acquisition Proposal directly to the Board
of Directors of the Company in accordance with this _Section 5.3_ and (y) the
Board of Directors of the Company determines, in good faith, after
consultation with outside legal counsel, that failure to take such action
would be inconsistent with the directors' fiduciary duties under applicable
Law. Except to the extent otherwise permitted by the proviso in the foregoing
sentence, the Company shall, and shall cause its controlled Affiliates to,
enforce the confidentiality and standstill provisions of any such agreement,
and the Company shall, and shall cause its controlled Affiliates to,
immediately take all steps within their power necessary to terminate any
waiver that may have been heretofore granted, to any Person other than Parent
or any of Parent's Affiliates, under any such provisions.

  

  

  

    


 

  

(e) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.3_ or elsewhere in this Agreement
shall prohibit the Company from (i) taking and disclosing a position
contemplated by Rule 14d-9, Rule 14e-2(a) or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A
promulgated under the Exchange Act, (ii) making any disclosure to the
Company's stockholders if, in the good faith judgment of the Board of
Directors of the Company or any committee thereof, after consultation with
outside legal counsel, the failure to do so would be inconsistent with the
fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors of the Company under applicable Law
or any disclosure requirements under applicable Law, or (iii) making any
disclosure that constitutes a stop, look and listen communication or similar
communication of the type contemplated by Section 14d-9(f) promulgated under
the Exchange Act that includes an express reaffirmation of the Company Board
Recommendation; provided that this _Section 5.3(e)_ shall not permit the Board
of Directors of the Company to make an Adverse Change Recommendation except to
the extent permitted by _Section 5.4(b)_ or _Section 5.4(c)_ and any Adverse
Recommendation Change will be subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement.

  


 

  

5.4 _Company Recommendation_.

  


 

  

(a) None of the Company, the Board of Directors of the Company or any
committee thereof shall (i) withhold, fail to include in (or remove from) the
Schedule 14D-9, withdraw, adversely qualify or modify (or resolve, determine
or publicly propose to do any of the foregoing) the Company Board
Recommendation, (ii) following the date any Acquisition Proposal (or any
material modification thereto) is made or commenced, or an intention to make

submit to the vote of securityholders or declare advisable any Acquisition
Proposal or the entry into any Company Acquisition Agreement (or resolve,
determine or publicly propose to do any of the foregoing) or (v) approve any
transaction under, or any transaction resulting in any Third Party becoming an
"interested stockholder" under, Section 203 of the DGCL (or resolve, determine
or publicly propose to do any of the foregoing) (any action described in
clauses (i) through (v) being referred to as an "Adverse Change
Recommendation"), except as expressly permitted by this _Section 5.4_.

  

  

  

    


 

  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, at
any time prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, the Board of Directors of the
Company may make an Adverse Change Recommendation or, subject to the payment
of the Termination Fee in accordance with Section 8.3, terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(e)_ to enter into a definitive agreement in
the event of a Superior Proposal (a "Specified Acquisition Agreement"), if and
only if:

  


 

  

(i) such Superior Proposal did not result from a breach of _Section 5.3_;

  


 

  

(ii) the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after
consultation with the Company's financial advisor and outside legal counsel,
that the failure to make the Adverse Change Recommendation or terminate this
Agreement to enter into a Specified Acquisition Agreement would be
inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors of the
Company under applicable Law;

  


 

  

(iii) Parent shall have received from the Company prior written notice of the
Company's intention to make an Adverse Change Recommendation or terminate this
Agreement to enter into a Specified Acquisition Agreement at least four (4)
business days prior to making any Adverse Change Recommendation or terminating
this Agreement to enter into a Specified Acquisition Agreement (a "Change of
Recommendation Notice"); and

  


 

  

(iv) the Company shall comply with clauses (A) through (E) (as applicable) as
follows: (A) prior to giving effect to clauses (B) through (E), the Board of
Directors of the Company shall have determined in good faith, after
consultation with the Company's financial advisor and outside legal counsel,
that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal; (B) the
Company shall have complied with _Section 5.3(c)_ with respect to such
Acquisition Proposal and shall have provided to Parent in writing the material
terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal, the most current version of
the proposed agreement under which such Acquisition Proposal is proposed, and
the identity of the Person making such Acquisition Proposal; (C) the Company
shall have negotiated in good faith with Parent (and caused its
Representatives to negotiate with Parent), to the extent Parent desires to
negotiate, during the four (4) business day period provided in the foregoing
clause (iii) of this _Section 5.4(b)_ with respect to any proposed revisions
to this Agreement or other proposals made by Parent, if any, so that the
Acquisition Proposal would no longer constitute a Superior Proposal; (D) after
considering the results of negotiations with Parent and taking into account
the proposals made by Parent, if any, after consultation with its outside
legal counsel and the Company's financial advisor, the Board of Directors of
the Company shall have determined in good faith that such Acquisition Proposal
remains a Superior Proposal and that the failure to make the Adverse Change
Recommendation or terminate this Agreement to enter into a Specified
Acquisition Agreement would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the
Board of Directors of the Company under applicable Law; and (E) if the Company
intends to terminate this Agreement to enter into a Specified Acquisition
Agreement, the Company shall have complied with _Section 8.1(e)_ and _Section
8.3(b)_.

  

  

  

    


 

  

For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of this _Section 5.4(b)_ shall also
apply to any material amendment to any Acquisition Proposal (in which case
such amendment shall require a new Change of Recommendation Notice and the
Company shall be required to comply again with the provisions of this _Section
5.4(b_ ) except that any reference to four (4) business days shall instead be
two (2) business days) or any successive Acquisition Proposals.

  


 

  

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, at any time prior to the
Offer Acceptance Time, the Board of Directors of the Company may make an
Adverse Change Recommendation with respect to an Intervening Event, if and
only if:

  


 

  

(i) the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after
consultation with the Company's outside legal counsel, that the failure to
make the Adverse Change Recommendation would be inconsistent with the
fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors of the Company under applicable
Law;

  


 

  

(ii) Parent shall have received from the Company a Change of Recommendation
Notice at least four (4) business days prior to making any Adverse Change of
Recommendation, describing the Intervening Event in reasonable detail
(including the underlying facts giving rise thereto and the reasons for such
Adverse Change of Recommendation);

  


 

  

(iii) during the four (4) business day period provided in the foregoing clause
(ii), the Company shall have negotiated in good faith with Parent (and caused
its Representatives to negotiate with Parent), to the extent Parent desires to
negotiate, with respect to any proposed revisions to this Agreement or other
proposals made by Parent, if any, that would obviate the need to make an
Adverse Change Recommendation; and

  


 

  

(iv) after considering the results of negotiations with Parent and taking into
account the proposals made by Parent, if any, after consultation with its
outside legal counsel, the Board of Directors of the Company shall have
determined in good faith that the failure to make the Adverse Change
Recommendation would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Board of
Directors of the Company under applicable Law.

  


 

  

The provisions of this _Section 5.4(c)_ shall also apply to any material
change to the facts and circumstances relating to an Intervening Event, in
which case such change shall require a new Change of Recommendation Notice and
the Company shall be required to comply again with the provisions of this
_Section 5.4(c) _(except that any reference to four (4) business days shall
instead be two (2) business days).

  

  

  

    


 

  

ARTICLE 6 
  
 ADDITIONAL COVENANTS OF THE PARTIES

  


 

  

6.1 _Filings and Approvals_.

  


 

  

(a) Without limiting the generality of anything contained in this _Section
6.1_, the Company and Parent shall cooperate with each other and use (and

efforts to take or cause to be taken all actions, and do or cause to be done
all things, reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its part under this
Agreement and applicable Law to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement as soon as reasonably practicable, including preparing and
filing as promptly as reasonably practicable all documentation to effect all
necessary notices, reports and other filings and to obtain as promptly as
practicable all consents, registrations, approvals, permits and authorizations
necessary or advisable to be obtained from any third party and/or any

order to consummate the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

  


 

  

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each of the Company
and Parent (and their respective Affiliates, if applicable) shall: (i) (x)
promptly, but in no event later than May 12, 2015, file any and all notices,
reports and other documents required to be filed by such party under the HSR
Act with respect to the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and (y) use reasonable best efforts promptly
to cause the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting periods under
the HSR Act; (ii) promptly make all filings, and use reasonable best efforts
to timely obtain all consents, permits, authorizations, waivers, clearances
and approvals, and to cause the expiration or termination of any applicable
waiting periods, as may be required under any other applicable Antitrust Laws
(to the extent required); (iii) as promptly as reasonably practicable provide
such information as may reasonably be requested by the DOJ or the FTC under
the HSR Act or by any other Governmental Body in connection with the Offer,
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, as well
as any information required to be submitted to comply with, a request for
additional information in order to commence or end a statutory waiting period;

other actions necessary or appropriate for the purpose of consummating and
effectuating the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by

reasonable actions and steps requested or required by any Governmental Body as
a condition to granting any consent, permit, authorization, waiver, clearance
and approvals, and to cause the prompt expiration or termination of any
applicable waiting period and to resolve such objections, if any, as the FTC
and the DOJ, or other Governmental Bodies of any other jurisdiction for which
consents, permits, authorizations, waivers, clearances, approvals and
expirations or terminations of waiting periods are required with respect to
the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (I) the parties agree that it is
Parent's sole right to devise and implement the strategy for all filings,
submissions, notifications and communications subject to this _Section 6.1_
and direct all matters with any Governmental Body consistent with Parent's
obligations hereunder and (II) Parent and the Company may, as each deems
advisable and necessary, reasonably designate any competitively sensitive
material provided to the other under this _Section 6.1_ as "Counsel Only
Material", which such material and the information contained therein shall be
given only to the in house and outside counsel of the recipient and will not
be disclosed by such outside counsel to employees, officers or directors of
the recipient unless express permission is obtained in advance from the source
of the materials (Parent or the Company, as the case may be) or its legal
counsel.

  

  

  

    


 

  

(c) Without limiting the generality of anything contained in this _Section
6.1_, but subject to Parent's rights under clause (I) of the preceding
paragraph (a), each party hereto shall (i) give the other parties prompt
notice of the making or commencement of any request, inquiry, investigation,
action or Legal Proceeding by or before any Governmental Body with respect to
the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (ii) keep the other parties reasonably informed as to the status of
any such request, inquiry, investigation, action or Legal Proceeding and (iii)
promptly inform the other parties of any communication to or from the FTC, DOJ
or any other Governmental Body to the extent regarding the Offer, the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or regarding any
such request, inquiry, investigation, action or Legal Proceeding, and provide
a copy of all written communications, provided that Parent shall control any
decisions and determine whether to pull and re-file any notice under the HSR
Act. Subject to applicable Law, in advance and to the extent practicable, each
of Parent or Company, as the case may be, will consult the other on all the
information relating to Parent or the Company, as the case may be, and any of
their respective Subsidiaries that appear in any filing made with, or written
materials submitted to, any third party and/or any Governmental Body in
connection with the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and shall incorporate all comments reasonably proposed by
Parent or the Company, as the case may be; provided, however, that if review
of any information would be material in connection with any second request (or
similar process) such information shall be provided solely to those
individuals acting as outside antitrust counsel for the other parties provided
that such counsel shall not disclose such information to such other parties
and shall enter into a joint defense agreement with the providing party. In
addition, except as may be prohibited by any Governmental Body or by any
applicable Law, in connection with any such request, inquiry, investigation,
action or Legal Proceeding in respect of the Offer, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, each party hereto will permit
authorized Representatives of the other party to be present at each meeting or
conference relating to such request, inquiry, investigation, action or Legal
Proceeding and to have access to and be consulted in connection with any
document, opinion or proposal made or submitted to any Governmental Body in
connection with such request, inquiry, investigation, action or Legal
Proceeding.

  


 

  

(d) In the event that any litigation or other administrative or judicial
action or Legal Proceeding is commenced challenging the Offer, the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and such litigation,
action or proceeding seeks, or would reasonably be expected to seek, to
prevent consummation of the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, Parent and Purchaser shall use reasonable best
efforts to resolve any such litigation, action or proceeding and each of the
Company, Parent and Purchaser shall cooperate with each other and use its
respective reasonable best efforts to contest any such litigation, action or
proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree,
judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts
consummation of the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.

  

  

  

    


 

  

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, with
respect to the matters set forth in this _Section 6.1_ , __ (x) none of
Parent, Purchaser or any of their Subsidiaries shall be required to, and the
Company may not, without the prior written consent of Parent, become subject
to, consent to, or offer or agree to, or otherwise take any action with
respect to, any requirement, condition, limitation, understanding, agreement
or order to (i) sell, license, assign, transfer, divest, hold separate or
otherwise dispose of any assets, business or portion of the assets or business
of the Company, the Surviving Corporation, Parent, Purchaser or any of their
respective Subsidiaries, (ii) conduct, restrict, operate, invest or otherwise
change the assets, business or portion of assets or business of the Company,
the Surviving Corporation, Parent, Purchaser or any of their respective
Subsidiaries in any manner, or (iii) impose any restriction, requirement or
limitation on the operation of the business or portion of the business of the
Company, the Surviving Corporation, Parent, Purchaser or any of their
respective Subsidiaries (any of the foregoing, a "Burdensome Condition"); (y)
the Company and its Subsidiaries will only be required to take or commit to
take any such action, or agree to any such condition or restriction, if such
action, commitment, agreement, condition or restriction is binding on the
Company or its Subsidiaries only in the event the Closing occurs; and (z)
subject to the obligations of Parent set forth in this Section 6.1, the
Company and its Subsidiaries shall only be permitted to take or commit to take
any such action, or agree to any such condition or restriction, with the prior
written consent of Parent and, if requested by Parent, subject to clause (y),
the Company will become subject to, consent to, or offer or agree to, or
otherwise take any action with respect to, any such requirement, condition,
limitation, understanding, agreement or order.

  


 

  

(f) Notwithstanding anything else contained in this Agreement, during the term
of this Agreement, neither the Company nor any of its Affiliates or any of
their respective representatives shall cooperate with any Third Party to
obtain any governmental approvals or clearances (including under any Antitrust
Law) with respect to any Acquisition Proposal.

  


 

  

(g) No party hereto shall take any action that is intended to or would
reasonably be expected to adversely affect or materially delay its ability or
the ability of any other party hereto to perform its covenants and agreements
under this Agreement or to consummate the Offer, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  


 

  

6.2 _Company Options and Company_ _RSUs_.

  


 

  

(a) _Company Options_. At the Effective Time, each outstanding Company Option,
whether vested or unvested or exercisable or unexercisable under the Company
Equity Plans, shall, automatically and without any required action on the part
of the holder thereof, be cancelled and converted into only the right to
receive (without interest) an amount in cash (less applicable Tax
withholdings), payable in a lump sum through the Company's payroll system as
soon as reasonably practicable (but no later than the second payroll period)
after the Effective Time, equal to the product of (A) the excess, if any, of
(1) the Offer Price over (2) the exercise price per share of such Company
Option, and (B) the number of Shares underlying such Company Option.

  

  

  

    


 

  

(b) _Company RSUs_.

  


 

  

(i) At the Effective Time, each outstanding Company Restricted Stock Unit
granted under the Company Equity Plans (each a "Company RSU") that is not held
by a non-employee member of the Board of Directors or the Advisory Board of
the Company, shall, automatically and without any required action on the part
of the holder thereof, be cancelled and converted into only an unvested award
representing the opportunity to receive (without interest) an aggregate amount
in cash (less applicable Tax withholdings) equal to the product of (A) the
Offer Price, and (B) the number of Shares underlying such Company RSU, which
award shall continue to vest and be subject to the same terms and conditions
(including forfeiture and time of payment) as were applicable to the Shares
underlying such Company RSU.

  


 

  

(ii) At the Effective Time, each outstanding Company RSU that is held by a
non-employee member of the Board of Directors or the Advisory Board of the
Company, whether vested or unvested, shall, automatically and without any
required action on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and converted
into only the right to receive (without interest) an amount in cash (less
applicable Tax withholdings), payable in a lump sum through the Company's
payroll system as soon as reasonably practicable (but no later than the second
payroll period) after the Effective Time, equal to the product of (A) the
Offer Price, and (B) the number of Shares underlying such Company RSU.

  


 

  

(c) At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the Board of Directors of
the Company and the Compensation Committee (as defined below), as applicable,
shall adopt any resolutions and take any actions that are necessary to (i)
effectuate the provisions of Sections 6.2(a) and (b), and (ii) ensure that
from and after the Effective Time neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation
will be required to deliver Shares or other capital stock of the Company to
any Person pursuant to or in settlement of Company Options or Company RSUs
after the Effective Time.

  


 

  

6.3 _Employee Benefits_. For a period commencing upon the Effective Time and
continuing through the first anniversary of the Effective Time, Parent shall,
or shall cause its Subsidiaries to, provide to each Company Associate who
continues to be employed by Parent or its Subsidiaries following the Effective
Time (the "Continuing Employees") total compensation and benefits (including
base salary or base hourly rate, as applicable, employee benefits and annual
bonus opportunities, other than severance benefits, equity-based compensation
and retention benefits) that are at least substantially comparable in the
aggregate to the compensation and benefits (other than severance benefits,
equity-based compensation and retention benefits) provided to such Continuing
Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time. In addition,
notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the Continuing Employees shall be eligible
for severance benefits as set forth in Part 6.3 of the Company Disclosure
Letter and (ii) Parent shall assume and honor the terms of the agreements set
forth in Part 6.3 of the Company Disclosure Letter in accordance with the
terms thereof as of the date hereof. Without limiting the foregoing:

  


 

  

(a) With respect to any accrued but unused personal, sick or vacation time to
which any Continuing Employee is entitled pursuant to the personal, sick or
vacation policies applicable to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to
the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
and instruct its Subsidiaries to, as applicable, assume the liability for such
accrued personal, sick or vacation time and allow such Continuing Employee to
use such accrued personal, sick or vacation time in accordance with the
practice and policies of the applicable Acquired Corporation.

  

  

  

    


 

  

(b) If requested by Parent at least five (5) business days prior to the
Effective Time, the Acquired Corporations shall terminate any and all U.S.
Employee Plans intended to qualify under Section 401(k) of the Code (the
"401(k) Plan(s)"), effective not later than the business day immediately
preceding the Effective Time. In the event that Parent requests that such
401(k) plan(s) be terminated, the Acquired Corporations shall provide Parent
with evidence that such 401(k) plan(s) have been terminated pursuant to
resolution of the Company's Board of Directors not later than two (2) business
days immediately preceding the Effective Time.

  


 

  

(c) To the extent that service is relevant for eligibility, vesting or
allowances (including paid time off) under any employee benefit plan of
Parent, its Subsidiaries or the Surviving Corporation in which a Continuing
Employee may be eligible to participate, then Parent shall use reasonable best
efforts to cause such employee benefit plan (to the extent that it would not
result in any duplication of benefits), for purposes of eligibility, vesting
and allowances (including paid time off), but not for purposes of benefit
accrual, to credit Continuing Employees for service prior to the Effective
Time with the Acquired Corporations to the same extent that such service was
recognized prior to the Effective Time under the corresponding employee
benefit plan of the Company.

  


 

  

(d) With respect to all employees, the Acquired Corporations shall be
responsible for providing any notices required to be given and otherwise
complying with the WARN or similar statutes or regulations of any jurisdiction
relating to any plant closing or mass layoff (or similar triggering event)
prior to the Effective Time. If Parent determines that an event would trigger
WARN obligations (or obligations arising under similar statutes or
regulations) on or after the Effective Time, Parent shall be responsible for
providing notices to all employees as are required to be provided notice under
WARN (or any similar statute or regulation), in a form that is compliant with
applicable regulations.

  


 

  

(e) Nothing in this _Section 6.3_ or elsewhere in this Agreement is intended
nor shall be construed to (i) be treated as an amendment to any Employee Plan,
(ii) prevent Parent from amending or terminating any of its employee benefit
plans in accordance their terms, (iii) create a right in any Company Associate
to employment with Parent, its Subsidiaries, the Surviving Corporation or any
other Subsidiary of the Surviving Corporation, and the employment of each
Continuing Employee shall be "at will" employment, or (iv) create any third-
party beneficiary rights in any employee of the Acquired Corporations or the
Surviving Corporation, any beneficiary or dependent thereof, or any collective
bargaining representative thereof, with respect to the compensation, terms and
conditions of employment and/or benefits that may be provided to any
Continuing Employee by Parent or the Company or under any benefit plan which
Parent, any Acquired Corporation or the Surviving Corporation may maintain.

  


 

  

6.4 _Indemnification of Officers and Directors_.

  


 

  

(a) For six (6) years after the Effective Time, Surviving Corporation shall,
and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain officers' and
directors' liability, employment practices liability and fiduciary liability
insurance in respect of acts or omissions occurring on or prior to the
Effective Time covering each such person covered by the Company's officers'
and directors' liability, employment practices liability and fiduciary
liability insurance policies as of the date hereof on terms with respect to
coverage and amount no less favorable than those of such policies in effect on
the date hereof; provided, however, that in satisfying its obligation under
this _Section 6.4(a)_ , neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be
obligated to pay annual premiums in excess of 250% of the aggregate annual
premium paid by the Company in its last full fiscal year prior to the date of
this Agreement that is set forth on Part 6.4(a) of the Company Disclosure
Letter (the "Current Premium") and if such premiums for such insurance would
at any time exceed 250% of the Current Premium, then the Surviving Corporation
shall cause to be maintained policies of insurance that, in the Surviving
Corporation's good faith judgment, provide the maximum coverage available at
an annual premium equal to 250% of the Current Premium. The provisions of the
immediately preceding sentence shall be deemed to have been satisfied if
prepaid "tail" or "runoff" policies have been obtained by the Company prior to
the Effective Time, which policies provide such directors and officers with
coverage for an aggregate period of six (6) years with respect to claims
arising from acts or omissions that occurred on or before the Effective Time,
including, in respect of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;
provided, however, that the amount paid for such prepaid policies does not
exceed 250% of the Current Premium. If such prepaid policies have been
obtained prior to the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall (and
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) maintain such policies in
full force and effect for their full term, and continue to honor the
obligations thereunder.

  

  

  

    


 

  

(b) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation, to the fullest extent that would
have been permitted under the Laws applicable to the Company prior to the
Effective Time: (i) indemnify and hold harmless each individual who at the
Effective Time is, or at any time prior to the Effective Time was, a director
or officer of the Company or of a Subsidiary of the Company (each, in his
capacity as such, an "Indemnified Party") for any and all reasonable costs,
expenses (including reasonable fees and expenses of legal counsel, which shall
be advanced as they are incurred, provided that the Indemnified Party shall
have made an undertaking to repay such expenses if it is ultimately determined
that such Indemnified Party was not entitled to indemnification under this
_Section 6.4(b)_ ), judgments, fines, penalties or liabilities (including
amounts paid in settlement or compromise) imposed upon or reasonably incurred
by such Indemnified Party in connection with or arising out of any action,
suit or other proceeding (whether civil or criminal, and including any
proceeding before any administrative or legislative body or agency) in which
such Indemnified Party may be involved or with which he or she may be
threatened (regardless of whether as a named party or as a participant other
than as a named party, including, without limitation, as a witness) (a
"Proceeding") by reason of such Indemnified Party's being or having been such
director or officer or an employee or agent of the Company or otherwise in
connection with any action taken or not taken at the request of the Company
(whether or not the Indemnified Party continues in such position at the time
such Proceeding is brought or threatened), in each case at, or at any time
prior to, the Effective Time (including any Proceeding relating in whole or in
part to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or relating to the
enforcement of this provision or any other indemnification or advancement
right of any Indemnified Party); and (ii) fulfill and honor in all respects
the obligations of the Company pursuant to: (x) each indemnification agreement
in effect between the Company and any Indemnified Party as of the date of this
Agreement; and (y) any indemnification provision (including advancement of
expenses) and any exculpation provision set forth in the certificate of
incorporation or bylaws of the Company as in effect on the date of this
Agreement. The Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, advance all expenses, including reasonable
attorneys' fees, that may be reasonably incurred by the Indemnified Parties in
connection with their enforcement of their rights provided under this _Section
6.4_ (subject to reimbursement to the extent the Indemnified Party is
subsequently determined not to be entitled to indemnification (and the
Indemnified Party shall provide an undertaking to this effect prior to
receiving such advance)). The Surviving Corporation's obligations under the
foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) shall continue in full force and effect for a
period of six (6) years from the Effective Time; provided, however, that all
rights to indemnification, exculpation and advancement of expenses in respect
of any claim asserted or made within such period shall continue until the
final disposition of such claim.

  

  

  

    


 

  

(c) If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns
(i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person, then, and in each such case proper provision shall be
made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving
Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the applicable obligations set
forth in this _Section 6.4_.

  


 

  

(d) The provisions of this _Section 6.4_ are (i) intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and his or her
heirs and (ii) in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights
to indemnification or contribution that any such individual may have under any
certificate of incorporation or bylaws, by contract or otherwise. The
obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this _Section 6.4_
shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect
the rights of any Indemnified Party to whom this _Section 6.4_ applies unless
the affected Indemnified Party shall have consented in writing to such
termination or modification (it being expressly agreed that the Indemnified
Parties to whom this _Section 6.4_ applies shall be third party beneficiaries
of this _Section 6.4_ ).

  


 

  

6.5 _Stockholder Litigation_. The Company shall provide Parent with prompt
notice of any claim or Legal Proceeding (including any class action or
derivative litigation) brought, asserted or commenced by, on behalf of or in
the name of, against or otherwise involving the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, the Board of Directors of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, any committee thereof and/or any of the Company's directors or
officers relating to the Offer, the Merger, this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and shall keep Parent informed on
a reasonably prompt basis with respect to the status thereof. The Company
shall give Parent the opportunity to participate (at Parent's expense) in the
defense or settlement of any such litigation, and no such settlement shall be
agreed to without the Parent's prior written consent.

  

  

  

    


 

  

6.6 _Disclosure_. The initial press releases relating to this Agreement shall
be issued seperately by the Company and Parent and each such press release
shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Company and Parent and thereafter
Parent and the Company shall consult with each other before issuing any
further press release(s) or otherwise making any public statement (to the
extent not previously issued or made in accordance with this Agreement) with
respect to the Offer, the Merger, this Agreement or any of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and shall not issue any such press
release or public statement without the other party's written consent, which
shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. Notwithstanding
the foregoing: (a) each of the Company and Parent may, without such
consultation or consent, make any public statement in response to questions
from the press, analysts, investors or those attending industry conferences,
make internal announcements to employees and make disclosures in Company SEC
Documents, so long as such statements are consistent with previous press
releases, public disclosures or public statements made jointly by the parties
(or individually, if approved by the other party); (b) each of the Company and
Parent may, without the prior consent of the other party but subject to giving
advance notice to the other party, issue any such press release or make any
such public announcement or statement as may be required by Law (including the
stock exchange rules); and (c) the Company need not consult with Parent in
connection with such portion of any press release, public statement or filing

 TERMINATION

  


 

  

8.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated prior to the Offer
Acceptance Time:

  


 

  

(a) by mutual written consent of Parent and the Company;

  


 

  

(b) by either Parent or the Company by written notice to the other if (i) a
court of competent jurisdiction or other Governmental Body shall have issued a
final and nonappealable Order permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise
prohibiting the making or consummation of the Offer, the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (ii) if there shall be any
applicable Law making the making or consummation of the Offer, the Merger or
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement illegal;

  


 

  

(c) by Parent by written notice to the Company if prior to the Offer
Acceptance Time: (i) the Board of Directors of the Company shall have effected
an Adverse Change Recommendation or delivered to Parent a Change of
Recommendation Notice or (ii) in the case of a tender offer or exchange offer
subject to Regulation 14D under the Exchange Act (other than by Parent and its

Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9, recommend rejection
of such tender offer or exchange offer and reaffirm the Company Board
Recommendation within ten (10) business days of the commencement of such
tender offer or exchange offer;

  


 

  

(d) by either the Company or Purchaser if the Offer Acceptance Time shall not
have occurred by the End Date; provided, however, that the right to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1(d)_ shall not be available to any
party whose breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement set
forth in this Agreement has been the principal cause of, or resulted in, the
failure of the Offer Acceptance Time to have occurred on or before the End
Date ;

  


 

  

(e) by the Company by written notice to Parent at any time prior to the Offer
Acceptance Time in order to accept a Superior Proposal and enter into a
Specified Acquisition Agreement relating to such Superior Proposal, if (i)
such Superior Proposal shall not have resulted from any breach of _Section
5.3_, (ii) the Company has complied with its obligations under _Section 5.3_
and _Section 5.4_ and the Board of Directors of the Company, after satisfying
all of the applicable requirements set forth in _Section 5.4(b)_, shall have
authorized the Company to enter into a Specified Acquisition Agreement and
(iii) the Company enters into the Specified Acquisition Agreement and pays the
Termination Fee as provided in _Section 8.3(b)_ substantially concurrently
with the termination of this Agreement;

  


 

  

(f) by Parent by written notice to the Company at any time prior to the Offer
Acceptance Time if a breach of any representation or warranty or failure to
perform any covenant or obligation contained in this Agreement on the part of
the Company shall have occurred that would cause a failure of the conditions
in clauses (2)(c), (d) or (e) of _Annex I_ to occur; provided, however, that,
for purposes of this _Section 8.1(f)_, if such a breach is curable by the
Company within the earlier of the End Date and twenty (20) business days of
the date Parent gives the Company notice of such breach and the Company is
continuing to use its reasonable best efforts to cure such breach, then Parent
may not terminate this Agreement under this _Section 8.1(f)_ on account of
such breach unless such breach shall remain uncured upon the earlier of the
End Date and the expiration of such twenty (20) business day period; provided
__ further, however, that Parent shall not be entitled to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1(f)_ if either Parent or Purchaser is
in breach of its obligations under this Agreement such that the Company would
be entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(g)_ ; or

  

  

  

    


 

  

(g) by the Company by written notice to Parent at any time prior to the Offer
Acceptance Time, if a breach in any respect of any representation or warranty
or failure to perform in any respect any covenant or obligation contained in
this Agreement on the part of Parent shall have occurred, in each case if such
breach or failure has had or could reasonably be expected to prevent Parent or
Purchaser from consummating the Offer, the Merger or any other transaction
contemplated herein; provided, however, that, for purposes of this _Section
8.1(g)_ , if such a breach is curable by Parent within the earlier of the End
Date and twenty (20) business days of the date the Company gives Parent notice
of such breach and Parent is continuing to use its reasonable best efforts to
cure such breach, then the Company may not terminate this Agreement under this
_Section 8.1(g)_ on account of such breach unless such breach shall remain
uncured upon the earlier of the End Date and the expiration of such twenty
(20) business day period; provided further, however, that the Company shall
not be entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1(g)_
if the Company is in breach of its obligations under this Agreement such that
Parent would be entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section
8.1(f)_.

  


 

  

8.2 _Effect of Termination_. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
_Section 8.1_, this Agreement shall be of no further force or effect without
liability of any party (or any Representative of such party) to each other
party hereto; provided, however, that the provisions of this _Section 8.2_ ,
the penultimate sentence of _Section 5.1(a)_ , _Section 8.3_ and _Article 9_
shall survive any termination hereof pursuant to _Section 8.1_.
Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, none of Parent, Purchaser or the Company shall be relieved or
released from any liabilities or damages arising out of any Willful Breach of
any provision of this Agreement or any other agreement delivered in connection
herewith or any fraud. The Confidentiality Agreement shall survive the
termination of this Agreement and shall remain in full force and effect in
accordance with its terms.

  


 

  

8.3 _Expenses; Termination Fee_.

  


 

  

(a) Except as set forth in _Section 6.10_ and this _Section 8.3_ , all fees
and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Offer, the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated herein shall be paid by the
party incurring such expenses, whether or not the Offer and Merger are
consummated. For the avoidance of doubt, Parent shall pay all filing fees
payable pursuant to the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Laws.

  


 

  

(b) In the event that:

  

  

  

    


 

  

(i) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section_ _8.1(c)_ ,

  


 

  

(ii) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 8.1(e)_ (including as
it relates to _Section 5.4_ ), or

  


 

  

(iii) (A) this Agreement is terminated by Parent, Purchaser or the Company
pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)_ or _Section 8.1(f)_ , (B) after the date of this
Agreement and at or prior to the time of the termination of this Agreement an
Acquisition Proposal shall have been made or commenced, or an intention to
make or commence any Acquisition Proposal shall have been publicly proposed or
announced, and (C) the Company consummates an Acquisition Proposal within
twelve (12) months after such termination or the Company enters into a
definitive agreement within twelve (12) months after such termination to
effect an Acquisition Proposal (provided that, for purposes of this _Section
8.3(b)(iii)_ , all percentages in the definition of Acquisition Proposal shall
be replaced with 50%).

  


 

  

then the Company shall pay Parent a fee in an amount equal to $17,000,000 (the
"Termination Fee") by wire transfer of same-day funds (x) in the case of
_Section 8.3(b)(i)_ , within two (2) business days after such termination, (y)
in the case of _Section 8.3(b)(ii)_ , substantially concurrently with the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(e)_ , and (z) in the
case of the _Section 8.3(b)(iii)_ , within two (2) business days after the
earlier of (1) the date of the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by such Acquisition Proposal and (2) the date of entry into the definitive
agreement to effect such Acquisition Proposal. For the avoidance of doubt, any
payment made by the Company under this _Section 8.3(b)_ shall be payable only
once with respect to this _Section 8.3(b)_ and not in duplication even though
such payment may be payable under one or more provisions hereof.

  


 

  

(c) The Company and Parent acknowledge and agree that the agreements contained
in _Section 8.3_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the Company and Parent would
not enter into this Agreement. In the event that the Company or Parent, as the
case may be, shall fail to pay the Termination Fee or any Expenses when due,
the term "Expenses" shall be deemed to include the costs and expenses actually
incurred or accrued by the other party (including fees and expenses of
counsel) in connection with the collection under and enforcement of this
_Section 8.3_, together with interest on such unpaid Termination Fee and
Expenses, commencing on the date that the Termination Fee or such Expenses
became due, at a rate equal to the "prime rate" as published in The Wall
Street Journal, Eastern Edition, in effect on the date such payment was
required to be made through the date of payment (calculated daily on the basis
of a year of 365 days and the actual number of days elapsed, without
compounding).

  


 

  

ARTICLE 9 
  
 MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS

  


 

  

9.1 _Amendment_. Prior to the Effective Time, subject to _Section 6.4_ , this

9.2 _Waiver_. No failure on the part of any party to exercise any power,
right, privilege or remedy under this Agreement, and no delay on the part of
any party in exercising any power, right, privilege or remedy under this
Agreement, shall operate as a waiver of such power, right, privilege or
remedy; and no single or partial exercise of any such power, right, privilege
or remedy shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof or of any other
power, right, privilege or remedy. No party shall be deemed to have waived any

9.4 _Entire Agreement; No Reliance; Counterparts_.

  


 

  

(a) This Agreement, the Support Agreements, the Confidentiality Agreement (to

warranties contained in _Article 3_ (including the Company Disclosure Letter),
and _Article 4_ of this Agreement, and the certificate delivered by the
Company to Parent pursuant to paragraph (e) of Annex I, neither the Company,
Parent or Purchaser makes any other representations or warranties and each
hereby disclaims any other representations or warranties made by itself or any

9.5 _Applicable Law; Jurisdiction; Specific Performance; Remedies_ _; Waiver

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to the conflicts of law rules of

connection with, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall
be brought in the Delaware Court of Chancery, New Castle County, or if that
court does not have jurisdiction, a federal court sitting in the State of
Delaware (the "Delaware Courts"). Each party hereby irrevocably submits to the
exclusive jurisdiction of such court in respect of any legal or equitable
action, suit or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, or relating to enforcement of any of the
terms of this Agreement, and hereby waives, and agrees not to assert, as a
defense in any such action, suit or proceeding, any claim that it is not
subject personally to the jurisdiction of such court, that the action, suit or
proceeding is brought in an inconvenient forum, that the venue of the action,
suit or proceeding is improper or that this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby may not be enforced in or by such courts. Each party
agrees that notice or the service of process in any action, suit or proceeding
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated

contemplated by _Section 9.8_ or in any other manner permitted by Law.

  


 

  

(b) The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur and that the parties

specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the
parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches
or threatened breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms
and provisions of this Agreement in the Delaware Courts and, in any action for
specific performance, each party waives the defense of adequacy of a remedy at
law and waives any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in
connection with such remedy, this being in addition to any other remedy to
which they are entitled at law or in equity (subject to the limitations set
forth in this Agreement). The parties hereto further agree that (i) by seeking
the remedies provided for in this _Section 9.5(b)_ , a party shall not in any
respect waive its right to seek any other form of relief that may be available
to a party under this Agreement (including monetary damages) for breach of any
of the provisions of this Agreement or in the event that this Agreement has
been terminated or in the event that the remedies provided for in this
_Section 9.5(b)_ are not available or otherwise are not granted, and (ii)
nothing set forth in this _Section 9.5(b)_ shall require any party hereto to
institute any proceeding for (or limit any party's right to institute any
proceeding for) specific performance under this _Section 9.5(b)_ prior or as a
condition to exercising any termination right under _Article 8_ (and pursuing
damages after such termination), nor shall the commencement of any Legal
Proceeding pursuant to this _Section 9.5(b)_ or anything set forth in this
_Section 9.5(b)_ restrict or limit any party's right to terminate this
Agreement in accordance with the terms of _Article 8_ or pursue any other
remedies under this Agreement that may be available at any time.

  

  

  

    


 

  

(c) EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO
TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS
AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

  


 

  

9.6 _Assignability_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests
or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by
operation of law or otherwise by any of the parties without the prior written
consent of the other parties, except that either Parent or Purchaser may
assign, in its sole discretion, any of or all its rights, interests and
obligations under this Agreement to Parent (in the case of Purchaser) or to
any direct or indirect Subsidiary of Parent, but no such assignment shall
relieve Parent or Purchaser, as applicable, of any of its obligations under
this Agreement. Any purported assignment without such consent shall be null
and void. Subject to the preceding sentences, this Agreement will be binding
upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties and their
respective successors and assigns.

  


 

  

9.7 _Third Party Beneficiaries_. Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or
implied, is intended to confer on any Person other than the parties hereto or
their respective heirs, successors, executors, administrators and assigns any
rights, remedies, obligations or liabilities under or by reason of this
Agreement, except for the provisions of _Section 6.4_ which shall inure to the
benefit of such Persons benefiting therefrom who shall be third-party
beneficiaries thereof and who may enforce the covenants contained therein.
