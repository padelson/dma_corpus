3.31(d)    vi    AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER   THIS AGREEMENT AND
PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of September 21, 2004 (this "Agreement"), is by and
among Capital One Auto Finance, Inc., a Texas corporation ("Parent"),
Foothill Services Corporation, a Delaware corporation and a direct wholly
owned subsidiary of Parent ("Sub"), and Onyx Acceptance Corporation, a
Delaware corporation (the "Company", and together with Sub, the "Constituent
Corporations").   W I T N E S S E T H:   WHEREAS, the respective Boards of
Directors of Parent, Sub and the Company have determined that the merger of
Sub with and into the Company (the "Merger"), upon the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth herein is advisable and fair to and in the best
interests of their respective stockholders;   WHEREAS, the respective
Boards of Directors of Sub and the Company have each approved and adopted, at
meetings of each such Board of Directors, this Agreement and have authorized
the execution hereof and the Board of Directors of Parent has authorized the
execution hereof;   WHEREAS, simultaneously with the execution and delivery
of this Agreement, Parent and each of the stockholders of the Company
identified in Exhibit A hereto are entering into voting agreements pursuant
to which each such stockholder of the Company agrees to take specified
actions in furtherance of the transactions contemplated hereby; and  
WHEREAS, Parent, Sub and the Company desire to make certain representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the Merger and also
to prescribe various conditions to the Merger.   NOW, THEREFORE, in
consideration of the premises, representations, warranties and agreements
herein contained, the parties agree as follows:   ARTICLE 1   THE
MERGER   Section 1.1 The Merger. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions hereof, and in accordance with Section 251 of the Delaware General
Corporation Law (the "DGCL"), Sub shall be merged with and into the Company
at the Effective Time (as hereinafter defined). Following the Merger, the
separate corporate existence of Sub shall cease and the Company shall
continue as the surviving corporation (the "Surviving Corporation") and shall
succeed to and assume all the rights and obligations of Sub in accordance
with the DGCL.   Section 1.2 Effective Time. The Merger shall become
effective when a Certificate of Merger (the "Certificate of Merger"),
executed in accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL, is filed
with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware at the time of the
Closing. When used in this Agreement, the term "Effective Time" shall mean
the date and time at which   1    the Certificate of Merger is accepted
for recording. The filing of the Certificate of Merger shall be made on the
date of the Closing (as defined in Section 1.13).   Section 1.3 Effects of
the Merger. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in this Agreement and
in Section 259 of the DGCL.   Section 1.4 Charter and Bylaws; Directors and
Officers.   (a) At the Effective Time, the Certificate of Incorporation of
the Company (the "Company Charter"), as in effect at the Effective Time,
shall be the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until
amended as provided by applicable law; provided, however, that such
Certificate of Incorporation shall be amended to become, and as a result at
the Effective Time shall without further action be, identical to the
Certificate of Incorporation of Sub (the "Sub Charter") as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time except that Article I thereof shall
be amended to change the name of the Surviving Corporation to the name of the
Company. At the Effective Time, the Bylaws of Sub (the "Sub Bylaws") as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the Bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or amended in accordance with
applicable law.   (b) The directors of Sub at the Effective Time shall be
the directors of the Surviving Corporation, until the earlier of their
resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly elected
and qualified, as the case may be. The officers of the Sub at the Effective
Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation, until the earlier of
their resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly
elected and qualified, as the case may be.   Section 1.5 Conversion of
Securities. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of Sub, the Company or the holders of any securities of
the Constituent Corporations:   (a) Each issued and outstanding share of
common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Sub shall be converted into one
(1) validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation.   (b) Each issued and outstanding share of common
stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the "Company Common Stock")
that is held in the treasury of the Company or by any wholly owned Subsidiary
(as defined in Section 3.1) of the Company, and any shares of Company Common
Stock owned by Parent, shall be cancelled and no payment, capital stock of
Parent or other consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.  
(c) Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than shares to be cancelled in accordance
with Section 1.5(b) and any Dissenting Shares (as hereinafter defined)) shall
be converted into the right to receive $28.00 in cash payable to the holder
thereof, without interest thereon (the "Merger Consideration"). All such
shares of Company Common Stock, when so converted, shall no longer
be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and retired and each
holder of a certificate representing any such shares shall cease to have any
rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger
Consideration pursuant to this Section 1.5(c). The Merger Consideration shall
be appropriately   2    adjusted for any stock dividend, stock split or
like transaction affecting the Company Common Stock prior to the Effective
Time.   (d) (i) The Company shall cause each Company Stock Option (as
defined in Section 3.2(a)) issued and outstanding under the Company 1996
Stock Option/Stock Issuance Plan (as amended and restated as of April 23,
1998 and subsequently amended and restated as of March 31, 2000 and as of
December 30, 2003) (the "1996 Plan"), to become fully vested and exercisable
as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and permit the holders of such
issued and outstanding Company Stock Options to exercise such Company Stock
Options as of immediately prior to the Effective Time. A notice and election
form to be mutually agreed upon by the Company and Parent shall be
distributed by the Company to the holders of such Company Stock Options to
permit such holders to elect to so exercise their Company Stock Options as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time and Parent shall cause the Company to
make a cash payment to such holders as promptly as practicable after the
Closing (but in no event later than two business days after the Closing)
equal to the number of shares of Company Common Stock for which each Company
Stock Option is then exercisable multiplied by the per share Merger
Consideration, less the aggregate exercise price of each such Company Stock
Option and less any amounts required to be withheld pursuant to any
applicable tax withholding requirements. The Company shall cause each Company
Stock Option issued and outstanding under the Company Stock Option Plans (as
defined in Section 3.2(a)) at the Effective Time, and which has not
been exercised prior to the Effective Time, to be cancelled as of the
Effective Time without payment thereon. All Company Stock Options when
cancelled in accordance with this Section 1.5(d) shall cease to be
outstanding, and each holder of such a Company Stock Option and all other
Persons (as defined in Section 4.1(d)) shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto.   (ii) Except as provided herein or as otherwise agreed to
by the parties, the Company shall cause the Company Stock Option Plans to
terminate as of the Effective Time.   Section 1.6 Exchange of
Certificates.   (a) Parent shall appoint a trust company or a commercial
bank reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as paying agent hereunder
(the "Paying Agent"). Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with
the Paying Agent the aggregate Merger Consideration under Section 1.5(c)
(the "Payment Fund"). The Paying Agent shall deliver the Merger
Consideration contemplated to be paid pursuant to Section 1.5(c) out of the
Payment Fund.   (b) Parent shall cause the Paying Agent, as soon as
practicable after the Effective Time, to mail to each record holder
(including nominee holders for distribution to beneficial holders) of a
certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock converted in the
Merger (the "Certificates") a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates
shall pass, only upon actual delivery of the Certificates to the Paying
Agent, and shall contain instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration and a Form W-9 to
establish available exemptions from back-up withholding). Upon surrender for
cancellation to the Paying Agent of one or more Certificates held by any
record holder of a Certificate, together with such letter of transmittal,
duly executed, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor the Merger   3    Consideration pursuant to this
Article 1, and any Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled.
No interest will be paid or accrued on the Merger Consideration payable to
the holder of the Certificates.   (c) The Paying Agent shall invest the
Payment Fund, as directed by Parent, in (i) direct obligations of the United
States of America, (ii) obligations for which the full faith and credit of
the United States of America is pledged to provide for the payment of
principal and interest, or (iii) certificates of deposit, bank repurchase
agreements or bankers acceptances, of commercial banks with assets exceeding
$1,000,000,000, and any net earnings with respect thereto shall be paid to
Parent as and when requested by Parent; provided that any such investment or
any such payment of earnings shall not delay the receipt by holders of
Certificates of their Merger Consideration or otherwise impair such holders\'
respective rights hereunder. Parent must promptly replace any portion of the
Payment Fund which the Paying Agent loses through investments.   (d) If any
Merger Consideration is to be paid to a name other than that in which the
Certificate surrendered is registered, it shall be a condition of such
payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed
and otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting
such payment shall pay to the Paying Agent any taxes required by reason of
payment or shall establish to the satisfaction of the Paying Agent that such
tax has been paid or is not applicable. Parent or the Paying Agent shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock
such amounts as Parent or the Paying Agent is required to deduct and withhold
with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the "Code"), or under any provision of state, local or
foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent or the
Paying Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company Common
Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent
or the Paying Agent.   Section 1.7 Return of Payment Fund. Any portion of
the Payment Fund which remains undistributed to the former stockholders of
the Company for six months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to
Parent, upon demand of Parent, and any such former stockholders who have not
theretofore complied with this Article 1 shall thereafter look only to Parent
for payment of their claim for Merger Consideration. Neither Parent nor the
Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any former holder of Company Common
Stock for any such Merger Consolidation that is delivered to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
law.   Section 1.8 No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock.
The Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender of Certificates and the
payments made in respect of exercised Company Stock Options in accordance
with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been paid and made in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock
represented by such Certificates and such Company Stock Options.   Section
1.9 Closing of Company Transfer Books. At the Effective Time, the stock
transfer books of the Company shall be closed and no transfer of shares of
Company Common   4    Stock shall thereafter be made on the records of
the Company. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the
Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent or the Parent, such Certificates
shall be cancelled as provided in this Article 1.   Section 1.10 Lost
Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent or the
Paying Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount
as Parent or the Paying Agent may direct as indemnity against any Claim (as
defined in Section 3.10) that may be made against them with respect to such
Certificate, the Paying Agent will pay the Merger Consideration for such
lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate.   Section 1.11 Further Assurances. If
at any time after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
consider or be advised that any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or
assurances or any other acts or things are necessary, desirable or proper (a)
to vest, perfect or confirm, of record or otherwise, in the Surviving
Corporation its right, title or interest in, to or under any of the rights,
privileges, powers, franchises, properties or assets of either of the
Constituent Corporations, or (b) otherwise to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement, the Surviving Corporation and its proper officers and directors or
their designees shall be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and
on behalf of either of the Constituent Corporations, all such deeds, bills of
sale, assignments and assurances and to do, in the name and on behalf of
either Constituent Corporation, all such other acts and things as may be
necessary, desirable or proper to vest, perfect or confirm the
Surviving Corporation\'s right, title or interest in, to or under any of the
rights, privileges, powers, franchises, properties or assets of such
Constituent Corporation and otherwise to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement.   Section 1.12 Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time held by a holder (if
any), who has the right to demand, and who properly demands, an appraisal of
such shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with Section 262 of the
DGCL (or any successor provision) ("Dissenting Shares") shall not be
converted into a right to receive the Merger Consideration unless such holder
fails to perfect or otherwise loses such holder\'s right to such appraisal,
if any. If, after the Effective Time, such holder fails to perfect or loses
any such right to appraisal, each such share of Company Common Stock of such
holder shall be treated as a share of Company Common Stock that had been
converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration in accordance with this Article 1. At the Effective Time, any
holder of Dissenting Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the rights provided in Section 262 of the DGCL (or any
successor provision) and as provided in the immediately preceding sentence.
The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent of any demands received by the
Company for appraisal of shares of Company Common Stock, and Parent shall
have the right to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings
with respect to such demands. The Company shall not, except with the prior
written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle or
compromise or offer to settle or compromise, any such demands. Parent shall
be responsible for all payments with respect to the Dissenting Shares,
including all expenses associated with any negotiations and proceedings with
respect to demands for appraisal under the DGCL.   5     Section 1.13
Closing. The closing of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the
"Closing") and all actions specified in this Agreement to occur at the
Closing shall take place at the offices of Mayer, Brown, Rowe and Maw LLP, 1909
K Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. at 10:00 a.m., local time, no later than the
second business day following the fulfillment or waiver (if permitted by law)
of the conditions set forth in Article 6 or at such other time and place as
Parent and the Company shall agree.   ARTICLE 2   REPRESENTATIONS AND
WARRANTIES OF PARENT AND SUB   Parent and Sub represent and warrant to the
Company as follows:   Section 2.1 Organization, Standing and Power. Each of
Parent and Sub is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in
good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction in which it is organized and
has the requisite corporate power and authority to carry on its business as
now being conducted. Each of Parent and Sub is duly qualified to do business,
and is in good standing, in each jurisdiction where the character of its
properties owned or held under lease or the nature of its activities makes
such qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified
would not, individually or in the aggregate, materially impair the ability of
Parent or Sub to perform their respective obligations hereunder or prevent
the consummation of any of the transactions contemplated hereby.   Section
2.2 Authority. On or prior to the date of this Agreement, (a) the Boards of
Directors of Parent and Sub have declared the Merger and this Agreement
advisable and fair to and in the best interest of Parent and
Sub, respectively, and their respective stockholders, (b) the Board of
Directors of Parent has approved the execution of this Agreement in
accordance with applicable law and (c) the Board of Directors of Sub has
approved and adopted this Agreement in accordance with the DGCL. Each of
Parent and Sub has all requisite corporate power to enter into this Agreement
and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The execution and
delivery of this Agreement by Parent and Sub and the consummation by Parent
and Sub of the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly authorized by
all necessary corporate action on the part of Parent and Sub, subject to
filing of appropriate Merger documents as required by the DGCL. This
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby have
been approved by Parent as the sole stockholder of Sub. This Agreement has
been duly executed and delivered by Parent and Sub, and (assuming the valid
authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company and
the validity and binding effect of this Agreement on the Company) this

Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as the case may be; and (b)
"Subsidiary" means any corporation, partnership, limited liability company,
joint venture or other legal entity of which Parent, the Company or the

covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it
hereunder; provided, however, that   35   the delivery of any notice
pursuant to this Section 5.9 shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies
available hereunder to the party receiving such notice.   Section 5.10
12-1/2% Subordinated Notes. The Company shall cause all of the 12-1/2%

whether before or after any approval of the matters presented in connection
with the Merger by the stockholders of the Company or Parent:   (a) by
mutual written consent of Parent and the Company;   (b) by either Parent or
the Company if the other party shall have failed to comply in any material
respect with any of its covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement
required to be complied with prior to the date of such termination, which
failure to comply has not been cured within thirty business days following
receipt by such other party of written notice from the nonbreaching party of
such failure to comply;   (c) by either Parent or the Company if there has
been (i) a breach by the other party (in the case of Parent, including any
breach by Sub) of any representation or warranty that is not qualified as to
materiality which has the effect of making such representation or warranty
not true and correct in all material respects or (ii) a breach by the other

which breach has not been cured within thirty business days following receipt

on or prior to the close of business on the date that is 180 days after the
date of this Agreement; provided, however, that the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(d) shall not be available to any party
whose failure to fulfill any of its obligations contained in this Agreement
has been the cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the Merger to have
occurred on or prior to the aforesaid date;   (e) by Parent or the Company
if any court or other Governmental Entity having jurisdiction over a party
hereto shall have issued an order, decree or ruling or taken any other action
permanently enjoining, restraining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation

become final and nonappealable;   (f) by Parent or the Company if the
stockholders of the Company do not approve this Agreement at the Company
Stockholder Meeting or at any adjournment or postponement thereof; provided,
however, that the Company may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 7.1(f) if the Company has not complied with its obligations under
Sections 5.1 and 5.2 or has otherwise breached in any material respect its
obligations under this Agreement in any   39   manner that could
reasonably have caused the failure of the stockholder approval to be obtained
at the Company Stockholder Meeting;   (g) by the Company on or after the
tenth calendar day after the Company has notified Parent in writing that the
Board of Directors of the Company has determined that a Takeover Proposal
involving the Company constitutes a Superior Proposal; provided, that, as of
such tenth calendar day after the Company has so notified Parent, the Board
of Directors of the Company continues to believe in its good faith judgment,
after taking into consideration any changes in the terms of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement that have been proposed by Parent on or prior
to such date, that such Takeover Proposal involving the Company continues to
constitute a Superior Proposal. For purposes of this Agreement "Superior
Proposal" means a Takeover Proposal involving the Company that the Board of
Directors of the Company determines in its good faith judgment, after
consultation with its financial advisors, is more favorable to the Company\'s
stockholders from a financial point of view than the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; or   (h) by Parent if (i) the

shall have resolved to do so, (ii) any Person (other than Parent or its
Affiliates) acquires or becomes the beneficial owner of 20% or more of the
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock, (iii) the Board of Directors of
the Company shall have recommended to the stockholders of the Company any
Takeover Proposal involving the Company or shall have resolved to do so or
(iv) a tender offer or exchange offer for 20% or more of the outstanding
shares of capital stock of the Company is commenced, and the Board of
Directors of the Company fails, within 10 business days of such
commencement, to recommend against acceptance of such tender offer or
exchange offer by its stockholders (including by taking no position with
respect to the acceptance of such tender offer or exchange offer by its
stockholders). As used herein, "Affiliate" shall have the meaning set forth
in Rule 405 under the Securities Act.   The right of any party hereto to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1 shall remain operative
and in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on
behalf of any party hereto, any Person controlling any such party or any of
their respective officers or directors, whether prior to or after the
execution of this Agreement.   Section 7.2 Effect of Termination. In the
event of termination of this Agreement by either Parent or the Company, as
provided in Section 7.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and there
shall be no liability hereunder on the part of the Company, Parent, Sub or
their respective officers or directors (except for the Confidentiality
Agreement and Section 5.4 and Article 8, which shall survive the
termination); provided, however, that nothing contained in this Section 7.2
shall relieve any party hereto from any liability for any willful breach of a
representation or warranty contained in this Agreement or the breach of any
covenant contained in this Agreement.   Section 7.3 Amendment. This
Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto, by or pursuant to action
taken by their respective Boards of Directors, at any time before or after
approval of the matters presented in connection with the Merger at the
Company Stockholder   40   Meeting, but, after any such approval, no
amendment shall be made which by law requires further approval by such
stockholders. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto.   Section 7.4
Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the parties hereto may (i)
extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts
of the other parties hereto, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties contained herein or in any document delivered
pursuant hereto and (iii) waive compliance with any of the agreements or
conditions contained herein which may legally be waived. Any agreement on the
part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if
set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party.

Representations and Warranties. The representations and warranties in this
Agreement or in any instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall
terminate at the Effective Time.   Section 8.2 Notices. All notices and
other communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed given

and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with respect to
the subject matter hereof. This Agreement, except as provided in the next
sentence, is not intended to confer upon any Person other than the parties
hereto any rights or remedies hereunder. The parties hereto expressly

enforceable by, as third party beneficiaries of this Agreement, the third
persons referred to in, or intended to be benefited by, such provision.

hereto irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent it may
legally and effectively do so, any objection that it may now or hereafter
have to the laying of venue of any suit, action or proceeding arising out of
or relating to this Agreement in any Delaware State or federal court. Such
party hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the
defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or
proceeding in any such court.   (d) EACH OF THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVES ALL
RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER

rendered in substantially the following form, subject to typical 
qualifications and final approval by AK Opinion Committee]   _________ __,
200__  [PARENT] [____________] [____________]  Ladies and Gentlemen:  
We have acted as counsel to [FOOTHILL], a Delaware corporation
(the "Company") in connection with the negotiation, execution and delivery of
the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of September __, 2004 among
[PARENT], a ________ corporation ("Parent"), [MERGER SUB], a Delaware

State of Delaware.   2. Each Subsidiary of the Company is, validly existing
and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction in which it is
organized.   3. The Company has all requisite corporate power to enter into

Company of the Merger Agreement, to consummate the transactions contemplated
thereby.   4. The execution and delivery of the Merger Agreement by the
Company and the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated
thereby have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the
part of the Company.   5. The execution and delivery of the Merger
Agreement by the Company does not, and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated thereby and compliance with the provisions thereof by the
Company will not, result in any violation of (a) the Company Charter or the
Company Bylaws or (b) any provision of the comparable charter or organization
documents of any of the Company\'s Subsidiaries.   6. No filing or
registration with, or authorization, consent or approval of, any Governmental
Entity is required by or with respect to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries in connection with the execution and delivery of the Merger
Agreement by the Company or is necessary for the consummation of the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, except for
(i) in connection, or in compliance, with the provisions of the    HSR Act
and the Exchange Act, (ii) applicable bank holding company
regulatory approval, (iii) the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware and appropriate related documents
with the relevant authorities of other states in which the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries is qualified to do business, (iii) applicable requirements,
if any, of The Nasdaq Stock Market, and (iv) other filings and registrations
the failure of which to obtain would not have a Material Adverse Effect.  
We have furnished this opinion pursuant to Section 6.3(f) of the
Merger Agreement.   Very truly yours,   Andrews Kurth LLP   2    '
