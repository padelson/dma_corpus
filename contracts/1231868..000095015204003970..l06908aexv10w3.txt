         THIS AMENDED AND RESTATED ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENT (this "AGREEMENT"),
dated as of February 25, 2004 (the "AMENDMENT DATE"), is made by and among

are defined or cross-referenced in Article 12.

                             BACKGROUND INFORMATION

         A. On May 19, 2003 (the "WSC PETITION DATE"), WSC commenced a voluntary
case for reorganization (the "WSC BANKRUPTCY CASE") under chapter 11 of the
Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. Section 101-1330 (the "BANKRUPTCY Code"), in the
United States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of West Virginia (the

Sale Motion (the "FWH PETITION DATE"), FWH has commenced or will commence a
voluntary case for reorganization (the "FWH BANKRUPTCY CASE") under the
Bankruptcy Code in the Bankruptcy Court. Concurrently with the filing of the
Bidding Procedures and Sale Motion (the "WVHC PETITION DATE"; collectively with

commenced or will commence a voluntary case for reorganization (the "WVHC
BANKRUPTCY CASE"; collectively with the WSC Bankruptcy Case and the FWH
Bankruptcy Case, the "BANKRUPTCY CASES") under the Bankruptcy Code in the
Bankruptcy Court.

         B. On February 18, 2004 (the "EXECUTION DATE"), Sellers, Buyer and ISG
entered into an asset purchase agreement, pursuant to which Buyer agreed to
purchase the Acquired Assets and assume the Assumed Liabilities from Sellers
(the "ORIGINAL AGREEMENT"). This Agreement replaces and supercedes the Original
Agreement.

         C. Buyer is a wholly owned subsidiary of ISG. Buyer desires to purchase
the Acquired Assets and assume the Assumed Liabilities from Sellers, and Sellers
desire to sell, convey, assign and transfer to Buyer the Acquired Assets
together with the Assumed Liabilities, all in the manner and subject to the
terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and in accordance with sections
105, 363, 365 and 1146 and other applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code.

         D. The Acquired Assets and Assumed Liabilities are assets and
liabilities of Sellers that are to be purchased and assumed by Buyer pursuant to
an order, in the form attached as Exhibit A or such other form satisfactory to
Buyer, in its sole discretion (the "BANKRUPTCY SALE ORDER"), approving such sale
pursuant to sections 105, 363 and 365 of the Bankruptcy Code, which order will
include the authorization for the assumption by Sellers and assignment to Buyer
of the Acquired Contracts and liabilities thereunder in accordance with section
365 of the Bankruptcy Code, all in the manner and subject to the terms and
conditions set forth in this Agreement and the Bankruptcy Sale Order and in
accordance with other applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code, and the
Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure (the "BANKRUPTCY RULES").

         E. On the Execution Date, WSC, Buyer and The Huntington National Bank,
as escrow agent (the "ESCROW AGENT"), entered into a performance escrow
agreement (the "PERFORMANCE ESCROW AGREEMENT") pursuant to which Buyer has
deposited $2,000,000 (the "PERFORMANCE DEPOSIT") with the Escrow Agent as
security for the performance of Buyer's obligations hereunder. The Performance
Deposit shall be held and disbursed by the Escrow Agent in accordance with the
terms of the Performance Escrow Agreement and this Agreement.

         F. The transactions contemplated by this Agreement are essential and
necessary to the confirmation of the Sellers' liquidating plan of
reorganization.

         Section 1.5 Non-Assignment of Contracts. Anything contained herein to
the contrary notwithstanding, this Agreement shall not constitute an agreement
to assign any Acquired Contract or any Permit, if, notwithstanding the
provisions of sections 363 and 365 of the Bankruptcy Code, an attempted
assignment thereof, without the consent of any other Person party thereto, would
constitute a breach thereof or in any way negatively affect the rights of either
of the Sellers or Buyer (unless the restrictions on assignment would be rendered
ineffective pursuant to sections 9-406 through 9-409, inclusive, of the Uniform
Commercial Code, as amended (the "UCC"), as the assignee of such Acquired
Contract or Permit, as the case may be, thereunder. If, notwithstanding the

rights under, such Acquired Contract or Permit. Any assignment to Buyer of any

any Person for such assignment as aforesaid shall be made subject to such
consent or approval being obtained.

                  deemed an Acquired Asset for all purposes of this Agreement,

                  Closing under such Contract shall be Assumed Liabilities for
                  all purposes of this Agreement. Any Contract removed from
                  Schedule 1.1(c) and/or added to Schedule 1.2(f) shall become
                  an Excluded Asset and shall not be an Acquired Contract for
                  all purposes of this Agreement and all liabilities and
                  obligations under such Contract shall be Excluded Liabilities
                  for all purposes of this Agreement.

         (b)      WSC shall provide ISG with a schedule of Sellers' reasonable
                  best estimates of Cure Costs for the Acquired Contracts
                  ("SCHEDULE 1.6(b)") within two Business Days after the
                  Amendment Date, which schedule shall be reasonably consistent
                  with the information previously provided by WSC to ISG on
                  WSC's estimate of contract cures dated January 19, 2004 (1:00
                  p.m.). Sellers shall, within three days after Buyer amends
                  Schedule 1.1(c) in accordance with Section 1.6(a), supplement
                  Schedule 1.6(b) to update the Cure Costs and update Schedule
                  4.1(n) to make any required disclosure with regard to any
                  Contract added to Schedule 1.1(c).

         (c)      On the Amendment Date, Sellers shall file a Motion to Assume
                  and Assign Certain Contracts and Unexpired Leases to Buyer,
                  effective as of the Closing Date, and establish Cure Costs
                  relating thereto, in a form acceptable to Buyer and Sellers,
                  and Sellers shall make such additional filings with the
                  Bankruptcy

                  Court as may be necessary or desirable to effect the
                  provisions of this Section 1.6.

         Section 1.7 Transition Services Agreement. The parties shall negotiate
in good faith, agree on and execute prior to the Closing the Transition Services
Agreement, which Transition Services Agreement shall set forth the nature,
scope, extent and duration of (i) Sellers' access to and use of the Acquired
Assets (including, without limitation, access to and use of the Acquired Assets
listed in Schedule 1.7 as may be necessary to meet Sellers' legal obligations
after Closing and consistent with Buyer's ability to use the Acquired Assets to
operate the business being acquired pursuant to this Agreement and (ii) Sellers'
services, if any, as may be reasonably requested by Buyer. The Transition
Services Agreement shall provide that the party receiving the services under the
Transition Services Agreement shall reimburse the party providing the services
for all reasonable direct costs, including, without limitation, all third-party
costs, incurred by the providing party in performing the requested services. All
services under the Transition Services Agreement shall be provided without
representation or warranty or liability to the other party.

         Section 1.8 Exclusion of Nonoperating Assets. If, prior to Closing, any
Seller sells, or enters into a Contract to sell (which conditions sale only upon
approval of the Bankruptcy Court and other customary closing conditions), any of
the assets set forth on Schedule 1.8 (collectively, the "NONOPERATING ASSETS"),
for a net realizable value equal to or greater than the estimated realizable
value set forth on Schedule 1.8 for such Nonoperating Asset, then such
Nonoperating Asset will become an Excluded Asset for all purposes of this
Agreement. Sellers shall promptly update Schedule 1.2(k) to include the Excluded
Asset. Buyer may, in its sole discretion based upon information provided to
Buyer by Sellers during the ten-day period after the Execution Date, determine
that the net realizable value set forth on Schedule 1.8 should be increased, and
if Buyer so determines it will notify Sellers of such determination in writing
promptly after the end of such period.

                            ARTICLE 2. CONSIDERATION

         Section 2.1 Purchase Price. The aggregate consideration for the sale,
transfer, assignment and conveyance of the Acquired Assets will be (a)
$158,000,000 in cash, subject to adjustment as provided in Section 2.2, Section
2.3 and Section 2.4 of this Agreement (as so adjusted, the "PURCHASE PRICE");
provided, however, that if, the Purchase Price, adjusted as provided in Section
2.2, Section 2.3 and Section 2.4(c), is less than the amount of the Senior Debt,
then the Purchase Price will be further increased by the amount necessary to
indefeasibly and finally satisfy the Senior Debt in cash in full at the Closing
(such increase, the "PURCHASE PRICE INCREASE"); and (b) the assumption by Buyer
of the Assumed Liabilities (such assumption, together with the Purchase Price
and the Purchase Price Increase, if any, the "TOTAL CONSIDERATION"). The
Purchase Price shall be payable in accordance with Section 3.3(b).

         Section 2.2 Accounts Payable and Payroll Liabilities.

         (a)      From time to time, at any time prior to the Closing, upon
                  delivery of written notice thereof by Buyer to Sellers, Buyer
                  may remove any Accounts Payable otherwise includable in the
                  definition of Assumed Liabilities hereunder. Any Accounts
                  Payable so removed shall become an Excluded Liability for all
                  purposes of this Agreement.

         (b)      From time to time, at any time prior to the Closing, upon
                  delivery of written notice thereof by Buyer to Sellers, Buyer
                  may elect (in its sole discretion) not to assume the Payroll
                  Liabilities described on items 6 and 17 of Schedule 1.3(e), if
                  Buyer determines in its sole discretion that the
                  administration of such Payroll Liabilities will be unduly
                  burdensome or that it is reasonably likely that the accrual
                  for such liabilities will be inadequate to cover the actual
                  liabilities, and thereafter such Payroll Liabilities will not
                  be Assumed Liabilities. If Buyer so elects, the estimated
                  amount of the Payroll Liabilities included in the Specified
                  Liabilities shall be reduced by the estimated amount of such
                  liabilities not assumed and, in the case of the Payroll
                  Liabilities described in item 6, the amount of such reduction
                  shall be determined in a fair and equitable manner by Buyer
                  and Sellers based upon the sum of the estimated amounts for
                  the liabilities described in items 6 and 7 of Schedule 1.3(e)
                  multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which equals the
                  number of employees of Sellers who are employed by Buyer
                  immediately after the Closing and the denominator of which is
                  the number of employees of Sellers immediately prior to the
                  Closing plus the number of retirees who are eligible for such
                  payments.

         (c)      At the Closing, the Purchase Price will be adjusted upward and
                  the Assumed Liabilities portion of the Total Consideration
                  will be adjusted downward, each on a dollar-for-dollar basis,
                  to reflect each dollar of Accounts Payable and Payroll
                  Liabilities so removed.

         Section 2.3 Directors and Officers Insurance. WSC will arrange for the
exercise of any option available under the D&O Policy for the establishment of
an extended reporting period, or shall arrange for a new policy of insurance or
an extension of the reporting period for the existing coverage to become
effective at Closing that insures the current and former directors and officers
of WSC and its subsidiaries against claims made after the Closing Date but
before the sixth anniversary thereof with respect to wrongful acts committed
prior to the Closing Date, and which would have been covered under the D&O
Policy had such claims been made prior to the Closing Date (in either case, the
"D&O TAIL POLICY"). WSC will arrange for the exercise of any option available
under the Employment Practices Policy for the establishment of an extended
reporting period, or shall arrange for a new policy of insurance or an extension
of the reporting period for the existing coverage to become effective at Closing
that insures the current and former directors and officers of WSC and its
subsidiaries against claims made after the Closing Date but before the second
anniversary thereof with respect to wrongful acts committed prior to the Closing
Date, and which would have been covered under the Employment Practices Policy
had such claims been made prior to the Closing Date (in either case, the
"EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES TAIL POLICY"). As soon as available to WSC (but no later
than five Business Days prior to the Closing), WSC shall provide to Buyer a
calculation of the maximum deductible amounts that could apply, after the
Closing, to claims pending or made under (i) either or both of the D&O Policy
and the D&O Tail Policy (the aggregate of such amounts being the "D&O
DEDUCTIBLE") and (ii) either or both of the Employment Practices Policy and the
Employment Practices Tail Policy (the aggregate of such amounts being the
"EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES DEDUCTIBLE"). As soon as available to WSC (but no later
than five Business Days prior to the Closing), WSC shall provide to Buyer its
calculations of the (x) D&O Deductible as well as the form of such D&O Tail
Policy and all pertinent information relating to premiums (the "D&O TAIL
PREMIUM") therefor and (y) Employment Practices Deductible as well as the form
of such Employment Practices Tail Policy and all pertinent information relating
to premiums for the Employment Practices Tail Policy (the "EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES
TAIL PREMIUM"). Buyer and WSC will review WSC's calculations and seek to jointly
determine the

                                       10
<PAGE>

amount of the Insurance Payments. The Purchase Price shall be reduced by the sum
of the Insurance Payments. Buyer may elect, at its expense, to purchase
additional insurance under the D&O Policy, the D&O Tail Policy, the Employment
Practices Policy or the Employment Practices Tail Policy to eliminate the
deductibles thereunder (in which case the amount included in the term "Insurance
Payment" will be adjusted accordingly).

         Section 2.4 Purchase Price Adjustment.

         (a)      The Purchase Price will be increased, on a dollar for dollar
                  basis, to the extent the Final Working Capital of Sellers as
                  of the Closing Date, exceeds Target Working Capital. The
                  Purchase Price will be decreased, on a dollar for dollar
                  basis, to the extent the Target Working Capital exceeds Final
                  Working Capital.

         (b)      Not less than three days prior to the Closing Date, Sellers
                  will provide Buyer with a good faith estimate of the Net
                  Working Capital of Sellers as of the Closing Date. Buyer and
                  Sellers will review Sellers' estimate and seek in good faith
                  to jointly determine the estimated Net Working Capital of
                  Sellers as of the Closing Date. In the event Buyer and Sellers
                  cannot agree on the estimated Net Working Capital of Sellers
                  as of the Closing Date, then Buyer shall estimate the Net
                  Working Capital of Sellers as of the Closing Date. The amount
                  of Net Working Capital as determined pursuant to this Section
                  2.4(b) shall be referred to as the "ESTIMATED CLOSING WORKING
                  CAPITAL". In no event will the Estimated Closing Working
                  Capital exceed the Target Working Capital by more than
                  $10,000,000.

         (c)      At Closing, the Purchase Price shall be increased, on a dollar
                  for dollar basis, to the extent the Estimated Working Capital
                  exceeds Target Working Capital. The Purchase Price shall be
                  decreased, on a dollar for dollar basis, to the extent the
                  Target Working Capital exceeds the Estimated Working Capital.

         (d)      As promptly as practicable, but no later than 90 days after
                  the Closing Date, Buyer shall prepare and cause to be
                  delivered to WSC a calculation of final Net Working Capital as
                  of the close of business on the Closing Date with appropriate
                  supporting documentation.

         (e)      If WSC disagrees with Buyer's calculation of final Net Working
                  Capital, WSC, on behalf of Sellers, may, within 30 days after
                  receipt of Buyer's calculation of final Net Working Capital,
                  deliver a notice to Buyer disagreeing with such calculation
                  and setting forth WSC's calculation of such amount. Any such
                  notice of disagreement shall specify those items or amounts as
                  to which WSC disagrees and the reasons for WSC's
                  disagreements, and WSC shall be deemed to have agreed with all
                  other items and amounts contained in the calculation of final
                  Net Working Capital delivered by Buyer.

         (f)      If a notice of disagreement is duly delivered, Buyer and WSC
                  shall, during the 30 days following receipt of such notice by
                  Buyer, use their commercially reasonable efforts to reach
                  agreement on the disputed items or amounts in order to
                  determine, as may be required, the amount of final Net Working
                  Capital, which amount shall not be less than the amount
                  thereof shown in Buyer's calculation nor more than the amount
                  thereof shown in WSC's calculation. If during such period,
                  Buyer and WSC are unable to reach such agreement, they shall
                  promptly thereafter cause Ernst & Young, LLP (the "ACCOUNTING
                  REFEREE") to review this

                                       11
<PAGE>

                  Agreement and the disputed items or amounts and calculate
                  final Net Working Capital, which amount shall not be less than
                  the amount thereof shown in Buyer's calculation nor more than
                  the amount thereof shown in WSC's calculation. In making such
                  calculation, the Accounting Referee shall consider only those
                  items or amounts in Buyer's calculation with which WSC has
                  disagreed and shall be guided by the provisions of this
                  Section 2.4. The Accounting Referee shall deliver to Buyer and
                  WSC, as promptly as practicable (but in any case no later than
                  30 days from the date of engagement of the Accounting
                  Referee), a report setting forth such calculation. Such report
                  shall be final and binding upon Buyer and Sellers. The cost of
                  such review and report shall be borne by Buyer. The amount of
                  the final Net Working Capital as determined pursuant to this
                  Section 2.4(f) shall be referred to as the "CLOSING WORKING
                  CAPITAL".

         (g)      Buyer and Sellers shall, and shall cause their respective
                  Related Persons to, cooperate and assist in the calculation of
                  Closing Working Capital and in the conduct of the reviews
                  referred to in this Section 2.4, including, without
                  limitation, the making available to the extent necessary of
                  books, records, work papers and personnel. All amounts to be
                  determined pursuant to this Section 2.4 will be determined in
                  accordance with Sellers' historic accounting practices and
                  principles consistently applied between December 31, 2002 and
                  the Closing Date.

         (h)      If Estimated Closing Working Capital equals or exceeds Final
                  Working Capital, Sellers shall pay Buyer, an amount equal to
                  such excess, if any. Such payment shall be made by wire
                  transfer of immediately available funds within three Business
                  Days of the final determination of Final Working Capital. ISG
                  and Buyer hereby waive their right to seek disgorgement or
                  return from the Agent or any Lender of any amounts necessary
                  to fund this purchase price adjustment (except for any such
                  right that may result from any overpayment of the amount
                  necessary to indefeasibly and finally satisfy the DIP
                  Obligations in full).

         (i)      If Final Working Capital exceeds the sum of the Estimated
                  Closing Working Capital plus the Purchase Price Increase, if
                  any, Buyer shall pay WSC, on behalf of Sellers, an amount
                  equal to such excess. Such payment shall be made by wire
                  transfer of immediately available funds within three Business
                  Days of the final determination of Final Working Capital. ISG
                  and Buyer hereby waive their right to seek disgorgement or
                  return from the Agent or any Lender of any amounts necessary
                  to fund this purchase price adjustment (except for any such
                  right that may result from any overpayment of the amount
                  necessary to indefeasibly and finally satisfy the DIP
                  Obligations in full).

                  Permit has been duly obtained, is valid and in full force and
                  effect, and is not subject to any pending or, to the Knowledge
                  of Sellers, threatened administrative or judicial proceeding

                  any respect. None of the operations of the businesses
                  conducted by Sellers are being conducted in a manner that
                  violates any of the terms or conditions under which any Permit

                  consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
                  Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements will not result in the
                  termination or suspension of any such Permit.

                  Acquired Contract set forth on Schedule 1.1(c). Except as set
                  forth on Schedule 4.1(n) and except for those defaults that
                  will be cured in accordance with the Bankruptcy Sale Order, no
                  Seller, and no other party to any Acquired Contract, has
                  commenced any action against any of the parties to such
                  Acquired Contract or given or received any written notice of
                  any default or violation under any Acquired Contract that has
                  not been withdrawn or dismissed. Except as set forth on

                  Closing, valid, binding and in full force and effect for the
                  benefit of Buyer in accordance with its terms, except as may
                  be limited by bankruptcy or other laws affecting creditors'
                  rights and by equitable principles.

                           soil of the Real Property requiring corrective,
                           response or remedial action under, or that is a
                           violation of, any applicable Environmental Laws;

                  (ii)     there are no pending or threatened Claims or

                           Property or the Acquired Assets and that relate in
                           any way to any Environmental Laws; and

                  a summary of each such policy, including any limits of
                  coverage, deductibles and premiums applicable to such policy.
                  Except as set forth on Schedule 4.1(p), all premiums required
                  to be paid

                  domain proceedings that might adversely affect the use of any

                  "foreign person" within the meaning of section 1445(f)(3) of
                  the Code.

         (r)      Accounts Receivable. Except as set forth on Schedule 4.1(r),

                           that has not been repaired; or

                  (ii)     any sale or other disposition of any assets
                           (including, without limitation, discounting of

                           of Sellers, other than sales of inventory in the

                  "gas utility," a "public utility holding company," a "holding
                  company," an "electrical corporation" or as a subsidiary or
                  affiliate of any of the foregoing, under (A) the Public

                           Obligations in full is $162,704,565. Schedule 4.1(w)
                           lists all Priming Liens that are senior in payment to
                           Sellers' obligations under the DIP Agreement and

                           Carveouts (by category) and the Sale Costs (by
                           category) as of the Closing Date. Except for the
                           Priming Liens, the Carveouts and the Sale Costs,
                           Sellers have not incurred any Indebtedness or any
                           other obligation that ranks senior to or pari passu
                           with Sellers' obligations under the DIP Agreement.

                  (ii)     Except as described on Schedule 4.1(w), no event or
                           condition has occurred that constitutes or would,
                           with the lapse of time or the giving of notice, or
                           both, constitute a "Default" or "Event of Default"
                           under the DIP Agreement.

                  (iii)    All consents of the Agent or the Lenders required
                           under the DIP Agreement to Sellers' execution and

                           transactions contemplated hereby and Sellers'
                           performance of their obligations hereunder have been
                           obtained.

                  (iv)     Since February 17, 2004, Availability as evidenced by
                           WSC's borrowing base certificate has been greater
                           than $5,000,000 but less than $20,000,000.

                  (v)      WSC has not requested, and the Agent and the Lenders
                           have not made, any Overadvance or Collateral
                           Protection Loan.

                  (vi)     The budget referred to in Section 4.1(w)(i) contains
                           the true and correct budget for Sellers' professional
                           fees and expenses related to the Bankruptcy Case (as
                           defined in the DIP Agreement) as approved by the
                           Bankruptcy Court, the Agent and the Lenders.

                  (x)      shall not enter into, amend, modify or terminate, in

         (b)      Cooperation. Sellers shall use commercially reasonable efforts
                  to (i) obtain the Consents, (ii) take, or cause to be taken,
                  all action and to do, or cause to be done, all things
                  necessary or proper, consistent with applicable law, to
                  consummate and make effective as soon as possible the
                  transactions contemplated hereby, including, without
                  limitation, commencing the FWH Bankruptcy Case and the WVHC
                  Bankruptcy Case and, after such commencement in the case of
                  FWH and WVHC, assuming and ratifying this Agreement in such
                  bankruptcy cases, and (iii) assist Buyer in the transfer of or
                  obtaining any Permits required to own the Acquired Assets.
                  Sellers acknowledge that Buyer has the right, in cooperation
                  with Sellers, to take any and all commercially reasonable
                  actions in order to obtain the Consents without the incurrence
                  of cost or obligation to Sellers. In addition, Sellers shall
                  use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, and assist
                  Buyer in obtaining, such Consents; provided, however, that (A)
                  Buyer has no obligation to obtain the Consents (other than to
                  sign an assumption agreement, pay Cure Costs and provide
                  adequate assurances as contemplated by this Agreement), (B)
                  Buyer will not incur any liability under this Agreement or
                  otherwise for Buyer's failure to take any further actions to
                  obtain such Consents and (C) in no event will any failure of
                  Buyer to obtain such Consents be construed as a waiver by
                  Buyer of any of the conditions set forth in Section 7.2.

         (c)      Access to Records and Properties. Buyer shall be entitled, at
                  its expense, and Sellers shall permit Buyer, to conduct such
                  investigation of the condition (financial or otherwise),
                  businesses, assets, properties or operations of Sellers as
                  Buyer shall reasonably deem appropriate. Sellers shall (i)
                  provide Buyer and its Related Persons full and complete access
                  at any reasonable time to all the facilities, offices and
                  personnel of Sellers and to all of the books and records of
                  Sellers, including, without limitation, to perform field
                  examinations and inspections of Sellers' inventories and other
                  properties; (ii) cause Sellers' respective Related Persons to
                  furnish Buyer with such financial and operating data and other
                  information with respect to the condition (financial or
                  otherwise), businesses, assets, properties or operations as
                  Buyer shall reasonably request; (iii) provide Buyer and the
                  Title Company with all customary documents, certificates and
                  instruments required by the Title Company to issue the title
                  insurance contemplated by Section 7.2(h); and (iv) permit
                  Buyer to make such inspections and copies thereof as Buyer may
                  require, including, without limitation, to conduct such
                  environmental assessments and investigations of the Real
                  Property and surrounding real property as Buyer or its
                  advisors and consultants may deem reasonably necessary or
                  appropriate and to conduct sampling and analysis of
                  environmental media to detect the presence or confirm the
                  absence of contamination, including any contamination which
                  may be present in groundwater and the sources of any such
                  contamination; provided, however, that Buyer shall use
                  commercially reasonable efforts to prevent any such
                  investigation from unreasonably interfering with the operation
                  of the businesses of Sellers. In addition, at Buyer's expense,
                  Sellers shall (i) consistent with its anti-trust guidelines,
                  provide Buyer and its Related Persons with full and complete
                  access to its customers and suppliers and the opportunity to
                  make cooperative and investigative sales calls on its
                  customers; (ii) provide Buyer and its Related Persons office
                  space at its facilities and access to such office space at all
                  times; and (iii) permit Buyer and its Related Persons to talk
                  to the employees of any Seller as Buyer deems appropriate for
                  the purpose of

                                       24
<PAGE>

                  determining the suitability of such employees for employment
                  by Buyer after the Closing Date; provided, however, that Buyer
                  shall use reasonable efforts to prevent any such conversations
                  from unreasonably interfering with the operations of Sellers'
                  respective businesses and such employee's duties with Sellers.

         (d)      Notice of Certain Events. Sellers shall promptly notify Buyer
                  of, and furnish Buyer any information it may reasonably
                  request with respect to, the occurrence of any event or
                  condition or the existence of any fact that would reasonably
                  be expected to cause any of the conditions to Buyer's
                  obligations to consummate the transaction(s) contemplated by
                  this Agreement or by any Ancillary Agreement not to be
                  fulfilled.

         (e)      Buyer's Right to Advise. Buyer shall have the right to consult
                  with, and make specific recommendations to, Sellers regarding
                  all aspects of management and operations of Sellers and
                  potential cost-cutting measures that may be implemented prior
                  to the Closing Date. Sellers agree to consider in good faith,
                  and in their reasoned business judgment, any such
                  recommendations and to discuss such recommendations with
                  Buyer. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this
                  Agreement shall give Buyer or its Affiliates, directly or
                  indirectly, the right to control or direct the management and
                  operations of Sellers prior to the Closing Date. Prior to the
                  Closing Date, Sellers shall exercise, consistent with the
                  terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control,
                  supervision and decision-making authority over the management
                  and operations of Sellers.

         (f)      Reporting; Payoff Certificate. Sellers will provide Buyer with
                  periodic reports of the amount of the Senior Debt (including a
                  break-out of the components thereof) and all other
                  documentation reasonably requested by Buyer from time to time
                  prior to the Closing in connection with the determination of
                  the Purchase Price Increase and Sellers' compliance with the
                  covenants contained in Section 5.1(g). No later than two
                  Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Sellers will provide
                  Buyer with a certification of the amount required to
                  indefeasibly and finally satisfy the Senior Debt in full in
                  cash (except that for each Unresolved Claim Sellers will
                  instead certify as to their best estimate of the amount of
                  such Unresolved Claim as of the Closing Date) (the "PAYOFF
                  CERTIFICATE"), including a certification from the Agent of the
                  amount required to indefeasibly and finally satisfy the DIP
                  Obligations in full in cash on the Closing Date.

         (g)      Covenant Compliance.

                  (i)      From the Execution Date until the Closing Date, WSC
                           will comply with all of its covenants under the DIP
                           Agreement and will not cause or permit to occur any
                           event or condition that constitutes a "Default" or
                           "Event of Default" under the DIP Agreement; provided
                           that (A) WSC's failure to comply with the Minimum
                           Cumulative EBITDAR, Minimum Monthly EBITDAR,
                           Cumulative Restructuring Expenses and Individual
                           Restructuring Expenses covenants listed on Exhibit
                           8.3 to the DIP Agreement will not be a breach
                           hereunder (1) if such failure is waived by the Agent
                           and the Lenders without amendment to the DIP
                           Agreement; or (2) if such waiver is not made or
                           obtained, so long as the failure to comply with any
                           such covenant or covenants does not result in a
                           material change

                                       25
<PAGE>

                           in the Agent's or the Lenders' administration of the
                           loans under the DIP Agreement; and (B) the execution
                           and delivery of this Agreement by Sellers, and the
                           consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby,
                           will not be a breach hereunder notwithstanding
                           Section 8.2.9 and Section 10.1.21 of the DIP
                           Agreement.

                  (ii)     From the Execution Date until the Closing Date, WSC
                           will not in any material respect amend or modify the
                           DIP Agreement or change its administration of its
                           borrowings thereunder, or permit any such amendment,
                           modification or change.

                  (iii)    From the Execution Date until the Closing Date, WSC
                           will not request or permit the issuance of any
                           additional Letters of Credit or LC Guaranties or
                           amend, modify or extend any outstanding Letters of
                           Credit or LC Guaranties.

                  (iv)     Nothing in this Agreement, including, without
                           limitation, the provisions of Section 4.1(w)(iii) and
                           Section 5.1(g)(i), shall be construed as a waiver by
                           the Agent or any Lender of any Default or Event of
                           Default under the DIP Agreement that may be
                           continuing on the Amendment Date or any Default or
                           Event of Default under the DIP Agreement that may
                           occur after the Amendment Date, and the parties
                           hereto acknowledge that the Agent and the Lenders
                           have not agreed to forbear with respect to any of
                           their respective rights or remedies concerning any
                           Default or Event of Default under the DIP Agreement
                           that may have occurred or are continuing as of the
                           Amendment Date or that may occur thereafter.

         (h)      Cash Sweeps. Sellers will continue to permit daily cash sweeps
                  of all of Sellers' bank accounts as currently required by the
                  Agent, and Agent will continue to apply all such cash to
                  reduce the DIP Obligations. Sellers do not currently own and
                  will not prior to the Closing Date acquire any cash
                  equivalents, including, without limitation, any money market
                  funds, certificates of deposit or similar investment
                  securities.

                  to take, or cause to be taken, all action and to do, or cause

                  Sellers to assist Sellers in obtaining the Bankruptcy Court's
                  entry of the Bankruptcy Sale Order and any other order of the
                  Bankruptcy Court reasonably necessary to consummate the
                  transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

                  of, and furnish Sellers any information it may reasonably
                  request with respect to, the occurrence of any event or
                  condition or the existence of any fact that would reasonably
                  be expected to cause any of the conditions to Sellers'
                  obligations to consummate the transactions contemplated by
                  this Agreement or by any Ancillary Agreement not to be

         (e)      Environmental Permits. Buyer shall use commercially reasonable
                  efforts to promptly obtain or consummate the transfer to Buyer
                  of any Permit required to operate the Acquired Assets under
                  applicable Environmental Laws and Buyer shall periodically

         (a)      Litigation Assistance. From and after the Closing Date, at the
                  request and at the sole expense of Sellers, Buyer shall use

         (b)      Improper Receipt of Payment. From and after the Closing Date,
                  (i) Sellers shall promptly forward to Buyer any and all
                  payments received by Sellers from customers or any other
                  Persons that constitute part of the Acquired Assets and (ii)
                  Buyer and ISG shall promptly forward to Sellers any and all
                  payments received by Buyer or ISG from customers or any other
                  Persons that constitute part of the Excluded Assets.

         (c)      Management of Expenses. Sellers shall use commercially
                  reasonable efforts to minimize the actual amount of the
                  Retained Liabilities and the Assumed Liabilities.

         (d)      Disclosure Supplements. Sellers, on the one hand, shall notify
                  ISG and Buyer of, and Buyer on the other hand, shall notify
                  Sellers of, and shall supplement or amend the Schedules to
                  this Agreement with respect to, any matter that (i) may arise
                  after the Execution Date and that, if existing or occurring at
                  or prior to the Execution Date, would have been required to be
                  set forth or described in the Schedules to this Agreement or
                  (ii) makes it necessary to correct any information in the
                  Schedules to this Agreement or in any representation and
                  warranty of Sellers, ISG or Buyer, as applicable, that has
                  been rendered inaccurate thereby. Each such notification and
                  supplementation shall be made no later than three days before
                  the date set for the Closing by the parties. No supplement or
                  amendment to the Schedules to this Agreement or any delivery
                  of Schedules after the Execution Date, unless expressly
                  acknowledged by Buyer or Sellers, as applicable, as a cure or
                  modification, shall be deemed to cure any inaccuracy of

                                       27
<PAGE>

                  any representation or warranty made in this Agreement or
                  modify, affect or diminish Buyer's right to exclude Contracts
                  as provided in Section 1.6(a) or Buyer's or Sellers' right to
                  terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1.

         (e)      Bulk Sale Compliance. Notwithstanding anything contained in
                  this Agreement, ISG and Buyer hereby waive compliance with any
                  bulk sale rule that relates to any Taxes of Sellers.

         (f)      Government Consents. Within ten business days following the
                  Execution Date, each of ISG and WSC will file or cause to be
                  filed a Notification and Report Form and related material with
                  the Federal Trade Commission and the Antitrust Division of the
                  United States Department of Justice under the
                  Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as
                  amended, together with all of its implementing regulations
                  ("HSR ACT"), will use its respective reasonable best efforts
                  to obtain early termination of the applicable waiting period
                  under all Antitrust Laws and will take all further actions and
                  make all further filings pursuant to the Antitrust Laws that
                  may be necessary, proper or advisable. Fees payable to any
                  Government in connection with filings required by the
                  Antitrust Laws will be shared equally by Buyer and WSC.
                  Nothing contained in this Agreement will require Buyer or any
                  of its Affiliates or Related Persons to enter into any
                  agreement, consent decree or other commitment requiring Buyer
                  or any of its Affiliates or Related Persons to (x) divest or
                  hold separate any assets of Sellers, ISG or any of their
                  Affiliates or Related Persons, (y) litigate, pursue or defend
                  any action or proceeding challenging any of the transactions
                  contemplated hereby as violative of any Antitrust Laws, or (z)
                  take any other action. In connection with the foregoing, each
                  party (a) will promptly notify the other party in writing of
                  any communication received by that party or its Affiliates or
                  Related Persons from any Government, and subject to applicable
                  law, provide the other party with a copy of any such written
                  communication (or written summary of any oral communication),
                  and (b) will not participate in any substantive meeting or
                  discussion with any Government in respect of any filing,
                  investigation or inquiry concerning the transactions
                  contemplated by this Agreement unless it consults with the
                  other party in advance, and to the extent permitted by such
                  Government, give the other party the opportunity to attend and
                  participate thereat.

         Section 5.4 Employment Covenants and Other Undertakings.

         (a)      Employee Benefits. Except as provided in Section 1.3(e),
                  Sellers shall retain all liabilities and obligations in
                  respect of its past, present and future employees under
                  applicable laws and the Sellers Benefit Plans. Without
                  limiting the generality of the foregoing or of Section 1.4,
                  Buyer shall have no liability or obligation whatsoever under
                  the Sellers Benefit Plans nor shall Buyer assume the
                  sponsorship of the Sellers Benefit Plans. Unless and until
                  such Sellers Benefit Plans are terminated, Sellers shall
                  retain sponsorship and all of its rights and obligations under
                  all of the Sellers Benefit Plans. Prior to or upon
                  commencement of employment with Buyer of any employees of
                  Sellers hired by Buyer as of or after the Closing, Buyer shall
                  offer such employees and their dependents employee benefits on
                  such terms and conditions as Buyer may, in its sole
                  discretion, determine, including, without limitation, such
                  terms and

                                       28
<PAGE>

                  conditions as Buyer may in its sole discretion agree with the
                  ISU or with any other labor organization representing such
                  employees.

         (b)      Future Employment. Buyer, in its sole discretion, may offer
                  employment from and after the Closing to such employees or
                  former employees of Sellers, and on such terms and conditions
                  as required by an Acquired Contract or as Buyer may determine,
                  in its sole discretion, including, without limitation, such
                  terms and conditions as Buyer may in its sole discretion agree
                  with the ISU or with any other labor organization representing
                  such employees.

         (c)      No Right to Employment. Nothing herein expressed or implied
                  shall confer upon any of the employees of any Seller, Buyer or
                  any of their or its respective Affiliates, any rights or
                  remedies, including any right to employment or continued
                  employment for any specified period, of any nature or kind
                  whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement. Except as
                  required by law or labor agreement, Buyer shall not be
                  required to hire any employee of any Seller after the Closing,
                  and the employment of any such employees may be terminated
                  after the Closing in accordance with the applicable law or
                  labor agreement.

         (d)      Employment Records. Except as otherwise provided in the
                  Transition Services Agreement and for those records required
                  by law to be maintained by Buyer, Sellers shall use
                  commercially reasonable efforts to remove the Employment
                  Records from the Real Property as soon as practicable after
                  Sellers no longer require the use of such Employment Records.
                  Any Employment Records remaining on the Real Property after
                  Sellers no longer require the use of such Employment Records
                  may be removed, disposed of or destroyed by Buyer; provided,
                  however, that Buyer must give Sellers 30 days written notice
                  before removing, disposing of or destroying such Employment
                  Records, except as otherwise required by law.

         (e)      Labor Matters. During the period between the Execution Date
                  and the Closing Date, Buyer and Sellers shall reasonably
                  cooperate on labor matters to effect the transactions
                  contemplated by this Agreement and the orderly transition of
                  the operations of the Acquired Assets from Sellers to Buyer.
                  Sellers shall comply with any obligations to bargain with any
                  labor organizations representing their employees with respect
                  to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and/or the
                  effects of such transactions on their represented employees,
                  in accordance with applicable law.

         (f)      Plant Closing Laws. Other than the implementation of layoffs
                  associated with WSC's current coke shortage, without Buyer's
                  prior written consent, Sellers shall take no action that
                  results in a "plant closing" or "mass layoff" within the
                  definitions of the WARN Act or any applicable state laws prior
                  to the Closing. At least 60 days prior to the Closing, Sellers
                  shall provide a contingent notice (in a form subject to the
                  review and comment of Buyer) to all affected employees or
                  their labor representatives, as well as appropriate state and
                  local government officials, in compliance with the WARN Act
                  and any applicable state laws.

         (g)      Other Obligations. Except as otherwise required by law,
                  specified in this Agreement, or otherwise agreed in writing by
                  Buyer and/or its Affiliates, neither Buyer nor its Affiliates
                  shall be obligated to provide any severance, separation

                                       29
<PAGE>

                  pay, or other payments or benefits, including any key employee
                  retention payments, to any employee of any Seller on account
                  of any termination of such employee's employment on or before
                  the Closing Date, and such benefits (if any) shall be payable
                  by Sellers.

         (h)      Health Insurance Coverage. (i) As soon as administratively
                  possible after the Execution Date, Sellers shall file a motion
                  with the Bankruptcy Court seeking to terminate their
                  obligations to provide health insurance benefits (other than
                  COBRA) to their retirees. Promptly upon the entry of such an
                  order, Sellers shall terminate their obligations to provide
                  health insurance benefits (other than COBRA) to their
                  retirees. Sellers shall take steps to ensure that such
                  termination of Sellers' obligations to provide retiree health
                  insurance benefits shall be effective prior to the Closing
                  Date. Buyer shall be entitled to review and comment on any
                  documents filed with the Bankruptcy Court related to the
                  termination of Sellers' retiree health insurance obligation
                  (including motions pursuant to Bankruptcy Code section 1114).

                  (ii) Sellers shall, either directly or through a third party
                  at Sellers' expense, provide all notices that Sellers' former
                  employees and retirees are entitled to receive under COBRA in
                  connection with a group health plan provided by Sellers,
                  subject to the timely review and comment of Buyer. Notices
                  required as a result of a qualifying event under Code section
                  4980B(f)(3) shall be provided promptly after the qualifying
                  event and shall include information with regard to an
                  individual's ability to receive the tax credit provided under
                  Code section 35. Sellers shall, at Buyer's reasonable request,
                  include with any notice described in this Section 5.4(h) any
                  materials requested by Buyer in a timely manner, which
                  materials shall be subject to Sellers' review and comment. If
                  the materials included at Buyer's request with the notice
                  described in this Section 5.4(h) increase the cost of such
                  notice, Buyer shall be responsible for paying the amount equal
                  to such increase in cost.

                  (iii) Sellers shall take reasonable actions necessary to
                  ensure that the initial COBRA continuation coverage elections
                  of its former employees, retirees and their dependents are
                  reported to Sellers. Sellers shall maintain records ("COBRA
                  RECORDS") of each of Sellers' former employees, retirees and
                  their dependents who elect COBRA continuation coverage as a
                  result of receiving the notice described in this Section
                  5.4(h) or who were receiving COBRA continuation coverage from
                  Sellers on the Closing Date. Such COBRA Records shall include
                  (i) the name and address of the former employee or retiree,
                  (ii) the specific qualifying event (listed under Code section
                  4980B(f)(3)) that entitled the former employee or retiree and
                  his or her dependents to elect COBRA continuation coverage,
                  (iii) the date on which COBRA continuation coverage was
                  elected, (iv) the type of health plan coverage elected, and
                  (v) the name of the former employee or retiree's dependents
                  who elected COBRA continuation coverage.

                  (iv) Sellers shall provide Buyer with the COBRA Records after
                  the expiration of the time period during which Sellers' former
                  employees and retirees are entitled to elect the COBRA
                  continuation coverage. Beginning on the later of the Closing
                  Date or 60 days or such shorter time as the parties may
                  reasonably agree after Seller provides Buyer with the COBRA
                  Records, Buyer shall provide the

                                       30
<PAGE>

                  continuation coverage pursuant to COBRA to any of Sellers'
                  former employees, retirees or their dependents who are "m & a
                  qualified beneficiaries" (as defined in 26 C.F.R. Section
                  54.4980B-9) and who elect such coverage, if entitled to do so.
                  Sellers shall provide the continuation coverage pursuant to
                  COBRA to any of Sellers' former employees, retirees and their
                  dependents until Buyer begins COBRA continuation coverage for
                  such persons in accordance with this paragraph.

         (i)      Employee and Retiree Information. To the extent necessary to
                  enable Buyer to meet any obligation Buyer may have to any
                  employees, former employees and retirees of Sellers after the
                  Closing Date, Sellers shall provide to Buyer, at Buyer's
                  request, in a format reasonably acceptable to Buyer, the name,
                  social security number, dates of service, most recent job
                  position, seniority, and most recent annual salary or wage
                  rate of each employee, retiree and any former employee with
                  reemployment or recall rights of Sellers and the name or names
                  of each such employee's, retiree's and former employee's
                  spouse and dependents; provided, however, that Sellers shall
                  be obligated to provide only such information as may be
                  reflected on Sellers' records. Sellers shall also provide to
                  Buyer, at Buyer's request, such additional available
                  information with regard to employees, former employees and
                  retirees of Sellers as Buyer may reasonably request in
                  connection with any obligation Buyer may have to such
                  employees, former employees and retirees of Sellers after the
                  Closing Date.

reasonable advance notice, the senior management of Sellers for their
participation in any "road shows" or other meetings with potential financing
sources or investors for the Financing and any Offering and assist with
responding to questions and inquiries of financing sources and investors
regarding the Financing and any Offering; (c) upon the discovery of the
occurrence of any event which causes any prospectus included in any registration
statement or Offering Memorandum (or amendment or supplement thereto) to contain
any untrue statement of a material fact with respect to Sellers or to omit any
material fact necessary to make the statements therein with respect to Sellers,
in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading,
promptly notify ISG and Buyer of such event and use their commercially
reasonable efforts to assist ISG and Buyer in preparing and filing with the SEC
an appropriate amendment or supplement to any such registration statement (and
any prospectus contained therein) or Offering Memorandum and, in the case of any
registration statement, filing the same with the SEC; (d) deliver to ISG and

therein (or in the case of a private placement, as would be required for a
registered offering of similar securities), which financial statements and other
information shall comply with the requirements of Regulation S-X, and such other
financial statements and information as otherwise may be requested by any
financing source in connection with the Financing or required under the
Securities Laws to be included in any ISG Report or registration statement or
Offering Memorandum not later than five business days prior to the date such
financial statements and information are so required; (e) if the Securities Laws
require financial statements (including pro forma financial statements) for
periods beginning before the Closing Date to be provided in any ISG Report or
registration statement (or in the case of a private placement, as would be
required for a registered offering of similar securities) that do not conform to
the historical financial statements prepared by Sellers, deliver such financial
information and provide ISG and Buyer with reasonable assistance in the
preparation of the additional financial statements required by the Securities
Laws not later than five business days prior to the date such financial
statements are so required; (f) use commercially reasonable efforts to cause
Sellers' independent public accountants to conduct all reviews and provide all
financial reports and information required by the Securities Laws, or as may
otherwise be customary for transactions such as any Offering, including
customary "comfort" letters and consents, to be completed in connection with the
preparation of any ISG Report or registration statement or Offering Memorandum;
(g) reasonably assist ISG and Buyer with the hosting of one or more meetings

limited purpose of paying any or all Payroll Liabilities assumed at the Closing.
In such case, Buyer shall notify WSC of those current and former employees of
WSC, and those Payroll Liabilities, for which WSC shall act as Buyer's agent. As
promptly as practicable after such notice is given, and in any event not less
than three Business Days prior to the date on which any assumed Payroll
Liability is due to be paid, WSC shall provide to Buyer a statement of the gross
amount of the Payroll Liabilities and a breakdown thereof in reasonable detail.
WSC shall pay any Payroll Liability assumed by Buyer on the later to occur of
(i) the date on which such payment is due and (ii) one Business Day after WSC
receives from Buyer the funds to pay such Payroll Liability. At Buyer's request
and expense, WSC shall take such steps as Buyer may reasonably request
(including, without limitation, establishment of one or more separate bank
accounts not subject to the control of any lender of WSC) to segregate and
protect funds advanced by Buyer pursuant to this Section 5.6.

                  Liabilities as is reasonably necessary for the preparation and
                  filing of any Tax Return, claim for refund or other required
                  or optional filings relating to Tax matters, for the
                  preparation for and proof of facts during any Tax audit, for
                  the preparation for any Tax protest, for the prosecution or
                  defense of any suit or other proceeding relating to Tax
                  matters and for the answer to any Government relating to Tax
                  matters.

         (b)      Buyer shall retain possession of all accounting, business,
                  financial and Tax records and information (i) relating to the
                  Acquired Assets or the Assumed Liabilities that are in
                  existence on the Closing Date and transferred to Buyer
                  hereunder and (ii) coming into existence after the Closing
                  Date that relate to the Acquired Assets or the Assumed
                  Liabilities before the Closing Date, for a period of at least
                  three years from the Closing Date. Buyer shall give Sellers
                  notice and an opportunity to retain any such records in the
                  event that Buyer determines to destroy or dispose of them
                  after such period. In addition, from and after the Closing
                  Date, Buyer shall provide access to Sellers and their Related
                  Persons (after reasonable notice and during normal business
                  hours and without charge), to the books, records, documents
                  and other information relating to the Acquired Assets or the
                  Assumed Liabilities as Sellers may reasonably deem necessary
                  to (i) properly prepare for, file, prove, answer, prosecute
                  and/or defend any such Tax Return, claim, filing, tax audit,
                  tax protest, suit, proceeding or answer or (ii) administer or
                  complete any cases under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code of
                  Sellers. Such access shall include, without limitation, access
                  to any computerized information retrieval systems relating to
                  the Acquired Assets or the Assumed Liabilities.

         Section 6.3 Allocation of Purchase Price. Buyer and Sellers will
allocate the Total Consideration among the Acquired Assets in accordance with a
schedule to be reasonably agreed by them prior to the Closing Date (the
"ALLOCATION"). If the parties are not able to agree upon the Allocation prior to
the Closing Date, then Buyer's allocation shall be the Allocation. The
Allocation will be binding upon Buyer and Sellers and their respective
successors and assigns, and none of the parties to this Agreement will take any
position (whether in returns, audits or otherwise) that is inconsistent with the
Allocation. Buyer and Sellers will report the purchase and sale of the Acquired
Assets on all tax returns, including, without limitation, Form 8594 as provided
for in section 1060 of the Code, in accordance with the Allocation and will
cooperate in timely filing with the Internal Revenue Service their respective
Forms 8594.

                  remains effective until the earlier of (A) July 1, 2005 or (B)
                  the date that ISG or Buyer, as applicable, becomes
                  self-insured for its workers' compensation risk in the State
                  of West Virginia and (ii) if ISG or Buyer does not become
                  self-insured on or before July 1, 2005, then as of July 1,
                  2005, ISG's or Buyer's experience modification factor shall be
                  calculated based upon the experience of ISG or Buyer, as

                  current leasehold interest therein) is included with the
                  Acquired Assets conveyed to Buyer at Closing, or (ii) the

of any breach of their covenants or other obligations, the others would suffer

                           modifications are likely to delay closing of the sale
                           of the Acquired Assets and Assumed Liabilities to the
                           Bidder and the cost to Sellers of such modifications
                           or delay; (D) extent to which such Bid covers less
                           than or more than all of the Acquired Assets and

                           considered by Sellers unless they are $1,000,000 more
                           than the sum of the (x) Total Consideration, (y)
                           Break-Up Fee and (z) Expense Reimbursement; (B) any
                           Bids thereafter must be at least $2,000,000 higher
                           than the then existing highest or better Bid; and (C)
                           a provision that Buyer will be credited with, and
                           have added to the aggregate amount of its bid when

                           successful bidder for the Acquired Assets.

                  (ii)     In determining the value of the consideration offered
                           under a Qualified Bid, Sellers shall value the
                           liabilities proposed to be assumed by the Bidder in a
                           manner consistent with the valuation methodology used
                           to value Buyer's and ISG's Qualified Bid as reflected
                           in the Agreement.
