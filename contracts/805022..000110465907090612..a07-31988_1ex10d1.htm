enter into, deliver and carry out its obligations pursuant to each of the
Transaction Documents to which it is a party. The Purchaser is duly
authorized to conduct business and is in good standing under the Laws of each
jurisdiction where such authorization is required, except where the failure

by the Purchaser and no other limited liability company proceeding on the
part of the Purchaser is necessary to authorize the Transaction Documents and

of the Purchaser enforceable against the Purchaser in accordance with its
terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by (i)
applicable insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization, moratorium or other
similar laws affecting creditors rights generally, and (ii) applicable
equitable principles (whether considered in a proceeding at law or in
equity).

  

### 

  

### (b) The execution, delivery and performance by the Purchaser of the
Transaction Documents to which the Purchaser is a party and the consummation
of the Transactions do not and shall not (with or without notice or lapse of
time or both): (i) conflict with or result in a breach of the terms,

obtaining such consent or any costs and expenses of any third Person
resulting from the process of obtaining any such consent. The Company and the
Purchaser shall furnish promptly to each other all information that is not
otherwise available to the other Party and that such Party may reasonably
request in connection with such authorizations and consents.

## 5.8 _Employee Matters_.

  

## 

  

### (a) For a period of ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, the
Purchaser shall not terminate Business Employees in such numbers as would
trigger any Liabilities under the Worker Adjustment and
Retraining Notification Act, 29 U.S.C. § 2101, et seq. (" _WARN_ ") or any
state or local plant closing or severance Law.  The Purchaser shall comply
with any notice or filing requirements under WARN and any state or local
plant closing or severance Law. The Purchaser is responsible for
providing notice under WARN and any state or local plant closing or severance
law of any plant closing or mass layoff which takes place or is triggered on
or after the Closing Date.

  

### 

  

### (b) From and after the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall, and shall cause
FandH LLC to, honor (without modification) each written Contract between the
Company and/or FandH LLC and any Business Employee that (i) existed as of the
date hereof, and (ii) is set forth in _Section 4.14_ or _Section 4.18(g)
_of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

  

### 

  

### (c) Subject to any greater compensation and benefits provided in an
employment agreement with any Business Employee, during the twelve (12)-month
period commencing at the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall provide, or shall
cause FandH LLC to provide, to any Business Employee (as long as such Business
Employee continues to be employed by FandH LLC during such period) compensation
and benefits, including the Employee Plans and Employee Benefit Arrangements,
that are in the aggregate, substantially comparable to

        
   

  



  

### and no less favorable than the compensation and benefits being
provided to Business Employees as of the date of this Agreement;
_provided, however_ , that nothing herein shall prohibit the Purchaser
from replacing any such existing Employee Plan or Employee Benefit
Arrangement with a plan, policy, program or arrangement which provide such
Business Employees with benefits that are in the aggregate substantially
comparable to and no less favorable than the benefits that would have been
provided under such existing Employee Plan or Employee Benefit Arrangement.

  

### 

  

### (d) The Purchaser shall cause FandH LLC to provide severance compensation
to employees involuntarily terminated during the twelve (12)-month period
commencing at the Closing Date in accordance with a severance policy
reasonably acceptable to the Sellers, the principal terms of which are set
forth on _Exhibit 5.8_ attached hereto.

  

### 

  

### (e) Without limiting the generality of Section 5.8(b), with respect to
any employee benefit plan, policy, program or arrangement as may be
maintained for Business Employees from time to time following the Closing
Date by Purchaser and/or FandH LLC (including plans, policies, programs or
arrangements providing severance benefits and vacation entitlement), service
by such Business Employees performed for FandH LLC and/or the Company prior to
Closing shall be treated as service with the Purchaser or FandH LLC, as the
case may be, for purposes of determining eligibility to participate and
vesting. Such service also shall apply for purposes of satisfying any waiting
periods, evidence of insurability requirements, or the application of any
preexisting condition limitations. The Purchaser shall also honor, or cause
FandH LLC to honor, all vacation, personal and sick days accrued by the
Business Employees under the Employee Plans and Employee Benefit
Arrangements immediately prior to the Closing Date, to the extent reserved
against the Financial Statements.

  

### 

  

### (f) Without limiting the generality of Section 5.8(b), the Purchaser
shall cause FandH LLC to honor, in accordance with their terms, and shall, or
shall cause FandH LLC to, make required payments when due under, all Employee
Plans and Employee Benefit Arrangements maintained or contributed to by FandH
LLC or to which FandH LLC is a party (including employment, incentive and
severance agreements and arrangements), that are applicable with respect to
any Business Employee or any director of the Company or manager of FandH LLC
(whether current, former or retired) or their beneficiaries; _provided,
however,_ that the foregoing shall not preclude the Purchaser or FandH LLC from
amending or terminating any Employee Plan or Employee Benefit Arrangement in
accordance with its terms.

  

### 

  

## 5.9 _Record Retention_. The Parties agree that for a period of seven (7)
years after the Closing Date, or for a longer period if required by Law,
without the prior written consent of the Sellers (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed), neither the Purchaser nor any of its
Affiliates shall dispose of or destroy any of the books and records purchased
hereunder which may be relevant to any legal, regulatory or Tax audit,
investigation, inquiry or requirement of any of the Sellers without first
offering such records to the Sellers.

  

## 

  

## 5.10 _Rights to Indemnification_. FandH LLCs certificate of formation
and operating agreement (at the time of the FandH LLC Merger) shall contain
the same provisions relating to indemnification and exculpation of managers
and officers of FandH LLC (and, with respect to the period prior to the
FandH LLC Merger, directors and officers of the Company) as currently

        
   

  



  

## contained in the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the Company
(with respect to officers and directors of the Company) for acts and
omissions on or prior to the Closing Date. The Purchaser shall not amend,
alter, modify, or terminate any provisions in FandH LLCs certificate of
formation or operating agreement or other equivalent governing documents in a
manner which would remove, limit or impair such provisions providing for such
indemnification and exculpation. The Purchaser shall cause FandH LLC to
maintain insurance coverage under a director and officers liability insurance
policy for a period of not less than six (6) years from the date hereof (in
amounts no less favorable than those of such policy in effect on the date
hereof and sufficient in scope to insure against FandH LLCs obligations in its
certificate of formation and operating agreement, including coverage for the
period up to and including Closing Date).  In lieu of the foregoing, the
Purchaser may purchase six-year "tail" coverage covering acts or omissions
prior to the Closing on terms no less favorable than those contained in the
existing policy. This Section 5.10 is intended for the irrevocable benefit
of, and to grant third party rights to, the directors and officers of the
Company (and the managers and officers of FandH LLC) existing on or at anytime
prior to the Closing (and their respective heirs and
personal representatives), and shall be binding upon all successors and
assigns of the Purchaser, FandH LLC and the Company.  The directors and
officers of the Company (and the managers and officers of FandH LLC) as of
immediately prior to Closing shall be entitled to enforce the covenants
contained in this Section 5.10. In the event that FandH LLC (or any of its
successors or assigns) shall consolidate or merge with any other Person and
shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such
consolidation or merger, or transfers all or substantially all of
its properties and Assets to any other Person, then in each case proper
provision shall be made so that the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity (or its successors or assigns, if applicable), or transferee of such
Assets, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this
Section 5.10 subject to applicable Law.

  

## 

  

## 5.11 _Acknowledgement of Personal Property_. The Parties acknowledge and
agree that the personal property set forth in _Schedule 5.11_ is personal
property owned by the Sellers and that Sellers shall be entitled to remove
such personal property from the premises of the Company.

be prepared and file or cause to be filed all Tax Returns for the Company and
FandH LLC for all periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date (" _Pre-
Closing Tax Period_ ") which are filed after the Closing Date, other than
income Tax Returns and the PA Capital Stock Tax Return for such periods. Such
Tax Returns shall be prepared consistently with the past practice of the
Company, unless otherwise required by applicable Law.  Purchaser shall
permit the Sellers Representative to review and comment on each such Tax
Return described in the preceding sentence prior to filing and shall accept
all comments that are reasonable.  Purchaser shall cause the Company to pay
such Taxes in accordance with the Companys normal past practices.  Sellers
shall reimburse Purchaser for such Taxes to the extent not incurred in the
ordinary course

        
   

  



  

##### of business or incurred in a manner inconsistent with the
Companys normal past practices within fifteen (15) days of demand by
Purchaser or the Company.

  

##### 

  

##### (B) _Income Tax Returns_. ** **Sellers Representative shall prepare or
cause to be prepared all income Tax Returns (including the PA Capital Stock
Tax Return) for the Company and FandH LLC for all Pre-Closing Tax Periods. Such
income Tax Returns shall be prepared consistently with past practice of
the Company. Sellers Representative shall permit Purchaser to review and
comment on each such Tax Return described in the preceding sentence prior to
filing and shall accept all comments that are reasonable. The Purchaser, the
Company or FandH LLC shall file such Tax Returns at the direction of the
Sellers Representative on or before the applicable due date (taken into
account extension periods). With respect to all income Tax Returns of the
Company or FandH LLC that reflect a Company Tax liability (as compared to a
Seller Tax Liability), Sellers shall reimburse Purchaser for such Taxes of
the Company or FandH LLC within fifteen (15) days of payment by Purchaser, the
Company or FandH LLC of such Taxes; provided, however, that Sellers shall be
permitted to utilize any Tax credits generated by the Company during Pre-
Closing Tax Period (including Tax credits that are generated by the Companys
participation in the Pennsylvania EITC Program) to offset their portion of
the Companys Tax Liability.

  

##### 

  

#### (ii) _Tax Periods Beginning Before and Ending After the Closing Date_.
Purchaser shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed
any Tax Returns of the Company or FandH LLC for Tax periods which begin on or
before the Closing Date and end after the Closing Date (a " _Straddle Tax
Period_ )". Such Tax Returns shall be prepared consistently with the past
practice of the Company unless otherwise required by applicable Law.
Purchaser shall permit the Sellers Representative to review and comment on
each such Tax Return described in the preceding sentence prior to filing and
shall accept all comments that are reasonable. Sellers shall reimburse
Purchaser solely from the Escrow Funds within five (5) days of the date on
which income Taxes are paid with respect to such periods an amount equal to
the portion of such income Taxes which relates to the portion of such taxable
period ending on the Closing Date.

  

#### 

  

#### (iii) _Allocation._ **** For purposes of this Section 5.12, in the case
of any Taxes that are imposed on a periodic basis and are payable for a
Straddle Tax Period, the portion of such Taxes which relates to the portion
of such Straddle Tax Period ending on the Closing Date shall (x) in the case
of any Taxes other than the Taxes based upon or related to income or
receipts, be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire Straddle Tax
Period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days
in the portion of the Straddle Tax Period ending on the Closing Date and the
denominator of which is the number of days in the entire Straddle Tax Period,
and (y) in the case of any Tax based upon or related to income or receipts be
deemed equal to the amount which would be payable if the Straddle Tax Period
ended on the Closing Date. For purposes of this Section 5.12, in the case of
any Tax credit relating to a Straddle Tax Period, the portion of such Tax
credit which relates to the portion of such Straddle Tax Period ending on the
Closing Date shall be the amount which bears the same relationship to the
total amount of such Tax credit as the amount of Taxes described in (y)
above bears to the total amount of Taxes for such Straddle Tax Period.

        
   

  



  

### (b) _Cooperation on Tax Matters_.

  

### 

  

#### (i) Purchaser and each Seller shall (and Purchaser shall cause the

request) the provision of records and information reasonably relevant to any
such audit, litigation, or other proceeding and making employees available on
a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation

or other proceedings relating to Taxes for a Straddle Tax Period, and neither
party shall settle any such Tax audit or other proceeding without the written
consent of the other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld
or delayed.

  

#### 

  

#### (iii) Purchaser shall have the right to control all other Tax audits or
proceedings of the Company or FandH LLC. Purchaser shall obtain the prior
written consent of Sellers Representative prior to the settlement of any

#### or reducing any Tax asset of the Company or FandH LLC with respect to any
Pre-Closing Tax Period or portion of a Straddle-Tax Period ending on
the Closing Date.

#### (ii) After the Closing Date, Purchaser, the Company or FandH LLC will not,

the FandH LLC Membership Interests to the Company;

  

##### 

  

##### (B) next, the liquidation of the Company pursuant to which the Company
distributes all its assets to the Sellers (consisting solely of the FandH LLC
Membership Interests) in a fully taxable transaction; and

  

##### 

  

##### (C) finally, on the day following the FandH LLC Merger, the purchase by

that the agreed fair market value of the Companys and FandHs assets for the
purposes of determining the tax consequences of the liquidation of the
Company and the purchase by Purchaser of the FandH LLC Membership Interests
shall be as set forth in an agreement reached by Purchaser and Sellers
Representative (the " _Purchase Price Allocation_ "). The Purchase Price
Allocation shall be prepared consistent with the principles of Section
1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder and
in accordance with the methodology set forth on _Schedule 5.12(g)_.

  

#### 

  

#### (iii) Sellers Representative shall deliver a statement reflecting the
Purchase Price Allocation (the " _Allocation Statement_ ") to the Purchaser
no later than sixty (60) days following the Closing Date. The Purchaser shall

notifies Sellers Representative of an objection to the

        
   

  



  

#### Allocation Statement by the end of the fifteen (15) day period, and
the Sellers Representative and the Purchaser are unable to resolve
their differences within fifteen (15) days thereafter, then the disputed
items on the Allocation Statement shall be submitted to a mutually acceptable
Neutral Accounting Firm (the " _Accounting Arbitrator_ ") for resolution,
with the costs paid fifty percent (50%) by the Sellers and fifty percent
(50%) by the Purchaser, and the Accounting Arbitrator shall be instructed to
deliver a finalized Allocation Statement as soon as possible.

  

#### 

  

#### (iv) Purchaser, Sellers, the Company, FandH LLC, and their respective
Affiliates shall report, act and file all Tax Returns in all respects and for

such Tax Returns required with respect to any adjustment to the Purchase
Price. Neither Purchasers, Sellers or any of their Affiliates shall take any

with the information set forth on the Allocation Statement or that is
inconsistent with this Section 5.12(g), unless required to do so by
applicable Law.

  

#### 

  

#### (h) _Tax Treatment of Executive Bonuses_. All Tax deductions relating to

the Company as the Sellers may reasonably request; _provided_ that such
investigation or examination relates to transactions or events
occurring prior to the Closing or transaction or events occurring subsequent
to the Closing which arise out of or are related to transactions or events
occurring prior to the Closing; _provided further_ , that such investigation
shall not unreasonably interfere with the business operations of the
Purchaser or the Company.

shall survive the Closing Date and be enforceable thereafter, subject to any
time limitations contained in this Agreement.

any Acquisition Proposal (as defined below), enter into any Contract or
accept any offer relating

cessation of existence of any Seller.  This power of attorney may be
exercised by the Sellers Representative by listing the Seller executing any
Transaction Document with the single signature of the Sellers Representative
acting as attorney-in-fact for such Seller. Each Seller hereby
forever releases and discharges the Sellers Representative from any and all
liability which may arise in connection with the Sellers Representatives

Agreement or the other Transaction Documents, other than such liabilities,
losses, damages, claims, costs or expenses arising out of or resulting from
the Sellers Representatives gross negligence or willful misconduct, and in
the event there are any remaining funds in the Escrow Account to be

be entitled to recover any such losses, liabilities or expenses from the
Escrow Account prior to the distribution of funds to the Sellers.

         
 

  



  

### (c) Each Party shall be entitled to rely exclusively upon any
communication given or other action taken by the Sellers Representative on
behalf of the Sellers pursuant to this Agreement or the other Transaction
Documents.

any representation or warranty of the Purchaser contained in this Agreement
or any other Transaction Document which survives the Closing, (b) the breach

## 

  

## 6.3 _Losses Net of Insurance, Etc_. Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Article VI, which terms and conditions shall not be applicable to any
Loss arising from a breach of Sections 5.8 or 5.10, following the Closing:

  

## 

  

### (a) The amount of any Loss for which indemnification is provided under
this Article VI shall be net of any amounts (i) actually recovered or (ii)
which are covered by, and recoverable, on a commercially reasonable basis, by
the Indemnified Person, in each of (i) and (ii) under insurance policies in
effect and applicable to such Loss.

  

### 

  

### (b) Any payment or indemnity required to be made pursuant to Sections
6.1 or 6.2 shall be adjusted to take into account any reduction in Taxes
actually realized by the Indemnified Person (which term shall, for purposes
of this paragraph, include the ultimate payer(s) of Taxes in the case of an
Indemnified Person that is a branch or a disregarded entity or other pass-
through entity for any Tax purpose) as a result of the Loss giving rise to
the payment or indemnity. In determining the amount necessary to be added to
any payment or indemnity in order to accomplish the foregoing, the parties
hereto agree (i) to treat all Taxes required to be paid by, and all
reductions in Tax realized by any Indemnified Person, as if such Indemnified
Person were subject to Tax at the highest marginal Tax rates (for both
federal and state, as determined on a combined basis) applicable to such
Indemnified Person and (ii) to treat any indemnification payments made to the
Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement as an adjustment to the final Purchase
Price, unless a "Final Determination" with respect to the indemnified party
or any of its affiliates causes any such payment not to be treated as an
adjustment to the Purchase Price.  For purposes of this agreement " _Final
Determination_ " means (i) with respect to federal income Taxes, a
"determination" as defined in Section 1313(a) of the Code or execution of an
Internal IRS Form 870-AD and, (ii) with respect to Taxes other than federal
income Taxes, any final determination of liability in respect of a Tax that,
under applicable law, is not subject to further appeal, review or
modification through proceedings or otherwise (including the expiration of a
statute of limitations or a period for the filing of claims for refunds,
amended returns or appeals from adverse determinations).

        
   

  



  

### (c) In connection with an Indemnified Persons rights under this Article
VI, an Indemnified Person may seek only seek actual damages and may not seek
any other damages, including but not limited to punitive, consequential
(including loss of anticipated profits) and incidental damages, as to any
matter under, relating to or arising out of the Transaction Documents or the
Transactions.

  

### 

  

### (d) Notwithstanding Section 6.1, the Purchaser shall not be entitled to
indemnification under this Article VI with respect to any Loss that
is reflected as a Liability on the Latest Balance Sheet or reflected in
the footnotes to the Financial Statements.

  

### 

  

### (e) No Person shall be entitled to indemnification under this Article
VI with respect to any Loss that is attributable to any action taken or
omitted to be taken by such Person or any of its Affiliates. The Indemnified
Person shall cooperate with each Indemnifying Person with respect to
resolving any Liabilities with respect to which such Person is obligated to
indemnify the other Person, including by making commercially reasonable
efforts to mitigate or resolve any such Liabilities. In the event that
the Indemnified Person shall fail to cooperate and make such efforts to
mitigate or resolve any such Liabilities, then notwithstanding anything else
to the contrary contained herein, each Indemnifying Person shall not be
required to indemnify any Person for any Loss that could reasonably be
expected to have been avoided if the Indemnified Person had made such
efforts.

  

### 

  

### (f) The indemnification provisions contained in this Article
VI (including the provisions of Section 6.1) are intended to provide the
sole and exclusive remedy following the Closing as to all Losses either party
may incur arising from or relating to the Transaction Documents (or
the representations, warranties or covenants contained therein) or
the Transactions, and each Party hereby waives, to the full extent they may
do so, any other rights or remedies that may arise under any applicable
statute, rule or regulation (other than with respect to claims for fraud).
Subject to the provisions of this Section 6.3(f), the sole source to satisfy
any and all indemnification claims of the Purchaser pursuant to Article VI
shall be the Escrow Funds, except for those claims arising from a breach of
Sections 3.1, 3.2(a), 3.3, 4.1, 4.2(a), 4.3 (other than 4.3(c)), 4.8 or 4.20
and except for claims under Section 6.1(b)(iii). With respect to claims
arising from a breach of Sections 4.1, 4.2(a), 4.3 (other than 4.3(c)), 4.8
or 4.20, no claim may be made directly against any Seller unless and until
the Escrow Funds are exhausted. For any claims arising under Section
6.1(a), Purchaser shall have the right to (and shall only have the right to)
make a claim against the Seller directly (and not the Escrow Funds or any
other Seller). If any claims involving a breach of covenants are made after
distribution of the Escrow Funds (in accordance with and subject to Section
6.6 of this Agreement), the Purchaser shall have the right to make a claim
against the Sellers directly for such matters, but in no event shall the
Sellers, in the aggregate, be liable for any or all of such claims for more
than the amount of Escrow Funds so distributed to the Sellers.
 Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no Seller in any
event shall be liable, in the aggregate, for more than such Sellers pro rata
portion of the Purchase Price received by such Seller.

  

### 

  

### (g) The indemnities herein are intended solely for the benefit of
the Persons expressly identified in Section 5.8 and 5.10 and this Article
VI (and their permitted successors and assigns) and are in no way intended
to, nor shall they, constitute an agreement for the benefit of, or be
enforceable by, any other Person.

        
   

  



  

## 6.4 _Termination of Indemnification_. The obligations to indemnify and
hold harmless an Indemnified Person pursuant to Sections 6.1 and 6.2 shall
terminate when the applicable representation, warranty or covenant terminates
pursuant to Section 6.6; _provided, however_ , that such obligations to
indemnify and hold harmless shall not terminate with respect to any specific
matter as to which the person to be indemnified shall have, before the
expiration of the applicable period, previously made a claim by delivering a
written notice thereof (stating in reasonable detail the basis of such claim)
(a " _Claim Notice_ ") to the Indemnifying Person.

  

## 

  

## 6.5 _Procedures Relating to Indemnification_. In order for an Indemnified
Person to be entitled to any indemnification provided for under this
Agreement in respect of, arising out of or involving a claim or demand made
by any Person against the Indemnified Person (a " _Third-Party Claim_ "),
such Indemnified Person must provide the Indemnifying Person with a Claim
Notice regarding the Third-Party Claim promptly and in any event within ten
(10) Business Days after receipt by such Indemnified Person of written notice
of the Third-Party Claim; _provided, however_ , that failure to give such
notification shall not affect the indemnification provided hereunder except
to the extent the Indemnifying Person shall have been actually prejudiced as
a result of such failure (except that the Indemnifying Person shall not be
liable for any expense incurred during the period in which the Indemnified
Person failed to give such notice).  Thereafter, the Indemnified Person shall
deliver to the Indemnifying Person, within five (5) Business Days after the
Indemnified Persons receipt thereof, copies of all notices and documents
(including court papers) received by the Indemnified Person relating to the
Third-Party Claim.

  

## 

  

If a Third-Party Claim is made against an Indemnified Person, the
Indemnifying Person will be entitled to participate in the defense thereof
and, if it so chooses, to assume the defense thereof with counsel selected by
the Indemnifying Person. If the Third-Party Claim includes allegations for
which the Indemnifying Person both would and would not be obligated to
indemnify the Indemnified Person, the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified
Person shall in that case jointly assume the defense thereof. Should the
Indemnifying Person so elect to assume the defense of a Third-Party Claim,
the Indemnifying Person will not be liable to the Indemnified Person for
legal fees and expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Person in
connection with the defense thereof. If the Indemnifying Person assumes such
defense, the Indemnified Person shall have the right, at its own expense, to
participate in the defense thereof and, at its own expense, to employ counsel
reasonably acceptable to the Indemnifying Person, separate from the counsel
employed by the Indemnifying Person, it being understood that
the Indemnifying Person shall control such defense.  The Indemnifying Person
shall be liable for the fees and expenses of counsel employed by the
Indemnified Person for any period during which the Indemnifying Person has
not assumed the defense thereof (other than during any period in which the
Indemnified Person shall have failed to give notice of the Third-Party Claim
as provided above). If the Indemnifying Person chooses to defend or prosecute
any Third-Party Claim, all the parties hereto shall cooperate in the defense
or prosecution thereof. Such cooperation shall include the retention and
(upon the Indemnifying Persons request) the provision to the Indemnifying
Person of records and information which are reasonably relevant to such
Third-Party Claim, and making officers, directors, employees and agents
of the Indemnified Person available on a mutually convenient basis to
provide information, testimony at depositions, hearings or trials, and such
other assistance as may be reasonably requested by the Indemnifying Person.
Whether or not the Indemnifying Person shall have assumed the defense

        
   

  



  

of a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnified Person shall not admit any liability
with respect to, or settle, compromise or discharge, such Third-Party Claim
without the Indemnifying Persons prior written consent (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). The Indemnifying Person shall not
admit any liability with respect to, or settle, compromise or discharge any
Third-Party Claim without the Indemnified Persons prior written consent
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) unless any such
admission, settlement, compromise or discharge also releases the Indemnified
Person completely in connection with such Third-Party Claim.

  



  

## 6.6 _Survival of Representations, Warranties, and Covenants_. All
representations, warranties and covenants contained in this Agreement and the
other Transaction Documents shall survive the Closing and remain in full
force and effect as follows: (a) for a period of twelve (12) months following
the Closing Date, with respect to all representations and warranties and any
covenant or agreement to be performed prior to the Closing (other than with
respect to Sections 3.1, 3.2(a), 3.3, 4.1, 4.2(a), 4.3 (other than 4.3(c)),
4.8 and 4.20 which shall survive the Closing and remain in full force and
effect until the date that is thirty (30) days after the applicable statute
of limitations), or (b) with respect to each other covenant or agreement
contained in this Agreement or any other Transaction Document, until the last
date on which such covenant or agreement is to be performed or, if no such
date is specified, for a period of three (3) years, except that any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement that would otherwise
terminate in accordance with clause (a) or (b) will continue to survive if a
written notice of a breach thereof shall have been timely given to the
breaching party by the other party on or prior to such termination date,
until the related claim for indemnification has been satisfied or otherwise
resolved as provided in this Article VI.

### (a) at any time prior to the Closing by mutual written agreement of the
Purchaser, the Company and Sellers Representative;

  

### 

  

### (b) by either the Purchaser or the Company and Sellers Representative if
a breach of any provision of this Agreement has been committed (in the case
of termination by Purchaser, a breach by the Company, Sellers Representative
or Sellers, and in the case of termination by the Company and the Sellers
Representative, a breach by Purchaser) and such breach results in a closing
condition becoming incapable of being satisfied on or prior to the Closing
Date and such breach has not been waived in writing; _provided, however_ that
a breach described above shall not give rise to a right to terminate this
Agreement under this Section 9.1(b) unless and until (i) the non-breaching
party delivers a written notice to the breaching party, notifying the
breaching party of the breach (including a reasonable description thereof)
and (ii) the breaching party fails to cure such breach within ten (10)
Business Days after delivery of such written notice ( _provided, further,
however_ , that the Party seeking termination pursuant to

        
   

  



  

### this clause (b) is not then in breach of any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement);

  

### 

  

### (c) (i) by Purchaser, if any of the conditions in Section 7.1 has not
been satisfied as of the Closing Date or if satisfaction of such a condition
is or becomes incapable of fulfillment (other than through the failure of the
Purchaser to comply with its obligations under this Agreement) and Purchaser
has not waived in writing such condition on or before the Closing Date; or
(ii) by the Company and Sellers Representative, if any of the conditions in
Section 7.2 has not been satisfied as of the Closing Date or if satisfaction

### 

  

### (d) by either the Purchaser or the Company and Sellers Representative if

## 9.2 _E_ _ffect of Termination_. Each Partys right of termination under
Section 9.1 is in addition to any other rights it may have under this

Agreement will terminate, except that the obligations of the parties in this
Section 9.1 and Sections 2.3 and 4.20 (Broker Fees), Section 5.5 (Publicity

if this Agreement is terminated because of a breach of this Agreement by the
non-terminating party or because one or more of the conditions to the
terminating partys obligations under this Agreement is not satisfied as a
result of the non-terminating partys failure to comply with its obligations
under this Agreement, then the terminating partys right (including FandH LLCs
right, as applicable) to pursue all legal remedies hereunder and otherwise
in connection with such breach will survive such termination unimpaired;
_provided further, however,_ that the Purchasers right to pursue all such
legal remedies hereunder shall be limited to the Company, and the Purchaser
shall have no right to pursue remedies under this Article IX against the
Sellers individually. In the event of termination of the Agreement, and
regardless of the reason for the termination, the Confidentiality
Agreement and any agreement executed by the Purchaser in connection with the
receipt of the Confidential Offering Memorandum of the Company shall continue
in full force and effect.

and Purchaser shall each have the right to specific performance of the
obligations of the other under this Agreement. The Sellers, the Company, FandH
LLC, and Purchaser each acknowledge that irreparable damage

        
   

  



  

## would result if this Agreement is not specifically enforced. The Sellers,
the Company, FandH LLC, and Purchaser each hereby agrees that monetary damages
would not be adequate compensation for any loss incurred by reason of a
breach by the other of the provisions of this Agreement and each hereby
agrees to waive the defense that a remedy at law may be adequate in any

##

## 

  

## 10.2 _Governing Law_. This Agreement will be governed by and construed in
accordance with the internal Laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
applicable to agreements made and to be performed entirely within such

## 10.3 _Jurisdiction; Service of Process_. Any Action or Proceeding arising
out of or relating to this Agreement or any transaction contemplated hereby
may be brought in the federal and state courts located in the Commonwealth

convenience of forum, agrees that all claims in respect of the Action or
Proceeding shall be heard and determined only in any such court and agrees

COURT AS WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE KNOWING, VOLUNTARY AND BARGAINED-FOR
AGREEMENT AMONG THE PARTIES TO IRREVOCABLY WAIVE TRIAL BY JURY AND THAT ANY

        
   

  



  

## ACTION OR PROCEEDING WHATSOEVER BETWEEN THEM RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR
ANY TRANSACTION CONTEMPLATED HEREBY SHALL INSTEAD BE TRIED IN A COURT
OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION BY A JUDGE SITTING WITHOUT A JURY.

  

## 

  

## 10.5 _Attorneys  Fees_. If any Action or Proceeding for the enforcement
of this Agreement is brought with respect to or because of an alleged
dispute, breach, default or misrepresentation in connection with any of the
provisions hereof, the successful or prevailing Party shall be entitled

or Proceeding, in addition to any other relief to which it may be entitled.

  

## 

  

## 10.6 _Waiver; Remedies Cumulative._ The rights and remedies of the Parties
to this Agreement are cumulative and not alternative. Neither any failure nor
any delay by any Party in exercising any right, power or privilege under this
Agreement or any of the other Transaction Documents will operate as a waiver
of such right, power or privilege, and no single or partial exercise of any
such right, power or privilege will preclude any other or further exercise of
such right, power or privilege or the exercise of any other right, power or
privilege. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable Law, (a) no claim or
right arising out of this Agreement or any of the other Transaction Documents
can be discharged by one Party, in whole or in part, by a waiver or
renunciation of the claim or right unless in writing signed by the other
Parties; (b) no waiver that may be given by a Party will be applicable except
in the specific instance for which it is given; and (c) no notice to or
demand on one Party will be deemed to be a waiver of any obligation of that
Party or of the right of the Party giving such notice or demand to take
further action without notice or demand as provided in this Agreement or any
of the other Transaction Documents.

  

## 

  

## 10.7 _Notices_. All notices or other communications required or permitted

with this Section 10.7.

  



  

## 10.8 _Assignment_. This Agreement shall be binding upon, and shall be
enforceable by and inure solely to the benefit of the Parties hereto and
their respective successors and assigns; _provided, however,_ that this
Agreement and the rights and obligations hereunder shall not be assignable or
transferable by any Party without the prior written consent of the other
Parties hereto; _provided further however,_ that without such
consent, Purchaser may transfer or assign, in whole or in part or from time
to time, to one or more of its Affiliates, the right to purchase all or a
portion of the FandH Membership Interests, but no such transfer or assignment
will relieve Purchaser of its obligations hereunder.

  

## 

  

## 10.9 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Except for contemplated third
party beneficiaries as expressly provided otherwise in this Agreement
(including provisions benefiting directors, officers, employees and the
Sellers contained in Sections 5.8 and 5.10 hereof and Article VI hereof),
**** this Agreement is for the sole benefit of the Parties hereto and their
permitted successors and assigns and nothing herein expressed or implied
shall give or be construed to give to any Person, other than the Parties
hereto and such successors and assigns (including FandH LLC), any legal or
equitable rights, remedy or claim hereunder.

  

## 

  

## 10.10 _Amendments or Supplements_. No amendment or supplement to this
Agreement shall be effective unless it shall be in writing and signed by the
Company, Sellers Representative and Purchaser.

  

## 

  

## 10.11 _Disclosure Schedules_. The Seller Disclosure Schedule and
the Company Disclosure Schedule (collectively, the " _Disclosure Schedules_
") shall be subject to the following terms and conditions: (a) any item
disclosed in any particular part of the Disclosure Schedules shall be deemed
to be disclosed in all parts of the Disclosure Schedules, (b) no disclosure
of any matter contained in the Disclosure Schedule shall create an
implication that such matter meets any standard of materiality (matters
reflected in the Disclosure Schedule are not necessarily limited to matters
required by this Agreement to be reflected in the Disclosure Schedule; such
additional matters are set forth for informational purposes only and do not
necessarily include other matters of a similar nature, nor shall the
inclusion of any item be construed as implying that any such item is
"material" for any purpose); (c) any disclosures contained in the Disclosure
Schedule which refer to a document are qualified in their entirety by
reference to the text of such document, a true and complete copy of which was
included in the due diligence information supplied to the Purchaser; and (d)
headings and introductory language have been inserted on the sections of the
Disclosure Schedule for convenience of reference only and shall to no extent
have the effect of amending or changing the express description of the
sections as set forth in this Agreement.

  

## 

  

## 10.12 _Construction_. In construing this Agreement, including the Exhibits
and Schedules and hereto, the following principles shall be followed: (a)
the terms "herein," "hereof," "hereby," "hereunder" and other similar terms
refer to this Agreement as a whole and not only to the

        
   

  



  

## particular Article, Section or other subdivision in which any such terms
may be employed; (b) except as otherwise set forth herein, references to
Articles, Sections, Schedules and Exhibits refer to the Articles,
Sections, Schedules and Exhibits of this Agreement, which are incorporated in
and made a part of this Agreement; (c) a reference to any Person shall
include such Persons predecessors; (d) all accounting terms not otherwise
defined herein have the meanings assigned to them in accordance with GAAP;
(e) no consideration shall be given to the headings of the Articles,
Sections, Schedules, Exhibits, subdivisions, subsections or clauses, which
are inserted for convenience in locating the provisions of this Agreement and
not as an aid in its construction; (f) the word "includes" and "including"
and their syntactical variants mean "includes, but is not limited to" and
"including, without limitation," and corresponding syntactical variant
expressions; (g) a defined term has its defined meaning throughout this
Agreement, regardless of whether it appears before or after the place in this
Agreement where it is defined, including in any Schedule or Exhibit; (h) the
word "dollar" and the symbol "$" refer to the lawful currency of the United
States of America; (i) the plural shall be deemed to include the singular and
vice versa; and (j) the phrase "local time" shall refer to Eastern Standard
Time.

  

## 

  

## 10.13 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including any Exhibit
or Schedule attached hereto) and the Transaction Documents contain the
entire agreement and understanding among the Parties hereto with respect to
the subject matter hereof and, except as explicitly set forth herein,
supersede all prior and contemporaneous oral and written agreements and
understandings relating to such subject matter.

  

## 

  

## 10.14 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement or
the application of any such provision to any Person or circumstance shall be
held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect by a court of
competent jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall
not affect any other provision hereof.

  

## 

  

## 10.15 _Mutual Drafting_. The Parties hereto are sophisticated and
have been represented by counsel who have carefully negotiated the
provisions hereof. As a consequence, the Parties do not intend that the
presumptions of any Laws or other rules relating to the interpretation of
contracts against the drafter of any particular clause should be applied to
this Agreement and therefore waive their effects.

  

## 

  

## 10.16 _Counterparts; Facsimile_. This Agreement may be executed in one or
more counterparts, including by facsimile, all of which shall be considered
one and the same agreement, and shall become effective when one or more
such counterparts have been signed by each of the Parties and delivered to
the other Party.
