than five Business Days, but in no event less than three Business Days, before
the Closing, the Sellers shall prepare and deliver to the Purchaser a
statement setting forth in reasonable detail the Sellers estimate of Working
Capital of the Business (the " _Estimated Working Capital_ "), as of the close
of business on the day immediately preceding the Closing Date.

 



16 (b) The consideration payable at the Closing (the " _Closing Cash
Consideration_ ") shall be an amount equal to (i) Base Cash Consideration,
(ii) (A) _plus,_ if Estimated Working Capital exceeds the Target Working
Capital, an amount equal to the lesser of (1) the amount by which Estimated

to be prepared, and deliver to the Purchaser a statement (the " _Statement of
Working Capital_ ") setting forth the Sellers calculation of the Working
Capital, in each case as of the close of business on the day immediately
preceding the Closing Date (the " _Closing Working Capital_ ").

(d) Upon receipt from the Sellers, the Purchaser shall have 60 days to review
the Statement of Working Capital (the " _Review Period_ "). If the Purchaser
disagrees with the Sellers computation of Closing Working Capital, the
Purchaser may, on or prior to the last day of the Review Period, deliver a
notice to the Sellers (the " _Notice of Objection_ "), which sets forth its
objections to the Sellers calculation of Closing Working Capital; _provided_
, _however_ , that the Notice of Objection shall include only objections based
on (i) non-compliance with the accounting principles used in preparation of
the illustrative calculation of Working Capital set forth on _Section 1.1(d)
of the Sellers Disclosure Schedule,_ or (ii) mathematical or factual errors in
the computation of Closing Working Capital. Any Notice of Objection shall
specify those items or amounts with which the Purchaser disagrees, together
with a detailed explanation of the reasons for disagreement with each such
item or amount, and shall set forth the Purchasers calculation of Closing
Working Capital based on such objections. To the extent not set forth in the
Notice of Objection, the Purchaser shall be deemed to have agreed with the
Sellers calculation of all other items and amounts contained in the
Statement of Working Capital.

(e) Unless the Purchaser delivers the Notice of Objection to the
Sellers within the Review Period, the Purchaser shall be deemed to have
accepted the Sellers calculation of Closing Working Capital and the Statement
of Working Capital shall be final, conclusive and binding on the parties
hereto. If the Purchaser delivers the Notice of Objection to the Sellers
within the Review Period, the Sellers and the Purchaser shall, during the 30
days following such delivery or any mutually agreed extension of such time
period, use their commercially reasonable efforts to reach agreement on the
disputed items and amounts in order to determine the amount of Closing Working
Capital. If, at the end of such period or any mutually agreed extension
thereof, the Purchaser and the Sellers are unable to resolve
their disagreements, they shall jointly retain and refer their disagreements
to PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (the " _Independent Expert_ ") or, if such firm
is unwilling or unable so to act, each of the Purchaser and the Sellers shall
select one such firm and those two firms shall select a third firm, which
third firm shall be the "Independent Expert". The parties shall instruct the
Independent Expert promptly to review this Section 2.6 and to determine,
solely with respect to the disputed items and amounts so submitted, whether
and to what extent, if any, the Closing Working Capital set forth in the
Statement of Working Capital requires adjustment. The Independent Expert shall
base its determination solely on written submissions by the Purchaser and the
Sellers and not on

 



17  an independent review. The Purchaser and the Sellers shall make available to
the Independent Expert all relevant books and records and other items
reasonably requested by the Independent Expert. The parties shall request
that the Independent Expert deliver to the Purchaser and the Sellers, as
promptly as practicable but in no event later than 45 days after its
retention, a written report that sets forth its resolution of the disputed
items and amounts and its calculation of Closing Working Capital; _provided_
, _however_ , that with respect to each disputed item in relation to the
computation of the Closing Working Capital, the Independent Expert shall adopt
the position of either the Sellers or the Purchaser with respect to such
item. The decision of the Independent Expert shall be final, conclusive and
binding on the parties. The costs and expenses of the Independent Expert shall
be allocated between the parties based upon the percentage which the portion
of the contested amount not awarded to each party bears to the amount actually
contested by such party.

 

(f) Within three Business Days after Closing Working Capital has been finally
determined pursuant to this Section 2.6:

 

(i) if the Closing Working Capital is less than the Estimated Working Capital,
the Sellers shall pay to the Purchaser, as an adjustment to the Purchase
Price, in the manner and with interest as provided in this Section 2.6, an
amount of cash equal to the difference between the Estimated Working Capital
and Closing Working Capital; _provided_ that any amount payable to Purchaser
under this Section 2.6(f)(i) shall be reduced by the amount, if any, by which
Estimated Working Capital exceeded the Target Working Capital in excess of
$5,000,000 but shall not be reduced to an amount less than zero; or 

(ii) if the Closing Working Capital exceeds the Estimated Working Capital, the
Purchaser shall pay to the Sellers, in the manner and with interest as
provided in this Section 2.6, an amount of cash equal to the difference
between the Estimated Working Capital and the Closing Working Capital.

 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the Purchaser pay to the
Sellers under this Section 2.6(f)(ii) and Section 2.6(b)(ii), in the
aggregate, an amount greater than $5,000,000.

(g) Any payment required to be made pursuant to Section 2.6(f) shall be made
by the party required to make such payment by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account designated in writing by the party entitled to
receive such payment at least one Business Day prior to such transfer. The
amount of any such payment shall bear interest from and including the Closing
Date to but excluding the date of payment at a rate per annum equal to the
"prime rate" as published in the Wall Street Journal, Eastern Edition, in
effect from time to time during the period from the Closing Date to but
excluding the date of payment. Such interest shall be calculated daily on the
basis of a year of 365 days and the actual number of days elapsed, without
compounding.

 

Section 2.7 _Allocation of Purchase Price_.

 

The Sellers shall prepare a proposed allocation of the Purchase Price (and
liabilities treated as assumed for Tax purposes and other capitalized costs)
among the Purchased Assets in accordance with Code Section 1060 and the
Treasury regulations thereunder (and any similar

 



18  provision of state, local or foreign law, as appropriate). The Sellers shall
deliver such proposed allocation to the Purchaser not later than 30 days
following the final resolution of the Closing Working Capital pursuant to
Section 2.6. If the Purchaser and the Sellers agree upon such proposed
allocation, then such proposed allocation shall become the final allocation
(the " _Final Allocation_ "). If the Purchaser raises any objections in
respect of the proposed allocation, then the Purchaser and the Sellers shall
negotiate in good faith until they will have resolved all such objections and
the so negotiated allocation shall become the Final Allocation. The
Sellers and the Purchaser and their Affiliates shall report, act and file Tax
Returns (including Internal Revenue Service Form 8594) in all respects and for
all Tax purposes consistent with such Final Allocation. The Purchaser shall
timely and properly prepared, execute, file and deliver all such documents,
forms and other information as the Sellers may reasonably request to prepare
such Final Allocation. Neither the Sellers nor the Purchaser (nor their
Affiliates) shall take any Tax position (whether in audits, Tax Returns or
otherwise) that is inconsistent with such Final Allocation unless required to

each be responsible for one-half of all filing and similar fees payable in
connection with such filings and for any local counsel fees.

(c) Each of the Purchaser and the Sellers agrees to instruct its respective
counsel to cooperate with each other and use their respective reasonable best

permitted by Law and in each case regarding the transactions contemplated by

the Purchaser, the appropriate Seller, and in the case of the Sellers, the
Purchaser, prior reasonable notice of the meeting or discussion, the
opportunity to confer with each other regarding appropriate contacts with and
responses to personnel of said Governmental Entity, the opportunity to review
and agree to the contents of any representations (oral or otherwise)
expected to be communicated at the meeting or discussion, and, to the extent
permitted by the relevant Governmental Entity, the opportunity to attend and
participate at the meeting or discussion (which, at the request of the
Purchaser or the Sellers, as applicable, shall be limited to outside
antitrust counsel only).

shall take the lead in making), (iii) the process for the receipt of any
necessary approvals of Governmental Entities, (iv) the resolution of any
investigation or other inquiry of any Governmental Entity, (v) devising and

approval, or to avoid the entry of or have lifted, vacated or terminated any
legal impediment to closing, take the following actions: (i) propose,
negotiate, consent to, offer to undertake, commit to and effect, by consent
decree, hold separate order, trust or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or
disposition (including by licensing any intellectual property) of
any Purchased Assets; and (ii) otherwise offer to take, commit to take or
take any action that it is capable of taking that limits its freedom of action
with respect to, including its ability to operate or retain, any of the
Purchased Assets;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the Purchaser shall not be
required to take any such action or actions to the extent such actions, in the
aggregate, would represent, directly or indirectly, assets or businesses that
would reasonably be likely to result in the one year loss of net sales
revenues (as measured by fiscal year 2014 net sales revenue) in excess of
$30,000,000.

 

Section 6.6 _Public Announcements_. Neither the Purchaser nor the Sellers
shall issue any press releases or otherwise make any public statements with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement without the prior
written consent of the other; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Purchaser or
the Sellers may, without such approval, make such press releases or other
public announcement as it believes are required pursuant to any listing
agreement with any national securities exchange or stock market, applicable
securities Laws or in connection with the Debt Financing, in which case the
party required to make the release or announcement shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to allow the other party reasonable time to comment on such
release or announcement in advance of such issuance.

 

Section 6.7 _Names_. As promptly as practicable following the Closing Date,
but in no event later than ten (10) Business Days following the Closing Date,
the Sellers shall execute and file all such executed documents as may be
required to change the name of any Seller, the name of which includes the name
of any publication purchased in the Purchased Assets to a name that does not
include such words.

Section 6.8 _Employees_.

 

(a) The Sellers shall deliver to the Purchaser, within ten (10) days after the
date hereof and again on the Closing, a list of each Business Employee, such
employees base salary and bonus opportunities, the employees date of hire,
and the primary geographic location of their employment with the Sellers, as
of the date hereof, broken down into the following categories: (i) active,
(ii) inactive on leave of absence with reemployment rights and (iii) on short-
term disability under the Sellers short-term disability policy. From the date
hereof to the Closing, the Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to make all Business Employees reasonably available to the Purchaser for in-
person and telephonic interviews to assist the Purchaser in evaluating if
offers of employment will be made. Excluding employees who are part of a
collective bargaining unit, not less than five days prior to the Closing, the
Purchaser (i) agrees that it will make offers of employment to the greater of
(A) substantially all of the Business Employees and (B) a number of Business
Employees in their current positions and locations that would not create any
obligation or liability under WARN or similar state law; and (ii) will provide
to the Sellers a list of Business Employees to whom the Purchaser does
not intend to make offers of employment.

 



40 (b) The Purchaser will make offers of employment to all of the Business
Employees that are not on the list provided by the Purchaser pursuant to
Section 6.8(a) to commence effective upon the Closing. Such offers may be made
before the Closing as the Purchaser may determine. Such offers of employment
shall be at comparable wage rates or base salary and bonus levels as are
identified in Section 4.16(a), and, if at a location different from the
Business Employees current location of employment with the applicable Seller,
at a commuting distance no greater than 50 miles farther away from such
Business Employees current location of employment. With respect to each
Business Employee who accepts the Purchasers offer of employment (a "
_Transferred Employee_ "), the Purchaser shall credit periods of service
prior to the Closing for purposes of determining eligibility, vesting and
benefit entitlement under all compensation and benefit plans, programs and
policies maintained by the Purchaser after the Closing; _provided, however,_
that the Purchaser shall not be required to credit any service to the extent
that doing so would result in duplication of benefits, and further provided
that nothing herein entitles any Transferred Employee to contributions under
any retirement plan for time periods prior to the Closing. Not later than the
Closing Date, the Sellers will provide to the Purchaser such information with
respect to each Transferred Employee as may be reasonably necessary to permit
the Purchaser to comply with its covenants in this Section 6.8 with respect
to the Transferred Employees.

(c) The Purchaser further agrees that it will not engage in any action within
90 days following the Closing that will create any obligation or liability
under WARN to any Business Employee or Transferred Employee.

 

(d) Without limiting the scope of Section 6.8(b), the Purchaser shall provide
each Transferred Employee (and his or her eligible dependents) with the
opportunity to be covered by a group health plan (within the meaning of
section 5000(b)(1) of the Code) on the first day of the month following the
Closing. The Sellers shall cover the Transferred Employees under
Sellers group health plans until the end of the month in which the Closing
occurs and shall remain responsible for all claims incurred by Transferred
Employees while such employees are covered by the Sellers group health plans.
The Purchaser shall be responsible for all claims incurred by the Transferred
Employees while such employees are covered by the Purchasers group health
plans. For purposes of clarity, a claim shall be considered incurred when the
treatment for a given condition is provided, and not when the condition
arose.

(e) Purchaser will maintain or, if it does not exist, establish, a health care
and dependent care flexible spending account arrangement pursuant to Section
125 or 129 of the Code (collectively, " _FSAs_ "). Purchaser will honor the
elections of all Transferred Employees under the FSAs of the Sellers or any of
their Affiliates, as in effect immediately prior to the Closing Date, and
Purchaser will assume responsibility for administering all reimbursement
claims of the Transferred Employees with respect to the calendar year in which
the Closing Date occurs that are submitted to Purchaser for payment on or
after the Closing Date, whether arising before, on or after the Closing Date,
under Purchasers FSAs. As soon as practicable but no more than forty-five
(45) days following the Closing Date, and except to the extent taken into
account in the computation of Closing Working Capital, Sellers will cause to
be transferred to

 



41  Purchaser an amount in cash equal to (i) the sum of all contributions to the
FSAs of Sellers or their Affiliates with respect to the calendar year in which
the Closing Date occurs by or on behalf of the Transferred Employees prior to
the Closing Date, reduced by (ii) the sum of all claims incurred in the
calendar year in which the Closing Date occurs that are submitted to the
Sellers for payment prior to the Closing Date and paid by the FSAs of the
Sellers or their Affiliates with respect to such Transferred Employees prior
to the date of such cash transfer to Purchaser; provided, however, if this
calculation results in a negative number, then Purchaser will pay to
the Sellers (on behalf of any relevant Affiliate of the Sellers) as soon as
practicable but not more than forty-five (45) days following the Closing Date,
the amount by which (ii) exceeds (i). Effective as of the Closing Date, the
Sellers shall provide the Purchaser with such information as is necessary for
the Purchaser to establish FSAs for such Transferred Employees, including, but
not limited to, each such Transferred Employees annual FSA election amount
and account balance as of the Closing Date.

(f) As soon as administratively practicable after the Closing, the Purchaser
shall establish a 401(k) plan, or cause an existing 401(k) plan, to cover the
Transferred Employees, subject to contrary collective bargaining agreement
provisions (if any) applicable to Transferred Employees after Closing. The
Purchaser shall permit such Transferred Employees to rollover any
distribution from the Sellers 401(k) plan to its 401(k) plan.

(g) For the avoidance of doubt, the Sellers shall remain liable for all
withdrawal liability relating to any obligation (current, past or future,
contingent or otherwise (in each case with respect to multiemployer plan
participation for periods before Closing)) on the part of the Sellers or any
of its ERISA Affiliates to contribute to any multiemployer plan and shall pay
all such liabilities as they come due. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, neither the Purchaser nor its ERISA Affiliates
shall be or shall become liable for any such withdrawal liability, nor shall
the Purchaser or any ERISA Affiliate incur an obligation to contribute to any
multiemployer plan in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 

(h) The provisions of this Section 6.8 are solely for the benefit of the
respective parties to this Agreement and nothing in this Section 6.8, express
or implied, shall confer upon any Business Employee, or legal representative
or beneficiary thereof, any rights or remedies, including any right to
employment or continued employment for any specified period, or compensation
or benefits of any nature or kind whatsoever under this Agreement. Nothing
contained herein shall (i) be treated as an amendment to any particular
employee benefit plan of the Purchaser or Sellers, (ii) obligate the
Purchaser or any of its ERISA Affiliates to (A) maintain any particular
benefit plan or arrangement or (B) retain the employment of any particular
employee, (iii) prevent the Purchaser or any of its ERISA Affiliates from
amending or terminating any benefit plan or arrangement, or (iv) give any
third party the right to enforce any of the provisions of this Agreement.

(i) With respect to all Benefit Plans, the Sellers shall make all required
payments, premiums or contributions for all periods (or partial periods)
ending prior to or as of the Closing Date.

 



42 Section 6.9 _Taxes_.

 

(a) The Purchaser shall pay 100% of all federal, state and local sales and
use, documentary and real estate and other transfer taxes, if any, due as a
result of the purchase, sale or transfer of the Purchased Assets in accordance
herewith, whether imposed by Law on the Sellers or the Purchaser. The
Purchaser and the Sellers shall cooperate in the preparation, execution and
filing of all Tax Returns regarding any transfer taxes which become payable
as a result of the transfer of the Purchased Assets from the Sellers to
Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement.

 

(b) All real property Taxes, personal property Taxes and similar ad valorem
obligations levied and assessed with respect to the Purchased Assets for a
taxable period prior to the period that includes the Closing Date shall be
paid by the Sellers. All real property Taxes, personal property Taxes and
similar ad valorem obligations levied and assessed with respect to the
Purchased Assets for a taxable period that includes (but does not end on) the
Closing Date shall be apportioned between the Sellers and the Purchaser as of
the Closing Date based on the number of days of such taxable period included
in the period ending with and including the Closing Date (with respect to any
such taxable period, the " _Pre-Closing Tax Period_ "), and the number of days
of such taxable period beginning after the Closing Date (with respect to any
such taxable period, the " _Post-Closing Tax Period_ "). The Sellers shall be
liable for the proportionate amount of such Taxes that is attributable to the
Pre-Closing Tax Period, and the Purchaser shall be liable for the
proportionate amount of such Taxes that is attributable to the Post-Closing
Period. If bills for such Taxes have not been issued as of the Closing Date
and if the amount of such Taxes for the period including the Closing Date is
not then known, the apportionment of such Taxes shall be made at Closing on
the basis of the prior periods Taxes. After Closing, upon receipt of bills
for the period including the Closing Date, adjustments to the apportionment
shall be made by the parties, so that if either party paid more than
its proper share at the Closing, the other party shall promptly reimburse
such party for the excess amount paid by such party. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, to the extent the apportionment of any Taxes is included as part of
the purchase price adjustment pursuant to Section 2.6, any amount so included
will not be subject to the apportionment described in this Section 6.9(b).

 

(c) The Purchaser and the Sellers agree to furnish or cause to be furnished to
each other, upon request, as promptly as practicable, such information and
assistance relating to the Business, the Purchased Assets and Assumed
Liabilities (including access to books and records) as is reasonably necessary
for the filing of all Tax Returns, the making of any election relating to
Taxes, the preparation for any audit by any Taxing Authority, and the
prosecution or defense of any Action relating to any Tax. Any expenses
incurred in furnishing such information or assistance shall be borne by the
party requesting it.

 

(d) The Purchaser shall prepare and file any Local Tax Returns due after the
Closing Date (including any final returns, as appropriate) for (i) taxable
periods ending after the Closing Date or which include the Closing Date or
(ii) the last taxable period ending prior to the Closing Date if the Tax
Return is due after the Closing Date. Such Local Tax Returns will be
prepared consistent with prior practice. The Sellers will reimburse the
Purchaser for any Taxes shown due on such returns to the extent that such
Taxes are not Assumed Liabilities under Section 2.3 and Section 2.4. Prior to
filing any Local Tax Returns in accordance with this Section 6.9(d), the
Purchaser will provide the Sellers a copy of any such returns for their review

 



43  and comment, which comments shall be incorporated into such Local Tax
Returns prior to filing. After the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall control
on the Sellers behalf any tax audits with respect to Local Tax Returns filed
by the Purchaser after the Closing Date, and will cooperate with the
applicable Taxing Authority to reach a resolution of any such audit. The
Purchaser shall (x) keep the Sellers informed of the status of any such
audit, and (y) will not agree to a settlement or resolution without the
Sellers prior written consent. The Sellers shall be responsible for the
liability resulting from such audit to the extent that such liability is not
an Assumed Liability.

Section 6.10 _Bulk Sales Laws_. Except as provided in Section 9.2(e), the
Purchaser and the Sellers hereby waive compliance by the Sellers and the
Purchaser with the bulk sales Laws and any other similar Laws in any
applicable jurisdiction in respect of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements.

 

Section 6.11 _Access to Books and Records_. Each of the Sellers and the
Purchaser shall preserve until the seventh anniversary of the Closing Date
all records possessed or to be possessed by such party relating to any of the
assets, Liabilities or business of the Business prior to the Closing. After
the Closing Date, where there is a legitimate business purpose, such
party shall provide the other party with reasonable access, upon prior
reasonable written request specifying the need therefor, during regular
business hours, to (a) the officers and employees of such party and (b) the
books of account and records of such party, but, in each case, only to the
extent relating to the assets, Liabilities or business of the Business prior
to the Closing, and the other party and its representatives shall have the
right to make copies of such books and records at their sole cost; provided,
however, that the foregoing right of access shall not be exercisable in such a
manner as to interfere unreasonably with the normal operations and business of
such party. Such records may nevertheless be destroyed by a party if such
party sends to the other party written notice of its intent to destroy
records, specifying with particularity the contents of the records to be
destroyed. Such records may then be destroyed after the 60th day after
such notice is given unless the other party objects to the destruction, in
which case the party seeking to destroy the records shall deliver such records
to the objecting party at the objecting partys cost.

 

Section 6.12 _Further Assurances_. The Purchaser and the Sellers shall execute
such documents and other instruments and take such further actions as may be
reasonably required or desirable to carry out the provisions of this Agreement
and the Ancillary Agreements and to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions hereof, the
Purchaser and the Sellers shall each use their respective commercially
reasonable efforts to take or cause to be taken all actions and to do or cause
to be done all other things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and
make effective as promptly as practicable the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements. If requested by the Sellers, the
Purchaser will provide written confirmation to the other parties to any
Assigned Contract of the Purchasers assumption thereof in the form required
by such Assigned Contract or otherwise reasonably requested by the Sellers. If
at any time after the Closing: (a) any Seller receives any cash in respect of
any Purchased Assets, such Seller shall remit such cash to the Purchaser or
its designee promptly following such receipt; and (b) the Purchaser or any
Subsidiary thereof receives any cash in respect of any Excluded Asset, the
Purchaser or such Subsidiary shall remit such amount to the relevant Seller
or its designee promptly following such receipt.

 



44 Section 6.13 _Support Services_. Except as set forth in Section 2.8 and
Articles VI and IX of this Agreement and the Transition Services Agreement,
the Purchaser agrees that as of the Closing Date, the Sellers and their
respective Affiliates shall have no obligation to provide any support or other
services to the Business (including any of the services for which allocations
were previously paid by the Business).

Section 6.14 _Lease Guaranty_. The Purchaser shall assume all obligations of
reimbursement under each guaranty arising after the Closing Date by any Seller
or any of its Affiliates for any Leased Real Property and/or replace any
applicable letters of credit associated therewith and use its commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain from the applicable beneficiary a full release of
all parties liable, directly or indirectly, for reimbursement in connection
with such guaranty or credit support obligations. To the extent the Purchaser
is unable, notwithstanding its compliance with the immediately preceding
sentence, to obtain such release, the Purchaser shall indemnify, defend and
hold harmless the Sellers and their respective Affiliates against, and
reimburse the Sellers and their respective Affiliates for, any and all Losses
in connection with such guaranty arising after the Closing Date, and shall in
any event promptly reimburse the Sellers and their respective Affiliates to
the extent such guaranty is called upon and any of the Sellers or any of
their Affiliates makes any payment thereunder.

Section 6.15 _Noncompetition and Related Covenants_.

(a) For a period of three years after the Closing Date, no Seller or any of
their respective equity owners will invest in, own, manage, operate, finance,
control, advise or guarantee the obligations of any Person whose business
includes any daily, bi-weekly or weekly local print, online or other digital
news publication, which is primarily targeted at and is primarily intended to
serve any county or portion thereof that are currently served by the Business
(which shall include those counties listed on _Section 6.15 of the Sellers
Disclosure Schedule)_ (the " _Restricted Area_ ");  _provided_ , _however_ ,
that in no event shall any of the following be deemed a breach or violation of
this Section 6.15: (A) ownership of less than 5% of any publicly traded
company; (B) investing in, owning, managing, operating, financing,
controlling, advising or guaranteeing the obligations of any Person whose
business operates at a national level, even if a portion of that business
competes in the individual markets that the Business presently serves; or (C)
any current activity of any Seller or any Affiliate other than the activities
of the Business.

(b) For a period of two years after the Closing Date, no Seller or any of its
Affiliates will induce or attempt to induce any individual who is then an
employee or independent contractor of the Purchaser to leave the employ or
service, as applicable, of the Purchaser, or in any way knowingly interfere
with the relationship between the Purchaser, on the one hand, and any such
employee or independent contractor thereof, on the other hand; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that nothing in this Section 6.15 shall prohibit any Seller or
any member of any Seller from engaging in any general employment solicitation
(including solicitations through recruiting firms and the Internet) not
targeted at employees of the Business, or from hiring any individual who
responds to any such solicitations without encouragement from any Seller or
any member of any Seller. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein,
this Section 6.15(b) shall not apply to the hiring or solicitation of
accounting personnel of Stephens Inc., Ronald Mayo or Michael Redding.

 



45 (c) If a final judgment of a court or tribunal of competent jurisdiction
determines that any term or provision contained in this Section 6.15 is
invalid or unenforceable, then the parties agree that the court or tribunal
will have the power to reduce the scope, duration or geographic area of the
term or provision, to delete specific words or phrases or to replace any
invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a term or provision that is
valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of
the invalid or unenforceable term or provision. This Section 6.15 will be
enforceable as so modified after the expiration of the time within which the
judgment may be appealed ( _provided_ , for the purpose of clarity, that in no
event shall this Section 6.15 be binding upon any Seller or any member of any
Seller following the second anniversary of the Closing Date in the case of
Section 6.15(a), or the second anniversary of the Closing Date in the case of
Section 6.15(b) (or, if the term of this Section 6.15 is reduced by such
court or tribunal, following the expiration of such modified term). This
Section 6.15 is reasonable and necessary to protect and preserve the
Purchasers legitimate business interests and the value of the Business.

 

Section 6.16 _Exclusivity_. From the date hereof until the Closing, the
Sellers will not, and shall cause their respective Affiliates and
representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (a) solicit, initiate,
consider, encourage or accept the submission of any proposal or offer from any

as is currently maintained as of the date of this Agreement, ordinary wear and

(a) The Sellers shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide the
Purchaser with such cooperation in connection with the arrangement of the
Debt Financing (including the syndication thereof (which syndication, for the
avoidance of doubt, shall not be a prerequisite to funding of the Debt

(i) such requested cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with the
ongoing operations of the Sellers and (ii) the Sellers shall not be required
to pay any commitment or other similar fee or incur any other liability (and,
for avoidance of doubt, excluding any allocable overhead costs) in connection
with the Debt Financing. The Purchaser shall, promptly upon request by the

reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs incurred by such Seller or
Sellers in connection with such cooperation. The Purchaser shall indemnify and
hold harmless the Sellers and their representatives from and against any and
all liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs and expenses suffered or
incurred by any of them in connection with the arrangement of the Debt
Financing and any information utilized in connection therewith (other than
historical information reasonably requested by the Purchaser and specifically
approved in writing by the Sellers for use therein (such approval not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed)) except to the extent such
liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs and expenses arose out of the bad
faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct of, or material breach, of this
Agreement by any Seller or their representatives. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained herein, none of the Sellers or their respective
current, former or future Affiliates, officers, directors, employees, agents,

7.2(g) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule_ and Leased Real Property listed on
_Section 6.19(c) of the Sellers Disclosure Schedule_ subject to the matters
set forth in the Title Commitments (other than Liens with respect to Funded
Indebtedness) together with such endorsements and extended and affirmative
coverages as may reasonably be required by the Purchaser and the Lenders.

 

Section 6.20 _Financing Commitments_. The Purchaser shall use reasonable best
efforts to take all actions prior to the Closing Date required under the
Commitment Letter to obtain the Debt Financing on the terms and conditions set
forth in the Commitment Letter (including, as necessary, any "flex" provisions
of the Fee Letter), including to (i) maintain in effect each Commitment
Letter and negotiate a definitive agreement (collectively, the " _Financing
Agreements_ ") with respect to the Commitment Letter on the terms and

the Sellers with their covenants and agreements hereunder, comply with all
covenants and agreements of the Purchaser set forth in the Commitment Letter

the Financing Agreements that are within its control and (iv) assuming the
satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Article VII, consummate the Debt

unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated in the Debt Commitment
Letter (including any related flex terms) (a " _Financing Failure Event_ "),
Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable to arrange for and obtain as promptly as practicable
following the occurrence of any such Financing Failure Event alternative debt
financing (the " _Alternative Financing_ "), including from alternative
sources on terms that are not materially less favorable in the aggregate to
Purchaser than the terms of the Debt Commitment Letter (including any "flex"
provisions applicable thereto), in an amount sufficient (when added to the
portion of the Debt Financing that is available) to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby and perform all of its obligations hereunder,
it being understood and agreed that if Purchaser proceeds with any
Alternative Financing, Purchaser shall be subject to the same obligations with
respect to such Alternative Financing as set forth in this Agreement with
respect to the Debt Financing. In the event that Alternative Financing is
obtained, Purchaser shall promptly provide the Sellers with a copy of the new
financing commitment that provides for such Alternative Financing (the "
_Alternative Financing Commitment Letter_ "). If applicable, any reference in
this Agreement to "Debt Financing" shall include "Alternative Financing", any
reference to "Debt Commitment Letter" shall include the "Alternative Financing
Commitment Letter" and any references to "Financing Agreements" shall include
the definitive documentation relating to any such Alternative Financing.

 



48 Section 6.21 _Purchaser s Environmental Insurance Policy_. Purchaser shall
use reasonable best efforts to obtain the Purchasers Environmental Insurance
Policy at or prior to the Closing Date, which Purchasers Environmental
Insurance Policy shall be bound as of the Closing.

 

Section 6.22 _Fire Pump Relocation Project_. Upon distribution of the agreed
upon funds from the Escrow Amount pursuant to the Escrow Agreement to

(e) The Sellers shall have procured those third party consents specified on

Section 7.2(g), but not the obligation, to cure any defects that could cause
the Title Company to refuse to issue any owners title policy for any of the
Owned Real Property listed on _Section 7.2(g) of the Sellers Disclosure
Schedule_, including payment or other comfort to remove objections or to cause
another title company reasonably acceptable to Purchaser to issue the relevant

warranties refer specifically to an earlier date, as of such earlier date,
except where the breach of such representations or warranties would not have a
material adverse effect or the ability of the Purchaser to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby, disregarding for this purpose any
qualifications in such representation and warranty as to materiality or
Material Adverse Effect.

(i) by mutual written consent of the Purchaser and the Sellers;

 

(ii) by the Purchaser or the Sellers if:

 

(1) the Closing does not occur on or before the date that is 120 days
following the date hereof (the " _Termination Date_ "); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section
8.1(a)(ii)(1) shall not be available to any party whose breach of a
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement under this Agreement has been
the primary cause of or resulted in the failure of the Closing to occur on or
before such date; or

(2) a Governmental Entity shall have issued an Order or taken any other
action, in any case having the effect of permanently restraining, enjoining or
otherwise prohibiting the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, which
Order or other action is final and non-appealable;

(iii) by the Purchaser if there has been a breach by the Sellers of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement
such that the condition set forth in Section 7.2(a) or Section 7.2(b) would
not be satisfied and such breach is not cured within 30 days after written
notice of such breach is given to the Sellers by the Purchaser; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section
8.1(a)(iii) shall not be available to the Purchaser if it is then in breach of
this Agreement such that any of the conditions set forth in Section 7.3(a) or
Section 7.3(b) would not be satisfied; or

(iv) by the Sellers if there has been a breach by the Purchaser of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement

notice of such breach is given to the Purchaser by the Sellers; _provided_ ,

8.1(a)(iv) shall not be available to the Sellers if the Sellers are then in
breach of this Agreement such that any of the conditions set forth in Section
7.2(a) or Section 7.2(b) would not be satisfied.

 



51 (b) The party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(a)
(ii), (iii) or (iv) shall give written notice of such termination to the
other party hereto.

Section 8.2 _Effect of Termination_. Termination of this Agreement pursuant

rights and remedies of any party to this Agreement against any other party to
this Agreement that has violated, breached or failed to satisfy any of the
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of this Agreement prior
to termination hereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the event that (a)
this Agreement is terminated pursuant to either Section 8.1(a)(ii)(1) or
Section 8.1(a)(iv) as a result of the Purchasers failure to consummate the
Closing on or prior to the date required pursuant to in Section 3.1, (b) at
the time of such termination, the Lenders have failed to fund the Debt
Financing on the terms and conditions set forth in the Commitment Letters and
(c) Purchaser has complied in all material respects with the covenant set
forth in Section 6.20, then the Sellers sole and exclusive remedy for any
breach by the Purchaser of this Agreement shall be a payment by Parent, NMH or
Purchaser of liquidated damages in an amount equal to (i) $20,000,000 less
(ii) the amount of any Marketing Extension Fee previously paid by the
Purchaser to the Sellers. For the avoidance of doubt, if the Sellers or a
Person designated by the Sellers shall receive full payment of the amount
specified in the prior sentence, the receipt of such amount under
circumstances where such amount was payable shall be deemed to be liquidated
damages for, and shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Sellers, their
Affiliates and their respective stockholders against the Purchaser, Parent,
NMH, the Lender Parties or any of their respective Affiliates for, any and
all losses or damages suffered or incurred by the Sellers or any other Person
in connection with this Agreement, the Guaranty, the Debt Financing and the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby (and the abandonment or

(or the abandonment or termination thereof). In the event that this Agreement

Marketing Extension Fee previously paid by the Purchaser to the Sellers within
two Business Days of such termination. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Sellers and Purchasers payment obligations under Section 6.5 and Section
6.9 shall survive the termination of this Agreement.

of the Parties contained in this Agreement shall survive the Closing hereunder
and continue in full force and effect for a period of 12 months thereafter.

 



52 Section 9.2 _Indemnification by the Sellers_. Subject to the limitations set

indemnify and defend the Purchaser against, and shall hold the Purchaser
harmless from, any loss, liability, claim, charge, action, suit, proceeding,

resulting from or arising out of:

(a) any breach of any representation and warranty of the Sellers contained in
this Agreement or in the certificate delivered pursuant to Section 7.2(d);

(b) any breach of any covenant or agreement of the Sellers contained herein;

(c) any Excluded Liabilities (regardless of whether or not the Sellers may

related to an Excluded Liability);

(d) any claims related to or based upon the pre-closing relationship between
the Sellers and any Business Employee, other than any claim related to the
termination of a Business Employee as a result of the Purchasers decision not
to offer such Business Employee a position with the Purchaser or any
Affiliate thereof; and

(e) any noncompliance with any bulk sales Laws, fraudulent transfer Laws or
similar Laws in any applicable jurisdiction in respect of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements.

Section 9.3  _Indemnification by the Purchaser_. Subject to the limitations
set forth herein, following the Closing the Purchaser shall indemnify and
defend the Sellers against, and shall hold the Sellers harmless from, any Loss

the Purchaser and any Transferred Employee.

 



53 Section 9.4 _Indemnification Procedures for Third Party Claims_.

 

(a) In the event that any claim or demand for which an Indemnitor may be
liable to an Indemnitee hereunder is asserted by a third party (a " _Third
Party Claim_ "), the Indemnitee shall promptly, and in any event within 30
days, provide written notice to the Indemnitor of such Third Party Claim (a "
_Claim Notice_ "). The Claim Notice shall (i) state that the Indemnitee has
paid or properly accrued Losses or anticipates that it will incur liability
for Losses for which the Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification pursuant
hereto, and (ii) specify in reasonable detail each individual item of Loss
included in the amount so stated, the date such item was paid or properly
accrued, the basis for any anticipated liability and the representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement curtained herein to which each such item is
related and the computation of the amount to which such Indemnitee claims to
be entitled hereunder. The Indemnitee shall enclose with the Claim Notice a
copy of all papers served with respect to such Third Party Claim and any other
documents evidencing such Third Party Claim. The failure to provide such
notice, however, shall not release the Indemnitor from any of its obligations
under this Article IX except to the extent that the Indemnitor is prejudiced
by such failure.

 

(b) The Indemnitor will have 30 days from the date on which the Indemnitor
received the Claim Notice to notify the Indemnitee that the Indemnitor has
elected to assume the defense or prosecution of such Third Party Claim and any
litigation resulting therefrom with counsel of its choice and at its sole cost
and expense (a " _Third Party Defense_ "). If the Indemnitor assumes the
Third Party Defense in accordance herewith: (i) the Indemnitee may retain
separate co-counsel at its sole cost and expense (as to which the Indemnitee
shall not be entitled to indemnification) and participate in the defense of
the Third Party Claim but the Indemnitor shall control the investigation,
defense and settlement thereof; (ii) the Indemnitee will not file any papers
or consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with
respect to the Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the
Indemnitor; and (iii) the Indemnitor will not consent to the entry of any
judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to the Third Party Claim to
the extent such judgment or settlement provides for equitable relief without
the prior written consent of the Indemnitee. The parties hereto will use
commercially reasonable efforts to minimize Losses from Third Party Claims,
act in good faith in responding to, defending against, settling or otherwise
dealing with such claims, and cooperate in any such defense and give each
other reasonable access to and copies of all information, records and
documents relevant thereto. Whether or not the Indemnitor has assumed the
Third Party Defense, the Indemnitor will not be obligated to indemnify the
Indemnitee hereunder for any settlement entered into or any judgment that was
consented to without the Indemnitors prior written consent.

 

(c) If the Indemnitor does not assume the Third Party Defense within 30 days
of receipt of the Claim Notice, the Indemnitee will be entitled to assume the
Third Party Defense at its sole cost and expense (or, if the Indemnitee incurs
a Loss with respect to the matter in question for which the Indemnitee is
entitled to indemnification pursuant to Section 9.2 or Section 9.3,
as applicable, at the expense of the Indemnitor) upon delivery of notice to
such effect to the Indemnitor; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnitor
(i) shall have the right to participate in the Third Party Defense at its sole
cost and expense, but the Indemnitee shall control the investigation, defense
and settlement thereof; and (ii) will not be obligated to indemnify the
Indemnitee hereunder for any settlement entered into or any judgment that was
consented to without the Indemnitors prior written consent.

 



54 Section 9.5 _Indemnification Procedures for Non-Third Party Claims_. The
Indemnitee will provide written notice to the Indemnitor promptly, and in any
event within 30 days, following its discovery of any matter for which the
Indemnitor may be liable hereunder that does not involve a Third Party Claim,
which Claim Notice shall (i) state that the Indemnitee has paid or properly
accrued Losses or anticipates that it will incur liability for Losses for
which the Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification pursuant hereto, and (ii)
specify in reasonable detail each individual item of Loss included in the
amount so stated, the date such item was paid or properly accrued, the basis
for any anticipated liability and the representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement contained herein to which each such item is related and the
computation of the amount to which such Indemnitee claims to be entitled
hereunder. If the Indemnitor does not acknowledge in writing its obligation to
indemnify the Indemnitee with respect to such Losses within 30 days after
its receipt of the Claim Notice, the Indemnitor will be deemed to have
rejected such claim, in which event the Indemnitee will be free to pursue such
remedies as may be available to it hereunder. The failure to provide such
notice, however, shall not release the Indemnitor from any of its obligations
under this Article IX except to the extent that the Indemnitor is prejudiced
by such failure. The Indemnitee will reasonably cooperate with and assist the
Indemnitor in determining the validity of any claim for indemnity by the
Indemnitee and in otherwise resolving such matters. Such assistance and
cooperation will include providing reasonable access to and copies of
information, records and documents relating to such matters,
furnishing employees to assist in the investigation, defense and resolution
of such matters and providing legal and business assistance with respect to
such matters.

 

Section 9.6 _Limitations on Indemnification_.

 

(a) No party hereto shall be required to indemnify, defend or hold harmless
any Person pursuant to Section 9.2(a) or Section 9.3(a): (i) unless a Claim
Notice is delivered prior to the expiration of the relevant representation or
warranty, as applicable; and (ii) with respect to a claim pursuant to Section
9.2(a) or Section 9.3(a) for the breach of a representation and warranty
other than the Specified Representations, unless and until the aggregate
Losses of (A) the Purchaser, in the case of the Sellers, with respect to any
such claims, or (B) the Sellers, in the case of the Purchaser, with respect
to any such claims, exceed $1,400,000, at which point such party shall be
liable for all such Losses exceeding $1,400,000.

 

(b) In no event shall the cumulative indemnification obligations of the
Sellers pursuant to Section 9.2(a) with respect to breaches
of representations and warranties other than the Specified Representations
and expenses related to the Fire Pump Relocation Project as described in
Schedule 7.2(h) on the one hand, or the Purchaser pursuant to Section 9.3(a)
with respect to breaches of representations and warranties other than the
Specified Representations on the other hand, exceed $17,000,000.

(c) The amount of Losses payable under this Article IX by the Indemnitor
shall be reduced (i) by any amounts actually recovered by the Indemnitee under
insurance policies or from any other Person (less any out-of-pocket expenses
incurred by the Indemnitee in collecting such amounts) and (ii) to take
account of any Tax benefit of the Indemnitee arising in connection with the
accrual, incurrence or payment of any such Losses in the taxable year in which
the indemnifiable Loss is incurred or the following taxable year.

 



55 (d) No party hereto shall be obligated to indemnify any other Person with
respect to (i) any breach of a representation or warranty of such party to
the extent such breach arises from or relates to any item disclosed in the
Sellers Disclosure Schedule, _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing
limitation shall not apply to Sellers obligation to indemnify Purchaser for
Pre-Closing Environmental Liabilities pursuant to Section 9.2(c), (ii) any
covenant or condition expressly waived in writing by another party on or prior
to the Closing, (iii) any indirect, special, incidental, consequential or
punitive damages, or (iv) any Loss to the extent such Loss was included in the
calculation of the adjustment of the Purchase Price pursuant to Section 2.6.
Each party hereto agrees that, for so long as such party has any right of
indemnification under this Article IX, it shall not, and shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that its Affiliates do not,
voluntarily or by discretionary action, accelerate the timing or increase the
cost of any obligation of any other party under this Article IX, except to the
extent that such action is taken (x) for a reasonable legitimate purpose and
not with a purpose of discovering a condition that would constitute a breach
of any representation or warranty, covenant or agreement of any other party
hereto or (y) in response to a discovery by such party, without violation of
the immediately preceding clause (x), of meaningful evidence of a condition
that constitutes a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement of any other party hereunder. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, an Indemnitor shall not be obligated to indemnify an
Indemnitee for any Loss to the extent arising from any such voluntary or
discretionary action, other than as so excepted.

(e) In addition to the other limitations set forth in this Article IX, with
respect to any claim by the Purchaser for indemnification relating to Losses
arising out of, relating to or resulting from: (x) any breach of any
representation and warranty set forth in Section 4.17, or (y) any Excluded
Liability relating to environmental matters or Environmental, Health and
Safety Requirements, including Pre-Closing Environmental Liabilities
(collectively, " _Environmental Losses_ "), the Sellers obligation
to indemnify, defend or hold harmless the Purchaser shall be limited to the
extent: (i) Purchasers insurer provides actual coverage, pursuant to the
Purchasers Environmental Insurance Policy, for the Environmental Loss; (ii)
(A) any such Environmental Loss arises out of a Third Party Claim that is
solicited by the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates, representatives or agents
or (B) any investigation, monitoring, removal, abatement,
disposal, remediation, corrective action, and/or any other response action ("
_Response Action_ ") forming the basis of any such Environmental Loss is not
reasonably necessary to comply with Environmental, Health and Safety
Requirements and/or notices, directives or orders from any Governmental
Entities; (iii) any such Environmental Loss would not have arisen but for any
disclosure to any Governmental Entity by the Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates, representatives or agents, except to the extent such disclosure
was required by applicable Environmental, Health and Safety Requirements
and/or any requests for information, notices, directives or orders from any
Governmental Entity; (iv) any such Environmental Loss would not have arisen
but for any intrusive investigations by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates,
representatives or agents that are not (A) reasonably necessary to comply with
applicable Environmental, Health and Safety Requirements and/or any
notices, directives or orders from any Governmental Entity or (B) required by
landlords at Leased Real Property pursuant to the terms of an applicable
lease, and with respect to the Owned Real Property, any intrusive
investigations by prospective purchasers or tenants; (v) any Response Action
forming the basis for any such Environmental Loss exceeds the cost of
reasonable, cost effective Response Actions acceptable under Environmental,
Health and Safety Requirements (including engineering or institutional
controls or any lesser standards resulting from any site-specific risk
assessments)

 



56  based on the industrial or commercial use of the relevant facility or
property; and (vi) any such Environmental Loss resulting from any condition or
circumstance caused, contributed to or exacerbated by the Purchaser, any
Affiliate of the Purchaser or any other Person under their control after the
Closing Date.

(f) Except for the Purchasers rights to indemnification pursuant to Section
9.2 or with respect to any claim for intentional fraud, the Purchaser shall
have no claim or right to indemnification, and none of the Sellers or any
other Person shall have or be subject to any liability to the other party
hereto or any other Person, with respect to any information, documents or
materials furnished or made available to the Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates, officers, directors, employees, agents or advisors by the Sellers
or Affiliates thereof or any of their respective officers, directors,
employees, agents or advisors, whether orally or in writing, in certain "data
rooms", management presentations, functional "break out" discussions,
responses to questions submitted on behalf of the Purchaser or in any other
form in contemplation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

Section 9.7 _Additional Procedures for Environmental Losses_.

 

(a) If the Purchaser seeks indemnification for any Environmental Losses, it
shall follow the claim procedures set forth in Section 9.4 or Section 9.5 as
modified and supplemented by the procedures set forth in this Section 9.7. Any
Claim Notice provided by the Purchaser for an Environmental Loss must: (i)
comply with the requirements and procedures set forth in Section 9.4 or
Section 9.5 and also must set forth with reasonable particularity the nature
of the condition or event underlying or giving rise to the Environmental Loss;
and (ii) include, to the extent known, the estimated amount of any
Environmental Losses incurred or reasonably expected to be incurred by the
Purchaser with respect to such Environmental Loss. The Purchaser shall also
provide the Sellers with copies of any non-privileged environmental reports,
data, proposals, claims and correspondence in the possession of the Purchaser
or any Affiliate thereof relevant to the Environmental Loss.

(b) Upon receipt of any Claim Notice, Sellers shall make a determination as
to coverage for the claim under either Sellers Environmental Insurance Policy
or Sellers right to environmental indemnification by the New York Times
Company pursuant to the NY Times APA. Sellers shall submit all required
notices and seek prompt confirmation of coverage under either Sellers
Environmental Insurance Policy or the New York Times Companys indemnification
obligation. Purchaser shall make reasonable efforts to cooperate and assist
Seller in obtaining such confirmation. If coverage for such claim is provided
by Sellers Environmental Insurance Policy or the New York Times Companys
indemnification obligation, then the procedures for conducting, directing,
managing, implementing and controlling the resolution of any such
Environmental Loss shall be governed by Sellers Environmental Insurance
Policy or the terms of the New York Times Companys
indemnification obligation pursuant to the NY Times APA. In that event,
Sellers shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Purchaser for any
additional Losses incurred by Purchaser (including, notwithstanding any other
provisions in this Agreement to the contrary, indirect, special, incidental,
consequential or punitive damages) as a result of the conduct, direction,
management, implementation and/or control of the resolution of any such
Environmental Loss by Sellers insurer or the NY Times Company.

 



57 (c) Except as set forth in Section 9.7(b), the Sellers and Purchaser shall
agree on a mutually satisfactory plan for conducting, directing, managing,
implementing and controlling the resolution of any Environmental Loss for
which Sellers have an indemnification responsibility or liability under this
Agreement and for which Sellers have formally assumed the defense of
(pursuant to Section 9.4) or acknowledged (pursuant to Section 9.5) and are
continuing to satisfy their indemnification obligation hereunder, including
(i) selecting and retaining counsel and consultants, and (ii) raising timely
and reasonable objections and defenses.

(d) The Purchaser shall provide, via one or more site access agreements that
are mutually satisfactory to the parties, reasonable access to the relevant
Real Property to the Sellers and their representatives and agents (including,
if applicable pursuant to the provisions of Section 9.7(b), insurers and
indemnitors of Sellers) to enable the Sellers to comply with their
indemnification obligations hereunder with respect to Environmental Losses.

 

(e) With respect to any Environmental Loss for which the Sellers have an
indemnification obligation hereunder, the Sellers, subject to the provisions
in Section 9.7(b) above, if applicable, agree to provide the Purchaser with
the following: (i) copies of material draft reports and final reports, plans
and other material documents prior to the submission thereof to
any Governmental Entity, and an opportunity to comment on the same (which
comments will be given due and good faith consideration so long as they are
timely submitted); and (ii) an opportunity to meet with the Sellers and their
representatives prior to and following any material substantive
communications or meetings with any Governmental Entity. The Purchaser shall
not submit any substantive reports, plans or other documents to, or have any
substantive communications with, any Governmental Entity with respect to any
Environmental Loss for which the Sellers have formally assumed the defense of
(pursuant to Section 9.4) or acknowledged (pursuant to Section 9.5) and are
continuing to satisfy their indemnification obligation hereunder without
first obtaining Sellers written consent to submit such documents or have such
communications.

(f) The provisions in this Section 9.7 shall govern with respect to
Environmental Losses to the extent there is a conflict with the provisions
pertaining to procedural rights and obligations in other sections of this
Article IX.

 

Section 9.8 _Exclusive Remedy_. The Purchaser and the Sellers acknowledge and
agree that, except for the right to specific performance pursuant to Section
10.12 or with respect to any claim for intentional fraud, following the
Closing, the indemnification provisions of Section 9.2 and Section 9.3 shall
be the sole and exclusive remedies of the Purchaser and the Sellers for any
breach by other party hereto of the representations and warranties in this
Agreement or the certificates delivered pursuant to Section 7.2(d) and Section
7.3(c) and for any failure by the other party to perform and comply with any
covenants and agreements in this Agreement, and anything herein to the
contrary notwithstanding, no breach of any representation, warranty, covenant
or agreement contained herein shall give rise to any right on the part of
the Purchaser or the Sellers after the Closing to rescind this Agreement or
any of the transactions contemplated hereby. In furtherance of the foregoing,
each party hereto, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates, hereby waives any
and all rights, claims and causes of action which such party may have against
any other party hereto or any of its Affiliates arising under or based upon
any Law or otherwise, other than pursuant to this Article IX or with respect
to any claim for intentional fraud.

 



58 Section 9.9 _Mitigation_. Each party hereto shall take all reasonable steps to
mitigate its Losses upon and after becoming aware of any event which could
reasonably be expected to give rise to any Losses.

Section 9.10  _Treatment of Indemnity Benefits_. All payments made by the
Sellers or the Purchaser pursuant to obligations under this Agreement shall be
treated as adjustments to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes.

Section 10.2 _Amendments and Waivers_. Any provision of this Agreement may be
amended or waived if, and only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and
is signed, in the case of an amendment, by each party to this Agreement, or in
the case of a waiver, by the party against whom the waiver is to be effective.
No failure or delay by any party in exercising any right or privilege
hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial
exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, power or privilege. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained herein, neither this Section 10.2 nor Section 6.19,
Section 6.20, Section 10.4, Section 10.6 or Section 10.8 (or any other
provision of this Agreement to the extent an amendment, supplement, waiver or
other modification of such provision would modify the substance of such
Sections) may be amended, supplemented, modified or waived in a manner that is
materially adverse to the interests of the Lender Parties in any respect
without the written consent of the Lender Parties.

Section 10.3 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement, each
party shall bear its own costs and expenses in connection with this
Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements and the transactions contemplated hereby
and thereby, including all legal, accounting, financial advisory, consulting
and all other fees and expenses of third parties, whether or not the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement are consummated.

Section 10.4 _Successors and Assigns_. This Agreement may not be assigned by
any Seller without the prior written consent of the Purchaser, or by the
Purchaser without the prior written consent of the Sellers; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Purchaser may assign any or all of its rights and interest
hereunder (a) to any of its Affiliates, in each case without the prior consent
of the Sellers if such assignment does not delay or impede the fulfillment of
any of the conditions set forth in Section 7.1 or Section 7.3 or (b) to its
Lenders. Subject to the foregoing, all of the terms and provisions of this
Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto
and their respective executors, heirs, personal representatives, successors
and permitted assigns.

Section 10.5 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and
interpreted and enforced in accordance with the Laws of the State of
Delaware, without giving effect to any choice of Law or conflict of Laws rules
or provisions (whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction)
that would cause the application of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than
the State of Delaware.

 



60 Section 10.6 _Consent to Jurisdiction and Service of Process_. EACH PARTY
HERETO CONSENTS TO THE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF ANY STATE OR FEDERAL COURT
LOCATED WITHIN THE COUNTY OF NEW CASTLE IN THE STATE OF DELAWARE AND
IRREVOCABLY AGREES THAT ALL ACTIONS OR PROCEEDINGS RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT,
THE ANCILLARY AGREEMENTS OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY
MAY BE LITIGATED IN SUCH COURTS. EACH PARTY HERETO ACCEPTS FOR ITSELF AND IN
CONNECTION WITH ITS RESPECTIVE PROPERTIES, GENERALLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY, THE
JURISDICTION OF SUCH COURTS AND WAIVES ANY DEFENSE OF FORUM NON CONVENIENS,
AND IRREVOCABLY AGREES TO BE BOUND BY ANY JUDGMENT RENDERED THEREBY IN
CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, THE ANCILLARY AGREEMENTS OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH PARTY HERETO IRREVOCABLY CONSENTS TO THE
SERVICE OF PROCESS OUT OF ANY OF SUCH COURTS IN ANY SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING
BY THE MAILING OF COPIES THEREOF BY REGISTERED OR CERTIFIED MAIL, POSTAGE
PREPAID, TO SUCH PARTY AT THE ADDRESS SPECIFIED IN THIS AGREEMENT, WITH SUCH
SERVICE TO BECOME EFFECTIVE 15 CALENDAR DAYS AFTER SUCH MAILING. NOTHING
HEREIN SHALL IN ANY WAY BE DEEMED TO LIMIT THE ABILITY OF EITHER PARTY HERETO
TO SERVE ANY SUCH LEGAL PROCESS, SUMMONS, NOTICES AND DOCUMENTS IN ANY OTHER
MANNER PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, each party hereto hereby (v) agrees that it
will not bring or support any action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or
third-party claim of any kind or description, whether in law or in equity,
whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against the Lender Parties in any
way relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including but not limited to any dispute arising out of or
relating in any way to the Debt Financing or the performance thereof or the
transactions contemplated thereby, in any forum other than exclusively in
the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York, or, if under
applicable law exclusive jurisdiction is vested in the federal courts, the
United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (and
appellate courts thereof), (w) submits for itself and its property with
respect to any such action to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts, (x)
agrees that service of process, summons, notice or document by registered mail
addressed to it at its address provided in Section 10.1 shall be effective
service of process against it for any such action brought in any such court,
(y) waives and hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by
law, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue
of, and the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of, any such
action in any such court and (z) agrees that a final judgment in any such
action shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit
on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law.

Section 10.7 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate counterparts,
each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which
taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement. Delivery of an
executed counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by facsimile, pdf
or other electronic transmission shall be effective as delivery of a manually
executed counterpart to this Agreement.

 



61 Section 10.8 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. The terms and provisions of this
Agreement are intended solely for the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns, and it is not the intention of
the parties to confer third-party beneficiary rights, and this Agreement does
not confer any such rights, upon any other Person. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, each of Sections 6.19, 10.2, 10.4, 10.6 and this Section 10.8 shall
expressly inure to the benefit of the Lender Parties and the Lender Parties
shall be entitled to rely on and enforce the provisions of such Sections

Section 10.9 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements, the
Schedules and the other documents, instruments and agreements specifically
referred to herein or therein or delivered pursuant hereto or thereto set
forth the entire understanding of the parties hereto with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. Any and all previous agreements
and understandings between or among the parties regarding the subject matter
hereof, whether written or oral, are superseded by this Agreement, except for
any confidentiality agreement entered into between the parties hereto, or
their respective designees, which shall continue in full force and effect in
accordance with its terms.

Section 10.10  _Captions_. All captions contained in this Agreement are for
convenience of reference only, do not form a part of this Agreement and shall
not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

 

Section 10.11 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be
illegal, invalid or unenforceable under any present or future Law, and if the
rights or obligations of any party hereto under this Agreement will not be
materially and adversely affected thereby: (a) such provision will be fully
severable; (b) this Agreement will be construed and enforced as if such
provision had never comprised a part hereof; (c) the remaining provisions of
this Agreement will remain in full force and effect and will not be affected
by such provision or its severance herefrom; and (d) in lieu of such
provision, there will be added automatically as a part of this Agreement a
legal, valid and enforceable provision as similar in terms to such provision
as may be possible.

 

Section 10.12 _Specific Performance_. The Purchaser and the Sellers each agree
that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions
of this Agreement were not performed by them in accordance with the terms
hereof, and that each party shall be entitled to specific performance of the
terms hereof in addition to any other remedy available at Law or in
equity. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
Sellers shall not be entitled to specifically enforce the obligations of the
Purchaser to conduct the Closing unless the Debt Financing has been, or would
at such Closing be, funded by the Lenders on the terms and conditions set
forth in the Commitment Letter.

Section 10.13 _Interpretation_. The parties hereto have participated jointly
in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements
and, in the event that an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation
arises, this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements shall be construed as if
drafted jointly by the parties hereto and no presumption or burden of proof
shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of
any of the provisions of this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement. Any
matter disclosed in any section or subsection of the Sellers Disclosure
Schedule shall be deemed disclosed for the purposes of each other section and
subsection of the Sellers Disclosure Schedule.

 



62 Section 10.14 _Legal Privilege_. The Purchaser waives and will not assert any
conflict of interest arising out of or relating to the representation, after
the Closing, of any Seller or any Affiliate thereof or any of their respective
officers, directors, employees or representatives (any such Person, a "
_Designated Person_ ") by any law firm currently representing any Seller (the
" _Current Representations_ "). The Purchaser will not assert any attorney-
client privilege with respect to any communication between any legal counsel
and any Designated Person occurring during the Current Representation in
connection with any dispute between any Designated Person and the Purchaser or
any Affiliate thereof, it being the intention of the parties hereto that all
such rights to such attorney-client privilege and to control such attorney-
client privilege in any such dispute shall be retained by such Designated
Person.
