Loss included in the amount so stated, the date such item was paid or properly accrued, the basis for any anticipated liability and the representation, warranty, covenant or agreement curtained herein to which each such item is related and the
computation of the amount to which such Indemnitee claims to be entitled hereunder. The Indemnitee shall enclose with the Claim Notice a copy of all papers served with respect to such Third Party Claim and any other documents evidencing such Third

Indemnitor has elected to assume the defense or prosecution of such Third Party Claim and any litigation resulting therefrom with counsel of its choice and at its sole cost and expense (a &#147;<U>Third Party Defense</U>&#148;). If the Indemnitor
assumes the Third Party Defense in accordance herewith: (i)&nbsp;the Indemnitee may retain separate co-counsel at its sole cost and expense (as to which the Indemnitee shall not be entitled to indemnification) and participate in the defense of the
Third Party Claim but the Indemnitor shall control the investigation, defense and settlement thereof; (ii)&nbsp;the Indemnitee will not file any papers or consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to the Third

provides for equitable relief without the prior written consent of the Indemnitee. The parties hereto will use commercially reasonable efforts to minimize Losses from Third Party Claims, act in good faith in responding to, defending against,
settling or otherwise dealing with such claims, and cooperate in any such defense and give each other reasonable access to and copies of all information, records and documents relevant thereto. Whether or not the Indemnitor has assumed the Third
