These schedules and exhibits consist of (i) the Disclosure Letter (as such
term is defined in the Agreement), (ii) the Escrow Agreement (as such term is
defined in the Agreement), (iii) the Conditional Option Exercise Agreements
(as such term is defined in the Agreement), (iv) the Nicolais Employment

The Agreement has been included to provide investors with information
regarding its terms. The Agreement is not intended to provide any factual
information about Balchem or Performance Chemicals and Ingredients Company
("PCI"). The representations, warranties and covenants contained in the
Agreement were made only for purposes of the Agreement and as of specific
dates, were solely for the benefit of the parties to the Agreement, and are
subject to limitations agreed upon by the parties to the Agreement, including
being qualified by information in the confidential Disclosure Letter delivered
by the Sellers (as defined in the Agreement) and PCI to Balchem in connection
with the execution of the Agreement. The confidential Disclosure Letter
contains information that modifies, qualifies and creates exceptions to the
representations and warranties contained in the Agreement. Moreover, the
representations and warranties contained in the Agreement were made for the
purpose of allocating contractual risk between the parties to the Agreement
instead of establishing matters as facts, and may be subject to standards of
materiality applicable to the parties to the Agreement that differ from those
applicable to investors. Investors are not third-party beneficiaries under the
Agreement and should not rely on the representations, warranties and covenants
contained therein or any descriptions thereof as characterizations of the
actual state of facts or condition of Balchem, PCI or any of their respective
subsidiaries or affiliates. Additionally, information concerning the subject
matter of the representations and warranties contained in the Agreement may
change after the date of the Agreement, which subsequent information may or
may not be fully reflected in Balchem's public disclosures.

PURCHASE AND SALE

  

  

Section 2.01 Purchase and Sale. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth
herein, at Closing, Sellers shall sell to Buyer, and Buyer shall purchase from
Sellers, all of the Shares for the consideration specified in Section 2.02.

  


 

  

Section 2.02 Purchase Price. The aggregate purchase price for the Shares (the
"Purchase Price") shall be five hundred sixty-seven million dollars
($567,000,000) (the "Base Purchase Price"), minus the Final Adjustment Amount,
if negative, or plus the Final Adjustment Amount, if positive.

  

    

Section 2.03 Payment of the Purchase Price.

  

  

(a) At Closing, Buyer shall pay to each Seller an amount in cash equal to the
Closing Payment multiplied by the Percentage Interest applicable to such
Seller. For purposes of this Agreement, the "Closing Payment" shall mean an
aggregate amount of cash equal to (i) the Base Purchase Price, minus (ii) the
Escrow Amount (as defined below), minus (iii) the Closing Adjustment Amount,
if negative, plus (iv) the Closing Adjustment Amount, if positive.

  


 

  

(b) At Closing, as security for Sellers' indemnification obligations under
this Agreement, Buyer shall remit to the Escrow Agent an amount of cash equal
to $27,500,000 (the "Escrow Amount"), to be held and disbursed by the Escrow
Agent pursuant to the Escrow Agreement. All parties hereto agree for all Tax
purposes that: (i) Buyer shall be treated as the owner of the Escrow Amount,
and all interest and earnings earned from the investment and reinvestment of
the Escrow Amount, or any portion thereof, shall be allocable to Buyer
pursuant to Section 468B(g) of the Code and Proposed Treasury Regulation
Section 1.468B-8 and an amount equal to fifty percent (50%) of all interest
and earnings earned thereon shall be distributed to Buyer within fifteen (15)

is actually distributed to Sellers, interest may be imputed on such amount, as
required by Section 483 or 1274 of the Code, (iii) Sellers' rights to any such
distributed portion of the Escrow Amount under this Agreement shall be treated
as installment obligations for purposes of Section 453 of the Code, and (iv)
in no event shall the aggregate payments under the Escrow Agreement to Sellers
exceed $28,500,000. Clause (iv) of the preceding sentence is intended to
ensure that the right of Sellers to the Escrow Amount and any interest and
earnings earned thereon is not treated as a contingent payment without a
stated maximum selling price under Section 453 of the Code and the Treasury
Regulations promulgated thereunder. No party hereto shall take any action or
filing position inconsistent with the foregoing.

  


 

  

(c) On the Closing Date, Buyer, on behalf of and for the benefit of the
Company, shall pay or cause to be paid in full the Estimated Indebtedness
(other than AFCO Indebtedness) to the applicable holder(s) thereof by wire
transfer as directed by the Company.

  


 

  

(d) On the Closing Date, Buyer shall pay on behalf of the Company or cause the
Company to pay by wire transfer the Estimated Unpaid Company Transaction
Costs, less in each case any amounts required to withheld from such payments
under applicable Law.

  


 

  

(e) By execution hereof, each Seller hereby expressly acknowledges and agrees
(i) that he, she or it understands the purchase price mechanics set forth
herein (including the manner in which his, her or its Percentage Interest will
be calculated) and (ii) to the deduction from the Base Purchase Price for the
items referenced herein, including the establishment of the Escrow Account,
the retention of the funds for such account and the distribution and use of
those funds pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement.

  


 

  

(f) Immediately following the execution of this Agreement, Buyer and the
Company shall deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent to
release and pay to the Buyer as soon as reasonably practicable all of the
funds contained in the Escrow Account.

  

    

Section 2.04 Estimated Working Capital, Indebtedness and Unpaid Company

Date, the Company shall deliver to Buyer an estimated consolidated balance
sheet of the Acquired Companies as of the Closing Date (the "Closing Balance
Sheet"), together with a written statement (the "Company Estimated Closing
Statement") which sets forth in reasonable detail the Company's good faith
estimate of the following: (i) the amount of unpaid Indebtedness (other than
AFCO Indebtedness) as of the close of business on the Closing Date before
giving effect to the transactions contemplated hereby, including the holders
thereof and the amounts payable to each, as set forth in the payoff letters
received from each holder of Indebtedness, or, in the case of capital lease
Indebtedness, as determined in good faith by the Company ("Estimated
Indebtedness"), (ii) the amount of Working Capital Surplus or Working Capital
Deficiency, as the case may be, as of the close of business on the Closing
Date before giving effect to the transactions contemplated hereby (the
"Estimated Working Capital Surplus" or "Estimated Working Capital
Deficiency"), (iii) the amount of the unpaid Company Transaction Costs,
including the Persons to which such Company Transaction Costs are owed and the
amounts owed to each (the "Estimated Unpaid Company Transaction Costs") and
(iv) the amount of Cash on hand of the Acquired Companies as of the close of
business on the Closing Date (the "Estimated Closing Cash"). The Closing
Balance Sheet shall be prepared by the Company in accordance with this
Agreement and GAAP applied in a manner consistent with the preparation of the

Section 2.05 Final Working Capital, Indebtedness, Unpaid Company Transaction
Costs and Final Closing Cash.

  

  

(a) Within ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall cause the
Company to prepare, in good faith, and deliver to the Stockholder
Representative a consolidated balance sheet of the Acquired Companies as of
the Closing Date (the "Final Balance Sheet"), together with a written
statement (the "Buyer Closing Statement") setting forth the following: (i) the
amount of the unpaid Indebtedness (other than AFCO Indebtedness) as of the
close of business on the Closing Date prior to giving effect to the
transactions contemplated hereby ("Closing Indebtedness"), (ii) the amount of
the Company Transaction Costs that were unpaid as of the Closing Date, prior
to giving effect to the transactions contemplated hereby, including the
Persons to which such Company Transaction Costs are or were owed and the
amounts owed to each (the "Unpaid Company Transaction Costs"), (iii) the
amount of Working Capital Surplus or Working Capital Deficiency, as the case
may be, as of the close of business on the Closing Date prior to giving effect
to the transactions contemplated hereby ("Closing Working Capital Surplus" or
"Closing Working Capital Deficiency") and (iv) the amount of Cash on hand of
the Acquired Companies as of the close of business on the Closing Date (the
"Final Closing Cash"). The Final Balance Sheet shall be prepared in accordance
with this Agreement and GAAP applied in a manner consistent with the
preparation of the Balance Sheet, except as otherwise contemplated by the
definitions of Current Assets, Current Liabilities and Working Capital
included herein. Following the delivery of the Final Balance Sheet to Sellers,
on reasonable advance notice and during normal business hours, Buyer shall
make available to the Stockholder Representative and its representatives, and
afford the Stockholder Representative and its representatives the opportunity
to examine, such supporting schedules, analyses, workpapers, including the
audit workpapers, and other underlying records or documentation

  


 

  

    

relating to the calculation of the amount of the Closing Indebtedness, the
Unpaid Company Transaction Costs, and the Closing Working Capital Surplus or
Closing Working Capital Deficiency (as the case may be) as are reasonably
requested by the Stockholder Representative, solely for purposes of verifying
the amounts thereof. Buyer shall reasonably cooperate with the Stockholder
Representative and its representatives in such examination. The Stockholder
Representative and its representatives shall direct all questions and requests
for information pertaining to the foregoing to the Chief Financial Officer of
the Buyer or the Chief Accounting Officer (or such other person as the Chief
Financial Officer and/or the Chief Accounting Officer of the Buyer may
designate in writing), and such persons will provide answers to all reasonable
questions asked by the Stockholder Representative and its representatives
pertaining to the foregoing to the extent known or reasonably available, in
each case during normal business hours and on reasonable advance notice.

  


 

  

(b) If within forty-five (45) days following delivery of the Final Balance
Sheet to the Stockholder Representative, the Stockholder Representative has
not delivered to Buyer written notice of its good faith objections to the
Buyer Closing Statement describing in reasonable detail the basis of such
objections and the Stockholder Representative's proposed calculations with
respect to the items to which the Stockholder Representative objects (the
"Objection Notice"), then the Closing Indebtedness, Unpaid Company Transaction
Costs and Closing Working Capital Surplus or Closing Working Capital
Deficiency, as applicable, as set forth in such Buyer Closing Statement shall
be deemed final and conclusive and shall be "Final Indebtedness," "Final
Unpaid Company Transaction Costs," and "Final Working Capital Surplus," "Final
Working Capital Deficiency" and "Final Closing Cash," respectively. If the
Stockholder Representative delivers an Objection Notice within such forty-five
(45)-day period, then Buyer and the Stockholder Representative shall endeavor
in good faith to resolve the objections, for a period not to exceed fifteen
(15) days from the date of delivery of the Objection Notice. If at the end of
such fifteen (15) day period there are any objections that remain in dispute,
then the remaining objections in dispute shall be submitted for resolution to
a nationally recognized accounting firm to be selected jointly by the
Stockholder Representative and Buyer within the following five (5) days or, if
Sellers and Buyer are unable to mutually agree within such five (5)-day
period, such accounting firm shall be BDO USA, LLP (such jointly selected
accounting firm or BDO USA, LLP, the "Referee"). The Referee shall determine
the disputed portions of Final Indebtedness, Final Unpaid Company Transaction
Costs and/or Final Working Capital Surplus or Final Working Capital Deficiency
within thirty (30) days after the objections that remain in dispute are
submitted to it. If any remaining objections are submitted to the Referee for
resolution, (i) Buyer and the Stockholder Representative shall furnish to the
Referee a report with respect to such party's positions with respect to the
issues in the Objection Notice, a copy of which shall be delivered to the
other party hereto, and no ex parte conferences, oral examinations, testimony,
depositions, discovery or other form of evidence gathering or hearings shall
be conducted or allowed, provided, that, at the Referee's request, or as
mutually agreed by Buyer and the Stockholder Representative, Buyer and the
Stockholder Representative may meet with the Referee as long as
representatives of both are present; (ii) to the extent that a value has been
assigned to any objection that remains in dispute, the Referee shall not
assign a value to such objection that is greater than the greatest value for
such objection claimed by either Buyer and the Stockholder Representative or
less than the smallest value for such objection claimed by either Buyer and
the Stockholder Representative; and (iii) the determination by the Referee of
Final Indebtedness, Final Unpaid

  


 

  

    

Company Transaction Costs and Final Working Capital Surplus or Final Working
Capital Deficiency, as set forth in a written notice delivered to both parties
by the Referee, shall be made solely in accordance with the written reports
(i.e., not on independent review) and in accordance with this Agreement and
shall be binding and conclusive on the parties absent manifest error and shall
constitute an arbitral award that is final, binding and unappealable and upon
which a judgment may be entered by a court having jurisdiction thereof. All of
the fees and expenses of the Referee will be borne by Buyer, on the one hand,
and Sellers, on the other hand, in proportion to the portion of the aggregate
amount in dispute that is finally resolved by the Referee in a manner adverse
to such party. For example, if Buyer claims the appropriate adjustments are
$1,100 less than the amount determined by Sellers, and Sellers contests only
$500 of the amount claimed by Buyer (thereby agreeing Buyer is owed $600), and
if the Referee ultimately resolves the dispute by awarding Buyer $300 of the
$500 contested, then the fees and expenses of the Referee shall be allocated
60% (i.e., 300/500) to Sellers and 40% (i.e., 200/500) to Buyer.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall preclude the Buyer from
seeking and obtaining indemnification pursuant to Section 7.02(a)(iv) hereof
for any Indebtedness (other than AFCO Indebtedness) or Unpaid Company
Transaction Expenses which are not accounted for in the Buyer Closing
Statement.

  


 

  

(c) To the extent that the Final Adjustment Amount exceeds the Closing
Adjustment Amount, such excess (the "Final Adjustment Surplus") shall be paid
by the Company to the Stockholder Representative (for further credit to
Sellers in accordance with their respective Percentage Interest), within ten
(10) days of any such final determination. To the extent that the Final
Adjustment Amount is less than the Closing Adjustment Amount (such deficiency,
the "Final Adjustment Deficiency"), the Stockholder Representative and Buyer
shall provide the Escrow Agent with joint written instructions in accordance
with the Escrow Agreement to deliver funds from the Escrow Account in the
amount of such Final Adjustment Deficiency to Buyer, within ten (10) days of
any such final determination. For Tax purposes, any payment under this Section
2.05(c) shall be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price unless a
contrary treatment is required by applicable Laws.

  

  

Section 2.06 Transactions to be Effected at Closing.

  

  

(a) At Closing, Buyer shall deliver to Sellers:

closing ("Closing") to be held at 10:00 a.m., Central Time, on the date that
is the later of (i) May 7, 2014 and (ii) five (5) Business Days after the last
of the conditions to Closing set forth in Article VI have been satisfied or
waived (other than conditions which, by their nature are to be satisfied on
the Closing Date). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Buyer delivers the
Available Funds Certificate more than five (5) Business Days prior to May 7,
2014 and the Company consents to the Closing occurring prior to May 7, 2014,
the Closing shall occur within five (5) Business Days of the delivery of the
Available Funds Certificate, subject to the satisfaction of the conditions to
Closing set forth in Article VI. Closing shall take place by exchange of
executed documents by PDF or facsimile at such time, or at such other time or
on such other date or at such other place as Stockholder Representative and
Buyer may mutually agree upon in writing (the day on which Closing takes place
being the "Closing Date").

  


 

  

Section 2.08 Tax Withholding. Buyer shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from the Closing Payment and any other payment by it hereunder all Taxes that
Buyer may be required to deduct and withhold under any provision of the Code
or any provision of applicable Law. To the extent that amounts are so
withheld, all such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to Seller in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made by Buyer.

constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of Buyer, enforceable

be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar
Laws affecting creditors' rights generally and by general principles of equity
(regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a proceeding at law or in
equity).

  

  

Section 4.03 No Conflicts; Consents. The execution, delivery and performance
by Buyer of this Agreement, and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, do not and will not: (a) result in a violation or breach

Section 4.04 Investment Purpose. Buyer is acquiring the Shares solely for its
own account for investment purposes and not with a view to, or for offer or
sale in connection with, any distribution thereof. Buyer acknowledges that the
Shares are not registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or any
state securities laws, and that the Shares may not be transferred or sold
except pursuant to the registration provisions of the Securities Act of 1933,
as

  

    

amended or pursuant to an applicable exemption therefrom and subject to state
securities laws and regulations, as applicable. Buyer is able to bear the
economic risk of holding the Shares for an indefinite period (including total
loss of its investment), and has sufficient knowledge and experience in
financial and business matters so as to be capable of evaluating the merits
and risk of its investment.

  

  

Section 4.05 Brokers. No broker, finder or investment banker is entitled to
any brokerage, finder's or other fee or commission in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement based upon arrangements made by or
on behalf of Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer.

  

  

Section 4.06 Financing. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement,
Buyer has delivered to the Company correct and complete copies of an executed
debt commitment letter (excluding the fee letter referred to therein), dated
as March 25, 2014 (the "Debt Commitment Letter"), from Bank of America, N.A.
and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and Smith Incorporated (the "Lead Arranger")
providing the terms and conditions upon which the Lead Arranger has agreed to
use commercially reasonable efforts to form a syndicate of financial
institutions (including Bank of America) (the "Debt Financing Sources") to
provide up to $450,000,000 of debt financing of which $400,000,000 will be
available to fund payment at Closing of a portion of the Purchase Price (the
"Debt Financing" or the "Financing"), and Bank of America N.A. will act as
Administrative Agent (the "Administrative Agent") and has committed
individually as a lender to provide up to $200,000,000 of such Debt Financing.
The Debt Commitment Letter in the form so delivered is, as to Buyer, and to
the knowledge of Buyer, the other parties thereto, valid and in full force and
effect; such commitments have not been withdrawn, terminated or otherwise
amended or modified in any respect; and no event has occurred that, with or
without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a default or breach on
the part of Buyer under any term or condition of the Debt Commitment Letter.
The Debt Commitment Letter (together with the Summary of Terms and Conditions
attached thereto as Exhibit A and the fee letter referred to therein)
constitute, as of the date hereof, the entire and complete agreement between
the parties thereto with respect to the financings contemplated thereby, and,
except as set forth, described or provided for in the Debt Commitment Letter,
(i) there are no conditions precedent to the respective obligations of the
Debt Financing Sources to provide the Debt Financing, and (ii) there are no
contractual contingencies or other provisions under any agreement (including
any side letters) relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
to which Buyer or any of its Affiliates is a party other than the Debt
Commitment Letter that would permit the Debt Financing Sources to not fund up
to $400 million of the Debt Financing amount prior to the Outside Date, to
reduce the total amount of the Debt Financing, or to impose any additional
conditions precedent to the availability of the Debt Financing; provided the
Company acknowledges that the Lead Arranger has not as of the date hereof
syndicated the $250 million of additional commitments to the Debt Financing
and any such additional commitments may be subject to conditions, contractual
contingencies or other provisions that are not contained in the Debt
Commitment Letter. Buyer has fully paid any and all commitment fees, if any,
or other fees required by the Debt Commitment Letter to be paid as of the date
hereof. Buyer has no reason to believe that any of the conditions to the
Financing will not be satisfied on a timely basis or that the funding
contemplated in the Financing will not be made available to Buyer in full on a
timely basis in order to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. The Debt Financing, together with Buyer's available cash, is
sufficient for

  

    

Buyer to (a) pay the Purchase Price in accordance with the terms hereof; (b)
refinance or repay in full the Company's Indebtedness, and pay in full any
obligation, of the Acquired Companies which may become due as a result of this
Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby; (c) pay
in full all fees, costs and expenses payable by Buyer in connection with this
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby; and
(d) provide for the working capital needs of the Acquired Companies following
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

  

  

Section 4.07 Legal Proceedings. There are no Actions pending or, to Buyer's
knowledge, threatened against or by Buyer or any Affiliate of Buyer that
challenge or seek to prevent, enjoin or otherwise delay the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 5.03 Taxes.

  


 

  

(a) The following provisions shall govern the allocation of responsibility and
payment of Taxes as between Buyer and Sellers for certain Tax matters
following the Closing Date:

  


 

  

(i) Between the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date, Sellers shall, or
shall cause the Company to, prepare and file, on a timely basis and on a basis
consistent with past practice, all Tax Returns that are required to be filed
by any of the Acquired Companies (taking account of extensions) prior to the
Closing Date and shall cause the Company to pay all Taxes with respect
thereto.

  


 

  

(ii) The Stockholder Representative shall prepare or cause to be prepared and
file or cause to be filed all income Tax Returns with respect to any taxable
period ending on or before the Closing Date for the Acquired Companies that
are required to be filed after the Closing Date (taking into account valid
extensions). The Buyer shall, and shall cause any Acquired Company to,
authorize and direct their respective officers to execute any and all Tax
Returns required to be filed by the Stockholder Representative pursuant to
this Section 5.03(a)(ii). Any such Tax Return shall be submitted (with copies
of any relevant schedules, work papers and other documentation then available)
by the Stockholder Representative to Buyer for Buyer's review and comment not
less than thirty (30) days prior to the due date for the filing of such Tax
Return, provided that any such Tax Return due within thirty (30) days
(including extensions) after the Closing Date, shall be provided as soon as
practical before such due date. Except as otherwise required by applicable
Law, all such Tax Returns shall be prepared on a basis consistent with the
prior Tax Returns for the Acquired Companies. Not later than ten (10) days
after Buyer's receipt of any Tax Return (or as soon as practical after receipt
in the case of a Tax Return due within thirty (30) days after the Closing
Date), Buyer shall provide to the Stockholder Representative any written
comments to such Tax Return. The Stockholder Representative and the Buyer
shall attempt in good faith to resolve any dispute with respect to any such
Tax Return. If the Stockholder Representative and the Buyer are unable to
resolve any such dispute at least ten (10) days prior to the due date (taking
into account valid extensions) for filing any such Tax Return, the Stockholder
Representative and Buyer shall refer such dispute to the Referee for
resolution. The fees and expenses of the Referee shall be apportioned between
the Stockholder Representative and the Buyer in accordance with the procedures
set forth in Section 2.05(b). To the extent that the Referee is unable to
resolve any dispute with respect to any Tax Return at least three (3) days
prior to the due date (taking into account valid extensions) for filing any
such Tax Return, such Tax Return shall be filed in accordance with the
position of the Buyer as to any unresolved disputed item, subject to
amendment, if necessary to reflect the resolution by the Referee. Buyer and
the Stockholder Representative shall jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to pay
from the Escrow Account to the Stockholder Representative for remittance to
the appropriate Governmental Authority, to the extent of any funds then
remaining therein, or Sellers shall timely remit to the Stockholder
Representative for remittance to the appropriate Governmental Authority, to
the extent there are not sufficient funds in the Escrow Account any Taxes
shown due and payable on such Tax Return, except to the extent that such Taxes
were included as Current Liabilities in calculating the Company's Working
Capital and taken into account in determining the amount of

  

    

the Purchase Price pursuant to Article II in which case Buyer shall be
responsible for the payment of such Taxes for remittance to the appropriate
Governmental Authority.

  


 

  

(iii) Buyer, at Sellers' expense, shall prepare or cause to be prepared and
file or cause to be filed all other Tax Returns (not covered by Section
5.03(a)(ii)) with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period for the Acquired
Companies that are required to be filed after the Closing Date (taking into
account valid extensions). Any such Tax Return required to be filed that shows
a Tax due and owing the payment of which is the responsibility of Sellers
under this Agreement shall be submitted (with copies of any relevant
schedules, work papers and other documentation then available) by Buyer to the
Stockholder Representative for the Stockholder Representative's approval not
less than thirty (30) days prior to the due date for the filing of such Tax
Return, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed;
provided, however, that any such Tax Return due within thirty (30) days
(including extensions) after the Closing Date, shall be provided as soon as
practical before such due date. Except as otherwise required by applicable
Law, all such Tax Returns shall be prepared on a basis consistent with the
prior Tax Returns for the Acquired Company. Not later than ten (10) days after
Stockholder Representative's receipt of any Tax Return (or as soon as
practical after receipt in the case of a Tax Return due within thirty (30)
days after the Closing Date), Stockholder Representative shall provide to the
Buyer any written comments to such Tax Return. The Stockholder Representative
and the Buyer shall attempt in good faith to resolve any dispute with respect
to any such Tax Return. If the Stockholder Representative and the Buyer are
unable to resolve any such dispute at least ten (10) days prior to the due
date (taking into account valid extensions) for filing any such Tax Return,
the Stockholder Representative and Buyer shall refer such dispute to the
Referee for resolution. The fees and expenses of the Referee shall be
apportioned between the Stockholder Representative and the Buyer in accordance
with the procedures set forth in Section 2.05(b). To the extent that the
Referee is unable to resolve any dispute with respect to any Tax Return at
least three (3) days prior to the due date (taking into account valid
extensions) for filing any such Tax Return, such Tax Return shall be filed in
accordance with the position of the Buyer as to any unresolved disputed item,
subject to amendment, if necessary to reflect the resolution by the Referee.
Buyer and the Stockholder Representative shall jointly instruct the Escrow
Agent to pay from the Escrow Account to the Buyer for remittance to the
appropriate Governmental Authority, to the extent of any funds then remaining
therein, or Sellers shall timely remit to the Buyer for remittance to the
appropriate Governmental Authority, to the extent there are not sufficient
funds in the Escrow Account, any Taxes shown due and payable on such Tax
Return, except to the extent that such Taxes were included as Current
Liabilities in calculating the Company's Working Capital and taken into
account in determining the amount of the Purchase Price pursuant to Article II
in which case Buyer shall be responsible for the payment of such Taxes for
remittance to the appropriate Governmental Authority.

  


 

  

(iv) For purposes of this Agreement, if an Acquired Company is permitted but
not required under applicable Law to treat the Closing Date as the last day of
a taxable period with respect to any Tax, then the parties shall treat that
day as the last day of a taxable period. In the case of any Taxes that are
imposed on a periodic basis and are payable for a Straddle Period, the portion
of such Tax which relates to the portion of such Tax period ending on the
Closing Date shall (x) in the case of any Taxes other than Taxes based upon or
related to income, gains or receipts, or employment or payroll, specific
transactions, or imposed in connection with any sale or other transfer or
assignment of property (real or personal, tangible or intangible) or

  

    

withholding, be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire Tax period
multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days in the
Tax period ending on and including the Closing Date and the denominator of
which is the number of days in the entire Tax period, and (y) in the case of
any Tax based upon or related to income, gains or receipts, or employment or
payroll, specific transactions, or imposed in connection with any sale or
other transfer or assignment of property (real or personal, tangible or
intangible) or withholding, be deemed equal to the amount which would be
payable if the relevant Tax period ended on the Closing Date. Any credits
relating to a Tax period that begins before and ends after the Closing Date
shall be taken into account as though the relevant Tax period ended on the
Closing Date. All determinations necessary to give effect to the foregoing
allocations shall be made in a manner consistent with reasonable prior
practice of the Acquired Companies, unless otherwise required by applicable
Law.

  


 

  

(v) Buyer and the Stockholder Representative agree that to the extent
permitted by Law, any deductions relating to the payment of bonuses, option
cancellation payments, repayment of Indebtedness, any other Company
Transaction Expense or (to the extent complying with the safe harbor set forth
in Rev. Proc. 2011-29) success-based fees in respect of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall be included as deductions of the Acquired
Companies in the relevant Tax Returns for Pre-Closing Tax Periods. Except to
the extent attributable to any Tax attribute generated after the Closing Date
or to the extent included as Current Assets in calculating the Company's
Working Capital and taken into account in determining the amount of the
Purchase Price pursuant to Article II, any refunds (or credits for
overpayment) of Taxes, including any interest received from a Governmental
Authority thereon, attributable to any Pre-Closing Tax Period of the Acquired
Companies shall be for the account of Sellers. Promptly upon any Acquired
Company's (or any of its Affiliates') receipt of any such refund (or use of a
credit for overpayment), Buyer shall pay over, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds, any such refund (or the amount of any such credit so used) to
the Stockholder Representative for further distribution to Sellers in
accordance with each Seller's Percentage Interest; provided that (A) such
amounts shall be repaid by Sellers to Buyer to the extent they are
subsequently disallowed or reduced; and (B) payments to the Stockholder
Representative under this Section 5.03(a)(v) shall be net of any Taxes and out
of-pocket costs incurred or associated in obtaining or receiving such refund
or credit of Taxes. Buyer shall take any action reasonably necessary for the
Acquired Companies to promptly claim refunds attributable to any Pre-Closing
Tax Period.

  


 

  

(b) Subject only to the specific limitations of this Section 5.03(b), Section
5.03(f) and Section 7.04 hereof, each Institutional Seller, jointly and
severally, and each Individual Seller, severally but not jointly in accordance
with its Percentage Interest, agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Buyer
Indemnified Parties from and against, and to reimburse and pay a Buyer
Indemnified Party with respect to, any and all Losses incurred or sustained
by, or imposed upon a Buyer Indemnified Party based upon, arising out of, with
respect to or by reason of: (1) all Taxes (or the nonpayment thereof) of the
Acquired Companies for any taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date
and, in the case of a Straddle Period, allocable to the portion of the taxable
period up to and including the Closing Date (determined in accordance with
Section 5.03(a)(iv)), (2) all Taxes of any member of an affiliated, combined
or unitary group of which an Acquired Company is or was a member on or prior
to the Closing Date, including pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section
1.1502-6 or any analogous or similar

  

    

state, local or foreign Law, and (3) any and all Taxes of any Person imposed
on the Acquired Company as a transferee or successor, by contract or pursuant
to any Law, which Taxes relate to an event or transaction occurring on or
before the Closing Date, provided, however, that (i) Sellers shall be liable
for Taxes only to the extent that such Taxes were not included as Current
Liabilities in calculating the Company's Working Capital and taken into
account in determining the amount of the Purchase Price pursuant to Article
II, (ii) Sellers shall have no liability for any Taxes or Losses with respect
to Taxes that are attributable to any transaction outside the ordinary course
of business of the Acquired Companies entered into by Buyer or its Affiliates
or at the direction of Buyer or its Affiliates that occurs on the Closing Date
after Closing, and (iii) Sellers shall have no liability to Buyer for any
Taxes or Losses attributable to Taxes with respect to any Tax period or
portion of a Tax period beginning after the Closing Date. Sellers'
indemnification obligations under this Section 5.03(c) are referred to herein
as the "Tax Indemnity."

  


 

  

(c) Buyer shall inform the Stockholder Representative of the commencement of
any audit, examination or proceeding ("Tax Contest") relating in whole or in
part to Taxes for which Buyer may be entitled to indemnity from Sellers
hereunder. With respect to any Tax Contest for which Sellers acknowledge in
writing that Sellers are liable under Section 5.03(b) for all Losses relating
thereto, Sellers shall be entitled to control, in good faith, all proceedings
taken in connection with such Tax Contest at their sole cost and expense;
provided, however, that (x) the Stockholder Representative shall notify Buyer
in writing of its intention to control such Tax Contest within fifteen (15)
days after Buyer notifies the Stockholder Representative of such Tax Contest,
and (y) Buyer shall be entitled to participate in such Tax Contest at its sole
cost and expense. In the case of a Tax Contest relating to Taxes of any of the
Acquired Companies for a Straddle Period, Buyer shall be entitled to control
all proceedings taken in connection with and such Tax Contest at its sole cost
and expense; provided, however, that the Stockholder Representative shall be
entitled to participate in such Tax Contest at its sole cost and expense. In
any event, when either the Buyer or the Stockholder Representative conduct the
defense of a Tax Contest, it shall (i) keep the other party or parties hereto
promptly and fully informed of the conduct of any such Tax Contest, (ii)
provide promptly to the other party or parties hereto any documents,
correspondence, or other materials relating to any such Tax Contest and (iii)
consider in good faith any reasonable suggestions of the other party or
parties hereto relating to the conduct (including prosecution, compromise, or
settlement) of such Tax Contest. Furthermore, the Stockholder Representative
shall not settle any Tax Contest that Stockholder Representative controls
without the prior written consent of the Buyer (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed ) and the Buyer shall not settle any Tax
Contest that Buyer controls without the prior written consent of the
Stockholder's Representative (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld
or delayed). This Section 5.03 and not Section 7.05 shall apply control any
Tax Contests.

  


 

  

(d) The Stockholder Representative and Buyer shall (i) each provide the other
with such assistance as may be reasonably requested by any of them or their
representatives in connection with the preparation of any Tax Return, Tax
Contest or Tax matter of the Acquired Company. Any expenses incurred in
furnishing such information or assistance shall be borne by the party
requesting it.

  

    

(e) Except as required by applicable Laws, without the prior written consent
of Sellers (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned), none of Buyer, the Acquired Companies, or any Affiliate of Buyer
shall file any amended Tax Return with respect to any Tax period ending on or
before the Closing Date.

  


 

  

(f) All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration, value added
and other such Taxes and fees (including any penalties and interest) incurred
in connection with this Agreement (including any real property transfer Tax
and any other similar Tax) shall be borne and paid 50% by Sellers, on the one
hand, and 50% by Buyer, on the other, when due. Buyer shall, 50% at its own
expense and 50% at the expense of Sellers, timely file any Tax Return or other
document with respect to such Taxes or fees, and Sellers shall reasonably
cooperate with Buyer with respect to such filings.

  


 

  

(g) As soon as practicable after the date hereof, the Company shall (i) seek
an executed 280G Waiver from each Person who is a "disqualified individual"
(within the meaning of Section 280G), as determined immediately prior to the
execution of this Agreement, and who might otherwise receive or have the right
or entitlement to receive a 280G Payment unless the requisite approval of such
280G Payment by the stockholders of the Company is obtained, and (ii) subject
to the receipt of such executed 280G Waivers, submit to its stockholders for
approval, meeting the requirements of Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and
the applicable rulings and final regulations thereunder, any payments and/or
benefits that may separately or in the aggregate, constitute "excess parachute
payments," within the meaning of Section 280G(b) of the Code and the
applicable rulings and final regulations thereunder (the "280G Payments"),
such that the Company's income tax deduction of such payments and benefits
will not be limited by the application of Section 280G of the Code and the
applicable rulings and final regulations thereunder. Prior to soliciting such
approval, the Company shall provide drafts of such shareholder approval
materials and 280G Waivers to Buyer for its review and approval, which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Prior to the Closing,
the Company shall deliver to Buyer evidence that a vote of the stockholders of
the Company was solicited in accordance with the foregoing provisions of this
Section with respect to each person who executes a 280G Waiver and that either
(A) the requisite vote of the stockholders was obtained with respect to the
280G Payments to such person (the "280G Approval"), or (B) that the 280G
Approval was not obtained, and, as a consequence, pursuant to the Section 280G
Waivers, the 280G Payments shall not be made or provided to such person.

  

  

Section 5.04 Financing Related Cooperation; Debt Financing.

  


 

  

(a) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company will provide, and will cause its
Subsidiaries and each of their respective Representatives and management teams
to provide all commercially reasonable cooperation requested by Buyer, Lead
Arranger, other arrangers, prospective Debt Financing Sources or other
prospective sources of debt financing in connection with the arrangement,
syndication, documentation and closing of the Debt Financing (or any
replacement thereof), including using commercially reasonable efforts to: (A)
cooperate with and assist Buyer and Buyer's Affiliates in connection with
their preparation and negotiation of definitive agreements with respect
thereto on terms and conditions in accordance with those set forth in the Debt
Commitment Letter, and execute and deliver such definitive documents at the
Closing; (B) furnish Buyer, Lead Arranger, other arrangers, prospective Debt

  

    

Financing Sources and other prospective sources of debt financing with such
financial and other information relating to the Acquired Companies as any of
them may reasonably request in connection with the Debt Financing or the
syndication thereof, or to obtain customary "comfort" (including "negative
assurance" comfort) from independent accountants in connection with
syndication of the Debt Financing; (C) assist Buyer in Buyer's preparation of
any required financial information (including pro forma financial information)
relating to the Acquired Companies or projections; (D) assist with the
preparation of customary bank information memoranda, rating agency
presentations and bank syndication materials required in connection with the
Debt Financing, and provide customary authorization letters authorizing the
distribution of information relating to the Acquired Companies to prospective
Debt Financing Sources and other prospective sources of debt financing; (E)
assist in the preparation for and participate in a customary and reasonable
number of meetings, due diligence sessions, presentations, drafting sessions,
sessions with rating agencies and road shows, including to make available, at
reasonable times and locations, Representatives of the Acquired Companies and
members of the Acquired Companies' finance departments for such purposes; (F)
take all actions reasonably necessary to permit prospective Debt Financing
Sources and other prospective sources of debt financing to perform customary
due diligence with respect to the Acquired Companies in connection with the
Debt Financing; and (G) deliver notices of prepayment (contingent upon the
Closing) and obtain customary payoff letters, lien terminations and
instruments of discharge to be delivered at the Closing, and give any other
necessary notices (contingent upon the Closing), to allow for the payoff,
discharge and termination in full, at the Closing, of all of the Company's
Indebtedness (other than AFCO Indebtedness). Notwithstanding the foregoing, no
Acquired Company shall be required to provide cooperation under this Section
5.04 that: (i) unreasonably interferes with the ongoing business of the
Acquired Companies; (ii) causes any representation or warranty of the Company
in this Agreement to be breached; or (iii) causes any Closing condition set
forth in Article VI to fail to be satisfied or otherwise causes the breach of
this Agreement or any Material Contract by the applicable Acquired Company
party thereto; and provided, further, the effect of any such breach shall be
excluded when determining if the conditions set forth in Section 6.02 are
satisfied. In no event shall the Company be in breach of this Section 5.04(a)
because of the failure to deliver any third party opinions.

  


 

  

(b) In no event shall any Acquired Company be required to pay any commitment
or similar fee or incur any liability or expense in connection with assisting
Buyer in arranging the Debt Financing or as a result of any information
provided by the Acquired Companies or any of their Affiliates or
representatives in connection therewith. Buyer shall, from and after Closing
or after the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01, (i)
promptly upon request by the Company reimburse the Company for all reasonable
out‑of‑pocket costs incurred in good faith by the Acquired Companies in
connection with such cooperation; and (ii) subject to the indemnification
procedures set forth in Section 7.05, indemnify and hold harmless the Acquired
Companies and their Affiliates and Representatives from and against any and
all Losses suffered or incurred by them in connection with the arrangement of
the Debt Financing or providing any of the information utilized in connection
therewith, except for Losses arising out of, resulting from or relating to any
negligent, reckless or wrongful acts or omissions of any of the Acquired
Companies or their respective Affiliates or any of their respective
Representatives or any inaccurate, incorrect or misleading information
provided by any of the Acquired Companies or their respective Affiliates or
any of their respective Representatives.

  

    

(c) Buyer shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, use best efforts to obtain
the Debt Financing on the terms and conditions described in the Debt
Commitment Letter, including using best efforts to: (i) enter into definitive
agreements with respect to the Debt Financing (including agreeing to any
requested changes to the Debt Commitment Letter by the committed lenders in
accordance with the related flex provisions); (ii) satisfy (or obtain a
waiver) on a timely basis of all conditions in such definitive agreements;
(iii) consummate the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter
at Closing; and (iv) seek to enforce its rights under the Debt Commitment
Letter. In the event any portion of the Debt Financing expires or is
terminated or otherwise becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions
contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letter, Buyer shall promptly (and in any
event within two (2) Business Days) notify the Company of such unavailability
and the reasons therefor and shall thereafter use its best efforts to arrange
to obtain alternative financing, including from alternative sources on
whatever terms are then available to Buyer, and shall accept any such
alternative financing so long as the terms thereof do not increase the total
fees, interest and other costs of the Debt Financing (compared to the cost of
the Debt Financing identified in the Debt Commitment Letter) by more than 35%
over the term of the Debt Financing (as such term is set forth in the Debt
Commitment Letter) and are otherwise commercially reasonable, as promptly as
practicable following the occurrence of such event; provided that such
replacement commitments shall not (A) be subject to any additional or modified
conditions or other contingencies to the funding of the Debt Financing than
those contained in the Debt Commitment Letter or (B) otherwise be reasonably
likely to impair or delay the funding of the Debt Financing or Closing. In
addition to, and without limiting in any respect Buyer's obligation to seek
alternative financing, in the event the failure to obtain the Debt Financing
is due to the breach or possible breach by the Debt Financing Sources of any
terms or conditions of the Debt Commitment Letters or any definitive financing
agreement entered into prior to Closing, Buyer shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to pursue any and all remedies available to it under the
Debt Commitment Letters and/or definitive financing agreements and applicable
laws including seeking specific performance of the Debt Commitment Letters
and/or definitive financing agreements. Buyer shall keep the Company informed
on a reasonably current basis in reasonable detail of the status of its
efforts to arrange the Debt Financing and shall not permit any amendment or
modification to be made to the Debt Commitment Letter that would have the
effect or would be reasonably likely to have the effect of impairing or
delaying the funding of the Debt Financing or Closing without the prior
written consent of the Company. Buyer shall provide notice to the Company
promptly upon receiving notification from the Administrative Agent that the
Debt Financing Sources are prepared to close on the Debt Financing (subject to
the terms and conditions of the definitive agreements negotiated among the
parties with respect thereto), and shall upon the Company's request furnish
correct and complete copies of the definitive agreements with respect thereto
to the Company promptly upon their execution. In addition, as soon as
reasonably practicable after learning that conditions permit Buyer to
accurately certify that (i) Buyer has satisfied its obligations set forth in
this Section 5.04, (ii) Buyer has satisfied all conditions to the Debt
Financing required to be satisfied by Buyer, other than any such conditions
which by their nature are to be satisfied on the Closing Date and, if not yet
obtained, HSR Clearance, and Buyer has provided the Company with a list of
outstanding closing conditions to the Debt Financing that are not required to
be satisfied by Buyer, (iii) upon closing of the Debt Financing, Buyer will
have liquid funds available to pay the Purchase Price at Closing, and (iv) the
Debt Financing will continue to be

  

    

available to the Buyer through the earlier of the Closing or the Outside Date,
subject to the terms and conditions of the Debt Commitment Letter and the
definitive agreements negotiated among the Buyer and the Debt Financing
Sources with respect thereto or, if Buyer has arranged for alternative
financing in accordance with this Section 5.04(c), the terms and conditions of
the debt commitment letter (if any) and definitive agreements negotiated among
the Buyer and the sources of such alternative financing with respect to such
alternative financing, Buyer shall deliver to the Company and Stockholder
Representative a certificate signed by a duly authorized officer of Buyer in
the form of _Exhibit E_ attached hereto (the "Available Funds Certificate")
certifying as to the foregoing.

  


 

  

(d) Buyer shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, refrain from taking,
directly or indirectly, any action that has as its principal or primary
purpose causing the failure of any of the conditions contained in the Debt
Commitment Letter or in any definitive agreement related to the Financing
contemplated therein.

  

  

Section 5.05 Director and Officer Indemnification and Insurance.

  


 

  

(a) Buyer agrees that all rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses
and exculpation by the Acquired Companies now existing in favor of each Person
who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date hereof or who becomes
prior to the Closing Date, an officer or director of any of the Acquired
Companies, as provided in the certificate of incorporation or by-laws of the
applicable Acquired Company, in each case as in effect on the date of this
Agreement, or pursuant to any other agreements in effect on the date hereof
and disclosed in Section 5.05(a) of the Disclosure Letter, shall survive the
Closing Date and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with
their respective terms.

  


 

  

(b) The Company shall maintain, through the Closing Date, the Company's
current policies of directors' and officers' liability insurance and
employment practices liability insurance in full force and effect without
reduction of coverage. Not later than the Closing, Date, the Company shall, or
Buyer shall cause the Company to, obtain "tail" insurance policies with a
claims period of six (6) years from the Closing Date with at least the same
coverage and amounts, and containing terms and conditions that are not less
advantageous to the directors and officers of the Company, in each case with
respect to claims arising out of or relating to events which occurred on or
prior to the Closing Date (including in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement).

  


 

  

(c) Effective as of the Closing, Buyer and the Company waive any claim
relating to and agree not to and to not permit any of their respective
Affiliates to bring any action asserting, any breach of fiduciary duty or
professional malpractice owed to any of the Acquired Companies against any
former director, officer, employee, partner, Seller, in-house attorney or
other representative or Affiliate of Highlander Partners, L.P. or the Company,
whether such action is filed derivatively on behalf of the Company or
otherwise, except for any claims for fraud or claims relating to criminal
conduct.

  


 

  

(d) The obligations of Buyer and the Company under this Section 5.05 shall not
be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any director
or officer to whom this Section 5.05 applies without the consent of such
affected director or officer (it being

  

    

expressly agreed that the directors and officers to whom this Section 5.05
applies shall be third-party beneficiaries of this Section 5.05, each of whom
may enforce the provisions of this Section 5.05).

  


 

  

(e) In the event Buyer, the Company or any of their respective successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be
the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or
merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets
to any Person, then, and in either such case, proper provision shall be made
so that the successors and assigns of Buyer or the Company, as the case may
be, shall assume all of the obligations set forth in this Section 5.05.

  

  

Section 5.06 Confidentiality. From and after Closing throughout the
Confidentiality Period, each Seller agrees to, and shall cause its Affiliates
and its and their officers, directors, managers, employees, representatives,
advisers, accountants and counsel (collectively, "Representatives") to, treat
and hold as confidential and not disclose any confidential or proprietary
information concerning Buyer, its Affiliates, or any Acquired Company,
including any notes, analyses, compilations, studies, forecasts,
interpretations or other documents that are derived from, contain, reflect or
are based upon any such information, together with the terms of this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby (the "Confidential Information"), and
refrain from using any of the Confidential Information, except in connection
with exercising its rights or responsibilities under this Agreement or
otherwise in connection with its legal obligations. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Confidential Information shall not include information that (a) is
or becomes generally available to the public or within the industry other than
as a result of a breach of this Section 5.06, or (b) is lawfully received
after the Closing Date from a third party not actually known to such receiving
party to be under any obligation of confidentiality with respect to such
information or fiduciary duty with respect to the secrecy of such information.
In the event that any Seller or its Representative is required in any legal
proceeding, discovery, or any subpoena, civil investigative demand, or similar
process to disclose any Confidential Information (a "Noticed Party"), such
Noticed Party shall promptly notify the Buyer of the requirement so that Buyer
or the Company may, at its sole expense, seek an appropriate protective order
or waive compliance with the provisions of this Section 5.06. If, in the
absence of a protective order or the receipt of a waiver hereunder, a Noticed
Party is, on the advice of counsel, required to disclose any Confidential
Information in any legal proceeding to any Governmental Authority, such
Noticed Party may disclose such Confidential Information to such Governmental
Authority; provided, that such Noticed Party shall give prior written notice
to the Buyer and the Company of such intended disclosure and shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, at the request of such other
parties, an order or other assurance that confidential treatment shall be
accorded to such portion of the Confidential Information required to be
disclosed as such other parties shall have designated in writing to such
Noticed Party. The parties hereby agree that the Confidentiality Agreement
shall survive the execution and delivery hereof and terminate automatically
effective upon Closing. If this Agreement is, for any reason, terminated prior
to Closing, the Confidentiality Agreement shall nonetheless continue in full
force and effect. Buyer acknowledges and confirms that the press release
issued under Section 5.10 shall not violate any provision of this Section
5.06. As used herein, the term "Confidentiality Period" means five (5) years
following the Closing Date, provided, however, that the Confidentiality Period
for all Confidential Information that constitutes a trade secret

  

   

  

  

under applicable Law shall continue after the expiration of such 5-year period
so long as such Confidential Information qualifies a trade secret under
applicable Law.

  

  

Section 5.07 Governmental Approvals and Other Third-Party Consents.

  


 

  

(a) Each party hereto shall, as promptly as possible, use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain, or cause to be obtained, all consents,
authorizations, orders and approvals from all Governmental Authorities that
may be or become necessary for its execution and delivery of this Agreement
and the performance of its obligations pursuant to this Agreement. Each party
shall cooperate fully with the other party and its Affiliates in promptly
seeking to obtain all such consents, authorizations, orders and approvals. The
parties hereto shall not willfully take any action that will have the effect
of delaying, impairing or impeding the receipt of any required consents,
authorizations, orders and approvals. In furtherance of the foregoing, each
party hereto agrees to supply as promptly as practicable to the appropriate
Governmental Authority any additional information and documentary material
that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the Notification
and Report Form filed by the parties pursuant to the HSR Act regarding the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  


 

  

(b) Without limiting the generality of Buyer's undertaking pursuant to this
Section 5.07, Buyer agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to avoid or
eliminate each and every impediment under any antitrust, competition or trade
regulation Law that may be asserted by any Governmental Authority or any other
party so as to enable the parties hereto to close the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as possible, provided, however,
that (i) Buyer shall not be required to initiate, file, prosecute, defend,
contest, compromise, settle or resist any action or proceeding, whether
judicial or administrative, or to take any action to have vacated, lifted,
reversed or overturned any Governmental Order relating to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and (ii) the Buyer shall not be required to,
and the Acquired Companies shall not, without the prior written consent of the
Buyer, become subject to, consent to, or propose, offer or agree to, or
otherwise take any action with respect to, any requirement, condition,
limitation, understanding, agreement or order to (A) sell, license, assign,
transfer, divest, hold separate or otherwise dispose of any assets, business
or portion of business of the Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries or any of the
Acquired Companies, or (B) conduct, restrict, operate, invest or otherwise
change the assets or business or any portion of the assets or business of the
Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries or any of the Acquired Companies in any
manner, or (C) impose any restriction, requirement or limitation on the
operation of the business or any portion of the business of the Buyer or any
of its Subsidiaries or any of the Acquired Companies; provided that, if
requested by the Buyer, the Company will become subject to, consent to, or
offer or agree to, or otherwise take any action with respect to, any such
requirement, condition, limitation, understanding, agreement or order so long
as such requirement, condition, limitation, understanding, agreement or order
is only binding on the Company in the event that the Closing occurs.

  


 

  

(c) All analyses, appearances, meetings, discussions, presentations,
memoranda, briefs, filings, arguments, and proposals made by or on behalf of
either party before any Governmental Authority or the staff or regulators of
any Governmental Authority, in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereunder (but, for the avoidance of doubt, not including any interactions
between the Company or Buyer and Governmental Authorities in the ordinary

  

    

course of business, any disclosure which is not permitted by Law or any
disclosure containing confidential information) shall be disclosed to the
other party or its legal counsel hereunder in advance of any filing,
submission or attendance, it being the intent that the parties will consult
and cooperate with one another, and consider in good faith the views of one
another, in connection with any such analyses, appearances, meetings,
discussions, presentations, memoranda, briefs, filings, arguments, and
proposals. Each party shall give notice to the other party with respect to any
meeting, discussion, appearance or contact with any Governmental Authority or
the staff or regulators of any Governmental Authority, with such notice being
sufficient to provide the other party with the opportunity to attend and
participate in such meeting, discussion, appearance or contact.

  


 

  

(d) The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to give all notices
to, and obtain all consents from, all third parties that are described in
Section 3.08 of the Disclosure Letter; provided, however, that Seller shall
not be obligated to pay any consideration therefor to any third party from
whom consent or approval is requested.

  

  

Section 5.08 Access to Information; Cooperation; Books and Records.

  


 

  

(a) From the date hereof until Closing, the Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries and its and each of its Subsidiaries' Representatives to (i)
afford the officers, employees, agents, representative, accountants and
counsel of Buyer and the financing sources of Buyer (and their respective
Representatives) reasonable access, during normal business hours and upon
reasonable notice, to the offices, properties, plants, other facilities, books
and records of the Company and each Subsidiary and to those Representatives of
the Company and each Subsidiary who have any knowledge relating to the Company
or any Subsidiary, (ii) furnish to the officers, employees, agents,
representative, accountants, counsel and financing sources of Buyer (and their
respective Representatives) such financial and operating data and other
information relating to the Company and the Subsidiaries as such Persons may
reasonably request and (iii) cooperate with Buyer in its investigation of the
Company and its Subsidiaries.

  


 

  

(b) For a period of five (5) years after the Closing Date, Buyer shall (and
shall cause the Acquired Companies to), during normal business hours and upon
reasonable notice, make available and provide the Stockholder Representative
and its Representatives (including, without limitation, counsel and
independent auditors) with access to or copies of all information, files,
documents and records (written and computer) relating to the Acquired
Companies or any of their businesses or operations for any and all periods
prior to and including the Closing Date that they may reasonably require in
connection with (i) financial reporting and accounting matters, (ii) the
preparation and filing of any Tax Returns or any other Tax related matter
addressed in Section 5.03, (iii) the determination of, Closing Indebtedness,
Working Capital, or the Final Adjustment Amount, or any dispute with Buyer
relating thereto, or (iv) any claim for indemnification pursuant to Article
VII. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Buyer nor any Acquired Company
will be required to provide or disclose any information to the Stockholder
Representative or its Representatives if such disclosure would, in the Buyer's
good faith opinion, contravene any applicable Law or jeopardize any attorney-
client privilege, and the Stockholder Representative and its Representatives
shall not have access to personnel records of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries relating to individual performance or evaluation records, medical
histories or other information that in Buyer's good faith opinion is sensitive
or the

  

    

disclosure of which could subject the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
risk of liability; provided that Sellers shall not be prohibited from
accessing such information pursuant to a valid court order. Any nonpublic
information about the Acquired Companies obtained by the Stockholder
Representative or its Representatives pursuant to this Section 5.08(b) shall
be deemed to be and treated as Confidential Information which is subject to
the provisions of Section 5.06.

  


 

  

(c) Until the third year following the Closing Date, Buyer shall preserve and
retain, all corporate, accounting, legal, auditing, human resources and other
books and records of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries relating to the
conduct of the business and operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries
prior to the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, during such period,
Buyer may dispose of any such books and records which are offered to, but not
accepted by, the Stockholder Representative.

  

  

Section 5.09 Closing Conditions. From the date hereof until Closing, each
party hereto shall use commercially reasonable efforts to take such actions as
are necessary to expeditiously satisfy Closing conditions set forth in Section
6.01, Section 6.02(b), Section 6.02(f) through Section 6.02(n) and Section
6.03(b) hereof.

  

  

Section 5.10 Public Announcements. No public release or announcement
concerning the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be issued by
any party to this Agreement or any of their respective Representatives without
the prior written consent of (i) the Buyer and (ii) the Company (prior to
Closing) or the Stockholder Representative (after Closing) (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), except as required by
applicable Law or stock exchange rules or regulations, in which case the party
required to make the release or announcement shall (to the extent reasonably
practicable under the circumstances) consult with the other party about, and
allow the other party reasonable time to comment on such release or
announcement in advance of such issuance. Buyer and the Company shall
cooperate to prepare mutually agreeable press releases to be issued by Buyer
and the Company upon signing of this Agreement and by Buyer and the
Stockholder Representative upon Closing.

  

  

Section 5.11 Further Assurances. Following Closing, each of the parties hereto
shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, execute and deliver
such additional documents, instruments, conveyances and assurances, and take
such further actions as may be reasonably required to carry out the provisions
hereof and give effect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

  

Section 5.12 Seller Releases. Effective as of Closing, each Seller, on such
Seller's own behalf and on behalf of such Seller's past, present and future
agents, attorneys, administrators, heirs, executors, spouses, trustees,
beneficiaries, representatives, successors and assigns claiming by or through
such Seller, hereby absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably RELEASES and
FOREVER DISCHARGES each of the Acquired Companies, and their respective past,
present and future directors, managers, members, shareholders, officers,
employees, agents, subsidiaries, affiliates, attorneys, representatives,
successors and assigns, from the following: all claims (including any

judgments, executions, indemnification rights, claims and demands arising out,
relating to, against or in any way connected with any of the Acquired
Companies, in respect of any and all agreements, liabilities or obligations
entered into or incurred on or prior to the date hereof, or in respect of any
event occurring or circumstances existing on or prior to the date hereof,
whether or not relating to claims pending on, or asserted after, the date
hereof; provided, however, that the foregoing release does not extend to,
include or restrict or limit in any way, and each Seller hereby reserves such
Seller's rights, if any, and the right of the other Sellers, if any, (a) to or
cause or permit to be pursued by the Stockholder Representative any and all
claims, actions or rights that such Seller may now or in future have solely on
account of rights of such Seller under this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or
any other documents entered into in connection therewith, (b) to receive
payments of accrued payroll and unpaid benefits since the last applicable
payroll or payment date, including any accrued bonuses, and (c) its rights to

Section 5.13 Intentionally omitted.

  

  

Section 5.14 Plant Closings and Mass Layoffs. During the period from the date
of this Agreement through and including the Closing Date, none of the Acquired
Companies shall take any action that could result in WARN Act liability for
any of the Acquired Companies.

  

  

Section 5.15 Exclusivity.

  


 

  

(a) From the date of this Agreement until the Closing or the termination of
the Agreement, the Company and the Sellers shall not, and shall not cause,
authorize or permit any of its or their respective Affiliates (including any
Subsidiary of the Company) or any of its or their respective investment
bankers or Representatives to, directly or indirectly, (i) encourage, solicit,
initiate, facilitate or continue inquiries regarding an Acquisition Proposal;
(ii) enter into discussions or negotiations with, or provide any information
to, any Person concerning a possible Acquisition Proposal; or (iii) enter into
any agreements or other instruments (whether or not binding) regarding an
Acquisition Proposal. The Company and the Sellers shall immediately cease, and
shall cause their respective Affiliates (including any Subsidiary of the
Company) investment bankers and Representatives to immediately cease, all
existing discussions or negotiations with any Persons with respect to, or that
could lead to, an Acquisition Proposal.

  


 

  

(b) To the extent not prohibited by existing contractual restrictions, in
addition to the other obligations under this Section 5.15, the Company or one
of the Sellers shall promptly (and in any event within two (2) Business Days
after receipt thereof) advise Buyer orally and in writing of any Acquisition
Proposal, any request for information with respect to any Acquisition
Proposal, or any inquiry with respect to or which could reasonably be expected
to result in an Acquisition Proposal, the material terms and conditions of
such request, Acquisition Proposal or inquiry, and the identity of the Person
making the same.

  


 

  

(c) The Company and each of the Sellers agree that the rights and remedies for
noncompliance with this Section 5.15 shall include having such provision
specifically enforced by any court having equity jurisdiction, it being
acknowledged and agreed that any such breach

  

    

or threatened breach shall cause irreparable injury to Buyer and that money
damages would not provide an adequate remedy to Buyer.

  

  

Section 5.16 Noncompetition and Nonsolicitation.

  


 

  

(a) Charles Nicolais and Alex Guiva (each a "Restricted Seller," and together
the "Restricted Sellers") each hereby agrees that, for a period of three (3)
years following the Closing Date (the "Noncompete Period"), such Restricted
Seller shall not, directly or indirectly, engage in, or be associated in any
way with or have any direct or indirect interest of any nature whatsoever in
any business that engages in the formulation, design, development,
manufacture, production, sale, distribution, licensing or other disposition
(at wholesale or retail, on commission or otherwise) anywhere in any of the
geographical areas where the Acquired Companies currently conduct business of
any products or services which are competitive with any products or services
developed or under development by, manufactured, produced, sold, licensed or
otherwise distributed or provided by any of the Acquired Companies as of the
Closing Date (a "Competitive Business"). Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, each Restricted Seller agrees that, during the Noncompete
Period, such Restricted Seller shall not, directly or indirectly: (i) own,
manage, operate, join, control or participate in any way in, or be connected
as an officer, employee, representative, agent, consultant, independent
contractor, advisor, partner, director, trustee, stockholder, member,
investor, lender, creditor, guarantor or otherwise in any manner with, any
Competitive Business; or (ii) call upon, solicit, divert, attempt to solicit
or divert, or conduct or carry on any business with any of the former
customers, current customers or potential customers of any of the Acquired
Companies for the benefit of any Competitive Business. Notwithstanding the
foregoing: (A) it is understood and agreed that the Restricted Seller's
service as members of the Board of Directors of Juice Tyme, Inc. (and, for no
longer than six (6) months at a time, Mr. Guiva's potential participation in
the operations of Juice Tyme, Inc.) shall not be considered a violation of the

(i) any breach of any of the representations or warranties of the Company or

certificate or instrument delivered by or on behalf of the Company or any
Seller pursuant hereto (provided that, in determining whether a breach of any
such representation or warranty has occurred for purposes of this Section
7.02(a)(i) or the amount of Losses arising therefrom, any and all references
to materiality qualifications such as "Material Adverse Effect," "material,"
"materially," "in all material respects" or similar qualifiers contained in

upon, any Buyer Indemnified Party based upon, arising out of, with respect to

Section 7.03 Indemnification By Buyer. Subject to the other terms and
conditions of this Article VII, Buyer shall indemnify Sellers against, and
shall hold Sellers harmless from and against, any and all Losses incurred or
sustained by, or imposed upon, Sellers based upon, arising out of, with
respect to or by reason of:

  


 

  

(a) any breach of any of the representations or warranties of Buyer contained
in this Agreement; or

  


 

  

(b) any breach of any covenant, agreement or obligation to be performed by
Buyer pursuant to this Agreement.

  

  

Section 7.04 Certain Limitations. The party making a claim under this Article
VII is referred to as the "Indemnified Party", and the party against whom such
claims are asserted under this Article VII is referred to as the "Indemnifying
Party". The indemnification provided for in Section 5.03(b) and Article VII
shall be subject to the following limitations:

  


 

  

(a) Sellers shall not be liable to the Indemnified Party for indemnification
under Section 7.02(a)(i) (I) for any Loss or any series of related Losses that
do not exceed $75,000 (a

  

    

"Qualifying Loss") and (II) until the aggregate amount of all Losses (whether
or not Qualifying Losses) incurred by the Buyer Indemnified Parties with
respect to the matters covered thereunder exceeds $2,000,000 (the
"Deductible"), in which event Sellers shall only be required to pay or be
liable for Qualifying Losses in excess of the Deductible; provided, however,
(A) any Losses related to the Fundamental Representations and the Tax
Representations shall constitute a Qualifying Loss notwithstanding the size of
such Loss and (B) the Deductible shall not apply to (i) any claim for
intentional breach of a representation or fraud or (ii) any breach of the Tax
Representations or the Fundamental Representations.

  


 

  

(b) The aggregate amount of all Losses for which Sellers shall be liable
pursuant to Section 7.02(a)(i) shall not exceed $55,000,000 (the "Cap");
provided, however, the Cap shall not apply to (i) any claim for intentional
breach of a representation or fraud or (ii) any breach of the Tax
Representations or the Fundamental Representations.

  


 

  

(c) Subject to the other limitations imposed by this Article VII, all claims
against the Sellers for indemnification under this Agreement, including any
claims for the Tax Indemnity and claims under Article VII, shall first be paid
and satisfied from the Escrow Account, to the extent of any funds then
remaining, and only secondarily by the Sellers; provided, however, that Losses
that could be asserted under the indemnification provisions of Section 7.02(b)
shall not be satisfied from the Escrow Account but instead, Buyer may only
seek to recover such Losses directly against the offending Seller (severally
and not jointly and severally against others). The Institutional Sellers shall
be jointly and severally liable for the indemnification obligations of the
Sellers pursuant to Section 7.02(a) and the Tax Indemnity, and the Individual
Sellers shall be severally (and not jointly) liable for such indemnification
obligations in proportion to each such Individual Seller's respective
Percentage Interest of the applicable Loss.

  


 

  

(d) Except in the case of intentional breach of a representation or fraud, the
aggregate liability of Sellers hereunder for all claims, including for the Tax
Indemnity and under this Article VII, shall not exceed the Purchase Price. No
Individual Seller shall be liable for any claim for indemnification under
Section 7.02 or for the Tax Indemnity in excess of such Individual Seller's
Percentage Interest in such claim, and with respect to any claims subject to
the Cap, each Individual Seller's aggregate liability for all such claims for
indemnification shall not exceed such Individual Seller's Percentage Interest
of the Cap. The maximum liability hereunder for any Individual Seller for the
Tax Indemnity shall not, when aggregated with all other indemnification
obligations of such Individual Seller hereunder, exceed the Purchase Price
actually received by such Individual Seller.

  


 

  

(e) The amount of any Loss subject to indemnification pursuant to Section
5.03(b) or Article VII shall be calculated net of any insurance proceeds and
any indemnity, contribution or other similar payment actually received by the
Indemnified Party (or the Company) in respect of any such Loss. The
Indemnified Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to recover under
insurance policies or indemnity, contribution or other similar agreements for
any Losses. The amount of any indemnity payment hereunder shall initially be
determined without regard to any such insurance proceeds or indemnity,
contribution or other similar payments and shall be subject to adjustment if
and when any such insurance proceeds indemnity, contribution or other similar
payments are actually received. If and to the extent that any insurance
proceeds or

  

    

indemnity, contribution or other similar payments are recovered by an
Indemnified Party with respect to any Losses for which it has already been
indemnified by an Indemnifying Party hereunder, such Indemnified Party shall
pay to the Indemnifying Party (or, in cases where the Sellers are the
Indemnifying Party, the Stockholder Representative, for the benefit of the
Sellers) within thirty (30) days of receiving such insurance proceeds or
payment, an amount equal to the excess of (i) the amount previously received
by the Indemnified Party under Section 5.03(b) or this Article VII with
respect to such claim plus the amount of the insurance proceeds and indemnity,
contribution or other similar payments received, over (ii) the amount of
Losses with respect to such claim which the Indemnified Party has become
entitled to receive under Section 5.03(b) or this Article VII; provided,
however, that if the Sellers were the Indemnifying Parties, the applicable
indemnification payment was made from the Escrow Account and the Escrow
Account remains in effect, then the Buyer Indemnified Party shall make such
payment to the Escrow Account.

  


 

  

(f) The amount of any Loss subject to indemnification pursuant to Section
5.03(b) or Article VII shall be calculated net of any Tax Benefit actually
realized by the Indemnified Party on account of such Loss. The amount of any
indemnity payment hereunder shall initially be determined without regard to
any such Tax Benefit, and shall be subject to adjustment if and when any such
Tax Benefit is actually realized. If and to the extent that any Tax Benefit is
realized by an Indemnified Party with respect to any Losses for which it has
already been indemnified by an Indemnifying Party hereunder, such Indemnified
Party shall pay to the Indemnifying Party (or, in cases where the Sellers are
the Indemnifying Party, the Stockholder Representative, for the benefit of the
Sellers) within 30 days of realizing such Tax Benefit, an amount equal to the
excess of (i) the amount previously received by the Indemnified Party under
Section 5.03(b) or this Article VII with respect to such claim plus the amount
of the Tax Benefit realized by the Indemnified Party, over (ii) the amount
previously received by the Indemnified Party under Section 5.03(b) or this
Article VII with respect to such claim; provided, however, that if the Sellers
were the Indemnifying Parties, the applicable indemnification payment was made
from the Escrow Account and the Escrow Account remains in effect, then the
Buyer Indemnified Party shall make such payment to the Escrow Account.

  


 

  

(g) No Seller shall have any liability with respect to a breach of any of the
Several Representations by any other Seller and Buyer agrees not to seek
recovery against a Seller with respect to a breach of the Several
Representations by another Seller.

  


 

  

(h) Notwithstanding anything contained elsewhere in this Agreement, the amount
of any Loss subject to indemnification under Section 7.02 shall be calculated
net of any amounts to the extent, but only to the extent, that such Loss was
included as a Current Liability in calculating the Company's Working Capital
and actually taken into account in determining the Final Adjustment Amount.

  


 

  

(i) The parties hereto agree that Buyer shall not have any rights to set-off
any Loss it may have against Sellers against any amount otherwise due to any
of Sellers.

  


 

  

(j) If an Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification under more than one
clause or subclause of this Agreement with respect to Losses, then such
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to only one indemnification or recovery
for such Losses to the extent it arises out of the

  

    

same set of circumstances and events; it being understood that this Section
7.04(j) is solely to preclude a duplicate recovery by Indemnified Party.

  


 

  

(k) Upon making any indemnity payment pursuant to this Agreement, as
applicable, the Indemnifying Party (or, in cases where the Sellers are the
Indemnifying Party, the Stockholder Representative, on behalf of the Sellers)
shall be subrogated to all rights of the Indemnified Party against any third
party in respect of the Losses to which the payment related. The Indemnifying
Party shall not, however, have the right to collect aggregate payments from
such third party or third parties in excess of the actual amount of the
indemnification payment previously paid with respect to such Losses. The
parties hereto will execute upon request, all instruments reasonably necessary
to evidence and perfect the above described subrogation rights.

  

  

Section 7.05 Indemnification Procedures.

  


 

  

(a) _Third-Party Claims_. If any Indemnified Party receives notice of the
assertion or commencement of any action, suit, claim or other legal proceeding
made or brought by any Person who is not a party to this Agreement or an
Affiliate of a party to this Agreement or a representative of the foregoing (a
"Third-Party Claim") against such Indemnified Party with respect to which the
Indemnifying Party may be obligated to provide indemnification under this
Agreement, the Indemnified Party shall give the Indemnifying Party prompt
written notice thereof. The failure to give such prompt written notice shall
not, however, relieve the Indemnifying Party of its indemnification
obligations, except and only to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is
materially disadvantaged by such failure or delay or forfeits material rights
or defenses by reason of such failure or delay. Such notice by the Indemnified
Party shall describe the Third-Party Claim in reasonable detail, and shall
indicate the estimated amount, if reasonably practicable, of the Loss that has
been or may be sustained by the Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Party
shall have the right to assume the defense of any Third-Party Claim at the
Indemnifying Party's expense and by the Indemnifying Party's own counsel,
which counsel must be reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, so
long as (i) the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party in writing
within twenty (20) days after the Indemnified Party has given notice of the
Third Party Claim that the Indemnifying Party will defend the Third Party
Claim, (ii) the Indemnifying Party provides the Indemnified Party with
evidence reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party that the Indemnifying
Party will have the financial resources to defend against the Third Party
Claim and fulfill its indemnification obligations hereunder, and (iii) the
Indemnifying Party conducts the defense of the Third Party Claim actively and
diligently. In the event that the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of
any Third-Party Claim, subject to Section 7.05(b), it shall have the right to
take such reasonable action as it deems necessary to avoid, dispute, defend,
appeal or make counterclaims pertaining to any such Third-Party Claim in the
name and on behalf of the Indemnified Party, and, the Indemnified Party shall
cooperate in good faith in such defense. The Indemnified Party shall have the
right, at its own cost and expense, to participate in the defense of any
Third-Party Claim with counsel selected by it subject to the Indemnifying
Party's right to control the defense thereof, provided that if in the opinion
of counsel to the Indemnified Party (A) there are legal defenses that are
available to the Indemnified Party that are different from or additional to
those that are available the Indemnifying Party or (B) there exists a conflict
of interest between the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party, the then
the Indemnifying Party shall be

  

    

responsible for paying the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel to the
Indemnified Party in each jurisdiction that the Indemnified Party determines
counsel is required. If the Indemnifying Party elects not to compromise or
defend such Third-Party Claim or if any of the conditions set forth in clauses
(i) through (iii) above is not satisfied or becomes unsatisfied, the
Indemnified Party may pay, compromise, defend or consent to the entry of any
judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to such Third-Party Claim
in any manner it may reasonably deem appropriate, subject to the right of the
Indemnifying Party to consent to a settlement in accordance with Section
7.05(c), and the Indemnifying Party will reimburse the Indemnified Party
promptly and periodically for the costs of defending against the Third Party
Claim (including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) (as long such costs
relate to a Loss subject to indemnification) and will indemnify the
Indemnified Party for any and all Losses based upon, arising from or relating
to such Third-Party Claim, in each case subject to the limitations on
indemnification contained in this Article VII. Sellers and Buyer shall
cooperate with each other in all reasonable respects in connection with the
defense of any Third-Party Claim, including making available (subject to the
provisions of Section 5.06) records relating to such Third-Party Claim and
furnishing, without expense (other than reimbursement of actual out-of-pocket
expenses) to the defending party, management employees of the non-defending
party as may be reasonably necessary for the preparation of the defense of
such Third-Party Claim.

  


 

  

(b) _Settlement of Third-Party Claims_. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement, the Indemnifying Party shall not enter into settlement of any
Third-Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), except as
provided in this Section 7.05(b). If a firm offer is made to settle a Third-
Party Claim solely for monetary consideration to be paid in full by the
Indemnifying Party and which does not create liability or any financial or
other obligation on the part of any Indemnified Party of any nature and which
provides, in customary form, for the unconditional release of each Indemnified
Party from all liabilities and obligations in connection with such Third-Party
Claim, and the Indemnifying Party desires to accept and agree to such offer,
the Indemnifying Party shall give written notice to that effect to the
Indemnified Party. If the Indemnified Party fails to consent to such firm
offer within twenty (20) days after its receipt of such notice, the
Indemnified Party may continue to contest or defend such Third-Party Claim and
in such event, the maximum liability of the Indemnifying Party as to such
Third-Party Claim shall not exceed the amount of such settlement offer. In
addition, the Indemnified Party shall not agree to any settlement of such
Third Party Claim without the written consent of the Indemnifying Party (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

  


 

  

(c) _Direct Claims_. Any claim by an Indemnified Party on account of a Loss
which does not result from a Third-Party Claim (a "Direct Claim") shall be
asserted in good faith by the Indemnified Party giving the Indemnifying Party
prompt written notice thereof. The failure to give such prompt written notice
shall not, however, relieve the Indemnifying Party of its indemnification
obligations, except and only to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is
materially disadvantaged by such failure or delay or forfeits material rights
or defenses by reason of such failure or delay. Such notice by the Indemnified
Party shall describe the Direct Claim in reasonable detail, and shall indicate
the estimated amount, if reasonably practicable, of the Loss that has been or
may be sustained by the Indemnified Party.

  

    

Section 7.06 Exclusive Remedies. Subject to Section 8.02 and Section 9.11, the
parties acknowledge and agree that following the Closing their sole and
exclusive remedy with respect to any and all claims (other than claims for
intentional breach of a representation or fraud) for any breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or obligation set forth herein
or otherwise relating to the subject matter of this Agreement, shall be
pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in Section 5.03(b) and
this Article VII. In furtherance of the foregoing, each party hereby waives,
to the fullest extent permitted under Law, any and all rights, claims and
causes of action (other than those for intentional breach or fraud) for any
breach of any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or obligation set
forth herein or otherwise relating to the subject matter of this Agreement it
may have against the other parties hereto and their Affiliates and each of
their respective Representatives arising under or based upon any Law, except
pursuant to Section 8.02, Section 9.11 or the indemnification provisions set
forth in Section 5.03(b) and this Article VII, or for intentional breach or
fraud. Nothing in this Section 7.06 shall limit the recourse of Sellers
pursuant to Section 8.02 or of any Person pursuant to Section 9.11, or limit
any Person's right to seek and obtain any equitable relief to which any Person
shall be entitled pursuant to Section 9.11 or to seek and obtain any remedy on
account of any intentional breach or fraud by any party.

  

  

Section 7.07 Effect of Investigation. The representations, warranties and
covenants of the Indemnifying Party, and the Indemnified Party's right to
indemnification with respect thereto, shall not be affected or deemed waived
by reason of any investigation made by or on behalf of the Indemnified Party
(including by any of its Representatives) or by reason of the fact that the
Indemnified Party or any of its Representatives knew or should have known that
any such representation or warranty is, was or might be inaccurate or by
reason of the Indemnified Party's waiver of any condition set forth in Section
6.02 or Section 6.03, as the case may be.

than Section 6.02(p)) shall not have been fulfilled by the Outside Date (other

Closing Date), unless such failure shall be due to

  

    

the failure of Buyer to perform or comply with any of the covenants,
agreements or conditions hereof to be performed or complied with by it prior
to Closing; or

  


 

  

(iii) the Company has failed to execute and deliver to the Escrow Agent the
instructions required by Section 2.03(f) within five (5) Business Days after

Buyer by the Outside Date; or

  


 

  

(ii) any of the conditions set forth in Section 6.01 or Section 6.03 shall not

conditions hereof to be performed or complied with by it prior to Closing; or

  


 

  

(iii) after 45 days from the date hereof, (A) each of the conditions set forth

of termination; and (E) Buyer shall not have consummated the Closing by 5:00
pm New York City time on the second Business Day following the date of Buyer's
receipt of such notice of termination; or

Section 8.02 Buyer Termination Fee.

  


 

  

(a) If (i) the Company or the Stockholder Representative terminate this
Agreement (A) pursuant to Section 8.01(c)(i), or (B) pursuant to Section
8.01(c)(ii) as a result of Buyer's failure to satisfy the conditions set forth
in Section 6.03 and the conditions to Buyer's obligations to consummate
Closing under Section 6.01 and Section 6.02 have been satisfied (other than
Section 6.02(p) and any such conditions which by their nature are to be
satisfied by the Closing Date), or (C) pursuant to Section 8.01(c)(iii) or
Section 8.01(c)(iv), in each case other than where such termination rights
arise from or relate to a Buyer Willful Breach or (ii) Buyer terminates this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(b)(v), the parties agree that the Company
shall have suffered a loss in value of an incalculable nature and amount,
unrecoverable in Law, and Buyer shall pay the Buyer Termination Fee to the
Company, it being understood that in no event shall Buyer be required to pay
the Buyer Termination Fee on more than one occasion. The Buyer Termination Fee
shall be payable by Buyer to the Company in immediately available funds by
wire transfer no later than five (5) Business Days after such termination. The
term "Buyer Termination Fee" shall mean an amount equal to $17,000,000.

  


 

  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Company's
right to terminate this Agreement and receive payment of the Buyer Termination
Fee pursuant to

  

    

Section 8.02(a) shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Company, Sellers,
Stockholder Representative and their respective Affiliates against Buyer or
any of its Affiliates or any of their respective stockholders, partners,
members, directors, officers, employees, advisors or Representatives or any of
the Financing Sources for any and all Losses that may be suffered based upon,
resulting from or arising out of any of the events or circumstances giving
rise to the Company's right to receive such Buyer Termination Fee, other than
any liability for Buyer Willful Breach. The payment of the Buyer Termination
Fee shall be considered liquidated damages for any breach by Buyer of this
Agreement giving rise to payment of the Buyer Termination Fee, and in the
event the Buyer Termination Fee is paid, Buyer shall have no further liability
for any breach by it of the representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements set forth in this Agreement except for Buyer Willful Breach, and
neither the Company nor Sellers (or the Stockholder Representative) shall seek
to recover any other money damages or seek any other remedy, other than with
respect to a Buyer Willful Breach. For the avoidance of doubt and
notwithstanding the foregoing, the payment of a Buyer Termination Fee shall
not limit damages, and shall not be considered liquidated damages, for any
Buyer Willful Breach of Section 5.04 or any other provision of this Agreement.
Each party acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Article VIII are
an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that,
without these agreements, the other parties would not enter into this
Agreement; accordingly, if Buyer fails to promptly to pay or cause to be paid
the Buyer Termination Fee pursuant to Section 8.02(a), and, in order to obtain
payment of the Buyer Termination Fee, the Company commences a suit that
results in a judgment for payment of the Buyer Termination Fee pursuant to
Section 8.02(a), Buyer shall pay to the Company its reasonable costs and
expenses (including attorneys' fees and expenses) in connection with such suit
and any appeal relating thereto, together with interest on the unpaid amount
of the Buyer Termination Fee due in accordance with Section 8.02(a) from the
date payment was due at eight percent (8%) per annum. The foregoing shall have
no effect on Sellers' or the Company's ability prior to termination of this
Agreement to require or request specific performance or any other remedy in
the event of a Buyer Willful Breach. For avoidance of doubt, Buyer shall have
no liability to the Company, the Sellers or the Stockholder Representative in
the event of any termination of this Agreement (i) by mutual agreement of the
Company and the Buyer pursuant to Section 8.01(a), (ii) by the Buyer pursuant
to Section 8.01(b)(iv), (iii) by the Buyer pursuant to Section 8.01(b)(ii) as
a result of a failure to fulfill any of the conditions set forth in Section
6.01; (iv) by the Company or the Stockholder Representative pursuant to
Section 8.01(c)(ii) as a result of a failure to fulfill any of the conditions
set forth in Section 6.01, or (v) by the Company or the Buyer pursuant to
Section 8.01(d).

  

  

Section 8.03 Effect of Termination. In the event of the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with this Article, this Agreement shall forthwith
become void and there shall be no liability on the part of any party hereto
except:

  


 

  

(a) as set forth in this Article VIII and Article IX hereof; and

  


 

  

(b) that, subject to the provisions of Section 8.02(b), termination of this
Agreement shall not (i) relieve or release any party to this Agreement of any
liability or damages (which the parties acknowledge and agree shall not be
limited to reimbursement of expenses or out-of-pocket costs, and may include
to the extent proven the benefit of the bargain lost by a party and/or such
party's stockholders (taking into consideration relevant matters, including
other

  

    

combination opportunities and the time value of money), which shall be deemed
in such event to be damages of such party) arising out of such party's breach
of any provision of this Agreement or (ii) impair the right of any party
hereto to compel specific performance by the other party or parties, as the
case may be, of such party's post-termination obligations under this
Agreement.

  


 

  

ARTICLE IX

  

MISCELLANEOUS

counsel, financial advisors and accountants, incurred in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party
incurring such costs and expenses, whether or not Closing shall have occurred;

other similar fees payable in connection with any filings or submissions under
the HSR Act, (ii) Buyer's expenses may, at the Buyer's election, be paid by
the Company in the event that Closing occurs, and (iii) any unpaid Company

Section 9.03 Interpretation. For purposes of this Agreement: (a) the words
"include," "includes" and "including" shall be deemed to be followed by the
words "without limitation"; (b) the word "or" is not exclusive; and (c) the
words "herein," "hereof," "hereby," "hereto" and "hereunder" refer to this
Agreement as a whole. Unless the context otherwise requires, references
herein: (x) to Articles, Sections, the Disclosure Letter and Exhibits mean the
Articles and Sections of, and the Disclosure Letter delivered with, and
Exhibits attached to, this Agreement; (y) to an agreement, instrument or other
document means such agreement, instrument or other document as amended,
supplemented and modified from time to time to the extent permitted by the
provisions thereof; and (z) to a statute means such statute as amended from
time to time and includes any successor legislation thereto and any
regulations promulgated thereunder. This Agreement shall be construed without
regard to any presumption or rule requiring construction or interpretation
against the party drafting an instrument or causing any

  

    

instrument to be drafted. The Disclosure Letter and Exhibits referred to
herein shall be construed with, and as an integral part of, this Agreement to
the same extent as if they were set forth verbatim herein.

  

  

Section 9.04 Headings. The headings in this Agreement are for reference only
and shall not affect the interpretation of this Agreement.

  

  

Section 9.05 Severability. If any term or provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, such invalidity,
illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other term or provision of
this Agreement or invalidate or render unenforceable such term or provision in
any other jurisdiction. Upon such determination that any term or other
provision is invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the parties hereto shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner
in order that the transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as
originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible.

  

  

Section 9.06 Entire Agreement. This Agreement, together with the Exhibits
hereto, the Disclosure Letter and all of the instruments of transfer and other
instruments and agreements referenced in or contemplated by this Agreement
executed and delivered or to be executed and delivered in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby, constitute the sole and entire agreement of
the parties to this Agreement with respect to the subject matter contained
herein and therein, and supersede all prior and contemporaneous
representations, warranties, understandings and agreements, both written and
oral, with respect to such subject matter.

  

  

Section 9.07 Successors and Assigns. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective
successors and permitted assigns. Neither party may assign its rights or
obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of the other parties,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; provided,
however, that notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer may, in its sole discretion
and without the consent of any other party, assign, in whole or in part, (a)
its rights under this Agreement for collateral security purposes to any lender
providing financing to Buyer, such permitted assign or any of their
Affiliates, and any such lender may exercise all of the rights and remedies of
such assignee hereunder and thereunder and (b) its rights under this Agreement
to any subsequent purchaser of Buyer or any of its divisions or any material
portion of its assets (whether such sale is structured as a sale of stock or
other equity interests, sale of assets, merger, recapitalization or
otherwise). No assignment shall relieve the assigning party of any of its
obligations hereunder.

  

  

Section 9.08 No Third-Party Beneficiaries. Except as provided in Section 5.05,
Section 9.17 and Article VII, this Agreement is for the sole benefit of the
parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns and
nothing herein, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any
other Person or entity any legal or equitable right, benefit or remedy of any
nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.

  

  

Section 9.09 Amendment and Modification; Waiver. This Agreement may only be
amended, modified or supplemented by an agreement in writing signed by Buyer,
the Company, the Stockholder Representative and Sellers having an aggregate
Percentage Interest in excess of 70%. No waiver by any party of any of the
provisions hereof shall be effective unless explicitly

  

    

set forth in writing and signed by the party so waiving, except that Sellers
having an aggregate Percentage Interest in excess of 70% may waive provisions
of this Agreement on behalf of all Sellers. No waiver by any party shall
operate or be construed as a waiver in respect of any failure, breach or
default not expressly identified by such written waiver, whether of a similar
or different character, and whether occurring before or after that waiver. No
failure to exercise, or delay in exercising, any right, remedy, power or
privilege arising from this Agreement shall operate or be construed as a
waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, remedy,
power or privilege hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or

(b) EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE PROVIDED IN Section 9.17, ANY LEGAL SUIT, ACTION OR
PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF, RELATING TO OR BASED UPON THIS AGREEMENT OR THE

EQUITY) MAY BE INSTITUTED IN THE COURT OF CHANCERY IN THE STATE OF DELAWARE
OR, IF THAT COURT DOES NOT HAVE JURISDICTION, IN THE FEDERAL COURTS OF THE

AND, THEREFORE, EACH SUCH PARTY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY
RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LEGAL ACTION ARISING

EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES

  

    

THAT (A) NO REPRESENTATIVE OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR
OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING
WAIVER IN THE EVENT OF A LEGAL ACTION, (B) SUCH PARTY HAS CONSIDERED THE
IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (C) SUCH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND
(D) SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER

Section 9.11 Specific Performance. Except as otherwise expressly provided
herein, all rights and remedies of each of the parties under this Agreement
will be cumulative, and the exercise of one or more rights or remedies will
not preclude the exercise of any other right or remedy available under this
Agreement, applicable Law or otherwise. Without limiting the foregoing, but
subject to the provisions of Section 8.02(b), the parties acknowledge that
irreparable damages would occur if any of the provisions of this Agreement
were not performed, or threatened not to be performed, in accordance with
their specific terms or were otherwise breached and that money damages or
other legal remedies would not be adequate for any such damages. It is
accordingly agreed that, except as otherwise expressly provided herein
(including in Section 8.02(b)), Buyer, the Stockholder Representative (after
Closing) or the Company (on behalf of Sellers before Closing) shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement
and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement.
Subject to the provisions of Section 8.02(b), it is explicitly agreed that (i)
solely in the case of a Buyer Willful Breach, the Company and Sellers (acting
through the Stockholder Representative) shall be entitled to specific
performance of Closing and Buyer's obligation to cause the transactions
contemplated hereby to be fully and timely funded and the other transactions
contemplated hereby and (ii) Buyer shall be entitled to specific performance
of Closing and Seller's obligations to sell the Shares and perform the other
obligations contemplated hereby. The parties hereto further agree that no
party shall be required to obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar
instrument in connection with or as a condition to obtaining any remedy
referenced in this Section 9.11 and the parties waive any right it may have to
require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or similar
instrument; provided, however, to the extent any such bond or similar
instrument is required by applicable Law or Governmental Order, the parties
expressly agree and intend that a bond or similar instrument in the amount of
$100 shall be sufficient and reasonable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no
event shall any party be entitled to specifically enforce or seek to
specifically enforce Buyer's obligation to pay the purchase price for the
Shares pursuant to Section 2.01 and 2.03 if the Debt Financing has not been
funded and will not be funded at the Closing; provided that nothing in this
section shall be interpreted to limit in any way Buyer's rights to
specifically enforce any other covenant contained in this Agreement.

  

  

Section 9.12 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts,
each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall be
deemed to be one and the same agreement. A signed copy of this Agreement
delivered by facsimile, e-mail or other means of electronic transmission shall
be deemed to have the same legal effect as delivery of an original signed copy
of this Agreement.

  

  

Section 9.13 Non-Recourse. This Agreement may only be enforced against, and
any claim, action, suit or other legal proceeding based upon, arising out of,
or related to this

  

    

Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement, may
only be brought against the Persons that are expressly named as parties hereto
and then only with respect to the specific obligations set forth herein with
respect to such party. No past, present or future director, officer, employee,
incorporator, manager, member, partner, stockholder, Affiliate, agent,
attorney or other representative of any party hereto or of any Affiliate of
any party hereto, or any of their successors or permitted assigns, shall have
any liability for any obligations or liabilities of any party hereto under
this Agreement or for any claim or action based on, in respect of or by reason
of the transactions contemplated hereby.

  

  

Section 9.14 Conflicts. Each of the parties hereto acknowledges and agrees, on
its own behalf and on behalf of its representatives and Affiliates, that the
Company is the client of Andrews Kurth LLP ("AK LLP") and that AK LLP has
jointly represented the Company and Sellers in connection with this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby. After Closing, it is possible that
AK LLP will represent one or more of Sellers, the Stockholder Representative
and/or their respective representatives and Affiliates (individually and
collectively, the "Seller Group") in connection with a variety of matters,
including matters adverse or potentially adverse to the interests of Buyer
and/or the Company. Each of the parties to this Agreement hereby agrees that
AK LLP (or any successor) may serve as counsel to all or a portion of the
Seller Group, in connection with any such matter arising after the date
hereof. Each of the parties hereto consents to such representation, and waives
any conflict of interest arising therefrom. Each of the parties hereto
acknowledges that such consent and waiver is voluntary, that it has been
carefully considered, and that the parties have consulted with counsel or have
been advised they should do so in connection herewith. Each of the parties
hereby irrevocably acknowledges and agrees that, solely for purposes of any
Action, indemnification claim, or dispute or procedure under this Agreement
following the Closing Date in which the Buyer or the Company are adverse to
any member of the Seller Group, all privileged communications between AK LLP,
on the one hand, and the Company (or any representative of the Company) or a
Seller, on the other hand, prior to the Closing, together with any privileged
communications between Christopher McRorie and the Company and/or members of
the Seller Group prior to Closing, in each case made for the purpose of
providing or obtaining legal advice in connection with the negotiation,
preparation, execution, delivery and performance under, or any dispute or
proceeding arising out of or relating to, this Agreement, any agreements
contemplated by this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, are privileged communications between such party and such counsel
and from and after the Closing do not pass to Buyer notwithstanding the
transactions contemplated hereby and instead remain with and are controlled by
the Seller Group (the "Privileged Communications"). Buyer and the Company,
together with any of their respective affiliates, subsidiaries, successors or
assigns, agree that no Person may use or rely on any of the Privileged
Communications, whether located in email accounts of the Company, or
otherwise, in any Action, indemnification claim, or dispute or procedure under
this Agreement following the Closing in which the Buyer or the Company are
adverse to any member of the Seller Group. Buyer and the Company will not
assert that Buyer (or the Company) has the right to waive the attorney-client
privilege with respect to any Privileged Communication in connection with any
Action, indemnification claim, or dispute or procedure under this Agreement
following the Closing in which the Buyer or the Company are adverse to any
member of the Seller Group. For avoidance of doubt, and notwithstanding the
foregoing, nothing herein shall preclude any Acquired Company or the Buyer
from using or relying on any Privileged Communication relating to any of the
Acquired Companies in

  

    

connection with any Action in which neither the Buyer nor any Acquired Company
are adverse to any member of the Seller Group.

  

  

Section 9.15 Stockholder Agreement Termination. Each of Sellers hereby agrees,
effective as of Closing, that the Stockholders Agreement of the Company, dated
as of April 20, 2007, as amended, shall terminate and cease to be effective
without any further action by Sellers. In furtherance of the foregoing, the
Company and Sellers hereby waive all consent rights, rights of first refusal
and other limitations on the sale of the Shares in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement that are currently contained in such stockholders agreement.
In the event that Closing shall not occur for any reason, the provision of
this Section 9.15 shall be void and such Stockholders Agreement shall continue
to be in full force and effect.

  

  

Section 9.16 Buyer Acknowledgement. Buyer specifically acknowledges and agrees
to the terms of Section 4.08 and that Seller and the Company have made no
representations or warranties of any kind relating to the Acquired Company,
including as to the prospects of the business, except as expressly set forth
in Article III and Buyer has not relied on any representations and warranties,
except for those expressly set forth in Article III.

  

  

Section 9.17 Debt Financing Party Arrangements. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in this Agreement, each of the parties hereto: (i)
agrees that it will not bring or support any Person, or permit any of its
Affiliates to bring or support any Person, in any action, suit, proceeding,
cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim of any kind or
description, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or
otherwise, against any Person that has committed or subsequently commits to
provide or otherwise enters into agreements in connection with providing debt
financing to Buyer or any of its Affiliates, or any of their respective
former, current and future Affiliates, equityholders, members, managers,
partners, controlling persons, officers, directors, employees, agents,
advisors, accountants, counsel and representatives involved in such debt
financing including without limitation the Debt Financing Sources, the Lead
Arranger and the Administrative Agent (collectively, the " _Financing Sources_
") in any way relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including, but not limited to, any dispute
arising out of or relating in any way to any debt financing commitment letter
and related fee letter including without limitation the Debt Commitment Letter
(together with the Summary of Terms attached thereto as Exhibit A and the fee
letter referred to therein) (each a " _Commitment Letter_ ") or the
performance thereof or the financings contemplated thereby, including without
limitation the Debt Financing and the Financing (collectively, the "
_Financings_ "), in any forum other than the federal and New York State courts
located in the Borough of Manhattan within the City of New York; (ii) agrees
that, except as specifically set forth in the Commitment Letter, all claims or
causes of action (whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort or
otherwise) against any of the Financing Sources in any way relating to the
Commitment Letter or the performance thereof or the Financings, shall be
exclusively governed by, and construed in accordance with, the internal laws
of the State of New York, without giving effect to principles or rules of
conflict of laws to the extent such principles or rules would require or
permit the application of laws of another jurisdiction; (iii) agrees that the
Financing Sources are beneficiaries of and may enforce any liability cap or
limitation on damages or remedies in this Agreement (including, without
limitation, Section 8.02 hereof) and (iv) HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY

  

    

JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION (WHETHER IN LAW OR IN EQUITY, WHETHER IN
CONTRACT OR IN TORT OR OTHERWISE) DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING IN ANY WAY TO THE COMMITMENT LETTER OR THE PERFORMANCE THEREOF OR THE
FINANCINGS AND ANY PROCEEDING INVOLVING THE FINANCING SOURCES UNDER THE
COMMITMENT LETTER. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, (a) the Acquired Companies, the Company, the Sellers, any
equityholders of the Sellers, the Stockholder Representative and their
respective subsidiaries, Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents,
partners, managers, members or stockholders shall not have any rights or
claims against any Financing Source in any way relating to this Agreement or
any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or in respect of any
oral representations made or alleged to have been made in connection herewith
or therewith, including any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to
the Commitment Letter or the performance thereof or the Financings, whether at
law or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise and (b) no Financing Source
shall have any liability (whether in contract, in tort or otherwise) to the
Acquired Companies, the Company, the Sellers, any equityholders of the
Sellers, the Stockholder Representative and their respective subsidiaries,
Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents, partners, managers,
members or stockholders for any obligations or liabilities of any party hereto
under this Agreement or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason
of, the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby or in respect of any oral
representations made or alleged to have been made in connection herewith or
therewith, including any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the
Commitment Letter or the performance thereof or the Financings, whether at law
or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, the Financing Sources and their
successors and assigns are intended third-party beneficiaries of, and shall be
entitled to the protections of this Section 9.17, and Sections 8.02, 9.08 and
9.10 to the same extent as if the Financing Sources and their successors and
assigns were parties to this Agreement. This Section 9.17, and Sections 8.02,
9.08 and 9.10 may not be amended, modified or supplemented, or any of their
provisions waived, without the written consent of the Financing Sources, which
consent may be granted or withheld in the sole discretion of the Financing
Sources.

(e) Buyer and the Company after Closing shall be entitled to rely exclusively
upon the communications of the Stockholder Representative, but only as it
relates to the foregoing, as the communications of Sellers. Neither Buyer nor
the Company (i) need be concerned with the authority of the Stockholder
Representative to act on behalf of all Sellers hereunder, or (ii) shall be
held liable or accountable in any manner for any act or omission of the
Stockholder Representative in such capacity.

  


 

  

(f) The grant of authority provided for in this Section 10.01 is coupled with

thereunder, (i) the Stockholder Representative shall not assume any, and shall
incur no, responsibility whatsoever to any Seller by reason of any error in
judgment or other act or omission performed or omitted hereunder or in
connection with this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, unless by the
Stockholder Representative's gross negligence or willful misconduct, and (ii)
the Stockholder Representative shall be entitled to rely on the advice of
counsel, public accountants or other independent experts experienced in the
matter at issue, and any error in judgment or other act or omission of the
Stockholder Representative pursuant to such advice shall in no event subject
the Stockholder Representative to liability to any Seller unless by the
Stockholder Representative's gross negligence or willful misconduct.

  


 

  

(c) Each Seller, severally, shall indemnify the Stockholder Representative up
to, but not exceeding, an amount equal to such Seller's pro rata portion of
the total amount, as determined in accordance with such Seller's Percentage
Interest and in no event exceeding such Seller's pro rata portion of the
Purchase Price, against all damages, liabilities, claims, obligations, costs
and expenses, including reasonable attorneys', accountants' and other experts'
fees and the amount of any judgment against it, of any nature whatsoever,
arising out of or in connection with any claim or in connection with any
appeal thereof, relating to the acts or omissions of the Stockholder
Representative hereunder, except for such damages, liabilities, claims,
obligations, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys', accountants'
and other experts' fees and the amount of any judgment against the Stockholder
Representative that arise from the Stockholder Representative's gross
negligence or willful misconduct, including the willful breach of this
