 **ARTICLE III**

 



 

 ** _EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES_**

 



 

Section 3.1 _Effect on Securities_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent, Acquisition
Sub or the holders of any securities of the Company or Acquisition Sub:

 



 

(a) _Cancellation or Conversion of Company Securities_. Each share of common
stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the " **Company Common
Stock** ") held by the Company as treasury stock or held, directly or
indirectly, by Parent or Acquisition Sub immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and
no consideration or payment shall be delivered in exchange therefor or in
respect thereof. Each share of Company Common Stock owned by wholly-owned
Subsidiaries of the Company shall remain outstanding and be converted into one
(1) newly and validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common
stock of the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

(b) _Conversion of Company Securities_. Except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any shares canceled or
converted pursuant to _Section 3.1(a)_ and any Dissenting Shares) shall be
converted into the right to receive $26.00 per share of Company Common Stock
in cash, without interest (the " **Merger Consideration** "). Each share of
Company Common Stock to be converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration as provided in this _Section 3.1(b)_ shall as of the Effective
Time no longer be outstanding and shall be automatically canceled and shall
cease to exist, and the holders of certificates (the " **Certificates** ") or
book-entry shares (" **Book-Entry Shares** ") which immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented such Company Common Stock shall cease to have any
rights with respect to such Company Common Stock other than the right to
receive, upon surrender of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in
accordance with _Section 3.2_ , the Merger Consideration, without interest
thereon.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) _Conversion of Acquisition Sub Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof,
each share of common stock, par value of $0.001 per share, of Acquisition Sub
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into and become one (1) fully paid share of common stock, par value
$0.001 per share, of the Surviving Corporation and along with any shares
converted pursuant to _Section 3.1(a)_ , constitute the only outstanding
shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

(d) _Adjustments_. Without limiting the other provisions of this Agreement, if
at any time during the period between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time, any change in the number of outstanding shares of Company
Common Stock shall occur as a result of a reclassification, recapitalization,
stock split (including a reverse stock split), or combination, exchange or
readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend or stock distribution with a
record date during such period, the Merger Consideration shall be equitably
adjusted to provide the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement
prior to such event. Nothing in this _Section 3.1(d)_ shall be construed to
permit any party to take any action that is otherwise prohibited or restricted
by any other provision of this Agreement.

 



 

Section 3.2 _Exchange of Certificates_.

 



 

(a) _Designation of Paying Agent; Deposit of Exchange Fund_. Prior to the
Closing, Parent shall enter into a customary paying agent agreement with a
nationally recognized financial institution designated by Parent and
reasonably acceptable to the Company (the " **Paying Agent** ") for the
payment of the Merger Consideration as provided in _Section 3.1(b)_. At or
prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited
with the Paying Agent, cash constituting an amount equal to the Total Common
Merger Consideration (the " **Aggregate Merger Consideration** " and such
Aggregate Merger Consideration as deposited with the Paying Agent, the "
**Exchange Fund** "). In the event the Exchange Fund shall at any time be
insufficient to make the payments contemplated by _Section 3.1(b)_ (and, if
applicable, _Section 3.5_ ), Parent shall promptly deposit, or cause to be
deposited, additional funds with the Paying Agent in an amount which is equal
to such deficiency. Parent shall cause the Exchange Fund to be (i) held for
the benefit of the holders of Company Common Stock and (ii) applied promptly
to making the payments pursuant to _Section 3.1(b)_. The Exchange Fund shall
not be used for any purpose other than to fund payments pursuant to _Section
3.1_ , except as expressly provided for in this Agreement.

 



 

(b) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the Effective Time and in
any event not later than the second Business Day thereafter, the Surviving
Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a
Certificate or Book-Entry Share (other than the Surviving Corporation, its
Subsidiaries and Parent) that immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (i) a letter of
transmittal, which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, shall
pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in
lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent and which shall be in
the form and have such other provisions as Parent and the Company may
reasonably specify and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration
into which the number of shares

 



      
 

 



 

of Company Common Stock previously represented by such Certificate or Book-
Entry Shares shall have been converted pursuant to this Agreement (which
instructions shall be in the form and have such other provisions as Parent and
the Company may reasonably specify).

 



 

(c) Upon surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or
Book-Entry Share for cancellation to the Paying Agent, together with a letter
of transmittal duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be required pursuant to
such instructions, the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration for each
share of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate or
Book-Entry Share within two (2) Business Days following the later to occur of
(i) the Effective Time or (ii) the Paying Agents receipt of such Certificate
(or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Share, together with a
letter of transmittal duly completed and validly executed in accordance with
the instructions thereto, and the Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu
thereof) or Book-Entry Share so surrendered shall be forthwith canceled. The
Paying Agent shall accept such Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu
thereof) or Book-Entry Shares upon compliance with such reasonable terms and
conditions as the Paying Agent may impose to effect an orderly exchange
thereof in accordance with normal exchange practices. No interest shall be
paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares on the Merger Consideration payable upon the surrender of the
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares.

 



 

(d) In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock that is
not registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment of the
appropriate amount of Merger Consideration may be made to a Person other than
the Person in whose name the Certificate or Book-Entry Share so surrendered is
registered, if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in
proper form for transfer (and accompanied by all documents reasonably required
by the Paying Agent) or such Book-Entry Share shall be properly transferred
and the Person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other Taxes
required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the registered holder
of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share or establish to the satisfaction of
Parent that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable.

 



 

(e) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which
remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
for one (1) year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent or its
designee, upon demand, and any such holders prior to the Merger who have not
theretofore complied with this _Article III_ shall thereafter look only to
Parent and the Surviving Corporation (subject to applicable abandoned
property, escheat or other similar Laws) as general creditor thereof for
payment of their claims for Merger Consideration in respect thereof. Parent or
the Surviving Corporation shall pay all charges and expenses, including those
of the Paying Agent, in connection with the exchange of Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares for the Merger Consideration.

 



 

(f) _No Liability_. None of Parent, Acquisition Sub, the Company, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person in
respect of any cash held in the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall not have been surrendered immediately
prior to the date on which any cash in respect of such Certificate or

 



      
 

 



 

Book-Entry Share would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
Governmental Authority, any such cash in respect of such Certificate or Book-
Entry Share shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the
property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto.

 



 

(g) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest any cash
included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent; _provided_ that (i) no
such investment shall relieve Parent or the Paying Agent from making the
payments required by this _Article III_ , and following any losses that render
the Exchange Fund insufficient to make the payments contemplated by _Section
3.1(b)_ , Parent shall promptly deposit, or cause to be deposited, additional
funds with the Paying Agent in the amount which is equal to such deficiency,
(ii) no such investment shall have maturities that could prevent or delay
payments to be made pursuant to this Agreement and (iii) such investments
shall be in short-term obligations of the United States of America with
maturities of no more than thirty (30) days or guaranteed by the United States
of America and backed by the full faith and credit of the United States of
America, or in commercial paper rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys
Investment Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively. Any
interest or income produced by such investments will be payable to Parent or
its designee as directed by Parent.

 



 

(h) _Withholding_. Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration and any
amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any former holder of
Company Common Stock or holder of Company Equity Awards such amounts as
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent are required to deduct
and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any
provision of applicable Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld
and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority by Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent.

 



 

Section 3.3 _Company Options, Company Restricted Stock, Other Company Awards;
Company ESPP; Performance Share Awards_.

 



 

(a) _Treatment of Company Options_. As of immediately prior to the Effective
Time, each vested and unvested Company Option that is outstanding shall become
vested and exercisable in full and to the extent not exercised as of the
Effective Time shall be canceled and shall entitle the holder thereof to
receive as soon as practicable following the Effective Time an amount in cash
(subject to any applicable withholding or other Taxes or other amounts
required by applicable Law to be withheld) equal to the product of (i) the
total number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option
and (ii) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration, over the exercise
price per share of Company Common Stock underlying such Company Option (the "
**Option Cash Payment** "). Following the Effective Time, any such canceled
Company Option shall no longer be exercisable for Company Common Stock and
shall only entitle the Company Option holder to the Option Cash Payment, which
shall be paid by the Surviving Corporation as of, or as promptly as reasonably
practicable following, the Effective Time.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) _Treatment of Company Restricted Stock_. Immediately prior to the
Effective Time, each then-outstanding share of unvested Company Restricted
Stock shall, contingent upon the Effective Time, vest and be treated in
accordance with _Section 3.1(b)_ (subject to any applicable withholding or
other Taxes required by applicable Law to be withheld), except that the
Surviving Corporation may, upon surrender of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share
for cancellation, pay, at or as promptly as reasonably practicable following
the Effective Time, the applicable Merger Consideration to the holder thereof
which shall relieve Parents obligation to deposit such amounts with the
Paying Agent.

 



 

(c) _Treatment of Other Company Awards_. As of the Effective Time, any vesting
or settlement conditions or restrictions applicable to each Other Company
Award (other than Performance Share Awards, which are the subject of _Section
3.3(e)_ ) outstanding immediately prior thereto shall lapse and the holder
shall receive an amount in cash (subject to any applicable withholding or
other Taxes required by applicable Law to be withheld) equal to the product of
(i) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Other
Company Award and (ii) the Merger Consideration (the " **Other Company Award
Payment** "). The Other Company Award Payment shall be paid by the Surviving
Corporation as of, or as promptly as reasonably practicable following, the
Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Other Company Award Payment
shall be paid at such other time or times following the Effective Time
consistent with the terms of the Other Company Award to the extent necessary
to avoid the imposition of additional income Tax under Section 409A of the
Code.

 



 

(d) _Treatment of Company ESPP_. No new offering period shall commence under
the Company ESPP following completion of the offering period in progress as of
the date of this Agreement under the Company ESPP (the date of such
completion, the " **Final Purchase Date** "). Shares of Company Common Stock
shall be issued to participants thereunder on the Final Purchase Date, such
that each then outstanding option under the Company ESPP shall be exercised
automatically on such Final Purchase Date. The Company shall terminate the
Company ESPP as of or prior to the Effective Time. The Company shall, after
the date hereof and prior to the Final Purchase Date, take all necessary
actions (including amending the Company ESPP if applicable (i) to avoid the
commencement of any new offering period thereunder at or after the date hereof
and prior to the earlier of the termination of this Agreement or the Effective
Time and (ii) to prevent new participants from joining the offering period in
progress as of the date of this Agreement.

 



 

(e) _Treatment of Performance Share Awards_. As of the Effective Time, each
Performance Share Award that is outstanding and vested immediately prior to
the Effective Time (after taking into account any acceleration of vesting or
lapse restrictions thereto provided for in the Company Benefit Plans or in any
award agreement by reason of the transactions contemplated hereby), shall
automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and the holder of such
Performance Share Award shall be entitled to receive an amount in cash equal
(subject to any applicable withholding or other Taxes required by applicable
Law to be withheld) to the product of (i) the total number of vested shares of
Company Common Stock subject to such Performance Share Award and (ii) the
Merger Consideration (the " **Performance Share Award Payment** "). The
Performance Share Award Payment shall be paid by the Surviving Corporation as
of, or as promptly as reasonably practicable following, the Effective Time;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Performance Share Award Payment shall be
paid at such other time

 



      
 

 



 

or times following the Effective Time consistent with the terms of the
Performance Share Award to the extent necessary to avoid the imposition of
additional income Tax under Section 409A of the Code. For the avoidance of
doubt, each Performance Share Award that is not vested immediately prior to
the Effective Time (after taking into account any acceleration of vesting or
lapse restrictions applicable thereto provided for in the Company Benefit
Plans or in any award agreement by reason of the transactions contemplated
hereby) shall be cancelled without consideration.

 



 

(f) _Required Approvals_. Prior to the Effective Time, the board of directors
of the Company shall adopt such resolutions as may be reasonably required to
effectuate the provisions of this _Section 3.3_.

 



 

Section 3.4 _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, then upon the making of an affidavit, in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to Parent, of that fact by the Person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent,
the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as Parent may
direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with
respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue in exchange for such
lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration to which the
holder thereof is entitled pursuant to this _Article III_.

 



 

Section 3.5 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
_Section 3.1(b)_ , to the extent that holders thereof are entitled to
appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL, shares of Company Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a
holder who has properly exercised and perfected his or her demand for
appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL (the " **Dissenting Shares**
"), shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration,
but the holders of such Dissenting Shares shall be entitled to receive such
consideration as shall be determined pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL;
_provided_ , _however_ , that if any such holder shall have failed to perfect
or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost his or her right to appraisal and
payment under the DGCL (whether occurring before, at or after the Effective
Time), such holders shares of Company Common Stock shall thereupon be deemed
to have been converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon, and such shares shall not
be deemed to be Dissenting Shares. Any payments required to be made with
respect to the Dissenting Shares shall be made by Parent (and not the Company
or Acquisition Sub) or, if the Exchange Fund is being administered by the
Paying Agent at such time, the Paying Agent, and the Aggregate Merger
Consideration (and, if applicable, the Exchange Fund) shall be reduced, on a
dollar for dollar basis, as if the holder of such Dissenting Shares had not
been a stockholder on the Closing Date. The Company shall give prompt notice
to Parent of any demands for appraisal of any shares of Company Common Stock,
withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the
DGCL received by the Company relating to appraisal demands, and Parent shall
have the right to direct, and otherwise participate in, all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to such demands. The Company shall not, without the
prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or
compromise or settle, or offer to compromise or settle, any such demands.
Following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will comply with any
notice requirements applicable to a merger without a meeting of stockholders
pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 3.6 _Transfers; No Further Ownership Rights_. After the Effective
Time, there shall be no registration of transfers on the stock transfer books
of the Company of shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
are presented to the Surviving Corporation for transfer following the
Effective Time, they shall be canceled against delivery of the applicable
Merger Consideration, as provided for in _Section 3.1(b)_ , for each share of
Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares, subject to applicable Law in the case of Dissenting Shares.

Parent Material Adverse Effect. Each of Parent and Acquisition Sub is duly
qualified or licensed to do business and in good standing in each jurisdiction
in which the property owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of the
business conducted by it makes such qualification or licensing necessary,
except where the failure to be so duly qualified or licensed and in good

of its Subsidiaries is a party, or (iv) result in the creation or imposition
of any Lien, other than any Permitted Lien or any Lien created in connection
with the Financing, upon any of the properties or assets of Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries, other than, in the case of clauses

 



      
 

 



 

(ii), (iii) and (iv), any such conflict, violation, breach, default,
termination, acceleration, cancellation or Lien that would not have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(d) No vote of, or consent by, the holders of any equity interests of Parent
is necessary to authorize the execution, delivery and performance by Parent of

case as would not have a Parent Material Adverse Effect, there is no suit,
action or proceeding pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened

omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to

Section 5.7 _Sufficient Funds; Financing_.

 



 

(a) Parent has delivered to the Company correct and complete copies of (1) the
executed commitment letter, dated October 23, 2014, by and among Parent, MIHI
LLC,

 



      
 

 



 

Macquarie Capital (USA) Inc., Sankaty Middle Market Opportunities Fund II-F,
L.P., Sankaty Middle Market Opportunities Fund II-A (Master), L.P., Sankaty
Middle Market Opportunities Fund II-F, L.P., MPS Investments S.À R.L. and
BCSSS Investments S.À R.L., together with any related fee letters (except that
the fee amounts and market flex provisions set forth therein shall have been
redacted) and related term sheets (including in each case all exhibits,
schedules, annexes and amendments thereto) (the " **Debt Commitment Letter**
"), pursuant to which, and subject to the terms and conditions thereof, the
lenders party thereto have committed to lend the amounts set forth therein to
Parent or Acquisition Sub for the purpose of funding the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (the " **Debt Financing** "), and (2) the
executed equity commitment letters, each dated as of the date hereof (the "
**Equity Commitment Letters** " and, together with the Debt Commitment Letter,
the " **Financing Commitments** ") from Guarantor, GCM SPV 14 Beta, LLC, GCM
Grosvenor Co-Investment Opportunities Fund, L.P., MIHI LLC, Sankaty Drawbridge
Opportunities, L.P., Sankaty Credit Opportunities V-B, L.P., Sankaty Credit
Opportunities V AIV II, L.P. (Master), Sankaty Credit Opportunities V AIV I,
L.P., Sankaty Middle Market Opportunities Fund II, L.P., Sankaty Middle Market
Opportunities Fund II-A (MASTER), L.P. and Sankaty Middle Market Opportunities
Fund II-F, L.P., pursuant to which the sources of equity financing thereunder
have committed to invest the amounts set forth therein (the " **Equity
Financing** " and, together with the Debt Financing, the " **Financing** ").
Each of the Equity Commitment Letters provides, and will continue to provide,
that the Company is a third party beneficiary thereof to the extent set forth
therein.

 



 

(b) As of the date hereof, all of the Financing Commitments are in full force
and effect and have not been withdrawn or terminated or otherwise amended,
supplemented or modified in any respect. Each of the Financing Commitments, in
the form so delivered, is a legal, valid, binding and enforceable obligation
of Parent and Acquisition Sub and, to the Knowledge of Parent, the other
parties thereto, except in each case as may be limited by (i) applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar Laws, now
or hereafter in effect, affecting creditors rights and remedies generally and
(ii) rules of law governing specific performance, injunctive relief or other
equitable remedies and by general principles of equity. As of the date hereof,
there are no side letters or other agreements, contracts or arrangements
(except for the Interim Investors Agreement, customary fee letters and
engagement letters) relating to the Financing or the Financing Commitments. As
of the date hereof, no event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse
of time or both, would constitute a default or breach on the part of Parent or
Acquisition Sub or, to the Knowledge of Parent, any other Person under any
term, or a failure of any condition to the obligations of the Financing
Sources in the Financing Commitments or otherwise result in any portion of the
Financing contemplated thereby to be unavailable. As of the date hereof,
assuming the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in _Section 7.1_ and
_Section 7.2_, neither Parent nor Acquisition Sub has reason to believe that
it will be unable to satisfy on a timely basis any term or condition of the
Financing Commitments required to be satisfied by it or that the full amount
of the Financing will not be funded at the Closing. Parent has fully paid any
and all commitment fees or other fees required by the Financing Commitments to
be paid on or before the date of this Agreement. Assuming the accuracy of the
representations and warranties contained in _Article IV_ in all material
respects, the aggregate proceeds from the Financing when funded in accordance
with the Financing Commitments, together with cash and cash equivalents held
by the Company and its Subsidiaries, are and will be sufficient to fund all of
the amounts required to be provided by Parent for the consummation of the
transactions contemplated

 



      
 

 



 

hereby, and are sufficient for the satisfaction of all of Parents and
Acquisition Subs obligations under this Agreement, including the payment of
the Aggregate Merger Consideration, any amounts payable pursuant to _Section
3.3_ and the payment of all associated costs and expenses of the Merger
(including any repayment or refinancing of indebtedness of Parent, Acquisition
Sub, the Company or the Surviving Corporation required in connection therewith
(including any amounts payable in respect to the redemption, conversion,
cancellation or retirement of any convertible notes or any other amounts owed
under the Convertible Notes Indenture)). There are no conditions precedent or
other contingencies directly or indirectly related to the funding or
investing, as applicable, of the full amount of the Financing, including in
any customary fee letters and engagement letters, other than as expressly set
forth in the Financing Commitments.

 



 

(c) Other than with respect to the Debt Financing Sources, neither Parent nor
Acquisition Sub is aware of any direct or indirect limitation or other
restriction on the ability of any potential sources of debt financing to
provide financing for other potential acquirers of the Company.

 



 

Section 5.8 _Guaranty_. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, the
Guarantor has delivered to the Company the Guaranty of the Guarantor, dated as
of the date hereof. The Guaranty has been duly executed and delivered by the
Guarantor, is in full force and effect and is a valid and binding obligation
of the Guarantor, enforceable against the Guarantor in accordance with its
terms (except that (i) such enforcement may be subject to applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar Laws, now
or hereafter in effect, affecting creditors rights and remedies generally and
(ii) the remedies of specific performance and injunctive and other forms of
equitable relief may be subject to equitable defenses and to the discretion of
the court before which any proceeding therefor may be brought) and no event
has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would
constitute a default on the part of the Guarantor under the Guaranty.

 



 

Section 5.9 _Capitalization of Acquisition Sub_. As of the date of this
Agreement, the authorized share capital of Acquisition Sub consists of 1,000
shares, par value $0.001 per share, 100 shares of which are validly issued and
outstanding. All of the issued and outstanding share capital of Acquisition
Sub is, and at the Effective Time will be, owned by Parent or a direct or
indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent. Acquisition Sub was formed solely
for the purpose of engaging in the transactions contemplated hereby, and it
has not conducted any business prior to the date hereof and has no, and prior
to the Effective Time will have no, assets, liabilities or obligations of any
nature other than those incident to its formation and pursuant to this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

Section 5.10 _Interest in Competitors_. Parent, Acquisition Sub and Guarantor
do not own any interest, nor do any of their respective Affiliates insofar as
such Affiliate-owned interests would be attributed to Parent, Acquisition Sub
or Guarantor under the HSR Act, in any entity or Person that derives revenues
from products, services or lines of business within the Companys products,
services or lines of business.

 



 

Section 5.11 _Investment Intention_. Parent is acquiring through the Merger
the shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation for its own account,
for investment purposes only and

 



      
 

 



 

not with a view to the distribution (as such term is used in Section 2(11) of
the Securities Act) thereof. Parent understands that the shares of capital
stock of the Surviving Corporation have not been registered under the
Securities Act or any Blue Sky Laws and cannot be sold unless subsequently
registered under the Securities Act, any applicable Blue Sky Laws or pursuant
to an exemption from any such registration.

 



 

Section 5.12 _Brokers_. Other than Union Square Advisors, LLC, Macquarie
Capital (USA) Inc. and Evercore Partners Inc., whose fees and expenses shall
be borne solely by Parent, no investment banker, broker or finder is entitled
to any investment banking, brokerage, finders or similar fee or commission in
connection with the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of Parent,
Acquisition Sub, the Guarantor or any of their respective Affiliates.

 



 

Section 5.13 _Solvency_. None of Parent, Acquisition Sub and the Guarantor is
entering into the transactions contemplated by this Agreement with the actual
intent to hinder, delay or defraud either present or future creditors of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Each of Parent and Acquisition Sub is
Solvent as of the date of this Agreement, and each of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation will, after giving effect to all of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, including the Financing, any Alternative Financing and the
payment of the Aggregate Merger Consideration, any amounts payable pursuant to
_Section 3.3_, the payment of all other amounts required to be paid in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the payment of all related fees and expenses, and assuming
satisfaction of the conditions to Parents obligations to consummate the
Merger, be Solvent at and immediately after the Effective Time. As used in
this _Section 5.13_, the term " **Solvent** " means, with respect to a
particular date, that on such date, (a) the sum of the assets, at a fair
valuation, of Parent and Acquisition Sub and, after the Merger, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries will exceed their debts, (b) each
of Parent and Acquisition Sub and, after the Merger, Parent and the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries have not incurred debts beyond its ability to
pay such debts as such debts mature and (c) each of Parent and Acquisition Sub
and, after the Merger, Parent and the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries has sufficient capital and liquidity with which to conduct its
business. For purposes of this _Section 5.13_, " **debt** " means any
liability on a claim, and " **claim** " means any (a) right to payment,
whether or not such a right is reduced to judgment, liquidated, unliquidated,
fixed, contingent, matured, unmatured, disputed, undisputed, legal, equitable,
secured or unsecured, and (b) any right to an equitable remedy for breach of

Section 6.2 _Preparation of the Proxy Statement; Stockholders  Meeting_.

 



 

(a) The Company shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable following the
date of this Agreement (with the Company using reasonable efforts to do so
within twenty-five (25) Business Days following the date of this Agreement),
prepare and shall cause to be filed with the SEC in preliminary form the Proxy
Statement. The Company shall promptly notify Parent and Acquisition Sub upon
the receipt of any comments from the SEC or the staff of the SEC or any
request from the SEC or the staff of the SEC for amendments or supplements to
the Proxy Statement, and shall promptly provide Parent and Acquisition Sub
with copies of all correspondence between the Company and its Representatives,
on the one hand, and the SEC or the staff of the SEC, on the other hand. The
Company shall use reasonable best efforts (with the assistance of, and after
consultation with, Parent as provided by this _Section 6.2(a)_) to (i)
respond as promptly as reasonably practicable to any comments of the SEC or
the staff of the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement, including filing any
amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement as may be required, (ii) have
the Proxy Statement cleared by the staff of the SEC as soon as reasonably
practicable after such filing and (iii) cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed
to the Companys stockholders as promptly as practicable thereafter;
_provided_ , that notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
the Company shall not be required to call, give notice of or convene the
Stockholders Meeting (as described in _Section 6.2(c)_) or mail the Proxy
Statement, in each case prior to the end of the Go-Shop Period. Prior to
filing or mailing the Proxy Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto)
or responding to any comments of the SEC (or the staff of the SEC) with
respect thereto, the Company shall provide Parent a reasonable opportunity to
review and to propose comments on such document or response (and the Company
shall give good faith consideration to including any such reasonable

 



      
 

 



 

comments in the Proxy Statement (or any supplement or amendment thereto) or
response letter) to the extent permitted by Law.

 



 

(b) Parent shall provide to the Company all information concerning Parent and
Acquisition Sub as may be reasonably requested by the Company in connection
with the Proxy Statement and shall otherwise assist and cooperate with the
Company in the preparation of the Proxy Statement and resolution of comments
of the SEC or its staff related thereto. Parent will cause the information
relating to Parent or Acquisition Sub supplied by it for inclusion in the
Proxy Statement, at the time of the mailing of the Proxy Statement or any
amendments or supplements thereto, and at the time of the Stockholders
Meeting, not to contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading.

 



 

(c) In accordance with the Companys Amended and Restated Certificate of
Incorporation (as amended) and Amended and Restated Bylaws, the Company shall,
as promptly as practicable following the clearance of the Proxy Statement by
the SEC, (i) establish a record date for and give notice of a meeting of its
stockholders, for the purpose of voting upon the adoption of this Agreement
and holding the Company Stockholder Advisory Vote (the " **Stockholders 
Meeting**") and (ii) duly call, convene and hold the Stockholders Meeting;
_provided_ that the Company may postpone or adjourn the Stockholders Meeting
only (1) with the written consent of Parent and Acquisition Sub (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), (2) for the
absence of a quorum, (3) to allow additional solicitation of votes in order to
obtain the Requisite Stockholder Approval or (4) as required by applicable
Law. Once the Company has established the record date for the Stockholders
Meeting, the Company shall not change such record date or establish a
different record date without the prior written consent of Parent (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), unless
required to do so by applicable Law. In the event that the date of the
Stockholders Meeting as originally called is for any reason adjourned,
postponed or otherwise delayed, the Company agrees that unless Parent shall
have otherwise approved in writing (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), it shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to implement such adjournment, postponement or other delay in such a
way that the Company does not establish a new record date for the
Stockholders Meeting, as so adjourned, postponed or delayed except for such
new record date as required by applicable Law. If at any time prior to the
Effective Time any event or circumstance relating to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or its or their respective officers or directors should be
discovered by the Company which, pursuant to the Securities Act or Exchange
Act, should be set forth in an amendment or a supplement to the Proxy
Statement, the Company shall promptly inform Parent. Each of Parent,
Acquisition Sub and the Company agree to promptly correct any information
provided by it for use in the Proxy Statement which shall have become false or
misleading. Each of the Company and Parent shall cause all documents that such
party is responsible for filing with the SEC in connection with the Merger to
comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable requirements of
the Exchange Act and, as applicable, not to contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) Subject to the ability of the board of directors of the Company to make an
Adverse Recommendation Change in accordance with _Section 6.5_, the board of
directors of the Company shall make the Company Recommendation with respect to
the adoption of this Agreement and the approval of the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Merger, shall include such recommendation
in the Proxy Statement and use its commercially reasonable efforts to solicit
proxies in favor of the Requisite Stockholder Approval. Parent and Acquisition
Sub shall vote all shares of Company Common Stock held by them in favor of the
adoption of this Agreement. The Company shall, upon the reasonable request of
Parent, use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the applicable proxy
solicitor of the Company to advise Parent on a daily basis on each of the last
ten (10) Business Days prior to the date of the Stockholders Meeting, as to
the aggregate tally of the proxies received by the Company with respect to the
Requisite Stockholder Approval. Without the prior written consent of Parent
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed),
approval of this Agreement, holding the Company Stockholder Advisory Vote and
adjournment shall be the only matters (other than procedural matters) which
the Company shall propose to be acted on by the holders of Company Common
Stock at the Stockholders Meeting.

 



 

Section 6.3 _Appropriate Action; Consents; Filings_.

 



 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement (including the
limitations set forth in _Section 6.5_), the parties hereto will use their
respective reasonable best efforts to consummate and make effective the
transactions contemplated hereby and to cause the conditions to the Merger set
forth in _Article VII_ to be satisfied, including using reasonable best
efforts to accomplish the following: (i) the obtaining of all necessary
actions or non-actions, consents and approvals from Governmental Authorities
or other Persons necessary in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger, and the
making of all necessary registrations and filings (including filings with
Governmental Authorities, if any) and the taking of all reasonable steps as
may be necessary to obtain an approval from, or to avoid an action or
proceeding by, any Governmental Authority or other Persons necessary in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the Merger, (ii) the obtaining of all other necessary
consents, approvals or waivers from Third Parties, (iii) the defending of any
lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative,
challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby (" **Merger Litigation** "), including the Merger,
performed or consummated by such party in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, including seeking to have any stay or temporary restraining order
entered by any court or other Governmental Authority vacated or reversed and
(iv) the execution and delivery of any additional instruments reasonably
necessary to consummate the Merger and any other transactions to be performed
or consummated by such party in accordance with the terms of this Agreement
and to carry out fully the purposes of this Agreement. Each of the parties
hereto shall promptly (and in no event later than ten (10) Business Days
following the date that this Agreement is executed) make and not withdraw
(without the other partys consent) its respective filings under the HSR Act,
and make, as soon as reasonably practicable after the date hereof, any other
applications and filings as reasonably determined by the Company and Parent
under other applicable Antitrust Laws with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable, but in no event later than as
required by Law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, obtaining any Third Party
consents, approvals or waivers pursuant to _Section _

 



      
 

 



 

 _6.3(a)(ii)_ above shall not be considered a condition to the obligations of
Parent and Acquisition Sub to consummate the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby.

 



 

(b) Parent and Acquisition Sub agree to take (and to cause their Affiliates to
take) promptly any and all steps necessary to avoid or eliminate each and
every impediment and obtain all consents under any Antitrust Laws that may be
required by any foreign or U.S. federal, state or local Governmental
Authority, in each case with competent jurisdiction, so as to enable the
parties to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as
promptly as practicable, including committing to or effecting, by consent
decree, hold separate orders, trust, or otherwise, the sale or disposition of
such assets or businesses as are required to be divested in order to avoid the
entry of, or to effect the dissolution of or vacate or lift, any Order, that
would otherwise have the effect of preventing or materially delaying the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Further, and
for the avoidance of doubt, Parent will take any and all actions necessary in
order to ensure that (x) no requirement for any non-action by or consent or
approval of the Antitrust Division or other foreign or U.S. Governmental
Authority with respect to any Antitrust Laws, (y) no decree, judgment,
injunction, temporary restraining order or any other Order in any suit or
proceeding with respect to any Antitrust Laws, and (z) no other matter
relating to any Antitrust Laws would preclude consummation of the Merger by
the Termination Date.

 



 

(c) In connection with and without limiting the efforts referenced in this
_Section 6.3_, each of the parties hereto will furnish to the other such
necessary information and reasonable assistance as the other may reasonably
request in connection with the preparation of any required governmental
filings or submissions and will cooperate in responding to any investigation
or other inquiry from a Governmental Authority or in connection with any
proceeding initiated by a private party, including immediately informing the
other party of such inquiry, consulting in advance before making any
presentations or submissions to a Governmental Authority, or in connection
with any proceeding initiated by a private party, to any other Person, and
supplying each other with copies of all material correspondence, filings or
communications between either party and any Governmental Authority, or in
connection with any proceeding initiated by a private party, between either
party and any other Person with respect to this Agreement. In addition, each
of the parties hereto will give reasonable notice to and consult with the
other in advance of any meeting or conference with any Governmental Authority,
or in connection with any proceeding by a private party, with any other
Person, and to the extent permitted by the Governmental Authority or other
Person, give the other the opportunity to attend and participate in such
meeting or conference. Without limiting the foregoing, in the event that any
Merger Litigation is brought against the Company and/or the members of the
board of directors of the Company prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall promptly notify Parent and keep Parent reasonably informed with respect
to the status thereof. The Company shall reasonably consult with Parent with
respect to the defense or settlement of any such Merger Litigation. Neither
the Company nor any Subsidiary or Representative of the Company shall
compromise, settle, come to an arrangement regarding or agree to compromise,
settle or come to an arrangement regarding any such Merger Litigation or
consent to the same unless Parent shall have consented in writing (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 



      
 

 



 

Section 6.4 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_. Upon reasonable notice,
the Company shall (and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to) afford to
authorized employees, officers, directors, attorneys, accountants, financial
advisors, agents and other representatives (" **Representatives** ") of Parent
reasonable access, in a manner not disruptive in any material respect to the
operations of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries, during normal
business hours and upon reasonable notice throughout the period prior to the
Effective Time (or until the earlier termination of this Agreement), to the
properties, Contracts, books and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries
and, during such period, shall (and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to)
furnish promptly to such Representatives (A) all information concerning the
business, properties and personnel of the Company and its Subsidiaries as may
reasonably be requested and (B) to the extent available, for the period
beginning after the date of this Agreement and ending at the Effective Time,
as soon as practicable after the end of each month, and in any event within
thirty (30) days thereafter, a copy of the monthly consolidated financial
statements of the Company, including statements of financial condition,
results of operations and statements of cash flow; _provided_ _,_ _however_ ,
that nothing herein shall require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
disclose any information to Parent or Acquisition Sub if such disclosure
would, in the reasonable judgment of the Company, (i) violate applicable Law
or the provisions of any agreement to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party or (ii) jeopardize any attorney-client or other legal
privilege; _provided_ , _further_ , that, with respect to the foregoing clause
(i), the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to seek to obtain
any Third Partys consent to the disclosure of such information and implement
appropriate procedures to enable the disclosure of such information (but the
Company shall not be required to pay any amounts or fees in pursuit thereof);
_provided_ , _further_ , that nothing herein shall authorize Parent or its
Representatives to undertake any environmental testing involving sampling of
soil, groundwater, or similar invasive techniques at any of the Companys (or
its Subsidiaries) properties, without the prior written consent of the
Company, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed (provided
that, with respect to the Leased Real Property, any denial, delay, failure to
respond or demand for indemnification by the applicable landlord shall not be
deemed to be an unreasonable withholding or delay on the part of the Company).
Without limiting the foregoing, in the event that the Company does not
disclose information in reliance on clause (i) or (ii) of the preceding
sentence, it shall provide notice to Parent that it is withholding such
information and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to communicate,
to the extent feasible, the applicable information in a way that would not
waive such privilege or violate such Law or agreement. No investigation or
access permitted pursuant to this _Section 6.4_ shall affect or be deemed to
modify any representation or warranty made by the Company hereunder. Parent
agrees that it will not, and will cause its Representatives not to, use any
information obtained pursuant to this _Section 6.4_ for any competitive or
other purpose unrelated to the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. The Confidentiality Agreement shall apply with respect to
information furnished by the Company, its Subsidiaries and the Companys
officers, employees and other Representatives hereunder. The Company hereby
consents to include the Financing Sources and other potential financing
sources as permitted "Representatives" under the Confidentiality Agreement;
provided, that (i) Parent only discloses "Information" (as such term is
defined in the Confidentiality Agreement) to the Financing Sources or such
other financing sources for the purpose of obtaining equity or debt financing
in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and (ii) for the
avoidance of

 



      
 

 



 

doubt, the first sentence of _Section 6.11(c)_ shall apply with respect to
such Financing Sources or other potential financing sources.

 



 

Section 6.5 _Go-Shop; Non-Solicitation; Competing Proposals_.

 



 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, during the
period commencing on the date of this Agreement and ending at 11:59 p.m.

this Agreement (the " **Go-Shop Period** "), the Company and its
Representatives and Subsidiaries shall be permitted to, directly or
indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate, encourage and facilitate (publicly or
otherwise) any inquiry, discussion, offer, proposal or request that could
constitute, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, a Competing Proposal,
(ii) grant a limited waiver under any "standstill" or similar obligation of
any Third Party with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
allow such Third Party to submit a Competing Proposal solely during the Go-
Shop Period in compliance with this _Section 6.5_ and (iii) engage in or
enter into, continue or otherwise participate in discussions and negotiations
with, and furnish non-public information relating to the Company and its
Subsidiaries and afford access to the books and records of the Company and its
Subsidiaries to any Third Party (and its Representatives, Affiliates and
prospective debt and equity financing sources) in connection with a Competing
Proposal or any inquiry, discussion, offer, proposal or request that could
reasonably be expected to lead to a Competing Proposal, or otherwise cooperate
with or assist or participate in, or facilitate any such inquiries, proposals,
discussions or negotiations or any effort or attempt to make any Competing
Proposal; _provided_ , that, prior to furnishing such information or affording
such access, the Company has entered into a confidentiality agreement with
such Person containing confidentiality terms that are not materially less
favorable in the aggregate to the Company than those contained in the
Confidentiality Agreement (an " **Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement** ");
_provided_ , _further_ , that the Company shall (subject to the terms of any
confidentiality agreement existing prior to the date hereof) promptly provide
or make available to Parent and its Representatives any material non-public
information concerning the Company or its Subsidiaries that the Company
provides to any Third Party given such access that was not previously made
available to Parent or its Representatives.

 



 

(b) From and after the expiration of the Go-Shop Period (and subject to
_Section 6.5(e)_): (i) the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective
officers and directors shall, and the Company shall instruct and use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cause its Representatives to, immediately
cease and cause to be terminated any existing solicitation of, or discussions
or negotiations with, any Third Party (other than Excluded Parties for so long
as such Persons or groups are Excluded Parties) relating to any Competing
Proposal or any inquiry, discussion, offer or request that could reasonably be
expected to lead to a Competing Proposal and (ii) the Company shall (A) to the
extent permitted by the applicable confidentiality agreement, request that
each Third Party (other than any Excluded Party for so long as such Person or
group is an Excluded Party) that has previously executed a confidentiality
agreement in connection with its consideration of a Competing Proposal
promptly return to the Company or destroy any non-public information
previously furnished or made available to such Third Party or any of its
Representatives by or on behalf of the Company or its Representatives in
accordance with the terms of such confidentiality agreement and (B)
immediately terminate access to any Third Party (other than any Excluded Party
for so long as such Person or group is

 



      
 

 



 

an Excluded Party and other than the Companys Representatives) to any
electronic data room maintained by the Company with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

(c) From the tenth day following the date of this Agreement through the
expiration of the Go-Shop Period, the Company will provide a written report to
Parent every ten (10) Business Days setting forth (1) the total number of
parties contacted to date during the Go-Shop Period pursuant to _Section
6.5(a)_, (2) the number of parties that have affirmatively declined to receive
information or enter into discussions regarding a Competing Proposal, (3) the
number of parties that have affirmatively expressed interest in receiving
information or entering into discussions regarding a Competing Proposal and
(4) the number of parties that have executed an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement. As promptly as reasonably practicable, and in any event within two
(2) Business Days, following the expiration of the Go-Shop Period, the Company
will provide Parent with (A) a written list identifying each Excluded Party
(to the extent not prohibited by any applicable confidentiality agreement in
place prior to the date hereof) and (B) the material terms and conditions of
the pending Competing Proposal made by such Excluded Party (and, if available,
a copy of the written offer or proposal submitted therewith). In addition,
from and after the end of the Go-Shop Period until the Effective Time (or, if
earlier, the valid termination of this Agreement), the Company shall, as
promptly as reasonably practicable, and in any event within forty-eight (48)
hours of receipt by the Company or any of its Representatives of any Competing
Proposal or any inquiry that could reasonably be expected to lead to a
Competing Proposal, deliver to Parent a written notice setting forth: (i) the
identity of the Third Party making such Competing Proposal or inquiry (to the
extent not prohibited by any applicable confidentiality agreement in place
prior to the date hereof) and (ii) if applicable, the material terms and
conditions of any such Competing Proposal (and, if available, a copy of the
written offer or proposal submitted therewith). Following the end of the Go-
Shop Period until the Effective Time (or, if earlier, the valid termination of
this Agreement), the Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed of any
material amendment or modification of any such Competing Proposal (including
any Competing Proposal received during the Go-Shop Period) on a prompt basis,
and in any event within forty-eight (48) hours thereafter.

 



 

(d) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement (including _Section
6.5(e)_), from and after the expiration of the Go-Shop Period until the
Effective Time or, if earlier, the termination of this Agreement in accordance
with its terms, the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective officers
and directors shall not, and the Company shall instruct and use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cause its Representatives not to, (i)
initiate, solicit or knowingly encourage any inquiries or the making of any
offer or proposal that could reasonably be expected to lead to a Competing
Proposal, (ii) engage in, enter into, continue or otherwise participate in any
negotiations or substantive discussions with (it being understood that the
Company may inform Persons of the provisions contained in this _Section
6.5_), or furnish any material nonpublic information to, any Third Party
relating to a Competing Proposal or any inquiry or proposal that could
reasonably be expected to lead to a Competing Proposal or (iii) otherwise
knowingly facilitate any such inquiries, proposals, discussions or
negotiations or any effort or attempt by any Person to make an Competing
Proposal, or publicly propose to do any of the foregoing.

 



      
 

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, at any time
after the expiration of the Go-Shop Period and prior to the date that the
Requisite Stockholder Approval is obtained at the Stockholders Meeting, in
the event that the Company (or its Representatives on the Companys behalf)
receives a written Competing Proposal (that did not result from a breach of
this _Section 6.5_) from any Third Party, (i) the Company and its
Representatives may contact such Third Party to clarify the terms and
conditions thereof (without the board of directors of the Company being
required to make the determination in clause (ii) of this _Section 6.5(e)_)
and (ii) the Company and its board of directors and its Representatives may
engage in negotiations or substantive discussions with, or furnish any
information and other access to, any Third Party making such Competing
Proposal and its Representatives, Affiliates and prospective debt and equity
financing sources if, and only to the extent that prior to taking any action
described in clause (ii) above, the Companys board of directors determines in
good faith (after consultation with its financial advisors and legal counsel)
that (A) the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the
directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law and (B) such Competing
Proposal either constitutes a Superior Proposal or could reasonably be
expected to lead to a Superior Proposal; _provided_ , that, (x) prior to
furnishing any material non-public information concerning the Company and its
Subsidiaries, the Company receives from such Person an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement (it being understood that, if such Person is already
subject to a confidentiality agreement, in lieu of entering into an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement, the Company shall amend the terms of such existing
agreement such that it is not materially less favorable in the aggregate to
the Company than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement) and (y) the
Company shall (subject to the terms of any confidentiality agreement existing
prior to the date hereof) promptly provide or make available to Parent and its
Representatives any material non-public information concerning the Company or
its Subsidiaries that the Company provides to any Third Party given such
access that was not previously made available to Parent or its
Representatives. For the avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding the end of the
Go-Shop Period, the Company may continue to engage in the activities described
in _Section 6.5(a)_ with respect to, and the restrictions in _Section
6.5(b)_ and _Section 6.5(d)_ shall not apply to, any Excluded Party (for so
long as such Person or group of Persons is an Excluded Party).

 



 

(f) Except as set forth in this _Section 6.5(f)_ and _Section 6.5(g)_, the
board of directors of the Company (and each committee thereof) shall not (i)
(A) withdraw, withhold, qualify or modify (or propose publicly to withdraw,
withhold, qualify or modify), in a manner adverse to Parent or Acquisition
Sub, the Company Recommendation, (B) authorize, recommend, adopt, approve or
otherwise declare advisable, or propose publicly to recommend, adopt, approve
or otherwise declare advisable, any Competing Proposal or (C) fail to include
the Company Recommendation in the Proxy Statement (any action described in
this clause (i) being referred to as a " **Adverse Recommendation Change** ")
or (ii) authorize, adopt, approve, recommend or otherwise declare advisable,
or allow the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to execute or enter into, any
letter of intent, memorandum of understanding or definitive merger or similar
agreement with respect to any Competing Proposal (other than an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement) (an " **Alternative Acquisition Agreement** ").
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, but following the
Companys compliance with _Section 6.5(g)_, at any time prior to the receipt
of the Requisite Stockholder Approval, the board of directors of the Company
may (1) make an Adverse Recommendation Change of the type described in clause
(i)(A) or (i)(C) of the previous sentence in connection with an event, fact,

 



      
 

 



 

development or occurrence that affects the business, assets or operations of
the Company that is unknown to the board of directors of the Company as of the
date of this Agreement and thereafter becomes known to the board of directors
of the Company (an " **Intervening Event** ") if the board of directors of the
Company determines in good faith (after consultation with its legal counsel)
that the failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be
inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law or (2)
make an Adverse Recommendation Change or cause the Company to enter into an
Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to a Competing Proposal, if,
and only to the extent that, the board of directors of the Company determines
in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisors and legal
counsel) that (x) such Competing Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and
(y) the failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be
inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law;
_provided_ , that the Company shall be permitted to enter into an Alternative
Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal only if the
Company concurrently terminates this Agreement in accordance with _Section
8.1(c)(ii)_ and pays to Parent or Parents designee(s) the fee due under
_Section 8.3(a)_.

 



 

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no Adverse
Recommendation Change may be made and no termination of this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 8.1(c)(ii)_ may be effected, in each case until after
the third (3rd) Business Day following Parents receipt of written notice from
the Company advising Parent that the board of directors of the Company intends
to make an Adverse Recommendation Change (a " **Notice of Adverse
Recommendation** ") or terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section
8.1(c)(ii)_ (a " **Notice of Superior Proposal** ") and specifying the reasons
therefor, including, if the basis of the proposed action by the Companys
board of directors is the existence of a Superior Proposal, the identity of
the Person making the Superior Proposal (to the extent permitted by any
applicable confidentiality agreement in place prior to the date hereof) and a
copy of the relevant proposed transaction document(s) related to the Superior
Proposal. In determining whether to make an Adverse Recommendation Change or
in determining whether a Competing Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal,
the board of directors of the Company shall, in good faith, take into account
any revisions to the terms of this Agreement, the Financing Commitments and
the Guaranty proposed in writing by Parent in response to a Notice of Adverse
Recommendation, a Notice of Superior Proposal or otherwise. Any material
amendment to the terms (financial or otherwise) of such Superior Proposal
shall require a new Notice of Adverse Recommendation or Notice of Superior
Proposal (as applicable) and the Company shall be required to comply again
with the requirements of this _Section 6.5(g)_.

 



 

(h) Nothing in this Agreement shall restrict the Company from taking or
disclosing a position contemplated by Rules 14d-9 or 14e-2(a) under the
Exchange Act, or otherwise making disclosure to comply with applicable Law (it
being agreed that a "stop, look and listen" communication by the board of
directors to the Companys stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the
Exchange Act or a factually accurate public statement by the Company that
describes the Companys receipt of a Competing Proposal and the operation of
this Agreement with respect thereto shall not be deemed to be an Adverse
Recommendation Change); _provided_ , that any such disclosure (other than (x)
issuing a "stop, look and listen" statement in accordance with the Exchange
Act pending disclosure of its position thereunder or (y) an express rejection
of any Competing Proposal or an unqualified reaffirmation of the Company
Recommendation) shall be deemed to be an Adverse Recommendation Change,

 



       
 

 



 

unless the board of directors of the Company expressly, publicly and
unconditionally reaffirms the Company Recommendation within four (4) Business
Days following any request by Parent for such reaffirmation (it being agreed
that Parent may make only one (1) such request with respect to any single such
disclosure and no more than two (2) such disclosures in the aggregate).

 



 

(i) For purposes of this Agreement:

 



 

(i) " **Competing Proposal** " shall mean any proposal or offer made by any
Person or group of Persons (other than Parent, Acquisition Sub or any
Affiliate thereof) to purchase or otherwise acquire, directly or indirectly,
in one transaction or a series of transactions, (i) beneficial ownership (as
defined under Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act) of twenty percent (20%) or
more of any class of equity securities of the Company pursuant to a merger,
reorganization, recapitalization, consolidation or other business combination,
sale of shares of capital stock, tender offer, exchange offer or similar
transaction or (ii) any one or more assets or businesses of the Company and
its Subsidiaries that constitute twenty percent (20%) or more of the revenues
or assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

 



 

(ii) " **Excluded Party** " shall mean any Third Party from which the Company
received during the Go-Shop Period a written Competing Proposal (i) that
remains pending as of, and shall not have been withdrawn prior to, the
expiration of the Go-Shop Period and (ii) that the board of directors of the
Company determines in good faith constitutes or could reasonably be expected
to lead to a Superior Proposal and (iii) as of any date following the
expiration of the Go-Shop Period, has not been withdrawn or abandoned.

 



 

(iii) " **Superior Proposal** " shall mean a bona fide Competing Proposal that
did not result from a material breach by the Company of this _Section 6.5_
(with all percentages in the definition of Competing Proposal increased to
fifty percent (50%)) made by a Third Party that the board of directors of the
Company determines in good faith, after consultation with the Companys
financial and legal advisors, (A) is reasonably likely to be consummated in
accordance with its terms, taking into account all legal, financial and
regulatory aspects of such proposal and the Person making the proposal
(including the expected timing and likelihood of consummation, taking into
account any governmental and other approval requirements), and (B) if
consummated, would result in a transaction more favorable to the Company and
its stockholders from a financial point of view than the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (including any revisions to the terms of this
Agreement, the Financing Commitments and the Guaranty committed to by Parent
to the Company in writing in response to such Competing Proposal under the
provisions of _Section 6.5(g)_).

 



 

Section 6.6 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_.

 



 

(a) Without limiting any additional rights that any employee may have under
any agreement or Company Benefit Plan, Parent and Acquisition Sub agree that
all rights to exculpation and indemnification for acts or omissions occurring
at or prior to the Effective Time,

 



      
 

 



 

whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time
(including any matters arising in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby), now existing in favor of the current or former
directors, officers, managers or employees (" **D andO Indemnified Parties**"),
as the case may be, of the Company or its Subsidiaries as provided in their
respective organizational documents as in effect on the date of this Agreement
or any Contract shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and
effect. Parent shall cause the certificate of incorporation, bylaws or other
organizational documents of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to
contain provisions with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses
and limitation of director, officer and employee liability that are no less
favorable to the DandO Indemnified Parties than those set forth in the Companys
and its Subsidiaries organizational documents as of the date of this
Agreement, which provisions thereafter shall not, for a period of six (6)
years from the Effective Time, be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in
any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of the DandO
Indemnified Parties.

 



 

(b) Without limiting the provisions of _Section 6.6(a)_, to the fullest
extent that the Company would be permitted by applicable Law to do so, Parent
shall or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to: (i) indemnify and hold
harmless each DandO Indemnified Party against and from any costs or expenses
(including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims,
damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, to the extent such claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation arises out of or pertains to: (A) any alleged
action or omission in such DandO Indemnified Partys capacity as a director,
officer or employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the
Effective Time or (B) this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby
and (ii) pay in advance of the final disposition of any such claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation the expenses (including attorneys fees) of
any DandO Indemnified Party upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of
such DandO Indemnified Party to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be
determined that such DandO Indemnified Party is not entitled to be indemnified
by applicable Law. Any determination required to be made with respect to
whether the conduct of any DandO Indemnified Party complies or complied with any
applicable standard shall be made by independent legal counsel selected by the
DandO Indemnified Party, which counsel shall be reasonably acceptable to the
Surviving Corporation. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this _Section 6.6(b)_ or elsewhere in this Agreement, Parent shall not (and
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation not to) settle or compromise or
consent to the entry of any judgment or otherwise seek termination with
respect to any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, unless such
settlement, compromise, consent or termination includes an unconditional
release of all of the DandO Indemnified Parties covered by the claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation from all liability arising out of such
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation.

 



 

(c) Unless the Company shall have purchased a "tail" policy prior to the
Effective Time as provided below, for at least six (6) years after the
Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain in
full force and effect, on terms and conditions no less advantageous to the DandO
Indemnified Parties, or any other Person entitled to the benefit of this
_Section 6.6_, as applicable, than the existing directors and officers
liability insurance and fiduciary insurance maintained by the Company as of
the date of this Agreement, covering claims arising from facts, events, acts
or omissions that occurred at or prior to the Effective

 



      
 

 



 

Time, including the transactions contemplated hereby ( _provided_ , that
Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, shall not be required to
pay an annual premium for such insurance in excess of three hundred percent
(300%) of the aggregate annual premiums currently paid by the Company on an
annualized basis, but in such case shall purchase as much of such coverage as
possible for such amount). In lieu of such insurance, prior to the Effective
Time, the Company may purchase a six (6) year "tail" prepaid policy on such
terms and conditions ( _provided_ , that the one-time premium for such "tail"
prepaid policy shall not exceed two hundred percent (200%) of the aggregate
annual premiums currently paid by the Company on an annualized basis, but in
such case shall purchase as much of such coverage as possible for such
amount), in which event Parent shall cease to have any obligations under the
first sentence of this _Section 6.6(c)_.

 



 

(d) The DandO Indemnified Parties to whom this _Section 6.6_ applies shall be
third-party beneficiaries of this _Section 6.6_. The provisions of this
_Section 6.6_ are intended to be for the benefit of each DandO Indemnified
Party and his or her successors, heirs or representatives. The Surviving
Corporation shall pay all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses,
including reasonable attorneys fees, that may be incurred by any DandO
Indemnified Party in enforcing its indemnity and other rights under this
_Section 6.6_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, this
_Section 6.6_ shall survive the consummation of the Merger indefinitely (or
any earlier period specified in this _Section 6.6_) and shall be binding,
jointly and severally, on all successors and assigns of Parent and the
Surviving Corporation, and shall be enforceable by the DandO Indemnified Parties
and their successors, heirs or representatives.

 



 

Section 6.7 _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company shall give prompt
notice to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company, of (a)
any notice or other communication received by such party from any Governmental
Authority in connection with the this Agreement, the Merger or the
transactions contemplated hereby, or from any Person alleging that the consent
of such Person is or may be required in connection with the Merger or the
transactions contemplated hereby, if the subject matter of such communication
or the failure of such party to obtain such consent could be material to the
Company, the Surviving Corporation or Parent and (b) any actions, suits,
claims, investigations or proceedings commenced or, to such partys Knowledge,
threatened against, relating to or involving or otherwise affecting such party
or any of its Subsidiaries which relate to this Agreement, the Merger or the
transactions contemplated hereby and (c) any breach by such party of any
representation, warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement that would
reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, result in a
failure of a condition set forth in _Section 7.2_ or _Section 7.3_, as
applicable, if continuing on the Closing Date.

 



 

Section 6.8 _Public Announcements_. Except as otherwise contemplated by
_Section 6.5_, prior to any Adverse Recommendation Change, the Company,
Parent and Acquisition Sub shall consult with each other before issuing any
press release or otherwise making any public statement with respect to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, and none of the parties or
their Affiliates shall issue any such press release or make any public
statement prior to obtaining the other parties consent (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), except that no such consent shall be
necessary to the extent disclosure may be required by Law, Order or applicable
stock exchange rule or any listing agreement of any party hereto (in

 



      
 

 



 

which case the disclosing party shall use its reasonable best efforts to
consult with the other party prior to such disclosure) or is consistent with
prior communications previously consented to by the parties. The Company may,
without Parent or Acquisition Subs consent, communicate to its employees,
customers, suppliers and consultants in a manner consistent with prior
communications of the Company or is consistent with a communications plan
previously agreed to by Parent and the Company in which case such
communications may be made consistent with such plan.

 



 

Section 6.9 _Employee Benefits_.

 



 

(a) For the one (1) year period commencing at the Effective Time, Parent
shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, provide each employee of
the Company and its Subsidiaries who continues to be employed by the Surviving
Corporation or its Subsidiaries following the Effective Time (the "
**Continuing Employees** ") with (i) a base salary and target cash bonus
opportunity (excluding any equity or equity-based compensation) that are each
no less favorable than, and (ii) defined contribution pension and welfare plan
benefits (excluding any severance benefits) that in the aggregate are no less
favorable than, the base salary and target cash bonus opportunity (excluding
any equity or equity-based compensation) and defined contribution pension and
welfare plan benefits (excluding any severance benefits) provided to such
individuals by the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the
Effective Time.

 



 

(b) Parent agrees that the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Surviving
Corporations employee benefit plans established following the Closing Date
(if any) and any other employee benefit plans covering the Continuing
Employees following the Effective Time (collectively, the " **Post-Closing
Plans** "), to recognize the service of each Continuing Employee (to the
extent such service was recognized by the Company) for purposes of
eligibility, vesting (other than vesting of future equity awards) and, for
purposes of future vacation accruals and levels of severance benefits only,
determination of the level of benefits (but not for benefit accrual purposes
under a defined benefit pension plan) under the Post-Closing Plans.

 



 

(c) For the calendar year including the Effective Time, the Continuing
Employees shall not be required to satisfy any deductible, co-payment, out-of-
pocket maximum or similar requirements under the Post-Closing Plans that
provide medical, dental and other welfare benefits (collectively, the "
**Post-Closing Welfare Plans** ") to the extent amounts were previously
credited for such purposes under comparable Company Benefit Plans that provide
medical, dental and other welfare benefits (the " **Company Welfare Plans**
").

 



 

(d) For the calendar year including the Effective Time, any waiting periods,
pre-existing condition exclusions and requirements to show evidence of good
health contained in such Post-Closing Welfare Plans shall be waived with
respect to the Continuing Employees (except to the extent any such waiting
period, pre-existing condition exclusion, or requirement of show evidence of
good health was already in effect with respect to such employees and that have
not been satisfied under the applicable Company Welfare Plan in which the
participant then participates or is otherwise eligible to participate as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time).

 



      
 

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding the generality of the foregoing, Parent shall, or shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to, provide severance payments and benefits to
each Continuing Employee whose employment is terminated without cause, on or
before the first (1st) anniversary of the date on which the Effective Time
occurs, that are consistent with the severance payments and benefits that
would have been paid or provided under the terms and conditions of the Company
severance plan set forth in _Section 6.9(e)_ of the Company Disclosure
Letter.

 



 

(f) Notwithstanding the generality of the foregoing, as of the Effective Time,
Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries
to, honor in accordance with their terms and, in each case, subject to
_Section 6.9(h)_, all employment, change in control, severance and other
compensation plans and agreements existing immediately prior to the execution
of this Agreement, which are between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
and any director, officer or employee thereof or maintained by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries (each, a " **Company Agreement** "). Parent and the
Company hereby agree that the occurrence of the Effective Time shall
constitute a "Change in Control" for purposes of all Company Agreements and
all Company Benefit Plans in which the term is relevant.

 



 

(g) In the event that the Effective Time occurs prior to the payment of the
annual cash bonuses otherwise payable under any Company Benefit Plan that
provides for payments of annual bonuses, annual sales awards or other annual
cash incentive awards in respect of the Companys 2014 fiscal year (the "
**2014 Cash Bonuses** "), the 2014 Cash Bonuses shall be determined based on
actual results and level of performance achieved in respect of the Companys
2014 fiscal year measured against the applicable targets under such Company
Benefit Plans as in effect on the date hereof and, if and to the extent
earned, the 2014 Cash Bonuses shall be paid to the eligible Continuing
Employees at the same time or times the Company otherwise would pay such
bonuses in the ordinary course of business. The 2014 Cash Bonuses shall be
paid in accordance with and subject to the terms of the relevant Company
Benefit Plans as in effect on the date hereof (including, without limitation,
subject to any requirement that the Continuing Employee remain an employee in
good standing on the applicable payment date). Notwithstanding the foregoing,
any Continuing Employee who is involuntarily terminated by Parent or the
Surviving Corporation following the Effective Time and prior to payment of the
2014 Cash Bonuses shall receive full payment of any 2014 Cash Bonus at the
same time such 2014 Cash Bonuses are paid to Continuing Employees.

 



 

(h) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that all provisions contained in
this _Section 6.9_ with respect to employees of the Company and the Companys
Subsidiaries are included for the sole benefit of the respective parties
hereto and shall not create any right (i) in any other person, including any
employees, former employees, any participant or any beneficiary thereof in any
Company Benefit Plan or Post-Closing Plan, or (ii) to continued employment
with the Company, any of the Companys Subsidiaries, Parent or the Surviving
Corporation. After the Effective Time, nothing contained in this _Section
6.9_ shall interfere with the right of the Company, any of the Companys
Subsidiaries, Parent or the Surviving Corporation to amend, modify or
terminate any Company Benefit Plan or Post-Closing Plan or to terminate the
employment of any employee of the Company or the Companys Subsidiaries for
any reason. Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 6.9_ to the contrary,
nothing in this Agreement, whether express or implied, shall be treated as an
amendment or other modification

 



      
 

 



 

of any Company Benefit Plan, Post-Closing Plan, or any other employee benefit
plans of the Company or Parent.

 



 

Section 6.10 _Conduct of Business by Parent Pending the Merger_. Parent and
Acquisition Sub covenant and agree that, between the date of this Agreement
and the earlier of the Effective Time and the date, if any, on which this
Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 8.1_, Parent and Acquisition Sub
shall not take any action which would reasonably be expected to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

Section 6.11 _Financing_.

 



 

(a) Each of Parent and Acquisition Sub shall use their respective reasonable
best efforts to take or cause to be taken, all actions and to do all things
necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and obtain the proceeds of the
Financing on the terms and conditions described in the Financing Commitments,
including using (and causing their Affiliates to use) their respective
reasonable best efforts to: (i) maintain in effect the Financing Commitments,
(ii) enter into definitive agreements with respect thereto on the terms and
conditions (including any flex provisions) contained in the Financing
Commitments, (iii) satisfy, or cause the satisfaction of, on a timely basis
all conditions and covenants applicable to Parent, Acquisition Sub or their
respective Representatives in such definitive agreements and otherwise comply
with their obligations thereunder, (iv) comply with any flex contemplated by
the Debt Commitment Letter (including any fee letters relating thereto), (v)
in the event that all conditions in the Debt Commitment Letter (other than the
availability or funding of the Equity Financing) have been satisfied,
consummate the Debt Financing at the Closing, (vi) cause the lenders and any
other Persons providing Financing to fund the Financing at or prior to the
Closing and (vii) enforce its rights under the Financing Commitments if all of
the conditions precedent to the Financing Sources obligation to fund the
Financing under the Financing Commitments have been met, by seeking specific
performance of the funding obligations of the parties thereunder.

 



 

(b) Parent shall not agree to any amendments or modifications to, or grant any
waivers of, any condition, remedy or other provision under the Financing
Commitments without the prior written consent of the Company if such
amendments, modifications or waivers would reduce the aggregate amount of the
Financing (including by changing the amount of fees to be paid or (if
applicable) original issue discount of the Debt Financing) to an amount below
the amount required to satisfy all of Parents and Acquisition Subs
obligations under this Agreement, impose new or additional conditions or
otherwise (i) expand in any respect the conditions precedent or contingencies
to the funding at Closing or prevent or delay or impair the ability of Parent
and Acquisition Sub to consummate the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) adversely impact the ability of Parent or
Acquisition Sub to enforce its rights against the other parties to the
Financing Commitments or (iii) adversely impact the ability of Parent or
Acquisition Sub to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_
, that Parent may replace, amend, supplement or modify the Debt Commitment
Letters for the purpose of adding agents, co-agents, lenders, arrangers, joint
bookrunners or other Persons that have not executed the Debt Commitment Letter
as of the date hereof, in each case in accordance with the Debt Commitment
Letter as of the date hereof. Parent shall not release or consent to the
termination of the obligations of the lenders under the Debt

 



      
 

 



 

Commitment Letter, except for assignments and replacements of an individual
lender (subject to _Section 6.11(c)_) under the terms of or in connection
with the syndication of the Debt Commitment Letter (so long as the assignment
or replacement of such additional parties, individually or in the aggregate,
would not result in any of the effects described in the first sentence of this
_Section 6.11(b)_ or otherwise reasonably be expected to prevent or delay or
impair the availability of the financing under the Debt Commitment Letter or
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement). For
purposes of this Agreement, (1) " _Financing_ " shall be deemed to include the
financing contemplated by the Financing Commitments as amended, modified or
waived pursuant to this _Section 6.11_ (including any Alternative Financing),
and (2) the term " _Financing Commitments_ " shall be deemed to include the
Financing Commitments as may be amended, modified or waived pursuant to this
_Section 6.11_ and any commitment letters with respect to the Alternative
Financing.

 



 

(c) Except as set forth in Section 6.11(c) of the Parent Disclosure Letter, in
no event shall Parent or Acquisition Sub or any of their Affiliates (which for
purposes of this _Section 6.11(c)_ shall be deemed to include each direct or
indirect investor or potential investor in Parent or Acquisition Sub, or any
of Parents, Acquisition Subs or such investors financing sources or
potential financing sources or other Representatives) prohibit or seek to
prohibit any bank, investment bank or other potential provider of debt or
equity financing from providing or seeking to provide financing or financial
advisory services to any Person in connection with a transaction relating to
the Company or its Subsidiaries or in connection with the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated hereby. In the event that any portion of the
Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated in the
Financing Commitments or Parent or Acquisition Sub become aware of any fact,
event or circumstance that makes or will make any portion of the Financing
unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated in the Financing
Commitments and such portion is reasonably required to consummate the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (i) Parent shall
promptly so notify the Company and (ii) Parent and Acquisition Sub shall use
their respective reasonable best efforts to arrange and obtain, and to

Parent Related Parties in respect of this Agreement, the Financing Commitments
and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby shall be to terminate
this Agreement in accordance with (and subject to the conditions of) _Article
VIII_ and collect, if due, the Reverse Termination Fee, and upon payment of
such Reverse Termination Fee in accordance with _Section 8.3(b)_, none of the
Parent Related Parties shall have any further liability or obligation relating
to or arising out of this Agreement, the Financing Commitments or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, other than any Additional
Amounts, if and when due. For the avoidance of doubt, the amount of the
Reverse Termination Fee is intended to serve as a cap on the maximum aggregate
liability of Parent or any Parent Related Party under this Agreement in the
event Parent or Acquisition Sub fail to effect the Closing in accordance with
this Agreement or otherwise breach this Agreement or fail to perform
hereunder; except that such cap shall in no event or circumstance apply to any
Additional Amounts that may be due or payable by any Parent Related Party
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement (including for such purposes the
Guaranty or the Confidentiality Agreement). Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth in this Agreement, but subject to _Section 9.9_, Parents
or Parents designee(s), as the case may be, right to receive payment from
the Company of the Termination Fee pursuant to _Section 8.3(a)_ and/or the
right to receive payment of the Parent Expenses pursuant to _Section 8.3(f)_,
shall, in circumstances in which the Termination Fee or Parent Expenses (as
applicable) are owed, constitute the sole and exclusive monetary remedy (other
than Parents or Parents designee(s), as the case may be, right, after
having received the Parent Expenses, to receive the Termination Fee less the
Parent Expenses in the circumstances expressly contemplated in _Section
8.3(a)_) of Parent and Acquisition Sub against the Company and its
Subsidiaries and any of their respective former, current or future general or
limited partners, stockholders, members, equityholders, controlling persons,
managers, directors, officers, employees, Affiliates, agents, Representatives
or assignees of any of the foregoing (collectively, the " **Company Related
Parties** ") for any and all losses and damages suffered or incurred as a
result of the failure of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be
consummated or for a breach or failure to perform hereunder or otherwise, and
upon payment of such amounts, none of the Company Related Parties shall have
any further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby (except that the Company
shall also be obligated with respect to _Section 8.3(e)_ and _Section 8.6_).

 



      
 

 



 

(e) Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that (i) the agreements contained
in this _Section 8.3_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, (ii) each of the Termination Fee, Parent Expenses and the
Reverse Termination Fee is not a penalty, but is liquidated damages, in a
reasonable amount that will compensate the Company, Parent or Parents
designee(s), as the case may be, in the circumstances in which such fee or
expenses are payable for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities
foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement
and on the expectation of the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision
and (iii) without these agreements, the parties would not enter into this
Agreement; accordingly, if the Company or Parent, as the case may be, fails to
timely pay any amount due pursuant to this _Section 8.3_ and, in order to
obtain such payment, either Parent or the Company, as the case may be,
commences a suit that results in a judgment against the other party for the
payment of any amount set forth in this _Section 8.3_, such paying party
shall pay the other party its costs and expenses in connection with such suit,
together with interest on such amount at the prime rate as published in _The
Wall Street Journal_ in effect on the date such payment was required to be
made through the date such payment was actually received, or such lesser rate
as is the maximum permitted by applicable Law.

 



 

(f) In the event this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section
8.1(b)(iii)_, then the Company shall pay Parent or Parents designee(s), as
the case may be (by wire transfer of immediately available funds), the
reasonable and documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses incurred by Parent
and Acquisition Sub in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement including the fees and expenses of counsel,
accountants, investment bankers, experts and consultants in an amount not to
exceed $8.4 million (the " **Parent Expenses** "); _provided_ , that any
payment of the Parent Expenses shall not affect Parents or Parents
designee(s), as the case may be, right to receive any reimbursement of
expenses otherwise due under _Section 8.6_ or any Termination Fee otherwise
due under _Section 8.1(a)_, but shall reduce, on a dollar for dollar basis,
any Termination Fee that becomes due and payable under _Section 8.1(a)_.

 



 

Section 8.4 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by mutual agreement of
the parties hereto in writing at any time before or after receipt of the
Requisite Stockholder Approval; _provided_ , _however_ , that (a) there shall
be no amendment that decreases the Merger Consideration, and (b) after the
Requisite Stockholder Approval has been obtained, there shall not be any
amendment that by Law or in accordance with the rules of any stock exchange
requires further approval by the stockholders of the Company without such
further approval of such stockholders nor any amendment or change not
permitted under applicable Law. Notwithstanding anything in this _Section
8.4_ to the contrary, the provisions of _Section 8.3(d)_, _Section 9.7_(b),
_Section 9.7_(c), _Section 9.8(b)_, _Section 9.9(c)_, the last sentence of
_Section 9.10(a)_ and _Section 9.12_ shall not be amended, modified or
supplemented in a manner that would adversely affect the rights of any
Financing Source without the prior written consent of such adversely affected
Financing Source.

 



 

Section 8.5 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time,
subject to applicable Law, any party hereto may (a) extend the time for the
performance of any obligation or other act of any other party hereto, (b)
waive any inaccuracy in the representations and warranties of the other party
contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and

 



      
 

 



 

(c) waive compliance with any agreement or condition contained herein. Any
such extension or waiver shall only be valid if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed by the party or parties to be bound thereby. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, no failure or delay by the Company, Parent or Acquisition Sub
in exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall
any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise
of any other right hereunder. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to
any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument
in writing signed on behalf of such party.

 



 

Section 8.6 _Expenses; Transfer Taxes_. Except as expressly set forth herein
(including _Section 8.3_), all expenses incurred in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by
the party incurring such expenses, _provided_ that Parent shall pay all costs
and expenses in connection with the filings of the notification and report
forms under the HSR Act in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement; _provided_ , further, that the Company shall promptly
reimburse Parent for 50% of the aggregate of amount of such costs and expenses
as promptly as practicable (and in any event within two (2) Business Days)
following the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(c)(ii)_,
_Section 8.1(d)(i)_, _Section 8.1(d)(ii)_ or _Section 8.1(d)(iii)_. Other
than Taxes imposed upon holders of Company Common Stock or Company Equity
Awards, Parent shall pay, or cause the Surviving Corporation to pay, all (i)
transfer, stamp and documentary Taxes or fees and (ii) sales, use, gains, real
property transfer and other similar Taxes or fees arising out of or in
connection with this Agreement.

Section 9.3 _Interpretation; Certain Definitions_.

 



 

(a) The parties have participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of
this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly
by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or
disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provisions of this
Agreement.

 



 

(b) Disclosure of any fact, circumstance or information in any Section of the
Company Disclosure Letter or Parent Disclosure Letter shall be deemed to be
disclosure of such fact, circumstance or information with respect to any other
Section of the Company Disclosure Letter or Parent Disclosure Letter,
respectively, if it is reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure that
such disclosure relates to any such other Section (other than any matters
required to be disclosed for purposes of _Section 4.2(a)_ or _Section
4.9(b)_ of this Agreement, which matters shall be specifically disclosed in
the respective corresponding section or subsections of the Company Disclosure
Letter). The inclusion of any item in the Company Disclosure Letter or Parent
Disclosure Letter shall not be deemed to be an admission or evidence of
materiality of such item, nor shall it establish any standard of materiality
for any purpose whatsoever.

 



 

(c) The words "hereof," "herein," "hereby," "hereunder" and "herewith" and
words of similar import shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to
any particular provision of this Agreement. References to articles, sections,
paragraphs, exhibits, annexes and schedules are to the articles, sections and
paragraphs of, and exhibits, annexes and schedules to, this Agreement, unless
otherwise specified, and the table of contents and headings in this Agreement
are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or

"including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by
the phrase "without limitation." Words describing the singular number shall be
deemed to include the plural and vice versa, words denoting any gender shall
be deemed to include all genders, words denoting natural persons shall be
deemed to include business entities and vice versa and references to a Person
are also to its permitted successors and assigns. The phrases "the date of
this Agreement" and "the date hereof" and terms or phrases of similar import
shall be deemed to refer to October 23, 2014, unless the context requires
otherwise. References to any statute shall be deemed to refer to such statute
as amended from time to time and to any rules or regulations promulgated
thereunder ( _provided_ , that for purposes of any representations and
warranties contained in this Agreement that are made as of a specific date or
dates, references to any statute shall be deemed to refer to such statute, as
amended, and to any rules or regulations promulgated thereunder, in each case,
as of such date). Terms defined in the text of this Agreement have such
meaning throughout this Agreement, unless otherwise indicated in this
Agreement, and all terms defined in this Agreement shall have the meanings
when used in any certificate or other document made or delivered pursuant
hereto unless otherwise defined therein. Any Law defined or referred to herein
or in any agreement or instrument that is referred to herein means such Law as
from time to time amended, modified or supplemented, including (in the case of
statutes) by succession of comparable successor Laws ( _provided_ , that for
purposes of any representations and warranties contained in this Agreement
that are made as of a specific date or dates, references to any statute shall
be deemed to refer to such statute, as amended, and to any rules or
regulations promulgated thereunder, in each case, as of such date). All
references to "dollars" or "$" refer to currency of the United States of
America.

 



 

Section 9.4 _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction of
this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other authority
to be invalid, void, unenforceable or against its regulatory policy, the
remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this
Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be
affected, impaired or invalidated. Upon such determination that any term or
other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to
effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in a mutually
acceptable manner in order that the Merger be consummated as originally
contemplated to the fullest extent possible. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the parties intend that the remedies and limitations thereon contained in
_Section 8.3_ be construed as an integral provision of this Agreement and
that such remedies and limitations shall not be severable in any manner that
increases a partys liability or obligations hereunder or under the Financing
Commitments or the Guaranty.

 



 

Section 9.5 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties
hereto (whether by operation of Law or otherwise) without the prior written
consent of the other parties. Subject to the preceding sentence, this
Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by
the parties and their respective permitted successors and assigns. Any
attempted assignment in violation of this _Section 9.5_ shall be null and
void.

 



 

Section 9.6 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the exhibits,
annexes and appendices hereto) constitutes, together with the Confidentiality
Agreement, the Guaranty, the

 



      
 

 



 

Equity Commitment Letters, the Company Disclosure Letter and the Parent
Disclosure Letter, the entire agreement, and supersedes all other prior
agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties, or
any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof.

 



 

Section 9.7 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement is not intended to
and shall not confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto any rights
or remedies hereunder; _provided_ , _however_ , that it is specifically
intended that (a) the DandO Indemnified Parties (with respect to _Section 6.6_
and this _Section 9.7_ from and after the Effective Time), (b) the Financing
Sources under the Debt Financing (with respect to _Section 8.3(d)_, the last
sentence of _Section 8.4_, this _Section 9.7_, _Section 9.8(b)_, _Section
9.10_ and _Section 9.12_) and (c) the Parent Related Parties (with respect to
_Section 8.3(d)_ and _Section 9.9_) and the Company Related Parties (with
respect to _Section 8.3(d)_ and _Section 9.9_), are intended third-party
beneficiaries hereof.

 



 

Section 9.8 _Governing Law_.

 



 

(a) This Agreement and all actions, proceedings or counterclaims (whether
based on contract, tort or otherwise) arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or the actions of Parent, Acquisition Sub or the Company in the
negotiation, administration, performance and enforcement thereof, shall be
governed by, and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of
Delaware, without giving effect to any choice or conflict of laws provision or
rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would
cause the application of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of
Delaware.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, each
of the parties hereto: (i) agrees that it will not bring or support any Person
in any action or proceeding before any Governmental Authority of any kind or
description, whether at law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or
otherwise, against any of the Financing Sources in any way relating to this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
but not limited to any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the
Debt Financing or the performance thereof or the financings contemplated
thereby, in any forum other than the United States Federal and New York State
courts located in the Borough of Manhattan, New York County, State of New York
and (ii) agrees that, except as specifically set forth in the Debt Commitment
Letters, all claims or causes of action (whether at law, in equity, in
contract, in tort or otherwise) against any of the Financing Sources in any
way relating to this Agreement, the Debt Financing or the performance thereof
or the financings contemplated thereby, shall be exclusively governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York, without
giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of
the State of New York or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the
application of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of New York.

 



 

Section 9.9 _Specific Performance_.

 



 

(a) The parties agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even
if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that
the parties hereto do not perform the provisions of this Agreement (including
failing to take such actions as are required of it hereunder to consummate
this Agreement) in accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach
such provisions. Accordingly, the parties acknowledge and agree

 



      
 

 



 

that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction, specific performance and
other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof, in addition to any other remedy
to which they are entitled at law or in equity. Each of the parties agrees
that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance
and other equitable relief on the basis that any other party has an adequate
remedy at law or that any award of specific performance is not an appropriate
remedy for any reason at law or in equity. Any party seeking an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall not be required to provide
any bond or other security in connection with any such order or injunction.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, this _Section 9.9_
is not intended and shall not be construed to limit in any way the provisions
of _Section 8.3(d)_.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding _Section 9.9(a)_ or anything else to the contrary in this
Agreement, the parties hereby acknowledge and agree that the Company shall be
entitled to specific performance to cause Parent and/or Acquisition Sub to
cause the Equity Financing to be funded and draw down the full proceeds of the
Equity Financing pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Equity Commitment
Letters and/or to cause Parent and/or Acquisition Sub to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby and to effect the Closing in accordance with
_Section 2.2_, in each case if, and only if, all of the following conditions
have been satisfied: (i) all conditions in _Section 7.1_ and _Section 7.2_
(but subject to the fulfillment or waiver of those conditions) have been
satisfied, and remain satisfied, at the time when the Closing would have
occurred (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied
by actions taken at the Closing, each of which shall be capable of being
satisfied at the Closing) but for the failure of the Financing to be funded,
(ii) Parent and Acquisition Sub fail to complete the Closing by the date the
Closing is required to have occurred pursuant to _Section 2.2_, (iii) the
Debt Financing provided for by the Debt Commitment Letter (or, if Alternative
Financing is being used in accordance with _Section 6.11(c)_, pursuant to the
commitments with respect thereto) has been funded or is required under the
terms of the Debt Commitment Letter to be funded at the Closing if the Equity
Financing is funded at the Closing and (iv) the Company has irrevocably
confirmed in writing to Parent that if specific performance is granted and the
Equity Financing and Debt Financing are funded, then the Closing would occur.

 



 

(c) The Company hereby covenants and agrees that it shall not, and shall cause
its Subsidiaries not to, institute any proceeding or bring any other claim
arising under, or in connection with, this Agreement, the Financing
Commitments, the Guaranty or the negotiation, execution, performance,
abandonment or termination of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby
(whether at law or in equity, under any theory of liability (including without
limitation by attempting to pierce a corporate, limited liability company or
partnership veil) against Parent or any Parent Related Party except for
claims: (i) against Parent and/or Acquisition Sub in accordance with and
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement (including this _Section 9.9_, and
including the Companys right to specific performance of Parents and/or
Acquisition Subs obligations under this Agreement with respect to the Debt
Financing (including to cause Parent and/or Acquisition Sub to enforce the
terms of the Debt Financing Commitment against the Debt Financing Sources));
(ii) against Parent and/or Acquisition Sub for indemnification or expense
reimbursement under _Section 6.6_, _Section 6.12_ or _Section 8.3(e)_;
(iii) against the Guarantor under the Guaranty, subject to the terms and
limitations thereof; (iv) against the Equity Financing Sources for specific
performance of their

 



      
 

 



 

respective obligations under the Equity Commitment Letters to fund their
respective commitments thereunder, subject to the terms and limitations
thereof if, and only if, the conditions of _Section 9.9(b)_ have been
satisfied; and (v) against Siris Capital Group, LLC under the Confidentiality
Agreement, subject to the terms and limitations thereof (the claims described
in clauses (i) through (v) collectively, the " **Retained Claims** "). For the
avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the exercise of the Companys right to
pursue a grant of specific performance pursuant to this _Section 9.9_ reduce,
restrict or otherwise limit the Companys right to terminate this Agreement
and receive payment of the Reverse Termination Fee under _Section 8.3(b)_ (if
due); _provided_ , that (A) under no circumstances shall the Company be
permitted or entitled to receive both (1) a grant of specific performance of
the obligation to close contemplated by _Section 9.9_ that results in the
Merger occurring and (2) the Reverse Termination Fee, (B) in no event shall
the Company seek equitable relief or to recover money damages from Parent or
any Parent Related Party in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement other than pursuant to a Retained Claim and (C) in no event
shall the Company or any Company Related Party seek to recover any money
damages in excess of the Reverse Termination Fee plus any Additional Amounts
from Parent or any Parent Related Party in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

Section 9.10 _Consent to Jurisdiction_.

 



 

(a) Each of the parties hereto hereby (i) expressly and irrevocably submits to
the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the Delaware Court of Chancery, any
other court of the State of Delaware or any federal court sitting in the State
of Delaware in the event any dispute arises out of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) agrees that it will not attempt to deny
or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from
any such court, (iii) agrees that it will not bring any action relating to
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby in any court other than
the Delaware Court of Chancery, any other court of the State of Delaware or
any federal court sitting in the State of Delaware, (iv) waives, to the
fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection which it
may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit, action or
proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement and (v) agrees that
each of the other parties shall have the right to bring any action or
proceeding for enforcement of a judgment entered by the Delaware Court of
Chancery, any other court of the State of Delaware or any federal court
sitting in the State of Delaware. Each of Parent, Acquisition Sub and the
Company agrees that a final judgment in any action or proceeding shall be
conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment
or in any other manner provided by Law. The parties hereby further agree that
New York state or United States Federal courts sitting in New York County,
State of New York shall have exclusive jurisdiction over any action (whether
at law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) brought against any
Financing Source in connection with the transactions contemplated under this
Agreement.

 



 

(b) Each party irrevocably consents to the service of process outside the
territorial jurisdiction of the courts referred to in _Section 9.10(a)_ in
any such action or proceeding by mailing copies thereof by registered or
certified United States mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested, to
its address as specified in or pursuant to _Section 9.2_. However, the
foregoing shall not limit the right of a party to effect service of process on
the other party by any other legally available method.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 9.11 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in multiple
counterparts, all of which shall together be considered one and the same

 _ARTICLE EIGHT_

 



 

A. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the Corporation is
authorized to provide indemnification of (and advancement of expenses to)
directors, officers, employees and agents (and any other persons to which
Delaware law permits the Corporation to provide indemnification) through bylaw
provisions, agreements with such agents or other persons, vote of stockholders
or disinterested directors or otherwise, in excess of the indemnification and
advancement otherwise permitted by Section 145 of the DGCL, subject only to
limits created by applicable Delaware law (statutory or non-statutory), with
respect to actions for breach of duty to the Corporation, its stockholders and
others.

 



 

B. No director of the Corporation shall be personally liable to the
Corporation or any stockholder for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary
duty as a director, except for any matter in respect of which such director
shall be liable under Section 174 of the DGCL or any amendment thereto or
shall be liable by reason that, in addition to any and all other requirements
for such liability, such director (1) shall have breached the directors duty
of loyalty to the Corporation or its stockholders, (2) shall have acted in a

C. Each person who was or is made a party or is threatened to be made a party
to or is in any way involved in any threatened, pending or completed action,
suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative
(hereinafter a "proceeding"), including any appeal therefrom, by reason of the
fact that he or she, or a person of whom he or she is the legal
representative, is or was a director or officer of the Corporation or a direct
or indirect subsidiary of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request
of the Corporation as a director or officer of another entity or enterprise,
or was a director or officer of a foreign or domestic corporation which was a
predecessor corporation of the Corporation or of another entity or enterprise
at the request of such predecessor corporation, shall be indemnified and held
harmless by the Corporation, and the Corporation shall advance all expenses
incurred by any such person in defense of any such proceeding prior to its
final determination, to the fullest extent authorized by the DGCL. In any
proceeding against the Corporation to enforce these rights, such person shall
be presumed to be entitled to indemnification and the Corporation shall have
the burden of proving that such person has not met the standards of conduct
for permissible indemnification set forth in the DGCL. Any person serving as a
director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership,
limited liability company, joint venture or other enterprise, at least 50% of
whose equity interests are owned by the Corporation shall be conclusively
presumed to be serving in such capacity at the request of the Corporation. The
rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses conferred by this
ARTICLE EIGHT shall be presumed to have been relied upon by the directors and
officers of the Corporation in serving or continuing to serve the Corporation
and shall be enforceable as contract rights. Said rights shall not be
exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification may
otherwise be entitled. The Corporation may, upon written demand presented by a
director or officer of the Corporation or of a direct or indirect subsidiary
of the Corporation, or by a person serving at the request of the Corporation
as a director or officer of another entity or enterprise, enter into contracts
to provide such persons with specified rights to indemnification, which
contracts may confer rights and protections to the maximum extent permitted by
the DGCL, as amended and in effect from time to time.

 



 

D. If a claim under this ARTICLE EIGHT is not paid in full by the Corporation
within sixty (60) days after a written claim has been received by the
Corporation, the claimant may at any time thereafter bring suit against the
Corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim and, if successful in
whole or in part, the claimant shall be entitled to be paid also the expenses
of prosecuting such claim. It shall be a defense to any such action (other
than an action brought to enforce the right to be advanced expenses incurred
in defending any proceeding prior to its final disposition where the required
undertaking, if any, has been tendered to the Corporation) that the claimant
has not met the standards of conduct which make it permissible under the DGCL
for the Corporation to indemnify the claimant for the amount claimed, but the
claimant shall be presumed to be entitled to indemnification and the
Corporation shall have the burden of proving that the claimant has not met the
standards of conduct for permissible indemnification set forth in the DGCL.

 



 

E. If the DGCL is hereafter amended to permit the Corporation to provide
broader indemnification rights than said law permitted the Corporation to
provide prior to such amendment, the indemnification rights conferred by this
ARTICLE EIGHT shall be broadened to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL,
as so amended.

 



      
 

 



 

F. Given that certain jointly indemnifiable claims (as defined below) may
arise due to the service of the indemnitee as a director of the Corporation at
the request of the indemnitee-related entities (as defined below), the
Corporation shall be fully and primarily responsible for the payment to the
indemnitee in respect of indemnification or advancement of expenses in
connection with any such jointly indemnifiable claims, pursuant to and in
accordance with the terms of this ARTICLE EIGHT, irrespective of any right of
recovery the indemnitee may have from the indemnitee-related entities. Under
no circumstance shall the Corporation be entitled to any right of subrogation
or contribution by the indemnitee-related entities and no right of advancement
or recovery the indemnitee may have from the indemnitee-related entities shall
reduce or otherwise alter the rights of the indemnitee or the obligations of
the Corporation hereunder. In the event that any of the indemnitee-related
entities shall make any payment to the indemnitee in respect of
indemnification or advancement of expenses with respect to any jointly
indemnifiable claim, the indemnitee-related entity making such payment shall
be subrogated to the extent of such payment to all of the rights of recovery
of the indemnitee against the Corporation, and the indemnitee shall execute
all papers reasonably required and shall do all things that may be reasonably
necessary to secure such rights, including the execution of such documents as
may be necessary to enable the indemnitee-related entities effectively to
bring suit to enforce such rights. Each of the indemnitee-related entities
shall be third-party beneficiaries with respect to this paragraph (F) of
ARTICLE EIGHT, entitled to enforce this paragraph (F) of ARTICLE EIGHT.

 



 

For purposes of this paragraph (F) of ARTICLE EIGHT, the following terms shall
have the following meanings:

 



 

(1) The term " _indemnitee-related entities_ " means any corporation, limited
liability company, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or
other enterprise (other than the Corporation or any other corporation, limited
liability company, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or
other enterprise for which the indemnitee has agreed, on behalf of the
Corporation or at the Corporations request, to serve as a director, officer,
employee or agent and which service is covered by the indemnity described
herein) from whom an indemnitee may be entitled to indemnification or
advancement of expenses with respect to which, in whole or in part, the
Corporation may also have an indemnification or advancement obligation.

 



 

(2) The term " _jointly indemnifiable claims_ " shall be broadly construed and
shall include, without limitation, any action, suit or proceeding for which
the indemnitee shall be entitled to indemnification or advancement of expenses
from both the indemnitee-related entities and the Corporation pursuant to
Delaware law, any agreement or certificate of incorporation, bylaws,
partnership agreement, operating agreement, certificate of formation,
certificate of limited partnership or comparable organizational documents of
the Corporation or the indemnitee-related entities, as applicable.

 



 

G. Any repeal or modification of this ARTICLE EIGHT shall be prospective and
shall not affect the rights under this ARTICLE EIGHT in effect at the time of
the alleged occurrence of any act or omission to act giving rise to liability
or indemnification.
