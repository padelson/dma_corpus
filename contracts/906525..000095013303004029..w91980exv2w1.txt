obtain consents without any obligation on the part of Sellers or their
respective Affiliates to incur any fees or expenses in connection
therewith.   (e) Without any further action on its behalf or on behalf

(b) December 31, 2004, the earlier of such dates, the "Nonassignable Contract

consent except for reasonable legal fees related to such efforts in
connection with the License-Related Purchased Assets Closing. Purchaser and
Sellers shall use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to obtain,
or cause to be obtained, any consent, substitution, approval or amendment
required to novate all Liabilities under any and all Purchased Contracts or
other Liabilities that constitute Assumed Liabilities or to obtain in writing
the unconditional release of Sellers and their Affiliates so that, in all
cases, Purchaser shall be solely responsible for such Liabilities after the
applicable Closing with respect to such Assumed Liabilities.   (f) The
transfer of the FCC Licenses held by the License Subsidiaries indirectly as a
result of the sale of Company\'s Membership Interest therein or directly, if
so elected by Purchaser, shall be subject to obtaining FCC Approval prior to
such transfer. Control over the License Subsidiaries and/or their FCC
Licenses shall not be conveyed by Company or assumed by Purchaser until the
FCC Approval has been obtained by Final Order.   2.6 Indemnification
Procedures.   (a) Procedures for Making Claims. In the event that any
Claim shall be asserted by any Person in respect of which payment may be
sought by an Indemnified Party under Section 2.5(c) hereof, such Indemnified
Party shall promptly provide reasonable written notice to Purchaser stating
specifically the nature and dollar amount of any such Claim to the extent
known at such time. Written notice to Purchaser of the existence of any Claim
shall be given by Sellers within fifteen (15) days after its becoming aware
of (i) the Claim giving rise to a Loss or (ii) the assertion a third party
Claim with respect to which Purchaser is obligated under Section 2.5(c)
hereof to provide indemnification or reimbursement; provided, however, that
the failure of Sellers to give such notice shall not relieve Purchaser of its
obligations under Section 2.5(c) hereof, except to the extent that such
Purchaser is actually prejudiced by such failure to give notice.      
17     (b) Defense of Claims.   (i) The Purchaser, at its own expense
and through counsel chosen by it, may elect to defend against, negotiate,
settle or otherwise deal with any Claim which relates to any Losses; and if
it so elects, it shall, within 30 (thirty) Business Days after receiving
notice of Claim (or sooner, if the nature of such Claim so requires), notify
the Indemnified Party of its intent to do so, and such Indemnified Party
shall cooperate fully in the defense, negotiation or settlement of any such
Claim. After notice from the Purchaser to the Indemnified Parties of its
election to defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with any such
Claim, Purchaser shall not be liable to the Indemnified Parties under this
Agreement for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the
Indemnified Parties in connection with the defense, negotiation or settlement
thereof; provided, however, that all Indemnified Parties shall have the right
to collectively employ one (and only one) counsel to represent
such Indemnified Parties in respect of such Claim hereunder (which counsel
shall be reasonably acceptable to the Purchaser) if, in the reasonable
opinion of counsel to the Indemnified Parties, a conflict of interest between
the Indemnified Parties and the Purchaser may exist in respect of such Claim
that would make such separate representation advisable, and in that event (x)
the reasonable fees and expenses of such separate counsel shall be paid by
the Purchaser and (y) each of the Purchaser and the Indemnified Parties shall
have the right to direct its own defense in respect of such Claim; provided,
further, that the Purchaser shall not be required to pay for more than one
additional counsel (excluding local counsel) for Indemnified Parties in
connection with any Claim hereunder. The parties hereto agree to cooperate
fully with each other in connection with any Claims hereunder. If the
Purchaser elects not to defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal
with such Claim, or fails to notify the Indemnified Parties of its election
within thirty (30) Business Days after request by the Indemnified Parties to
assume the defense of any such Claim, the Indemnified Parties may assume
control of the defense of such Claim at Purchaser\'s expense. Notwithstanding
anything in this Section 2.6 to the contrary, neither the Purchaser nor the
Indemnified Parties may, without the prior written consent of the other
party, settle or compromise any such Claim or permit a default or consent to
the entry of any judgment unless the claimant and such party provide to such
other party an unqualified written release from all liability in respect of
such Claim, and such settlement or compromise does not materially and
adversely impair the ability of the Indemnified Parties to conduct their
respective businesses, and does not contain any admission of wrongdoing on
the part of any of the Indemnified Parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if
a settlement offer solely for money damages is made by the applicable third
party claimant, and the Purchaser notifies the Indemnified Parties in writing
of the Purchaser\'s willingness to accept the settlement offer and pay the
amount called for by such offer, and the Indemnified Parties decline to
accept such offer, the Indemnified Parties may continue to contest
such Claim, free of any participation by the Purchaser, and the amount of
any ultimate liability with respect to such Claim that the Purchaser has
an obligation to pay hereunder shall be limited to the lesser of (A) the
amount of the settlement offer that the Indemnified Parties declined to
accept plus the Losses of the Indemnified Parties relating to such Claim
through the date of its rejection of the settlement offer or (B) the
aggregate Losses of the Indemnified Parties with respect to such
Claim.      18     (ii) After any final decision, judgment or award
shall have been rendered by a Governmental Body of competent jurisdiction and
the expiration of the time in which to appeal therefrom, or a settlement
shall have been consummated, or the Indemnified Parties and the Purchaser
shall have arrived at a mutually binding agreement with respect to a Claim
hereunder, the Indemnified Parties shall forward to the Purchaser notice of
any sums due and owing by the Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement with
respect to such matter.   (c) No Consequential Damages. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no party hereto (or any of its
Affiliates) shall, in any event, be liable to any other party hereto (or any
of its Affiliates) for any consequential, incidental, special or punitive
damages of such other party (or its Affiliates) (collectively, an "Excluded
Loss"), including loss of future revenue, income or profits, diminution of
value or loss of business reputation or opportunity relating to any claim or
loss hereunder; provided, that to the extent that any Loss constitutes the
payment of any amount to a third party that is not an Indemnified Person,
such Loss shall not be reduced by the amount thereof that would otherwise
constitute an Excluded Loss.   2.7 Bulk Sales Laws. Purchaser hereby waives
compliance by Sellers and the Subsidiaries with the requirements and
provisions of any "bulk transfer" Laws of any jurisdiction that may otherwise
be applicable with respect to the sale of any or all of the Purchased Assets
to Purchaser.   2.8 Purchase Price Allocation.   (a) Sellers and Purchaser
shall act in good faith to attempt to agree to the allocation of the purchase
price (including the Assumed Liabilities) among the Purchased Assets. In
accordance with such allocation and upon such agreement, Purchaser shall
prepare and deliver to Sellers copies of Form 8594 and any required exhibits
thereto (the "Asset Acquisition Statement"). Purchaser shall prepare and
deliver to Sellers from time to time revised copies of the Asset Acquisition
Statement (the "Revised Statements") so as to report any matters on the Asset
Acquisition Statement that need updating (including purchase price
adjustments, if any) consistent with the allocation as agreed upon or
determined in accordance with this Section 2.8. The purchase price for the
Initial Purchased Assets and License-Related Purchased Assets shall
be allocated in accordance with the Asset Acquisition Statement or, if
applicable, the last Revised Statements, provided by Purchaser to Sellers,
and all income Tax Returns and reports filed by Purchaser and Sellers shall
be prepared consistently with such allocation.   (b) If the Sellers and
Purchaser fail to agree to such matters within 60 days (the "Negotiation
Period") after the date hereof, the allocation of the purchase price among
the Purchased Assets will be resolved by submission to an independent
accounting firm of national recognition reasonably acceptable to Sellers and
Buyer (the "Accountants"). If the purchase price allocation is submitted to
the Accountants for resolution, (x) each party will furnish to
the Accountants such work papers and other documents and information relating
to the purchase price allocation as      19    the Accountants may
request and are available to that party (or its independent public
accountants), and will be afforded the opportunity to present to
the Accountants any material relating to the determination and to discuss
the determination with the Accountants; (y) the determination by the
Accountants, as set forth in a notice delivered to the Sellers and Purchaser
by the Accountants will be binding and conclusive on the Sellers and
Purchaser; and (z) the fees of the Accountants for such determination shall
be allocated by the Accountant equally between Purchaser and Sellers.   2.9

From and after the Initial Closing, each of Parent and Purchaser will make or
cause to be made available to the Sellers and their agents and employees all
business records and files (except for those business records and files the
provision of which is prohibited by Law) during regular business hours as may
be reasonably necessary for (A) preparing or reviewing tax returns and

accounting systems purchased hereunder to the extent that such access is
reasonably required by Sellers and the other services listed on Schedule
7.1(b) hereto.   7.2 Preservation of Records. Each of Parent and Purchaser
agrees that it shall preserve and keep the records held by it relating to the
Business for a period of six years from the Initial Closing Date. In the
event each of Parent and Purchaser wishes to destroy such records after that
time, Purchaser shall first give ninety (90) days prior written notice to
Company and shall have the right at its option and expense, upon prior
written notice given to Purchaser within that ninety (90) day period, to take
possession of the records within one hundred and eighty (180) days after the
date of such notice.   7.3 Publicity.   (a) None of Sellers, Parent or
Purchaser shall issue any press release or public announcement concerning
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby without obtaining the
prior written approval of the other party hereto, which approval will not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed, unless, in the judgment of Sellers or
Purchaser, disclosure is otherwise required by applicable Law or by
applicable rules of any stock exchange, provided that, to the extent required
by applicable Law, the party intending to make such release shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts consistent with applicable Law to consult
with the other party with respect to the text thereof.   (b) Each of
Purchaser and each Seller agrees that the terms of this Agreement shall not
be disclosed or otherwise made available to the public and that copies of
this Agreement shall not be publicly filed or otherwise made available to the
public, except where such disclosure, availability or filing is required by
applicable Law and only to the extent required by such Law.     36   
7.4 Negative Covenant.   (a) Except as otherwise expressly permitted herein,
between the date of this Agreement and each applicable Nonassignable Contract
Assignment Date, Sellers shall not, without the prior written consent of
Purchaser, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, make any
modification to any such Nonassignable Contract.   (b) Except as otherwise
expressly permitted herein, between the date of this Agreement and the
License-Related Asset Purchase Closing Date, Sellers shall not, without the
prior written consent of Purchaser, (i) enter into any compromise or
settlement of any litigation, proceeding or governmental investigation
relating to the License-Related Purchased Assets, or the License-Related
Assumed Liabilities; or (ii) terminate the employment of any employee listed
on Schedule 1.1(c).   7.5 Notification.   Between the date of this
Agreement and the License-Related Asset Purchase Closing Date, Sellers shall
promptly notify Purchaser of the occurrence of any breach of any covenant of
Sellers in this Article 7 or of the occurrence of any event that may make the
satisfaction of the conditions in Article 8 impossible or unlikely.   7.6
Sellers\' Reasonable Best Efforts.   Sellers shall use their reasonable best
efforts, without the obligation to incur any costs, expenses or Liabilities,
except for reasonable legal fees related to the License-Related Asset
Purchase Closing as provided in Section 2.5(e) hereof, to cause the
conditions in Sections 8.1 to be satisfied.   7.7 Purchaser\'s Reasonable
Best Efforts. Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the
conditions in Sections 8.1 to be satisfied.   7.8 Non-Solicitation.   (a)
Each Seller agrees that for a period of three years from the Initial Closing
Date, it shall not employ or solicit or offer or induce or receive or accept
the performance of services by any senior or management employee of the
Business while such Persons are employed by Purchaser.   (b) If Each Seller
acknowledges that Purchaser would be irreparably harmed by any breach of this
Section 7.8 and that there would be no adequate remedy at law or in damages
to compensate Purchaser for any such breach. Each Seller agrees that
Purchaser shall be entitled to injunctive relief requiring specific
performance by each Seller and its Affiliates of this Section 7.8 without the
necessity of proving actual damages or the posting of a bond, and each
consents to the entry thereof.   7.9 Employment.     37    (a) Prior
to the Initial Closing Date, Purchaser shall offer employment to each of the
Initial Transferred Employees to commence immediately following the Initial
Closing. On March 31, 2004 (the "Subsequent Transfer Date"), Purchaser shall
offer employment to each Subsequent Transferred Employee, who is
still employed by Seller, to commence on the Subsequent Transfer Date. Each
such offer of employment shall be at the same salary or hourly wage rate in
effect immediately prior to the Initial Closing Date, or, in the case of the
Subsequent Transferred Employees, the Subsequent Transfer Date. Each of the
Transferred Employees shall be entitled to any sick leave, personal days and
vacation time they would be entitled to if they remained employed by Sellers.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section 7.9 shall not prohibit Purchaser
from terminating the employment of any Transferred Employee at any time or
for any reason. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Agreement shall
create a contract of employment or alter the "at-will" employment status of
any Transferred Employee.   (b) As a condition of the offers of employment
to Transferred Employees with Severance Agreements listed on Schedule
2.3(a)(viii), Purchaser and each Transferred Employee will enter into a
"substitute severance agreement" substantially in the form attached hereto as
Exhibit G as a replacement for such Transferred Employee\'s Severance
Agreement. Payments under the "substitute severance agreements" shall be made
by the Purchaser to Transferred Employees in accordance with their terms and
Sellers shall have no liability with regard to payments under the "substitute
severance agreements" or the Severance Agreements. Any Transferred Employee
who does not enter into a substitute severance agreement within 3 days of the
Initial Closing Date (the "Eligibility Period") will not become an employee
of Purchaser and shall receive payments under the Severance Agreement
applicable to such Transferred Employee, and, in such case, Purchaser will
promptly, and in no event in more than one Business Day after the expiration
of the Eligibility Period, reimburse Sellers for its severance pay costs
(including severance pay, employer contributions for FICA and FUTA and any
accrued vacation, sick or personal days) which were otherwise Assumed
Liabilities of Purchaser under this Agreement. Such reimbursement
shall constitute an Expense under the Management Agreement.   (c) Purchaser
and Sellers agree that the payroll taxes of the Transferred Employees shall
be treated in accordance with the Standard Procedure of Section 4 of Revenue
Procedure 96-60.   7.10 Employee Benefits.   (a) From and after the
Initial Closing, or in the case of the Subsequent Transferred Employees, the
Subsequent Transfer Date, Purchaser shall provide, or cause to be provided to
each of the Transferred Employees, benefits under the employee benefits plans
of Purchaser (the "Purchaser Plans") that are, in each case, substantially
equivalent on an aggregate basis to those provided to employees of the
Purchaser. For purposes of this Section 7.10(a), coverage under any Employee
Benefit Plan assumed pursuant to Section 2.3(a)(ii) may be considered
coverage under a Purchaser Plan after the Initial Closing Date.    
38    (b) For purposes of eligibility, vesting and benefit accrual (but not
for purposes of any employer contribution to the Purchasers\' defined
contribution plan based on the Purchaser\'s financial performance for
calendar year 2003) , under the Purchaser Plans, Purchaser shall credit each
Transferred Employee with his or her years of service with Company, the
Subsidiaries and any predecessor entities, to the same extent as such
Transferred Employee was entitled immediately prior to the Initial Closing
Date, or in the case of the Subsequent Transferred Employees, the Subsequent
Transfer Date, to credit for such service under any similar Employee Benefit
Plan. The Purchaser Plans shall not deny Transferred Employees coverage on
the basis of pre-existing conditions unless a Transferred Employee was denied
coverage under Employee Benefit Plan and shall credit such Transferred
Employees for any deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses paid in the year of
initial participation in the Purchaser Plans.   (c) Except as required by
applicable Law, Purchaser shall be responsible for all Liabilities with
respect to Transferred Employees attributable to their accrued and unused
vacation, sick days and personal days through the Initial Closing Date or, in
the case of the Subsequent Transferred Employees, the Subsequent Transfer
Date. Schedule 7.10(c) to this Agreement contains a true and correct list of
all such Liabilities as of the payroll date ending immediately prior to the
Initial Closing Date described in this Section 7.10(c).   (d) Sellers and
Purchaser shall take all actions necessary or appropriate so that, effective
as of the Initial Closing Date (A) Purchaser shall be designated the "plan
sponsor" (as defined in Section (3)(16)(B) of ERISA) of the Employee Benefit
Plans assumed pursuant to sections 2.1(b)(x) and 2.3(a)(ii) of this Agreement
and insurance contracts related to the Sellers\' insured health and welfare
plans are assigned by the Sellers to the Purchaser; (B) the elections,
contribution levels and coverage levels of the Initial Transferred Employees
under Seller\'s flexible spending account plans shall continue to apply until
the end of the plan year and the Transferred Employees shall be
reimbursed for claims incurred at any time during the plan year in which the
Initial Closing Date occurs from and after the Initial Closing Date on the
same basis and the same terms and conditions as immediately prior to the
Initial Closing Date; and, (C) Transferred Employees will be eligible to
participate in the Purchaser\'s 401(k) defined contribution plan; provided
that the Purchaser (or its appropriate representative) receives payroll
deduction elections from Transferred Employees, and Purchaser\'s 401(k) plan
shall provide for receipt of "direct rollovers" of benefits from the
Sellers\' 401(k) Plan.   (e) The Purchaser\'s health and welfare plan shall
provide continuation coverage under COBRA to all "Mand A Qualified
Beneficiaries" (as defined in Treasury Regulation 54.4980B-9, QandA-4;) in
accordance with the terms of the Purchaser\'s health plan; provided that,
during the period between the Initial Closing Date and the Subsequent Closing
Date, the Subsequent Transferred Employees shall continue to participate in a
health and welfare of the Seller or a health and welfare plan of the selling
group (as defined in Treasury Regulation 54.4980B-9, QandA-3;).    
39    (f) On or prior to December 9, 2003, Purchaser shall pay the
Transferred Employees the transaction bonuses listed on Schedule
2.3(a)(viii). With respect to such transaction bonuses, Purchaser shall
satisfy any tax withholding obligation and shall be responsible for payment
of the employer contributions for FICA and FUTA required by Law with respect
to each such Transferred Employee.   7.11 Confidentiality. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary set forth herein or in any other agreement to which
the parties hereto are parties or by which they are bound, the obligations of
confidentiality contained herein and in the confidentiality agreement between
Purchaser and Company dated November 14, 2002, as they relate to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, shall not apply to the tax
structure or tax treatment of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and each party hereto (and any employee, representative, or agent
of any party hereto) may disclose to any and all persons, without limitation
of any kind, the tax structure and tax treatment of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and all materials of any kind
(including opinions or other tax analysis) that are provided to such party
relating to such tax treatment and tax structure; provided, however, that
such disclosure shall not include the name (or other identifying information
not relevant to the tax structure or tax treatment) of any person and shall
not include information for which nondisclosure is reasonably necessary in
order to comply with applicable securities laws.   7.12 Tax Reporting.
Sellers and Purchaser agree that the purchase and sale of the Purchased
Assets pursuant to this Agreement is intended to be treated as a taxable sale
for federal, state and local income tax purposes and, accordingly, will
consistently report it as such and will not take any actions, and will cause
their Affiliates not to take any actions, which are inconsistent with such
treatment.   7.13 Assumption in Bankruptcy.   (a) In the event that after
the execution of this Agreement a Seller files a voluntary petition or is the
subject of an involuntary petition for relief under Chapter 11 of the U.S.
Bankruptcy Code (a "WLNK Bankruptcy Filing"), such Seller hereby agrees, to
the extent permitted by Law, to seek assumption of this Agreement and each of
the Documents as soon as possible after the filing of such petition.   (b)
In the event of a WLNK Bankruptcy Filing, such Seller hereby agrees, to the
extent permitted by Law, to seek assumption as soon as possible thereafter of
any contract for which a consent, waiver, authorization or approval of a
third party was required but not sought or obtained to the extent that, prior
to or after such WLNK Bankruptcy Filing, any such third party has notified
Seller that the assignment of such contract was void and/or that Seller is in
breach of such contract as a result of the assignment thereof to
the Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement.   (c) In the event that any funds
are paid to any Seller or any of its subsidiaries in respect of the Business
on or after the Initial Closing Date, all such funds shall be (i) received
and held in trust by such Seller or subsidiary of a Seller and (ii)
immediately transferred to Purchaser by wire transfer in same day funds, free
and clear of any Encumbrances.     40    7.14 No Negotiation. Neither
the Sellers nor any of their Affiliates (and their respective officers,
directors, employees, accountants, consultants, legal counsel, financial
advisors, agents and other representatives (collectively, "Representatives")
shall directly or indirectly solicit, initiate, encourage or entertain any
inquiries or proposals or offer (including, without limitation, any proposal
or offer to its stockholders) from any Person, discuss or negotiate with,
provide any nonpublic information to or consider the merits of any inquiries
or proposals from any Person (other than Purchaser) relating to any business
combination transaction involving Sellers, including, without limitation, the
sale of Sellers\' stock, the merger or consolidation of Sellers or the sale
of Sellers\' business or any of the assets (other than in the Ordinary Course
of Business); enter into or maintain or continue discussions or negotiate
with any Person in furtherance of such inquiries; enter into any agreement
with respect to any such transaction; or authorize or knowingly permit any of
Sellers\' or their Affiliates\' Representatives, to take any such
action. Sellers shall notify Purchaser of any such inquiry or proposal
within twenty-four (24) hours of receipt or awareness of the same by Sellers
and shall promptly furnish a copy of any such written proposal or a detailed
description of any such oral proposal to Purchaser. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, it is being hereby agreed by Parent, Purchaser and Sellers that
this Section 7.14 shall not in any way be applicable to the Excluded Assets
or Liabilities.   7.15 Change of Name; Use of Names. As soon as practicable
after the Initial Closing Date, each Seller will change its corporate or
limited partnership name, as applicable, to such other name as does not
contain the word "WebLink". After the Initial Closing Date, Sellers shall not
have any right, title or interest in or to, the name WebLink Wireless and all
related Marks; provided, however, that Sellers shall have until November 15,
2004 to replace stationery and other documents and forms, and to replace or
repaint signs, vehicles and other items, that on the Initial Closing Date
bear the "WebLink Wireless" or other related Marks, during which period of
time Sellers may use such Marks on inventory, documents, forms and other
items that have not yet been replaced or repainted.   ARTICLE VIII

other terms or provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full
force and effect so long    44   as the economic or legal substance of
the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially
adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other
provision is invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced, the parties
hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect
the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable
manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated as
originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible.   9.10 Binding
Effect; Assignment. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the

rights or obligations hereunder may be made by any of Sellers or Purchaser,
directly or indirectly (by operation of law or otherwise), without the prior
written consent of the other party hereto and any attempted
assignment without the required consents shall be void; provided, however,
that Purchaser may assign this Agreement and any or all rights or obligations
hereunder (including, without limitation, Purchaser\'s rights to purchase the
Purchased Assets) to any Affiliate of Purchaser, provided that Purchaser
shall not be relieved of such obligations. Upon any such permitted
assignment, the references in this Agreement to Purchaser shall also apply to
any such assignee unless the context otherwise requires.   9.11 Non-
Recourse. Except as set forth in the Indemnification Agreement, no past,
present or future director, officer, employee, incorporator, member, partner,

hereby and thereby.   9.12 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in
