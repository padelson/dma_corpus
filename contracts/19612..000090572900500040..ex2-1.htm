<P ALIGN="CENTER"><U><B>AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER</B></U></P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This Agreement and Plan of Merger (this "<B><I>Plan of Merger</B></I>") is made as of August 21, 2000, between Shoreline Financial Corporation, a Michigan corporation, headquartered
at 823 Riverview Drive, Benton Harbor, Michigan 49022 ("<B><I>Shoreline</B></I>"), and Chemical Financial Corporation, a Michigan corporation ("<B><I>Chemical</B></I>"), headquartered at 333 East Main Street, Midland, Michigan 48640.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Chemical and Shoreline desire that Shoreline and its subsidiaries become affiliated with Chemical. The affiliation would be effected through the merger of Shoreline with and into
Chemical in accordance with this Plan of Merger and the Business Corporation Act of the State of Michigan, as amended (the "<B><I>Michigan Act</B></I>"). The transactions contemplated by, and described in, this Plan of Merger are referred to as the "<B><I>Merger</B></I>."</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It is intended that, for federal tax purposes, the Merger qualify as a reorganization under the provisions of Section 368 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "<B><I>
Internal Revenue Code</B></I>"). It is also intended that, for accounting and financial reporting purposes, the Merger shall be accounted for as a pooling-of-interests.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As a condition to, and concurrently with the execution of, this Plan of Merger, Shoreline and Chemical are entering into a Stock Option Agreement attached as <B>Exhibit A</B> (the "<B>
<I>Option Agreement</B></I>"). Shoreline's execution and delivery of the Option Agreement is an inducement for Chemical to enter into this Plan of Merger.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In consideration of the representations, warranties, and covenants contained in this Plan of Merger, the parties agree:</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><I>ARTICLE I - THE TRANSACTION</I></P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Subject to the terms and conditions of this Plan of Merger, the Merger shall be carried out in the following manner: </P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1.1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <I>Merger of Shoreline with and into Chemical</I>. Subject to the terms and conditions herein, at the Effective Time, Shoreline shall be merged with and into Chemical. Shoreline
and Chemical are each sometimes referred to as a "<B><I>Constituent Corporation</B></I>" prior to the Merger. At the Effective Time, the Constituent Corporations shall become a single corporation, which corporation shall be Chemical (the "<B><I>Surviving Corporation</B></I>"). The effect of the Merger
upon each of the Constituent Corporations and the Surviving Corporation shall be as provided in Chapter Seven of the Michigan Act with respect to the merger of domestic corporations. If Chemical is advised by its independent tax accountants that a
different corporate structure for the transactions contemplated by this Plan of Merger would be more advantageous to Chemical from a financial, tax, or accounting perspective, then Shoreline shall cooperate with Chemical to effect a restructuring of these
transactions; provided, that such restructuring is presented prior to the Shareholders' Meeting (as defined below), the Merger continues to qualify as a tax-free reorganization under the Internal Revenue Code, the Effective Time of the Merger is not
delayed by more than 30 days, and the<BR>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2.3.2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <I>Chemical</I>. If the Upset Condition occurs and Chemical receives an Increase Notice pursuant to the preceding Section, Chemical shall either accept or decline the Adjusted
Rate by delivering written notice of its decision to Shoreline at or before 5 p.m. Midland, Michigan time on the second business day after receipt of the Increase Notice (the "<B><I>Acceptance Period</B></I>").

declines the Adjusted Rate within the Acceptance Period or fails to deliver written notice of its decision to accept or decline or the Adjusted Rate within the Acceptance Period, the Merger shall be abandoned and this Agreement shall thereupon terminate
without further action by Shoreline or Chemical effective as of 5 p.m. Midland, Michigan time on the business day following the expiration of the Acceptance Period; provided, that if Chemical so declines the Adjusted Rate or so fails to deliver written
notice of its decision to accept or decline the Adjusted Rate within the Acceptance Period, Shoreline may, by written notice delivered to Chemical at or before 5 p.m. Midland, Michigan time on the business day following the expiration of the of the
Acceptance Period, elect to proceed with the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Plan of Merger on the basis of the Exchange Rate set forth in Section (<I>Conversion of Shoreline Common Stock</I>), subject to adjustment as provided in Section (<I>Adjustments</I>), and, upon such election, no abandonment of the Merger or termination of this Plan of Merger shall be deemed to have occurred and this Plan of

the account of, Chemical directors or employees pursuant to restricted stock, deferred stock compensation, thrift, employee stock purchase, and other compensation or benefit plans of Chemical. Further, no adjustment shall be made in the event of the
issuance of additional shares of Chemical Common Stock or other securities pursuant to a public offering, private placement, or an acquisition of one or more banks, corporations, or business assets as authorized by the board of directors of Chemical or a
duly authorized committee of the board.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2.4.4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<I>Changes in Capital.</I> Subject only to making any adjustment provided above and related computations prescribed by this Section, nothing contained in this Plan of

cease to be a shareholder of Shoreline and shall have no rights as a shareholder of Shoreline. Each stock certificate representing shares of Shoreline Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time ("<B><I>Old Certificates</B></I>") shall then be considered to represent shares of Chemical Common Stock and the right, if any, to receive cash in lieu of fractional shares, all as provided in this Plan of Merger.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2.8.2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <I>Exchange Agent</I>. On or prior to the Effective Time, Chemical will deliver to Computershare, Inc. or such other bank or trust company as Chemical may designate (the "<B><I>

vote or exercise any rights of ownership with respect to such shares of Chemical Common Stock, except that it shall receive and hold all dividends or other distributions paid or distributed with respect to such shares for the account of the record holders
entitled to such shares.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2.8.3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <I>New Stock Registrations</I>. Chemical shall cause the Exchange Agent to promptly register the shares of Chemical Common Stock issuable to former Shoreline shareholders of

by the Exchange Agent; provided, that with respect to each former Shoreline shareholder, the Exchange Agent shall have received all of the Old Certificates held by that shareholder, or an affidavit of loss and indemnity bond for such certificate or
certificates, together with properly executed transmittal materials; and such certificates, transmittal materials, affidavits, and bonds are in a form and condition reasonably acceptable to Chemical and the Exchange Agent. </P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2.8.4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <I>Dividends Pending Surrender</I>. Whenever a dividend is declared by Chemical on Chemical Common Stock that is payable to shareholders of record of Chemical Common Stock as
of a record date after the Effective Time, the declaration shall include dividends on all shares issuable under this Plan of Merger. No former shareholder of Shoreline shall be entitled to receive a distribution of any such dividend until the Exchange
Agent has received all of that shareholder's Old Certificates (or an affidavit of loss and indemnity bond for such certificates) pursuant to properly submitted transmittal materials. Upon the exchange of that shareholder's Old Certificates (or an
affidavit of loss and indemnity bond for such certificates), the shareholder shall be entitled to receive from Chemical an amount equal to all such dividends (without interest thereon and less the amount of taxes, if any, that may have been imposed or
paid thereon) declared and paid with respect to the shares of Chemical Common Stock represented thereby. If such shareholder has then elected to enroll in Chemical's dividend reinvestment program, such amount shall be credited as a cash purchase for
investment at the plan's next regular investment date.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2.8.6&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <I>Exchange Agent's Discretion</I>. The Exchange Agent shall have discretion to determine and apply reasonable rules and procedures relating to the exchange (or lack thereof)
of Old Certificates and the registration of the shares of Chemical Common Stock into which shares of Shoreline Common Stock are converted in the Merger and governing the payment for fractional shares of Shoreline Common Stock.</P>
</DIR>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2.9&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <I>No Fractional Shares</I>. No certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Chemical Common Stock shall be issued in the Merger upon the surrender of Old
Certificates. No fractional interest in any share of Chemical Common Stock resulting from the Merger shall be entitled to any part of a dividend, distribution, or stock split with respect to shares of Chemical Common Stock nor entitle the record holder to
vote or exercise any rights of a shareholder with respect to that fractional interest. In lieu of issuing any fractional share, each holder of an Old Certificate who would otherwise have been entitled to a fractional share of Chemical Common Stock upon
surrender of all Old Certificates for exchange shall be paid an amount in cash (without interest) equal to such fraction of a share multiplied by the Final Chemical Price. If the holder of record has elected to enroll in Chemical's dividend reinvestment
program, then the cash in lieu of fractional shares shall be held for reinvestment at the plan's next regular investment date.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2.10.3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <I>ISOs</I>. Each Unexercised Option that is an "incentive stock option" as defined in Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code shall be adjusted as required by Section 424 of
the Internal Revenue Code and the regulations issued thereunder so as not to constitute a modification, extension or renewal of that option within the meaning of Section 424 of the Internal Revenue Code.</P>

effectiveness of, a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission covering such options and the sale of the Chemical Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such options so long as unexercised options remain outstanding.</P>

or requesting) any such order, decree, agreement, memorandum of understanding, extraordinary supervisory letter, commitment letter or similar submission. As of the date of this Plan of Merger, Chemical knows of no reason why the regulatory approvals
referred to in Section <I>(Required Approvals)</I> cannot be obtained or why the process would be materially impeded.</P>

reasonable opinion of management to meet all reasonably anticipated credit losses, net of recoveries related to assets previously charged off as of that date, and (b) consistent with GAAP and safe and sound banking practices.</P>

Shoreline that had or in the future is reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on Shoreline, other than such changes that are caused by events and circumstances generally affecting the banking industry as a whole. No facts or circumstances

generally affecting the banking industry as a whole.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 4.8&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <I>Absence of Litigation</I>. Except as disclosed in Shoreline's filings with the SEC, there is no action, suit, proceeding, claim, arbitration, or investigation pending or
threatened by any person, including without limitation any governmental or regulatory agency, against Shoreline or any of the Subsidiaries, or the assets or business of Shoreline or any of the Subsidiaries, any of which is reasonably likely to have a

Shoreline or any Subsidiary is bound, the result of which is reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on Shoreline. Excepting any ordinary and customary banking relationships, there is no material agreement, contract, mortgage, deed of trust,
lease, commitment, indenture, note, or other instrument of which Shoreline has knowledge that another party is in material default under its obligations to Shoreline or any Subsidiary. Neither Shoreline nor any Subsidiary is a party to any contract,

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 4.18.3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <I>Assignment</I>. None of Shoreline's Leases contain a prohibition against assignment by Shoreline or any Subsidiary, by operation of law or otherwise, or any provision that

Effective Time without cost, penalty, or further obligation. There is no other agreement, contract, loan, mortgage, deed of trust, lease, commitment, indenture, note, or other instrument under which (a) a consent or approval is required, (b) a prohibited
assignment by operation of law could occur, (c) a waiver or loss of any right could occur, or (d) acceleration of any obligation could occur, in each case as a result of the execution and delivery of this Plan of Merger, or the change of control, or
merger of Shoreline or any Subsidiary or the liquidation of Shoreline upon consummation of the Merger where (w) the failure to obtain such consent or approval, (x) the violation of the prohibition against assignment, (y) the waiver or loss of any right,
or (z) the acceleration of any obligation could materially interfere with the ordinary course of business by Shoreline or any Subsidiary (or Chemical or any of its subsidiaries as their successors) or have a Material Adverse Effect on Shoreline. The
execution and delivery of this Plan of Merger by Shoreline will not subject Chemical or its subsidiaries to liability for tortious interference with contractual rights. </P>

made, not misleading.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 4.36&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <I>No Insider Trading</I>. Shoreline has reviewed its stock transfer records since January 1, 2000, and has questioned its directors and executive officers concerning known
stock transfers since that date. Based upon that investigation, Shoreline has not, and to Shoreline's knowledge (a) no director or officer of Shoreline, (b) no person related to any such director or officer by blood or marriage and residing in the same
household, and (c) no person who has been knowingly provided material nonpublic information by any one or more of these persons, has purchased or sold, or caused to be purchased or sold, any shares of Shoreline Common Stock or other securities issued by
Shoreline during any period when Shoreline was in possession of material nonpublic information or in violation of any applicable provision of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "<B><I>Exchange Act</B></I>").</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 4.37&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <I>Joint Ventures; Strategic Alliances</I>. Neither Shoreline nor any Subsidiary is, directly or indirectly, a party to or bound by any joint venture, partnership, limited

that, with respect to Shoreline and its affiliates, would prevent Chemical from accounting for the business combination to be effected by the Merger as a pooling-of-interests. Shoreline has no knowledge of any reason why the Merger would fail to qualify
as a reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code.</P>

incorporation and bylaws, promptly and duly call, give notice of, convene, and hold as soon as practicable following the date upon which the Registration Statement becomes effective, a shareholders meeting for the purpose of adopting this Plan of Merger

change its recommendation, and (c) determined to accept and recommend the Superior Proposal to the shareholders of Shoreline.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 5.5.4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <I>Superior Proposal</I>. A "<B><I>Superior Proposal</B></I>" means any bona fide unsolicited Proposal (as defined in Section (<I>Communication of Other Proposals</I>)) made by

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 5.6&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <I>Regular Dividends</I>. </P>

<DIR>
<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 5.6.1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  <I>Shoreline</I>. Shoreline shall not declare, set aside, pay, or make any dividend or other distribution or payment (whether in cash, stock, or property) with respect to, or
purchase or redeem, any shares of Shoreline Common Stock other than regular quarterly cash dividends on Shoreline Common Stock in an amount not to exceed $0.15 per share per quarter in 2000 and $0.17 per share in 2001, in each case payable on the regular
historical payment dates and in a manner consistent with Shoreline's past dividend practice. Chemical and Shoreline agree that they will cooperate to assure that, during any calendar quarter, there shall not a duplication of payment of dividends to the
holders of Shoreline Common Stock. Notwithstanding the preceding sentences, if and to the extent that the payment of a dividend in the manner provided in this Section would, in Chemical's reasonable judgment, present a significant risk that under GAAP or
the rules, regulations, or interpretations of the SEC or its staff, the Merger would not qualify for pooling-of-interests accounting treatment, that dividend shall not be paid, but an equitable adjustment shall be made to the Exchange Ratio for the amount
of the dividend not paid.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 5.6.2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <I>Chemical</I>. Subject to applicable legal and regulatory restrictions, and subject to the Chemical board of directors discretion as to bank safety and soundness matters,
Chemical's first regular quarterly cash dividend on Chemical Common Stock with a record date following the Effective Time shall be at least $0.24 per share. Such dividend shall be payable on the regular historical payment date and in a manner consistent
with Chemical's past dividend practice.</P>
</DIR>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 5.7&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <I>Technology-Related Contracts</I>. Shoreline shall advise Chemical of all anticipated renewals or extensions of existing data processing service agreements, data processing
software license agreements, data processing hardware lease agreements, and other material technology-related licensing or servicing agreements with independent vendors ("<B><I>Technology-Related Contracts</B></I>") that will occur between the date of this Plan of Merger and the date of the Effective Time. Shoreline's material Technology-Related Contracts are contained in the Shoreline Disclosure Statement. Notwithstanding
any other provision of this Section, Shoreline shall not be obligated to take any irrevocable action, or irrevocably forego taking any action, with respect to these Technology-Related Contracts that would cause any such agreement to terminate, expire, or
be materially modified prior to the Effective Time.</P>

<DIR>
<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 5.7.1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <I>Contract Notices</I>. Shoreline shall send to each vendor, as and when permitted after the date of this Plan of Merger, such notices of nonrenewal as may be necessary or
appropriate under the terms of these Technology-Related Contracts to prevent them from automatically renewing for a term extending beyond the Effective Time. Such notices may be conditioned upon the consummation of the Merger.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 5.7.2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <I>Extensions and Renewals</I>. Shoreline shall cooperate with Chemical in negotiating with each vendor the length of any new, extension, or renewal term of these
Technology-Related Contracts in those cases where such extension or term extends beyond the Effective Time.</P>

unreasonably withheld or delayed if such agreement is necessary for Shoreline or a Subsidiary to conduct business in the ordinary course through the Effective Time).</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 5.8&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <I>Affiliates</I>.</P>

<DIR>
<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 5.8.1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  <I>Shoreline's Affiliates</I>. Shoreline shall use all reasonable efforts to cause each director, executive officer, and other person who is an "affiliate" (for purposes of
(a) Rule 145 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "<B><I>Securities Act</I> </B>"), and (b) qualifying the Merger for pooling-of-interests accounting treatment) of Shoreline to deliver to Chemical, as soon as practicable after the date of this Plan of Merger, and prior to the date of the Shoreline
Shareholders' Meeting, a written agreement, in the form of <B>Exhibit C</B> (the "<B><I>Shoreline Affiliate Agreements</I> </B>"). Shoreline shall provide a list of such affiliates within seven days of the date of this Plan of Merger and shall update such list as necessary upon the reasonable request of Chemical.
</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 5.8.2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <I>Chemical's Affiliates</I>. Chemical shall use all reasonable efforts to cause each director, executive officer, and other person who is an "affiliate" (for the purpose of
qualifying the Merger for pooling-of-interests accounting treatment) of Chemical, as soon as practicable after the date of this Plan of Merger, and prior to the date of the Chemical Shareholders' Meeting, to execute and deliver a written agreement in the
form of <B>Exhibit D</B> under which such affiliate agrees not to sell, pledge, transfer, or otherwise dispose of his or her Chemical Common Stock during any period that any such disposition would, under GAAP or the rules, regulations, or interpretations of the
SEC or its staff, disqualify the Merger for pooling-of-interests accounting treatment.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 5.8.3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <I>Publishing Operating Results</I>. Chemical shall use all reasonable efforts to publish as promptly as reasonably practical but in no event later than 45 days after the end
of the first full calendar month after the Effective Time in which there are at least 30 days of post-Merger combined operations (which month may be the month in which the Effective Time occurs), combined sales and net income figures as contemplated by
and in accordance with the terms of SEC Accounting Series Release No. 135.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 5.9.1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <I>Indemnification</I>.<I> </I>Chemical shall honor any and all rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses now existing in favor of the present and former directors
and officers of Shoreline, Shoreline Bank, or Shoreline Insurance under their articles of incorporation, charter, or bylaws included in the Disclosure Schedule which, as enforceable contractual rights, shall survive the Merger and shall, as contractual
rights, continue with respect to acts or omissions occurring before the Effective Time with the same force and effect as prior to the Effective Time. </P>

<dir>
<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 5.9.2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <I>Insurance</I>. Chemical shall use all reasonable efforts to cause the persons currently serving or having served as officers and directors of Shoreline immediately prior to
the Effective Time to be covered for a period of at least six years from the Effective Time by the directors' and officers' liability insurance policy maintained by Shoreline with respect to acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time that
were committed by such officers and directors in their capacity as such. Chemical may substitute, for Shoreline's current coverage, (a) coverage under policies maintained by Chemical that offer comparable or better coverage and amounts, and that contain
terms and conditions that, considered in the aggregate, are not materially less advantageous than Shoreline's current policy, and (b) a written undertaking by Chemical to maintain such coverage for the remaining period of the six year period provided for
by this Section. In no event shall Chemical be required to spend, directly or indirectly through Shoreline or a Subsidiary, more than $250,000 in the aggregate (the "<B><I>Insurance Amount</B></I>") to either maintain or procure insurance coverage pursuant to this Plan of Merger. Coverage under Chemical's policy shall not be considered "materially less advantageous" than Shoreline's policy because of a higher
deductible amount if Chemical undertakes in writing to pay any difference in deductible amounts. If Chemical does not advise Shoreline in writing prior to the Shoreline Shareholders' Meeting that it has procured such coverage and that it undertakes to
procure and maintain coverage that offers comparable or better coverage and amounts, and that contains terms and conditions that, considered in the aggregate, are not materially less advantageous than Shoreline's current policy for the remaining period of
the six year period provided for by this Section without regard to the Insurance Amount, Shoreline shall be permitted (after giving Chemical three Business Days prior written notice and an additional two Business Day period to purchase such coverage), in
lieu of receiving the foregoing insurance coverage, to procure tail coverage for past acts and omissions for a single premium amount not in excess of the Insurance Amount.</P>
</DIR>

<P>This Section is for the benefit of persons who are or have been directors or officers of Shoreline and shall be enforceable by such persons.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 5.10&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <I>Exclusive Commitment</I>. Except as provided below, neither Shoreline nor any of Shoreline's Representatives, attorneys, investment bankers, or agents, shall take any action
inconsistent with the intent to consummate the Merger upon the terms and conditions of this Plan of Merger. Without limiting the foregoing:</P>

<DIR>
<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 5.10.1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <I>No Solicitation</I>. Neither Shoreline nor any of Shoreline's Representatives, attorneys, investment bankers, or agents shall, directly or indirectly, (i) invite, initiate,
solicit, encourage an Acquisition Proposal; or (ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding an Acquisition Proposal unless a Fiduciary Event has occurred and continues or such discussions or negotiations are likely to lead to a Superior
Proposal. A proposal, offer, or other expression of interest concerning any tender offer, exchange offer, merger, consolidation, sale of shares, sale of assets, or assumption of liabilities not in the ordinary course, or other business combination
involving Shoreline or Shoreline Bank other than the Merger shall be referred to as an "<B><I>Acquisition Proposal</B></I>."</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 5.10.2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <I>Communication of Other Proposals</I>. Shoreline shall cause written notice to be delivered to Chemical promptly upon receipt of any Acquisition Proposal. Such notice<BR>

shall contain the material terms and conditions of the Proposal to which such notice relates. Within ten Business Days after Shoreline's receipt of an Acquisition Proposal, Shoreline shall give notice to Chemical whether or not a Fiduciary Event has
occurred or a Superior Proposal is reasonably likely to result, and if not, Shoreline's notice shall include a copy of Shoreline's unequivocal rejection of the Proposal in the form actually delivered to the person from whom the Acquisition Proposal was
received. Thereafter, Shoreline shall promptly notify Chemical of any material changes in the terms, conditions, and status of such Acquisition Proposal.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 5.10.3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <I>Furnishing Information</I>. Unless a Fiduciary Event has occurred and continues or there is a reasonable likelihood that a Superior Proposal would result, neither Shoreline
nor any of Shoreline's Representatives, investment bankers, or agents shall furnish any nonpublic information concerning Shoreline to any person who is not affiliated or under contract with Shoreline or Chemical, except as required by applicable law or
regulations. Prior to furnishing such information to any person who is not affiliated or under contract with Shoreline or Chemical, Shoreline shall receive from such person an executed confidentiality agreement with terms no less favorable to Shoreline
than those contained in its confidentiality agreement with Chemical and Shoreline shall then provide only such information as has been furnished previously to Chemical.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 5.10.4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <I>Corporate Liability for Individual's Breach</I>. For the purposes of this Section, any breach of this Section by an executive officer, director, attorney or financial
advisor of Shoreline in his or her individual capacity shall be deemed to be a breach by Shoreline.</P>
</DIR>

<P>Notwithstanding the above, no provision of this Agreement shall be construed to require either party or their directors to take any action that would violate applicable law (whether statutory or common law), rule, or regulation.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 5.11&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <I>Registration Statement</I>. Chemical shall prepare and file with the SEC under the Securities Act, the Registration Statement and the related Prospectus and Joint Proxy
Statement included as a part thereof covering the issuance by Chemical of the shares of Chemical Common Stock as contemplated by this Plan of Merger, together with such amendments as may reasonably be required for the Registration Statement to become
effective. Chemical shall provide Shoreline with reasonable opportunities to review and comment upon the Registration Statement, each amendment to the Registration Statement, and each form of the Prospectus and Joint Proxy Statement before filing.
Chemical shall provide Shoreline, upon request, with copies of all correspondence received from the SEC with respect to the Registration Statement and its amendments and with all responsive correspondence to the SEC. Chemical shall notify Shoreline of any
stop orders or threatened stop orders with respect to the Registration Statement. Shoreline shall provide to Chemical all necessary information pertaining to Shoreline promptly upon request, and to use all reasonable efforts to obtain the cooperation of
Shoreline's independent accountants, attorneys and investment bankers in connection with the preparation of the Registration Statement. In the Prospectus and Joint Proxy Statement, Chemical shall indicate that forward looking information and financial
projections have been prepared by, and are the responsibility of, Chemical.</P>

obtain each necessary approval of or consent to consummate the Merger. Chemical shall provide Shoreline with reasonable opportunities to review and comment upon such documents before filing and to make such amendments and file such supplements thereto as
Shoreline may reasonably request. Chemical shall provide Shoreline with copies of all material correspondence received from these agencies and all material responsive correspondence sent to these agencies.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 5.14.4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <I>Consents</I>. Each of Chemical and Shoreline acknowledges that certain information may not be disclosed by the other without the prior written consent of persons not
affiliated with that party. If such information is requested, then the other party shall use all reasonable efforts to obtain such prior consent and shall not be required to disclose such information unless and until such prior consent has been obtained.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 5.15.3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <I>Excepted Information</I>. The provisions of this Section shall not preclude Chemical or Shoreline, or their respective subsidiaries, from using or disclosing information

received from any other person who is not affiliated with a party and who is not under any obligation to keep such information confidential, or reasonably required to be included in any filing or application required by any governmental or regulatory agency
 .</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 5.15.4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <I>Prohibit Insider Trading</I>. Chemical and Shoreline shall each take responsible steps to assure that any person who receives nonpublic information concerning the Merger or

Shoreline Common Stock, any securities convertible into such stock or any other rights to acquire such stock, except in a fiduciary capacity for a customer as to which it has no beneficial interest, and except as permitted for purposes other than a
business combination under the pooling-of-interests method of accounting and provided that no more than a permitted number of shares have been acquired for such permissible purposes; and</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (b)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <I>No Change of Equity Interest</I>. Neither Chemical nor Shoreline, respectively, shall in any manner change the equity interest of Chemical Common Stock or Shoreline Common
Stock, respectively, between the date of this Plan of Merger and the consummation of the Merger, including without limitation distributions (other than ordinary and customary cash and stock dividends) to shareholders and additional issuances, exchanges,
and retirements of securities. </P>
</DIR>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 5.19.3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <I>Stock Repurchase Programs</I>. Immediately prior to the execution of this Plan of Merger, Chemical and Shoreline shall rescind their respective stock purchase programs and
discontinue the repurchase of their respective shares under such programs and shall make appropriate public disclosures of such recission and discontinuation.</P>
</DIR>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 5.20&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <I>Public Announcements</I>. Chemical and Shoreline shall cooperate with each other in the development and distribution of all news releases and other public information

carrying out this Plan of Merger, and incident to the consummation of the Merger. Each party shall pay the fees and expenses of any investment banker engaged by that party. The costs of all filing fees pertaining to the Registration Statement shall be
paid by Chemical. The costs of printing and mailing the Prospectus and Joint Proxy Statement to their respective shareholders shall be borne by Chemical and by Shoreline.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 9.6&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <I>Specific Enforcement</I>. The parties each agree that, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Plan of Merger, in the event of a breach by a party to this Plan of
Merger, money damages will be inadequate and not susceptible of computation because of the unique nature of Shoreline, the subsidiaries, and the Merger. Therefore, the parties each agree that a federal or state court of competent jurisdiction shall have
authority, subject to the rules of law and equity, to specifically enforce the provisions of this Plan of Merger by injunctive order or such other equitable means as may be determined in the court's discretion. </P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 9.7&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <I>Jurisdiction; Jury</I>. The parties acknowledge that jurisdiction and venue may be permissible in more than one jurisdiction or court district. Chemical and Shoreline each
hereby agree not to assert any defense of improper jurisdiction or venue and each waive their right to a trial by jury.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 9.8&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <I>Waiver</I>. Any of the terms or conditions of this Plan of Merger may be waived in writing at any time by action taken by the board of directors of a party, a duly authorized
committee thereof, or a duly authorized officer of such party. The failure of any party at any time or times to require performance of any provision of this Plan of Merger shall in no manner affect such party's right at a later time to enforce the same
provision. No waiver by any party of any condition, or of the breach of any term, covenant, representation, or warranty contained in this Plan of Merger, whether by conduct or otherwise, in any one or more instances shall be deemed to be or construed as a
further or continuing waiver of any such condition or breach, or as a waiver of any other condition or of the breach of any other term, covenant, representation, or warranty.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 9.9&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <I>Notices</I>. All notices, requests, demands, and other communications under this Plan of Merger shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given and effective
immediately if delivered or sent and received by a fax transmission (if receipt by the intended recipient is confirmed by telephone and if hard copy is delivered by overnight delivery service the next day), a hand delivery, or a nationwide overnight
delivery service (all fees prepaid) to the following addresses:</P>
