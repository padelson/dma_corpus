 _AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER_

  

 This Agreement and Plan of Merger (this " _Plan of Merger_ ") is made as of August 21, 2000, between Shoreline Financial Corporation, a Michigan corporation, headquartered at 823 Riverview Drive, Benton Harbor, Michigan 49022 (" _Shoreline_ "), and Chemical Financial Corporation, a Michigan corporation (" _Chemical_ "), headquartered at 333 East Main Street, Midland, Michigan 48640.

  

 Chemical and Shoreline desire that Shoreline and its subsidiaries become affiliated with Chemical. The affiliation would be effected through the merger of Shoreline with and into Chemical in accordance with this Plan of Merger and the Business Corporation Act of the State of Michigan, as amended (the " _Michigan Act_ "). The transactions contemplated by, and described in, this Plan of Merger are referred to as the " _Merger_."

  

 It is intended that, for federal tax purposes, the Merger qualify as a reorganization under the provisions of Section 368 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _ Internal Revenue Code_ "). It is also intended that, for accounting and financial reporting purposes, the Merger shall be accounted for as a pooling-of-interests.

  

 As a condition to, and concurrently with the execution of, this Plan of Merger, Shoreline and Chemical are entering into a Stock Option Agreement attached as Exhibit A (the "  _Option Agreement_ "). Shoreline\'s execution and delivery of the Option Agreement is an inducement for Chemical to enter into this Plan of Merger.

  

 In consideration of the representations, warranties, and covenants contained in this Plan of Merger, the parties agree:

  

 _ARTICLE I - THE TRANSACTION_

  

 Subject to the terms and conditions of this Plan of Merger, the Merger shall be carried out in the following manner: 

  

 1.1 _Merger of Shoreline with and into Chemical_. Subject to the terms and conditions herein, at the Effective Time, Shoreline shall be merged with and into Chemical. Shoreline and Chemical are each sometimes referred to as a " _Constituent Corporation_ " prior to the Merger. At the Effective Time, the Constituent Corporations shall become a single corporation, which corporation shall be Chemical (the " _Surviving Corporation_ "). The effect of the Merger upon each of the Constituent Corporations and the Surviving Corporation shall be as provided in Chapter Seven of the Michigan Act with respect to the merger of domestic corporations. If Chemical is advised by its independent tax accountants that a different corporate structure for the transactions contemplated by this Plan of Merger would be more advantageous to Chemical from a financial, tax, or accounting perspective, then Shoreline shall cooperate with Chemical to effect a restructuring of these transactions; provided, that such restructuring is presented prior to the Shareholders\' Meeting (as defined below), the Merger continues to qualify as a tax-free reorganization under the Internal Revenue Code, the Effective Time of the Merger is not delayed by more than 30 days, and the   alternative structure does not alter or change the amount or kind of
consideration to be issued to Shoreline\'s shareholders.

  

 1.2 _The Closing_. The " _Closing_ " for the Merger shall be held at such time, date, and location as may be mutually agreed by the parties. In the absence of such agreement, the Closing shall be held at the offices of Chemical at Midland, Michigan, commencing at 11 a.m. on the earliest date specified by either Chemical or Shoreline upon five Business Days\' (defined below) written notice (or at the election of Chemical, on the last Business Day of the month) after the last to occur of the following events: (a) receipt of all consents and approvals of government regulatory authorities, and the expiration of all related statutory waiting periods, legally required to consummate the Merger; and (b) approval of this Plan of Merger by the shareholders of Shoreline and Chemical. Scheduling or commencing the Closing shall not, however, constitute a waiver of the conditions precedent of either Chemical or Shoreline as set forth in Articles VI and VII, respectively. Upon completion of the Closing, Shoreline and Chemical shall each promptly execute and file the certificate of merger as required by the Michigan Act to effect the Merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ "). No party shall take any action to revoke the Certificate of Merger after its filing without the written consent of the other party. 

  

 1.3 _Effective Time of the Merger_. The Merger shall be consummated following the Closing by filing the Certificate of Merger in the manner required by law. The " _Effective Time_ " of the Merger shall be as of the time and date to be elected by Chemical and specified in the Certificate of Merger, but not later than five Business Days after the Closing occurs. As used in this Plan of Merger, the term " _Business Day _ " means any day other than a day on which The Nasdaq Stock Market (" _Nasdaq_ ") is closed.

  

 1.4 _Additional Actions_. At any time after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation may determine that deeds, assignments, or assurances or any other acts are necessary or desirable to vest, perfect, or confirm, of record or otherwise, in the Surviving Corporation its rights, title, or interest in, to, or under any of the rights, properties, or assets of Shoreline acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger, or to otherwise carry out the purposes of this Plan of Merger. Shoreline hereby grants to the Surviving Corporation an irrevocable power of attorney to execute and deliver all such deeds, assignments, and assurances and to do all acts necessary, proper, or convenient to accomplish this purpose. This irrevocable power of attorney shall only be operative following the Effective Time and at such time, the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be fully authorized in the name of Shoreline to take any and all such actions contemplated by this Plan of Merger.

  

 1.5 _Surviving Corporation_. As of and immediately after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall have the following attributes until they are subsequently changed in the manner provided by law:

   

 1.5.1 _Name_. The name of the Surviving Corporation shall be "Chemical Financial Corporation."    

 1.5.2 _Articles of Incorporation_. The articles of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be the articles of incorporation of Chemical as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, without change.

  

 1.5.3 _Bylaws_. The bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall be the bylaws of Chemical as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, without change.

  

 1.5.4 _Officers_. The officers of Chemical immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation and shall hold with the Surviving Corporation the same offices as they hold with Chemical.

  

 1.5.5 _Directors_. From and after the Effective Time, until duly changed in compliance with applicable law and the articles of incorporation of Chemical, the Board of Directors of Chemical shall consist of eleven (11) persons, including Mr. Dan L. Smith and two (2) other members of the Shoreline Board of Directors selected by Shoreline and subject to approval by the Board of Directors of Chemical, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld.

   
  

 _ARTICLE II - CONVERSION AND EXCHANGE OF SHARES_

  

 Subject to the terms and conditions of this Plan of Merger and as a result of the Merger, all Common Stock of Shoreline (" _Shoreline Common Stock_ ") shall be converted into Common Stock, $1.00 par value, of Chemical (" _Chemical Common Stock_ ") as follows:

  

 2.1 _Conversion of Shares_. As of the Effective Time:

   

 2.1.1 _Conversion of Shoreline Common Stock._ Except as provided in this Article II, each share of Shoreline Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted automatically into and become 0.64 (the " _Exchange Ratio_ ") shares of validly issued, fully paid, and non-assessable Chemical Common Stock.

  

 2.1.2 _No Conversion of Chemical Common Stock_. Each share of Chemical Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall continue to be outstanding without any change. 

  

 2.1.3 _Stock Held by Chemical_. Each share of Shoreline Common Stock, if any, held by Chemical or any of its subsidiaries for its own account, and not in a fiduciary or representative capacity for a person other than Chemical or any of its subsidiaries, shall be canceled and no consideration shall be issuable or payable with respect to any such share.

  

 2.1.4 _Shoreline Common Stock No Longer Outstanding_. Each share of Shoreline Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, as of the Effective Time, no longer be outstanding and each certificate previously representing such shares of Shoreline Common Stock shall thereafter represent only the right to receive shares of Chemical Common Stock into which such shares of Shoreline Common Stock were    converted, together with any dividends and other distributions payable
as provided in Section ( _Dividends Pending Surrender_ ), but subject to
payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares.

   

 2.2 _Upset Provision_. After a Closing is properly called pursuant to Section ( _The Closing_ ), the " _Upset Condition_ " shall exist if both of the following conditions then exist:

    

 (a) The Final Chemical Price (defined below) is less than $19.55 (the " _Floor Chemical Price_ "); and

  

 (b) The number determined by dividing the Final Chemical Price by $23.00 (the " _Initial Chemical Price_ ") is less than the number obtained by subtracting (i) 0.15 from (ii) the quotient obtained by dividing the Final Index Price (defined below) by the Initial Index Price (defined below).

   

 2.2.1 _Final Chemical Price_. The " _Final Chemical Price_ " means the average of the closing prices per share of Chemical Common Stock reported on Nasdaq for the twenty (20) consecutive full trading days ending on the sixth Business Day prior to the date of the Closing (the " _Pricing Period_ "), as reported in the _Dow Jones News/Retrieval_ system, or other equally reliable means.

  

 2.2.2 _Initial Index Price_. The " _Initial Index Price_ " means the average of the closing prices per share of each of the common stocks of the Index Companies (defined below) as reported on New York Stock Exchange (" _NYSE_ "), Nasdaq, or the American Stock Exchange (" _AMEX_ ") on August 18, 2000 (" _Initial Index Date_ "). The Initial Index Price computed as of August 18, 2000 is presented below as an illustration of the method of computation, but is subject to adjustment as provided in Sections ( _Index Adjustments_ ).

The term " _Index Companies_ " refers to the companies listed above, as the
list may be modified under Section ( _Index Exclusions_ ).

   

 2.2.3 _Final Index Price_. The " _Final Index Price_ " means the average of the average closing prices per share of each of the common stocks of the Index Companies as reported on NYSE, Nasdaq, or AMEX for each trading day during the Pricing Period.

  

 2.2.4 _Index Adjustments_. If any Index Company declares a stock dividend, stock split, or stock split-up (any such event being a " _Stock Distribution_ ") of its common stock for which the ex-dividend date, ex-split date, ex-distribution date or other comparable date (the " _Ex-Date_ ") occurs between the Initial Index Date and the end of the Pricing Period, then for purposes of the definitions in Section ( _Upset Provision_ ) the closing prices for such common stock as of the Initial Index Date and each date during the Pricing Period prior to the Ex-Date shall be adjusted so as to be comparable as of the Initial Index Date and throughout the Pricing Period in the same manner as is described in Section ( _Stock Dividends and Distributions_ ) for any Stock Distribution.

  

 2.2.5 _Index Exclusions_. There shall be excluded from the list of Index Companies any company as to which, between the Initial Index Date and the end the Pricing Period, there occurs or there is publicly announced (a) a proposed merger, acquisition, or business combination in which that company is not or will not be the survivor, (b) a tender offer, exchange offer, other transaction involving the acquisition of a majority of that company\'s common stock or assets, or (c) a reclassification, recapitalization, subdivision, spin-off, split-up, or combination of its common stock; provided that if five or more of the Index Companies are excluded pursuant to this Section, then, unless Chemical and Shoreline agree otherwise, Chemical and Shoreline shall agree upon mutually acceptable substitute Index Companies. If a company is excluded from the list of Index Companies, then the Initial Index Price and the Final Index Price shall be calculated as if the excluded company had not originally been included in the list of companies.

   

 2.3 _Rights in Upset Condition_. 

   

 2.3.1 _Shoreline_. If the Upset Condition shall then exist, Shoreline shall have the right, exercisable at any time prior to 5 p.m. Midland, Michigan time on the second business day after the last day of the Pricing Period (the " _Exercise Period_ "), to either (i) abandon the Merger and terminate this Plan of Merger (by delivering to Chemical within the Exercise Period written notice of its decision to do so) and, upon the delivery of such notice by    Shoreline, the Merger shall be abandoned and this Plan of Merger shall
immediately terminate; (ii) proceed with the Merger on the basis of the
Exchange Rate set forth in Section ( _Conversion of Shoreline Common Stock_ ),
subject to adjustment provided by Section 2.4 ( _Adjustments_ ), by
delivering to Chemical within the Exercise Period written notice of its
decision to do so or by failing to deliver any notice to Chemical pursuant to
this Section during the Exercise Period; or (iii) request Chemical to adjust
the Exchange Rate (by delivering to Chemical within the Exercise Period
written notice to such effect (an " _Increase Notice_ ")) to an Exchange Rate
computed by multiplying the then-existing Exchange Rate by a fraction that has
as its numerator the Floor Chemical Price and that has as its denominator the
Final Chemical Price (the " _Adjusted Rate _ ").

  

 2.3.2 _Chemical_. If the Upset Condition occurs and Chemical receives an Increase Notice pursuant to the preceding Section, Chemical shall either accept or decline the Adjusted Rate by delivering written notice of its decision to Shoreline at or before 5 p.m. Midland, Michigan time on the second business day after receipt of the Increase Notice (the " _Acceptance Period_ "). If Chemical accepts the Adjusted Rate within the Acceptance Period, this Plan of Merger shall remain in effect in accordance with its terms except that the Exchange Rate shall be equal to the Adjusted Rate. If Chemical declines the Adjusted Rate within the Acceptance Period or fails to deliver written notice of its decision to accept or decline or the Adjusted Rate within the Acceptance Period, the Merger shall be abandoned and this Agreement shall thereupon terminate without further action by Shoreline or Chemical effective as of 5 p.m. Midland, Michigan time on the business day following the expiration of the Acceptance Period; provided, that if Chemical so declines the Adjusted Rate or so fails to deliver written notice of its decision to accept or decline the Adjusted Rate within the Acceptance Period, Shoreline may, by written notice delivered to Chemical at or before 5 p.m. Midland, Michigan time on the business day following the expiration of the of the Acceptance Period, elect to proceed with the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Plan of Merger on the basis of the Exchange Rate set forth in Section ( _Conversion of Shoreline Common Stock_ ), subject to adjustment as provided in Section ( _Adjustments_ ), and, upon such election, no abandonment of the Merger or termination of this Plan of Merger shall be deemed to have occurred and this Plan of Merger shall remain in effect in accordance with its terms and the Closing shall thereafter occur in accordance with the terms of this Plan of Merger.

   

 2.4 _Adjustments_. The Exchange Ratio, Floor Chemical Price, Initial Chemical Price, and Final Chemical Price, and the related computations described in Sections ( _ Conversion of Shares_ ) and ( _Upset Provision_ ) shall be adjusted in the manner provided in this Section upon the occurrence of any of the following events:

   

 2.4.1 _Stock Dividends and Distributions._ If Chemical declares a Stock Distribution of Chemical Common Stock to its holders prior to the Effective Time, then:

   

 (a) If the record date for the Stock Distribution occurs prior to the Effective Time, then the Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted by multiplying it by that ratio (the " _Chemical Adjustment Factor_ ") (i) the numerator of which shall be the total number of shares of Chemical Common Stock that are outstanding as of the     record date for such Stock Distribution plus the additional number of
shares (including the aggregate of all possible fractional shares) to be
issued in the Stock Distribution computed as of that record date; and (ii) the
denominator of which shall be the total number of shares of Chemical Common
Stock outstanding as of the Stock Distribution\'s record date; and

  

 (b) If the Ex-Date for the Stock Distribution occurs before the end of the Pricing Period, then the Floor Chemical Price and the Initial Chemical Price (and if the Ex-Date occurs during the Pricing Period, then the closing price per share of Chemical Common Stock for each day during the Pricing Period prior to the Ex-Date) shall each be adjusted by dividing them by the Chemical Adjustment Factor.

   

 2.4.2 _Other Action Affecting Chemical Common Stock_. In the event of a reclassification of outstanding shares of Chemical Common Stock or a consolidation or merger of Chemical with or into another corporation, other than a merger in which Chemical is ultimately the surviving corporation and which merger does not result in any reclassification of Chemical Common Stock, holders of Shoreline Common Stock shall receive, in lieu of each share of Chemical Common Stock to be issued in exchange for Shoreline Common Stock based on the Exchange Ratio, the kind and amount of shares of Chemical stock, other securities, money, and/or property receivable upon such reclassification, consolidation, or merger by holders of Chemical Common Stock with respect to each share of Chemical Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such reclassification, consolidation, or merger.

  

 2.4.3 _Authorized Issuances._ Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Section, no adjustment shall be made in the event of the issuance of additional shares of Chemical Common Stock pursuant to the dividend reinvestment plan of Chemical, pursuant to the exercise of stock options awarded under director or employee stock option plans of Chemical, or upon the grant or sale of shares or rights to receive shares to, or for the account of, Chemical directors or employees pursuant to restricted stock, deferred stock compensation, thrift, employee stock purchase, and other compensation or benefit plans of Chemical. Further, no adjustment shall be made in the event of the issuance of additional shares of Chemical Common Stock or other securities pursuant to a public offering, private placement, or an acquisition of one or more banks, corporations, or business assets as authorized by the board of directors of Chemical or a duly authorized committee of the board.

  

 2.4.4 _Changes in Capital._ Subject only to making any adjustment provided above and related computations prescribed by this Section, nothing contained in this Plan of Merger shall preclude Chemical from amending its restated articles of incorporation to change its capital structure or from issuing additional shares of Chemical Common Stock, preferred stock, shares of other capital stock, or securities that are convertible into shares of capital stock.

   

 2.5 _Increase in Outstanding Shares of Shoreline Common Stock_. If the number of shares of Shoreline Common Stock outstanding is greater than 11,511,486 for any reason whatsoever    (whether or not such increase constitutes a breach of this Plan of
Merger), other than as a result of Permitted Issuances (defined below); then
the Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted by multiplying it by a fraction (a) the
numerator of which shall be 11,511,486; and (b) the denominator of which
shall be the total number of shares of Shoreline Common Stock outstanding as
of the Effective Time of the Merger, excluding Permitted Issuances. "
_Permitted Issuances_ " include and are limited to (i) the issuance of not
more than 65,949 shares upon exercise of currently outstanding Shoreline stock
options awarded under the Shoreline Financial Corporation Stock Incentive Plan
of 1996, or the Shoreline Financial Corporation Stock Incentive Plan of 2000
(the " _Option Plans_ "), and (ii) the issuance of shares of Shoreline Common
Stock under Shoreline\'s dividend reinvestment plan.

  

 2.6 _Decrease in Shoreline\'s Shareholders\' Equity_. If as of the Final Statement Date (as defined below), the "Adjusted Shareholders\' Equity" of Shoreline, as set forth on the Closing Balance Sheet (as defined below), is less than $86,500,000 then Chemical shall have the right abandon the Merger and terminate the Plan of Merger; provided Chemical delivers such notice of its decision to do so to Shoreline in writing within three Business Days of its receipt of the Closing Balance Sheet. 

   

 2.6.1 _Adjusted Shareholders\' Equity_. For the purposes of the Closing Balance Sheet, Shoreline\'s _"Adjusted Shareholders\' Equity_ " shall be Shoreline\'s "Total Shareholders\' Equity" as of the Final Statement Date (as defined below), computed in accordance with generally accepted United States accounting principles (" _GAAP_ ") and in a manner consistent with Shoreline\'s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 1999 and Form 10-Q for the six months ended June 30, 2000, except such total shareholders\' equity shall be adjusted so that no expense shall have been accrued or deduction shall have been made for any of the following:

   

 (a) Any and all transaction-related expenses that Shoreline has or will incur as a result of the Merger (including, without limitation, its legal, accounting, actuarial, printing, mailing, tax preparation, and investment bankers fees and expenses);

  

 (b) Any and all special provisions for loan losses or other charges taken by Shoreline to establish reserves in anticipation of the Merger with the consent of Chemical;

  

 (c) Any and all additional provision to Shoreline\'s loan loss reserve above such amount necessary so that such loan loss reserve as a percentage of total loans as of the Final Statement Date is at least equal to Shoreline\'s loan loss reserve as a percentage of total loans as of June 30, 2000; 

  

 (d) Any and all accruals for severance pay, "stay bonuses" or other compensation expense accrued as a result of the Merger as permitted by this Plan of Merger or with Chemical\'s consent; and

  

 (e) The amount under the "accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss)" balance sheet line item.   

 2.6.2 _Closing Balance Sheet_. Shoreline shall prepare, and cause its independent accountants Crowe Chizek and Co. (" _Crow_ e") to review, a consolidated balance sheet of Shoreline as of the Final Statement Date (the " _Closing Balance Sheet_ ") and the computation of Shoreline\'s Adjusted Shareholders\' Equity as of the Final Statement Date, determined in accordance with this Plan of Merger. The Closing Balance Sheet shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP and in a manner consistent with the audited consolidated balance sheet of Shoreline as of December 31, 1999, excluding footnotes. Crowe\'s review shall be governed by mutually agreed upon procedures and upon completion of such review, Crowe shall issue a report setting forth the Adjusted Shareholders\' Equity (the " _Closing Report_ "). 

  

 2.6.3 _Final Statement Date_. After the shareholders of Shoreline and Chemical have approved the Merger as required by this Plan of Merger, and after all regulatory approvals required by law to consummate the Merger have been obtained, but prior to the expiration of all related statutory waiting periods, the parties may agree upon a month-end or, if not, either party may specify the preceding month-end as the date of the Closing Balance Sheet (the " _Final Statement Date_ ") and direct Crowe to prepare the Closing Report by written notice to Crowe and the other party, delivered prior to the Final Statement Due specified in such notice. The parties shall use all reasonable efforts to cause Crowe to prepare and deliver to Chemical and Shoreline the Closing Report not later than 14 days the agreement upon a month end or after the Final Statement Date, whichever is later. In the event the Closing does not occur within one month after the designated Final Statement Date, either party may specify a new Final Statement Date and direct Crowe to prepare a Closing Report as of such date pursuant to notice in accordance with the provisions set forth above applicable to the initial designation of such date. The fees and expenses of Crowe incurred pursuant to this Article shall be paid by Chemical.

   

 2.7 _Cessation of Shareholder Status_. As of the Effective Time, each record holder of shares of Shoreline Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to be a shareholder of Shoreline and shall have no rights as a shareholder of Shoreline. Each stock certificate representing shares of Shoreline Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (" _Old Certificates_ ") shall then be considered to represent shares of Chemical Common Stock and the right, if any, to receive cash in lieu of fractional shares, all as provided in this Plan of Merger.

  

 2.8 _Surrender of Old Certificates and Distribution of Chemical Common Stock_. After the Effective Time, Old Certificates shall be exchangeable by holders for new stock certificates representing the number of shares of Chemical Common Stock to which such holders shall be entitled in the following manner:

   

 2.8.1 _Transmittal Materials_. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Chemical shall send or cause to be sent to each record holder of Shoreline Common Stock as of the Effective Time transmittal materials for use in exchanging that holder\'s Old Certificates pursuant to receiving Chemical Common Stock certificates and either enrolling or not enrolling in Chemical\'s dividend reinvestment program. The transmittal materials will contain instructions with respect to the surrender of Old Certificates and the selection of    these exchange options. In the absence of a selection among these
exchange options, the shareholder shall receive Chemical Common Stock
certificates without enrolling in Chemical\'s dividend reinvestment program.

  

 2.8.2 _Exchange Agent_. On or prior to the Effective Time, Chemical will deliver to Computershare, Inc. or such other bank or trust company as Chemical may designate (the " _ Exchange Agent_ "), written notice of the number of shares of Chemical Common Stock issuable in the Merger and a commitment to pay the amount of cash payable for fractional shares in the Merger when and as determined. The Exchange Agent shall not be entitled to vote or exercise any rights of ownership with respect to such shares of Chemical Common Stock, except that it shall receive and hold all dividends or other distributions paid or distributed with respect to such shares for the account of the record holders entitled to such shares.

  

 2.8.3 _New Stock Registrations_. Chemical shall cause the Exchange Agent to promptly register the shares of Chemical Common Stock issuable to former Shoreline shareholders of record in such manner, in the names, and to the addresses that appear on Shoreline\'s stock records as of the Effective Time, or in such other name or to such other address as may be specified by the shareholder of record in transmittal documents received by the Exchange Agent; provided, that with respect to each former Shoreline shareholder, the Exchange Agent shall have received all of the Old Certificates held by that shareholder, or an affidavit of loss and indemnity bond for such certificate or certificates, together with properly executed transmittal materials; and such certificates, transmittal materials, affidavits, and bonds are in a form and condition reasonably acceptable to Chemical and the Exchange Agent. 

  

 2.8.4 _Dividends Pending Surrender_. Whenever a dividend is declared by Chemical on Chemical Common Stock that is payable to shareholders of record of Chemical Common Stock as of a record date after the Effective Time, the declaration shall include dividends on all shares issuable under this Plan of Merger. No former shareholder of Shoreline shall be entitled to receive a distribution of any such dividend until the Exchange Agent has received all of that shareholder\'s Old Certificates (or an affidavit of loss and indemnity bond for such certificates) pursuant to properly submitted transmittal materials. Upon the exchange of that shareholder\'s Old Certificates (or an affidavit of loss and indemnity bond for such certificates), the shareholder shall be entitled to receive from Chemical an amount equal to all such dividends (without interest thereon and less the amount of taxes, if any, that may have been imposed or paid thereon) declared and paid with respect to the shares of Chemical Common Stock represented thereby. If such shareholder has then elected to enroll in Chemical\'s dividend reinvestment program, such amount shall be credited as a cash purchase for investment at the plan\'s next regular investment date.

  

 2.8.5 _Stock Transfers_. After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on Shoreline\'s stock transfer books of the shares of Shoreline Common Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Old Certificates are properly presented for transfer, they shall be canceled and exchanged for shares of Chemical Common Stock as provided in this Plan of Merger. After the Effective    Time, ownership of such shares as are represented by any Old
Certificates may be transferred only on the stock transfer records of
Chemical.

  

 2.8.6 _Exchange Agent\'s Discretion_. The Exchange Agent shall have discretion to determine and apply reasonable rules and procedures relating to the exchange (or lack thereof) of Old Certificates and the registration of the shares of Chemical Common Stock into which shares of Shoreline Common Stock are converted in the Merger and governing the payment for fractional shares of Shoreline Common Stock.

   

 2.9 _No Fractional Shares_. No certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Chemical Common Stock shall be issued in the Merger upon the surrender of Old Certificates. No fractional interest in any share of Chemical Common Stock resulting from the Merger shall be entitled to any part of a dividend, distribution, or stock split with respect to shares of Chemical Common Stock nor entitle the record holder to vote or exercise any rights of a shareholder with respect to that fractional interest. In lieu of issuing any fractional share, each holder of an Old Certificate who would otherwise have been entitled to a fractional share of Chemical Common Stock upon surrender of all Old Certificates for exchange shall be paid an amount in cash (without interest) equal to such fraction of a share multiplied by the Final Chemical Price. If the holder of record has elected to enroll in Chemical\'s dividend reinvestment program, then the cash in lieu of fractional shares shall be held for reinvestment at the plan\'s next regular investment date.

  

 2.10 _Stock Options_.

   

 2.10.1 _Conversion of Options_. Each unexercised stock option (" _Unexercised Options_ ") under the Option Plans outstanding at the Effective Time shall become, at the Effective Time, an option to purchase that number of shares of Chemical Common Stock equal to the number of shares of Shoreline Common Stock subject to such Unexercised Option multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, rounded to the nearest whole share.

  

 2.10.2 _Option Exercises_. The exercise price per share of Chemical Common Stock under each Unexercised Option shall be equal to the exercise price per share of the Shoreline Common Stock that was purchasable under that option divided by the Exchange Ratio (rounded to the nearest whole cent).

  

 2.10.3 _ISOs_. Each Unexercised Option that is an "incentive stock option" as defined in Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code shall be adjusted as required by Section 424 of the Internal Revenue Code and the regulations issued thereunder so as not to constitute a modification, extension or renewal of that option within the meaning of Section 424 of the Internal Revenue Code.

  

 2.10.4 _Option Plans Assumption_. As of the Effective Time of the Merger, Chemical shall assume the rights, duties and obligations of Shoreline under the Option Plans, as amended by this Plan of Merger. The duration and other terms and conditions of the assumed options shall be the same as the original Shoreline options, except that any reference to Shoreline shall be considered to be references to Chemical. In no event shall any    subsequent merger or amendment of the Option Plans adversely affect the
terms, rights, benefits, and features of the Unexercised Options without the
consent of the holders thereof.

  

 2.10.5 _Registration_. Chemical shall use all reasonable efforts to file before or promptly after the Effective Time, and use all reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness of, a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission covering such options and the sale of the Chemical Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such options so long as unexercised options remain outstanding.

  

 2.10.6 _No New Options_. At the Effective Time, the Option Plans shall be terminated with respect to the granting of any additional options or option rights.

 4.33 _Allowance for Loan Losses_. The allowance for loan losses as reflected in Shoreline\'s Financial Statements and Call Reports for the fiscal year ended December 31, 1999, and the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2000, was in the reasonable opinion of management (a) adequate to meet all reasonably anticipated loan and lease losses, net of recoveries related to loans previously charged off as of those dates, and (b) consistent with GAAP and safe and sound banking practices.

In originating, underwriting, servicing, purchasing, selling, transferring, and discharging loans, mortgages, land contracts, and other contractual obligations, either for its own account or for the account of others, Shoreline Bank has complied with all applicable terms and conditions of such obligations and with all applicable laws, regulations, rules, contractual requirements, and procedures, except for incidents of noncompliance that would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on Shoreline.

  

 4.35 _Public Communications; Securities Offering_. Each annual report, quarterly report, proxy material, press release, or other communication previously sent or released by Shoreline to   Shoreline\'s shareholders or the public did not contain any untrue
statement of material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

  

 4.36 _No Insider Trading_. Shoreline has reviewed its stock transfer records since January 1, 2000, and has questioned its directors and executive officers concerning known stock transfers since that date. Based upon that investigation, Shoreline has not, and to Shoreline\'s knowledge (a) no director or officer of Shoreline, (b) no person related to any such director or officer by blood or marriage and residing in the same household, and (c) no person who has been knowingly provided material nonpublic information by any one or more of these persons, has purchased or sold, or caused to be purchased or sold, any shares of Shoreline Common Stock or other securities issued by Shoreline during any period when Shoreline was in possession of material nonpublic information or in violation of any applicable provision of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the " _Exchange Act_ ").

 4.39 _Accounting and Tax Treatment_.

Shoreline has no knowledge of any reason why the Merger would fail to qualify as a reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code.

  

 4.40 _True and Complete Information_. No schedule, statement, list, certificate, or other information furnished or to be furnished by Shoreline in connection with this Plan of Merger, including the Shoreline Disclosure Statement, contains or will contain any untrue statement of a material fact, or omits or will omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements contained therein, in light of the circumstances in which they are made, not misleading.

 5.4 _Approval of Plan of Merger by Chemical Shareholders_. Chemical, acting through its board of directors, shall, in accordance with the Michigan Act and its articles of incorporation and bylaws, promptly and duly call, give notice of, convene, and hold as soon as practicable following the date upon which the Registration Statement becomes effective, a shareholders meeting for the purpose of adopting this Plan of Merger (the " _Chemical Shareholders\' Meeting_ "). At such meeting,   the board of directors of Chemical shall unanimously recommend that its
shareholders vote for approval of this Plan of Merger and use all reasonable
efforts to solicit from its shareholders proxies to vote on the proposal to
approve this Plan of Merger and to secure a quorum at such meeting.

  

 5.5 _Approval of Plan of Merger by Shoreline Shareholders_. Shoreline, acting through its board of directors, shall, in accordance with the Michigan Act and its articles of incorporation and bylaws, promptly and duly call, give notice of, convene, and hold as soon as practicable following the date upon which the Registration Statement becomes effective, a shareholders meeting for the purpose of adopting this Plan of Merger (the " _Shoreline Shareholders\' Meeting_ ").

   

 5.5.1 _Board Recommendation_. Except while Shoreline has received in writing a Superior Proposal (as defined below), which proposal is still pending, at the Shoreline Shareholders\' Meeting and in any proxy materials used in connection with the Shoreline Shareholders\' Meeting, the board of directors of Shoreline shall recommend that its shareholders vote for approval of this Plan of Merger.

  

 5.5.2 _Solicitation of Proxies_. Except while a Fiduciary Event has occurred and continues:

   

 (a) Shoreline shall use all reasonable efforts to solicit from its shareholders proxies to vote on the proposal to approve this Plan of Merger and to secure a quorum at the Shoreline Shareholders\' Meeting. 

  

 (b) Except while Shoreline has received in writing a Superior Proposal that is still pending, Shoreline shall use all reasonable efforts to secure the vote of shareholders required by the Michigan Act and Shoreline\'s articles of incorporation and bylaws to approve this Plan of Merger.

   

 5.5.3 _Fiduciary Event_. A " _Fiduciary Event_ " shall have occurred when the board of directors of Shoreline has (a) received in writing a Superior Proposal (as defined below) that is then pending, (b) determined in good faith (having considered the advice of legal counsel) that its fiduciary duties to Shoreline\'s shareholders under applicable law would require the board of directors to so withdraw, modify, or change its recommendation, and (c) determined to accept and recommend the Superior Proposal to the shareholders of Shoreline.

  

 5.5.4 _Superior Proposal_. A " _Superior Proposal_ " means any bona fide unsolicited Proposal (as defined in Section ( _Communication of Other Proposals_ )) made by a third party on terms that the board of directors of Shoreline determines in its good faith judgment, based upon the written advice of Keefe or another financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation, to be materially more favorable to Shoreline\'s shareholders than this Plan of Merger from a financial point of view.

Chemical and Shoreline agree that they will cooperate to assure that, during any calendar quarter, there shall not a duplication of payment of dividends to the holders of Shoreline Common Stock. Notwithstanding the preceding sentences, if and to the extent that the payment of a dividend in the manner provided in this Section would, in Chemical\'s reasonable judgment, present a significant risk that under GAAP or the rules, regulations, or interpretations of the SEC or its staff, the Merger would not qualify for pooling-of-interests accounting treatment, that dividend shall not be paid, but an equitable adjustment shall be made to the Exchange Ratio for the amount of the dividend not paid.

  

 5.6.2 _Chemical_. Subject to applicable legal and regulatory restrictions, and subject to the Chemical board of directors discretion as to bank safety and soundness matters, Chemical\'s first regular quarterly cash dividend on Chemical Common Stock with a record date following the Effective Time shall be at least $0.24 per share. Such dividend shall be payable on the regular historical payment date and in a manner consistent with Chemical\'s past dividend practice.

   

 5.7 _Technology-Related Contracts_. Shoreline shall advise Chemical of all anticipated renewals or extensions of existing data processing service agreements, data processing software license agreements, data processing hardware lease agreements, and other material technology-related licensing or servicing agreements with independent vendors (" _Technology-Related Contracts_ ") that will occur between the date of this Plan of Merger and the date of the Effective Time. Shoreline\'s material Technology-Related Contracts are contained in the Shoreline Disclosure Statement. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section, Shoreline shall not be obligated to take any irrevocable action, or irrevocably forego taking any action, with respect to these Technology-Related Contracts that would cause any such agreement to terminate, expire, or be materially modified prior to the Effective Time.

   

 5.7.1 _Contract Notices_. Shoreline shall send to each vendor, as and when permitted after the date of this Plan of Merger, such notices of nonrenewal as may be necessary or appropriate under the terms of these Technology-Related Contracts to prevent them from automatically renewing for a term extending beyond the Effective Time. Such notices may be conditioned upon the consummation of the Merger.

  

 5.7.2 _Extensions and Renewals_. Shoreline shall cooperate with Chemical in negotiating with each vendor the length of any new, extension, or renewal term of these Technology-Related Contracts in those cases where such extension or term extends beyond the Effective Time.    

 5.7.3 _New Agreements_. Neither Shoreline nor any Subsidiary shall enter into any new Technology-Related Contract, except with Chemical\'s consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed if such agreement is necessary for Shoreline or a Subsidiary to conduct business in the ordinary course through the Effective Time).

   

 5.8 _Affiliates_.

   

 5.8.1 _Shoreline\'s Affiliates_. Shoreline shall use all reasonable efforts to cause each director, executive officer, and other person who is an "affiliate" (for purposes of (a) Rule 145 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the " _Securities Act_ "), and (b) qualifying the Merger for pooling-of-interests accounting treatment) of Shoreline to deliver to Chemical, as soon as practicable after the date of this Plan of Merger, and prior to the date of the Shoreline Shareholders\' Meeting, a written agreement, in the form of Exhibit C (the " _Shoreline Affiliate Agreements_ "). Shoreline shall provide a list of such affiliates within seven days of the date of this Plan of Merger and shall update such list as necessary upon the reasonable request of Chemical. 

  

 5.8.2 _Chemical\'s Affiliates_. Chemical shall use all reasonable efforts to cause each director, executive officer, and other person who is an "affiliate" (for the purpose of qualifying the Merger for pooling-of-interests accounting treatment) of Chemical, as soon as practicable after the date of this Plan of Merger, and prior to the date of the Chemical Shareholders\' Meeting, to execute and deliver a written agreement in the form of Exhibit D under which such affiliate agrees not to sell, pledge, transfer, or otherwise dispose of his or her Chemical Common Stock during any period that any such disposition would, under GAAP or the rules, regulations, or interpretations of the SEC or its staff, disqualify the Merger for pooling-of-interests accounting treatment.

  

 5.8.3 _Publishing Operating Results_. Chemical shall use all reasonable efforts to publish as promptly as reasonably practical but in no event later than 45 days after the end of the first full calendar month after the Effective Time in which there are at least 30 days of post-Merger combined operations (which month may be the month in which the Effective Time occurs), combined sales and net income figures as contemplated by and in accordance with the terms of SEC Accounting Series Release No. 135.

   

 5.9 _Indemnification and Insurance_.

   

 5.9.1 _Indemnification_. __ Chemical shall honor any and all rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses now existing in favor of the present and former directors and officers of Shoreline, Shoreline Bank, or Shoreline Insurance under their articles of incorporation, charter, or bylaws included in the Disclosure Schedule which, as enforceable contractual rights, shall survive the Merger and shall, as contractual rights, continue with respect to acts or omissions occurring before the Effective Time with the same force and effect as prior to the Effective Time.    

 5.9.2 _Insurance_. Chemical shall use all reasonable efforts to cause the persons currently serving or having served as officers and directors of Shoreline immediately prior to the Effective Time to be covered for a period of at least six years from the Effective Time by the directors\' and officers\' liability insurance policy maintained by Shoreline with respect to acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time that were committed by such officers and directors in their capacity as such. Chemical may substitute, for Shoreline\'s current coverage, (a) coverage under policies maintained by Chemical that offer comparable or better coverage and amounts, and that contain terms and conditions that, considered in the aggregate, are not materially less advantageous than Shoreline\'s current policy, and (b) a written undertaking by Chemical to maintain such coverage for the remaining period of the six year period provided for by this Section. In no event shall Chemical be required to spend, directly or indirectly through Shoreline or a Subsidiary, more than $250,000 in the aggregate (the " _Insurance Amount_ ") to either maintain or procure insurance coverage pursuant to this Plan of Merger. Coverage under Chemical\'s policy shall not be considered "materially less advantageous" than Shoreline\'s policy because of a higher deductible amount if Chemical undertakes in writing to pay any difference in deductible amounts. If Chemical does not advise Shoreline in writing prior to the Shoreline Shareholders\' Meeting that it has procured such coverage and that it undertakes to procure and maintain coverage that offers comparable or better coverage and amounts, and that contains terms and conditions that, considered in the aggregate, are not materially less advantageous than Shoreline\'s current policy for the remaining period of the six year period provided for by this Section without regard to the Insurance Amount, Shoreline shall be permitted (after giving Chemical three Business Days prior written notice and an additional two Business Day period to purchase such coverage), in lieu of receiving the foregoing insurance coverage, to procure tail coverage for past acts and omissions for a single premium amount not in excess of the Insurance Amount.

   

This Section is for the benefit of persons who are or have been directors or
officers of Shoreline and shall be enforceable by such persons.

  

 5.10 _Exclusive Commitment_. Except as provided below, neither Shoreline nor any of Shoreline\'s Representatives, attorneys, investment bankers, or agents, shall take any action inconsistent with the intent to consummate the Merger upon the terms and conditions of this Plan of Merger. Without limiting the foregoing:

   

 5.10.1 _No Solicitation_. Neither Shoreline nor any of Shoreline\'s Representatives, attorneys, investment bankers, or agents shall, directly or indirectly, (i) invite, initiate, solicit, encourage an Acquisition Proposal; or (ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding an Acquisition Proposal unless a Fiduciary Event has occurred and continues or such discussions or negotiations are likely to lead to a Superior Proposal. A proposal, offer, or other expression of interest concerning any tender offer, exchange offer, merger, consolidation, sale of shares, sale of assets, or assumption of liabilities not in the ordinary course, or other business combination involving Shoreline or Shoreline Bank other than the Merger shall be referred to as an " _Acquisition Proposal_."

  

 5.10.2 _Communication of Other Proposals_. Shoreline shall cause written notice to be delivered to Chemical promptly upon receipt of any Acquisition Proposal. Such notice    shall contain the material terms and conditions of the Proposal to which
such notice relates. Within ten Business Days after Shoreline\'s receipt of an
Acquisition Proposal, Shoreline shall give notice to Chemical whether or not a
Fiduciary Event has occurred or a Superior Proposal is reasonably likely to
result, and if not, Shoreline\'s notice shall include a copy of Shoreline\'s
unequivocal rejection of the Proposal in the form actually delivered to the
person from whom the Acquisition Proposal was received. Thereafter, Shoreline
shall promptly notify Chemical of any material changes in the terms,
conditions, and status of such Acquisition Proposal.

  

 5.10.3 _Furnishing Information_. Unless a Fiduciary Event has occurred and continues or there is a reasonable likelihood that a Superior Proposal would result, neither Shoreline nor any of Shoreline\'s Representatives, investment bankers, or agents shall furnish any nonpublic information concerning Shoreline to any person who is not affiliated or under contract with Shoreline or Chemical, except as required by applicable law or regulations. Prior to furnishing such information to any person who is not affiliated or under contract with Shoreline or Chemical, Shoreline shall receive from such person an executed confidentiality agreement with terms no less favorable to Shoreline than those contained in its confidentiality agreement with Chemical and Shoreline shall then provide only such information as has been furnished previously to Chemical.

  

 5.10.4 _Corporate Liability for Individual\'s Breach_. For the purposes of this Section, any breach of this Section by an executive officer, director, attorney or financial advisor of Shoreline in his or her individual capacity shall be deemed to be a breach by Shoreline.

to require either party or their directors to take any action that would
violate applicable law (whether statutory or common law), rule, or regulation.

  

 5.11 _Registration Statement_. Chemical shall prepare and file with the SEC under the Securities Act, the Registration Statement and the related Prospectus and Joint Proxy Statement included as a part thereof covering the issuance by Chemical of the shares of Chemical Common Stock as contemplated by this Plan of Merger, together with such amendments as may reasonably be required for the Registration Statement to become effective. Chemical shall provide Shoreline with reasonable opportunities to review and comment upon the Registration Statement, each amendment to the Registration Statement, and each form of the Prospectus and Joint Proxy Statement before filing. Chemical shall provide Shoreline, upon request, with copies of all correspondence received from the SEC with respect to the Registration Statement and its amendments and with all responsive correspondence to the SEC. Chemical shall notify Shoreline of any stop orders or threatened stop orders with respect to the Registration Statement. Shoreline shall provide to Chemical all necessary information pertaining to Shoreline promptly upon request, and to use all reasonable efforts to obtain the cooperation of Shoreline\'s independent accountants, attorneys and investment bankers in connection with the preparation of the Registration Statement. In the Prospectus and Joint Proxy Statement, Chemical shall indicate that forward looking information and financial projections have been prepared by, and are the responsibility of, Chemical.

Chemical shall provide Shoreline with copies of all material correspondence received from these agencies and all material responsive correspondence sent to these agencies.

  

 5.13 _Miscellaneous Agreements and Consents_.

 5.14.2 _Cooperation_.

 5.15.3 _Excepted Information_. The provisions of this Section shall not preclude Chemical or Shoreline, or their respective subsidiaries, from using or disclosing information that is readily ascertainable from public information or trade sources, known by it before the commencement of discussions between the parties or subsequently developed by it or its subsidiaries independent of any investigation under this Plan of Merger, received from any other person who is not affiliated with a party and who is not under any obligation to keep such information confidential, or reasonably required to be included in any filing or application required by any governmental or regulatory agency  .

  

 5.15.4 _Prohibit Insider Trading_. Chemical and Shoreline shall each take responsible steps to assure that any person who receives nonpublic information concerning the Merger or the other party will treat the information confidentially as provided in this Section and not directly or indirectly buy or sell, or advise or encourage other persons to buy or sell, Shoreline\'s stock until such information is properly disclosed to the public.

   

 5.16 _Environmental Investigation_. Chemical shall be permitted to conduct an environmental assessment of (a) each parcel included in the Premises; (b) to the extent permitted by the current owners or operators thereof, any other real estate formerly owned by Shoreline or any Subsidiary; and (c) any other real estate acquired by Shoreline Bank in satisfaction of a debt previously contracted.

Upon request, Shoreline and its Subsidiaries shall provide reasonable assistance, including site access, a knowledgeable contact person, documentation relating to the real estate, and any prior environmental investigations or reports in Shoreline\'s possession to Chemical\'s consultant for purposes of conducting the Phase I assessments.

  

 5.16.2 _Environmental Risks._ If there are any facts or conditions identified in a Phase I assessment that Chemical reasonably believes pose a current or future risk of liability, interference with use, or diminution of value of the property, then Chemical shall identify that risk to Shoreline, identify the facts or conditions underlying that risk, and provide Shoreline with a copy of the Phase I assessment for that property (an " _Environmental Risk_ ").    

 5.16.3 _Phase II and III Work._ Chemical may obtain one or more estimates of the proposed scope of work and cost of any further environmental investigation, or other follow-up work it reasonably considers necessary or appropriate to assess and, if necessary, remediate an Environmental Risk (" _Phase II and III Work_ "). Chemical shall provide copies of those estimates to Shoreline. The fees and expenses of any Phase II and III Work shall be allocated as agreed. Chemical and Shoreline shall cooperate in the review, approval, and implementation of all work plans for Phase II and III Work. All work plans for Phase II and III Work shall be mutually satisfactory to Chemical and Shoreline. Mutually agreed upon Phase II and III Work shall be undertaken and completed as quickly as possible and shall be completed prior to the Closing. If the proposed work plans or removal or remediation actions would entail a material cost to complete, Chemical and Shoreline shall discuss a mutually acceptable modification to this Plan of Merger. 

  

 5.16.4 _Chemical\'s Termination Rights_. If (a) Chemical and Shoreline are unable to agree upon the need for, or upon a course of action to complete, any Phase II and III Work, and/or a mutually acceptable modification to this Plan of Merger, and (b) Chemical cannot be reasonably assured that the after-tax cost of the sum of (i) the actual cost of all investigative and remedial or other corrective actions or measures desired to be taken pursuant to Section 5.16.3 ( _Phase II and III Work_ ); (ii) the estimated cost of all investigative actions and remedial or other corrective actions or measures not undertaken but required by Environmental Laws, or necessary to avoid future exposure to material liability under Environmental Laws; and (iii) after taking in account the remediation that would be undertaken under clause (ii) immediately above, all diminutions of the value of such properties resulting from an environmental impairment or liability; in the aggregate will not exceed $1,750,000, then Chemical may terminate this Plan of Merger as provided in Section ( _Environmental Risks_ ).

   

 5.17 _Termination of Employee Benefit Plans_. Shoreline shall terminate the Shoreline 401(k) Plan and Shoreline Pension Plan (collectively, the " _Shoreline Plans_ ") as of a date prior to the Effective Time, if requested by Chemical to do so. Shoreline shall provide Chemical with reasonable assistance, approve and adopt all resolutions, and take all other actions that are necessary and appropriate in the judgment of Chemical to complete the termination process of the Shoreline Plans as soon as practicable after the Effective Time. Upon receipt of a favorable IRS determination letters with respect to the terminations of the Shoreline Plans (which termination applications shall be prepared by Chemical and its counsel with the participation and cooperation of Shoreline and its counsel), Chemical shall offer, if reasonably feasible, the participants in the Shoreline Plans the option to transfer or roll over their benefits into the Chemical retirement plans.

  

 5.18 _Implementation Agreements_. Shoreline shall use all reasonable efforts to obtain from its four senior executives who are parties to existing employment agreements with Shoreline, prior to execution of this Plan of Merger and as soon as possible thereafter, executed implementation agreements relating to the existing employment agreement, in the form previously agreed to by Chemical and Shoreline, providing for a general release, which release shall only become effective upon consummation of the Merger at the Effective Time (the " _Implementation Agreements_ ").   

 5.19 _Accounting and Tax Treatment_. 

   

 5.19.1 _General_. Chemical and Shoreline each agree that, except as expressly provided in this Plan of Merger, while this Plan of Merger is in effect, it shall not take or fail to take, or cause to be taken or fail to cause to be taken, any action if the result would be or present a material risk that the Merger would become disqualified for the pooling-of-interests method of accounting by Chemical or as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code; provided that nothing in this Plan of Merger shall limit Chemical\'s ability to exercise its rights under the Option Agreement. Chemical and Shoreline each agree to take such actions as may be reasonably required to negate the impact of any past or future actions taken prior to the Effective Time that might adversely impact the ability of Chemical to treat the Merger as a pooling-of-interests. Chemical shall continue its current practice of due care with respect to matters that could impact the ability to account for the Merger as a pooling-of-interests and shall consult with its independent accountants with respect to such matters. 

  

 5.19.2 _Specific Actions_. Without limiting the foregoing: 

   

 (a) _No Stock Purchases_. Neither Chemical, any of Chemical\'s subsidiaries, Shoreline, nor the Subsidiaries, respectively, shall acquire any shares of Chemical Common Stock, Shoreline Common Stock, any securities convertible into such stock or any other rights to acquire such stock, except in a fiduciary capacity for a customer as to which it has no beneficial interest, and except as permitted for purposes other than a business combination under the pooling-of-interests method of accounting and provided that no more than a permitted number of shares have been acquired for such permissible purposes; and

  

 (b) _No Change of Equity Interest_. Neither Chemical nor Shoreline, respectively, shall in any manner change the equity interest of Chemical Common Stock or Shoreline Common Stock, respectively, between the date of this Plan of Merger and the consummation of the Merger, including without limitation distributions (other than ordinary and customary cash and stock dividends) to shareholders and additional issuances, exchanges, and retirements of securities. 

   

 5.19.3 _Stock Repurchase Programs_. Immediately prior to the execution of this Plan of Merger, Chemical and Shoreline shall rescind their respective stock purchase programs and discontinue the repurchase of their respective shares under such programs and shall make appropriate public disclosures of such recission and discontinuation.

   

 5.20 _Public Announcements_. Chemical and Shoreline shall cooperate with each other in the development and distribution of all news releases and other public information disclosures with respect to this Plan of Merger, except as may be otherwise required by law. Neither Chemical nor Shoreline shall issue any news releases with respect to this Plan of Merger or the Merger unless such news releases have been mutually agreed upon by the parties, except as required by law.

 _ARTICLE IX - MISCELLANEOUS_

  

 Subject to the terms and conditions of this Plan of Merger, Chemical and Shoreline further agree as follows:

  

 9.1 _"Material Adverse Effect" Defined_. As used in this Plan of Merger, the term " _Material Adverse Effect_ " means any change or effect that, individually or when taken together with all other such changes or effects that have occurred prior to the date of determination of the occurrence of the Material Adverse Effect, has had or could have a material negative impact on (a) the business, assets, financial condition, results of operations, or value of Chemical and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or Shoreline and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as the case may be; or (b) the ability of Chemical or Shoreline, as the case may be, to satisfy the applicable closing conditions or consummate the Merger or perform its obligations under the Option Agreement. Notwithstanding the above, the impact of the following shall not be included in any determination of a Material Adverse Effect: (a) changes in GAAP, generally applicable to financial institutions and their holding companies; (b) actions and omissions of a party (or any of its subsidiaries) taken with the prior written consent of the other party; (c) changes in economic conditions (including changes in the level of interest rates) generally affecting financial institutions; and (d) fees and expenses reasonably related to this transaction (such as any additional insurance coverages, employment and consulting services, legal, accounting, and investment banking fees and expenses, and severance and retention provisions) incurred or paid without violation of the representations, warranties or covenants contained in this Plan of Merger.

  

 9.2 _"Knowledge" Defined_. As used in this Plan of Merger, the term "knowledge " means the actual knowledge of any director or officer (as that term is defined in Rule 16a-1 of the Exchange Act) of Shoreline or Chemical, as the case may be. 

  

 9.3 _Nonsurvival of Representations, Warranties, and Agreements_. None of the representations, warranties, covenants, and agreements in this Plan of Merger or in any other agreement or instrument delivered pursuant to this Plan of Merger, including any rights arising out of any breach of such representations, warranties, covenants, and agreements, shall survive the Effective Time, except for the Option Agreement, Shoreline Affiliate Agreements, Implementation Agreements, and those covenants and agreements contained herein and therein that, by the terms hereof and thereof, apply or are to be performed in whole or in part after the Effective Time.   

 9.4 _Amendment_. Subject to applicable law, this Plan of Merger may be amended, modified, or supplemented by, and only by, written agreement of Chemical and Shoreline, executed by the respective officers thereunto duly authorized, at any time prior to the Effective Time.

  

 9.5 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided in this Plan of Merger, Shoreline and Chemical shall each pay its own expenses incident to preparing for, entering into, and carrying out this Plan of Merger, and incident to the consummation of the Merger. Each party shall pay the fees and expenses of any investment banker engaged by that party. The costs of all filing fees pertaining to the Registration Statement shall be paid by Chemical. The costs of printing and mailing the Prospectus and Joint Proxy Statement to their respective shareholders shall be borne by Chemical and by Shoreline.

  

 9.6 _Specific Enforcement_. The parties each agree that, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Plan of Merger, in the event of a breach by a party to this Plan of Merger, money damages will be inadequate and not susceptible of computation because of the unique nature of Shoreline, the subsidiaries, and the Merger. Therefore, the parties each agree that a federal or state court of competent jurisdiction shall have authority, subject to the rules of law and equity, to specifically enforce the provisions of this Plan of Merger by injunctive order or such other equitable means as may be determined in the court\'s discretion. 

  

 9.7 _Jurisdiction; Jury_. The parties acknowledge that jurisdiction and venue may be permissible in more than one jurisdiction or court district. Chemical and Shoreline each hereby agree not to assert any defense of improper jurisdiction or venue and each waive their right to a trial by jury.

  

 9.8 _Waiver_. Any of the terms or conditions of this Plan of Merger may be waived in writing at any time by action taken by the board of directors of a party, a duly authorized committee thereof, or a duly authorized officer of such party. The failure of any party at any time or times to require performance of any provision of this Plan of Merger shall in no manner affect such party\'s right at a later time to enforce the same provision. No waiver by any party of any condition, or of the breach of any term, covenant, representation, or warranty contained in this Plan of Merger, whether by conduct or otherwise, in any one or more instances shall be deemed to be or construed as a further or continuing waiver of any such condition or breach, or as a waiver of any other condition or of the breach of any other term, covenant, representation, or warranty.
