STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT

  

  

THIS STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT (this "Agreement") is entered into as of July 1,
2011 (the "Effective Date") by and among Tutor Perini Corporation, a
Massachusetts corporation ("Buyer"), Lunda Construction Company, a Wisconsin
corporation (the "Company"), each of the Larry Lunda 2000 Trust Dated December
27, 2000, Mr. Carl W. Holmquist, Mr. Paul O. Gehl, the Marlee K. Slifka 2000
Trust Dated December 27, 2000, Mr. Tom R. Braun, Mr. Dennis L. Behnke, Mr.
Richard E. Rust and Ms. Cleo Rust (each a "Shareholder" and collectively, the
"Shareholders"), and, solely for purposes of Section 3.3 and Section 6.5,
Marlee K. Slifka, Richard S. Slifka and Larry Lunda. Buyer, the Company and
the Shareholders are referred to collectively herein as the "Parties."

  

  

W I T N E S S E T H

  

  

WHEREAS, the Shareholders own beneficially and of record all of the issued and
outstanding capital stock of the Company, as set forth on Exhibit A (the
"Shares");

  

  

WHEREAS, the Shareholders desire to sell to Buyer and Buyer desires to
purchase from the Shareholders all of the Shares owned by the Shareholders;

  

  

WHEREAS, capitalized terms used in this Agreement are used as defined in
Section 7.8 or in the preamble, recitals or other Sections of this Agreement
where such terms are specifically defined; and

  

  

NOW, THEREFORE, in order to consummate said purchase and sale and in
consideration of the mutual representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements herein made, and upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth herein, the Parties agree as follows:

  

  

 

SECTION 1. SALE OF SHARES AND PURCHASE PRICE.

 

  

  

1.1 Purchase and Sale. On and subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, Buyer agrees to purchase from each Shareholder, and each
Shareholder agrees to sell to Buyer, all of the Shares owned by such
Shareholder for the consideration specified in this Section 1, concurrently
with the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Parties.

  

  

1.2 Delivery of Shares. At the Closing (as defined in Section 1.6), each
Shareholder is delivering to Buyer a certificate or certificates representing
all of the Shares owned by such Shareholder. Such certificate or certificates
are duly endorsed in blank for transfer or are being presented with stock
powers duly executed in blank, with such other documents as have been
requested by Buyer to effect a valid transfer of the Shares by the
Shareholders to Buyer, free and clear of any and all liens, restrictions,
assessments, judgments, mortgages, easements, encumbrances, pledges, security
interests and adverse claims of any kind (collectively, "Liens"), other than
restrictions under federal or state securities Laws.

  

  

1.3 Purchase Price; Indemnity Escrow.

  

  

(a) In consideration of the sale by the Shareholders to Buyer of the Shares
and in reliance on the representations and warranties of the Company and the
Shareholders in this Agreement, Buyer is paying an aggregate purchase price
(the "Purchase Price") equal to One Hundred Sixty-Three Million Five Hundred
Thousand Dollars ($163,500,000.00), subject to adjustment pursuant to Section
1.4, plus the right to receive additional consideration as and to the extent
set forth in Section 1.5. The Purchase Price shall be paid as follows:

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

1  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

(i) at the Closing, Buyer is depositing the sum of Eight Million One Hundred
Seventy-Five Thousand Dollars ($8,175,000.00) (the "Indemnity Escrow") with
The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A. as escrow agent (the "Escrow Agent")
under that certain Escrow Agreement among Buyer, the Shareholders and the
Escrow Agent being entered into concurrently with this Agreement (the "Escrow
Agreement"). The Indemnity Escrow shall be held, administered and distributed
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement (including the provisions of
Section 6) and the Escrow Agreement;

  

  

(ii) at the Closing, Buyer is delivering to the Shareholders, by wire
transfers of immediately available funds pursuant to the wiring instructions
previously delivered to Buyer by the Shareholders, their respective Pro Rata
Portions of an aggregate amount equal to One Hundred Thirty-Three Million Five
Hundred Seventy-Five Thousand Dollars ($133,575,000);

  

  

(iii) at Closing, Buyer is delivering to the Shareholders, promissory notes
(the "Promissory Notes") in original principal amounts equal to their
respective Pro Rata Portions of an aggregate amount equal to Twenty-One
Million Seven Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($21,750,000); and

  

  

(iv) the Parties agree to treat the Indemnity Escrow and principal payments
under the Promissory Notes, to the extent paid to the Shareholders in
accordance with this Agreement, as proceeds of an installment sale for federal
income Tax purposes in accordance with Section 453 of the Code and any
comparable provision of other Tax Law, and shall not take any position
inconsistent therewith in any books, records, or filings or otherwise
voluntarily act inconsistently with such intent, except as otherwise required
by a change in Law effective after the date of this Agreement. Consistent with
such treatment, the Indemnity Escrow and the principal payments under the
Promissory Notes shall be deemed to be additional consideration for the
purchase of the Shares only if, when, and to the extent paid to the
Shareholders in accordance with this Agreement, and the Shareholders will not
be treated as the legal or beneficial owner of such Indemnity Escrow until and
to the extent it is actually paid to them pursuant to this Agreement, provided
that a portion of the Indemnity Escrow ultimately paid to the Shareholders
will be treated as interest paid in a contingent installment sale for which
there is a maximum stated selling price, as required by Sections 453 and 1274
of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder, using the applicable
discount rate to determine the amount of imputed interest under Section 1274
of the Code.

  

  

1.4 Adjustment to Purchase Price.

  

  

(a) Schedule 1.4(a) sets forth the estimated closing statement (the "Estimated
Closing Statement"), which includes the Shareholders' calculation of the
estimated Closing Net Worth (as defined in Section 1.4(b)) of the Company as
of the close of business on the Closing Date (the "Estimated Closing Net
Worth"), together with worksheets and data that support the Estimated Closing
Statement and such other information that Buyer has heretofore requested in
order for Buyer to verify the amounts reflected on the Estimated Closing
Statement. Except as set forth on Schedule 1.4(a), the Estimated Closing
Statement has been prepared in accordance with generally accepted United
States accounting principles as in effect on the date hereof ("GAAP");
provided, however, that the Parties have agreed that the Estimated Closing
Statement does not, and the Closing Balance Sheet (as defined in Section
1.4(b)) and any estimation or determination of Net Worth therefrom shall not,
reflect any write-downs or other impairments of any of the Receivables subject
to the provisions of Section 3.4 (except to the extent reflected in the
Interim Balance Sheet (as defined in Section 2.6(a)). As set forth in the
Estimated Closing Statement, the Estimated Closing Net Worth equals Forty
Million Dollars ($40,000,000.00) (the "Target Net Worth").

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

2  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) As soon as reasonably practicable but no later than ninety (90) days after
the Closing Date, Buyer will deliver to the Shareholders an unaudited balance
sheet of the Company as of the Closing Date (the "Closing Balance Sheet").
Except as set forth on Schedule 1.4(a), the Closing Balance Sheet shall be
prepared in accordance with GAAP, consistent with the methodology used to
prepare the Estimated Closing Statement. Buyer will deliver to the
Shareholders, together with the Closing Balance Sheet, a calculation of the
Net Worth as of the close of business on the Closing Date based on the Closing
Balance Sheet, prepared in accordance with the methodology used to prepare the
Estimated Closing Net Worth, without giving effect to the Closing or any
transaction between the Company, on the one hand, and Buyer or any of its
Subsidiaries, on the other hand, effected on the Closing Date (the "Closing
Net Worth").

  

  

(i) The Closing Balance Sheet and Buyer's calculation of the Closing Net Worth
shall be binding upon the Parties if (A) the Shareholders fail to object in
writing within thirty (30) days after receipt of the Closing Balance Sheet and
Buyer's calculation of the Closing Net Worth or (B) the Shareholders approve
the Closing Balance Sheet and Buyer's calculation of the Closing Net Worth in
a written notice that specifically states such approval and references this
Section 1.4(b)(i).

  

  

(ii) If the Shareholders do not agree with the Closing Balance Sheet or
Buyer's calculation of the Closing Net Worth, and Buyer and the Shareholders
cannot mutually agree on revisions to the same, then within seventy-five (75)
days following receipt by the Shareholders of the Closing Balance Sheet,
Buyer, the Company and the Shareholders shall engage PricewaterhouseCoopers
LLP or such other nationally recognized independent accounting firm mutually
satisfactory to Buyer and the Shareholders (the "Neutral Auditor") to resolve
such dispute. The Neutral Auditor shall review the Closing Balance Sheet,
Buyer's calculation of the Closing Net Worth and any proposed revisions to the
same and, within forty-five (45) Business Days of its appointment (or as soon
as practicable after such forty-five (45) Business Day period), shall make any
adjustments it deems necessary thereto (but only with respect to the items in
dispute), and, upon completion of such review, such Closing Balance Sheet and
the Closing Net Worth as determined by the Neutral Auditor shall be binding
upon the Parties. If such a review is conducted, then the Company shall pay
all the Neutral Auditor's fees and expenses associated with such review,
provided that fifty percent (50%) of such fees and expenses shall be deemed a
liability of the Company for purposes of determining the Closing Net Worth.

  

  

(c) Within ten (10) Business Days following determination of the Closing Net
Worth in accordance with Section 1.4(b):

  

  

(i) in the event the Closing Net Worth is less than the Estimated Closing Net
Worth ("Negative Net Worth Adjustment Amount"), Buyer shall be entitled to
receive an amount equal to the Negative Net Worth Adjustment Amount (which
Buyer may, at its option, recover from the Indemnity Escrow), and the Purchase
Price shall be deemed to be decreased by the Negative Net Worth Adjustment
Amount. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in the
event that Buyer chooses not to recover the Negative Net Worth Adjustment
Amount from the Indemnity Escrow (or such Negative Net Worth Adjustment Amount
exceeds the Indemnity Escrow), each Shareholder shall pay to Buyer, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds, such Shareholder's Pro Rata Portion
of the Negative Net Worth Adjustment Amount (or, if applicable, such
Shareholder's Pro Rata Portion of the amount by which the Negative Net Worth
Adjustment exceeds the Indemnity Escrow); the Parties agree to treat any
payment made pursuant to this Section 1.4(c)(i) as an adjustment to the
consideration paid for the purchase of the Shares for federal income Tax
purposes and for purposes of any comparable provision of other Tax Law; and

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

3  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(ii) in the event the Closing Net Worth is greater than the Estimated Closing
Net Worth, Buyer shall pay the Shareholders, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds, their respective Pro Rata Portions of the amount equal to the
difference between such amounts ("Positive Net Worth Adjustment Amount"), and
the Purchase Price shall be deemed to be increased by such Positive Net Worth
Adjustment Amount; the Parties agree to treat any payment made pursuant to
this Section 1.4(c)(ii) as proceeds of an installment sale in accordance with
Section 453 of the Code and any comparable provision of other Tax Law.

  

  

(d) As used in this Section 1.4, "Net Worth" means total assets (including any
Tax assets, including any deferred Tax assets, but excluding any goodwill)
minus total liabilities (including any liabilities for Taxes, including any
deferred Tax liabilities) of the Company determined in accordance with GAAP,
consistent with the methodology used to prepare the Estimated Closing
Statement, except as contemplated by the proviso to the second sentence of
Section 1.4(a) or as set forth on Schedule 1.4(a).

  

  

(e) Notwithstanding anything in the Agreement to the contrary, the payment of
any Negative Net Worth Adjustment Amount by the Escrow Agent or the
Shareholders, as the case may be, under this Section 1.4 shall not be subject
to any of the limitations on indemnification contained in Section 6.

  

  

(f) Assuming each Shareholder delivers a FIRPTA Certificate (as defined in
Section 1.6(b)), the Parties agree that no amount shall be withheld from the
Purchase Price under Code Section 1445.

  

  

1.5 Earn-Out.

  

  

(a) Following the Closing and as additional consideration for sale by the
Shareholders to Buyer of the Shares as contemplated by the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, the Shareholders, collectively, shall be
entitled to receive from Buyer (subject to the terms and conditions of this
Section 1.5) cash as determined in accordance with this Section 1.5 (the
"Earn-Out Payment"). For the period beginning on July 1, 2011, and ending on
June 30, 2012, and each of the two (2) succeeding twelve-month periods (i.e.,
July 1, 2012 through June 30, 2013, and July 1, 2013 through June 30, 2014)
(the "Earn-Out Term"), the Shareholders shall be entitled to receive an
aggregate amount equal to fifty percent (50%) of any and all Pre-Tax Profit
(as defined in Section 1.5(d)) in excess of Twenty-Four Million Dollars
($24,000,000.00) (each, a "Yearly Earn-Out Payment").

  

  

(b) Within forty-five (45) days after the end of each twelve-month period in
the Earn-Out Term, Buyer shall in good faith prepare and deliver to the
Shareholders a report setting forth the Pre-Tax Profit for such period (the
"Pre-Tax Profit Report"), together with worksheets and data that support the
determination of the Pre-Tax Profit for such period and any other information
that the Shareholders may reasonably request in order to verify the Pre-Tax
Profit. The Pre-Tax Profit Report and the Pre-Tax Profit for such period
reflected thereon shall be binding upon the Parties upon the approval of such
Pre-Tax Profit Report by the Shareholders, in a written notice that
specifically states such approval and references this Section 1.5(b), or the
failure of the Shareholders to object in writing within thirty (30) days after
receipt thereof by the Shareholders. If the Shareholders do not agree with the
Pre-Tax Profit Report and the calculation of the Pre-Tax Profit stated
thereon, and Buyer and the Shareholders cannot mutually agree on the
calculation of the Pre-Tax Profit, then within sixty (60) days following
receipt by the Shareholders of the Pre-Tax Profit Report, Buyer, the Company
and the Shareholders shall engage the Neutral Auditor to resolve such dispute.
The Neutral Auditor shall review the Pre-Tax Profit Report and any proposed
revisions to the same and, within thirty (30) Business Days of its
appointment, shall make any adjustments it deems necessary thereto (but only
with respect to the items in dispute), and, upon completion of such review,
such Pre-Tax Profit Report and the Pre-Tax Profit as determined by the Neutral
Auditor shall be binding upon the Parties. If such a review is conducted, then
the Company shall pay all of the Neutral Auditor's fees and expenses
associated with such review, provided that the amount of such fees and
expenses shall be deemed to be a reduction of the Pre-Tax Profit for the
period to which such review relates.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

4  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) For each of the three twelve-month periods during the Earn-Out Term, the
Yearly Earn-Out Payment, if any, shall be paid by Buyer to the Shareholders,
in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Portions thereof, within five (5)
Business Days of the final determination of the Pre-Tax Profit for the
applicable period in accordance with Sections 1.5(a) and 1.5(b); provided,
however, that payment of any portion of such Yearly Earn-Out Payment that is
not in dispute shall be made within five (5) Business Days of the date of
determination under this Section 1.5 that such portion of such Yearly Earn-Out
Payment is not in dispute; provided, further, that the aggregate amount
payable to the Shareholders under the foregoing provisions of this Section
1.5(c) (and any amount payable to the Shareholders under the provisions of
Section 1.5(h)) shall be reduced by an aggregate amount equal to the fees
payable to FMI Capital Advisors, Inc. in accordance with Schedule 1.5(c) with
respect to the subject Yearly Earn-Out Payment (or Earn-Out Reimbursement
Amount, as applicable), with such reduction to be allocated to the amounts
payable to the Shareholders in accordance with their respective Pro Rata
Portions thereof, and Buyer shall fund the payment of such fees to FMI Capital
Advisors, Inc. on behalf of the Shareholders.

  

  

(d) As used in this Section 1.5, "Pre-Tax Profit" means, with respect to any
period, the profit of (x) the Company and (y) any other operations of Buyer
and any of its Affiliates that (as mutually agreed in writing by Buyer and the
Shareholders) are managed by the Company after the Closing, prior to reduction
for Taxes based on or measured by income, profits, revenues or gross receipts
("Income Taxes") but taking into account appropriate allocations of profits or
losses from insurance programs maintained by Buyer and its Affiliates, all
calculated in accordance with GAAP, consistently applied) for such period, and
shall exclude the effects of the following items:

  

  

(i) any expenses incurred in connection with any loans provided to the Company
by Buyer or any of Buyer's Affiliates other than a loan provided to the
Company by Buyer (or any Affiliate of Buyer) that the Company would have
otherwise incurred in the ordinary course of business on a stand-alone basis
(considering competitive market rates at which the same could be obtained from
third-party sources);

  

  

(ii) any gain, loss, income or expense resulting from a change in the
Company's accounting methods, principles or practices after the date hereof
other than a change necessary to cause such accounting methods, principles or
practices to conform to GAAP;

  

  

(iii) any expenses directly or indirectly incurred by Buyer in connection with
the acquisition of the Company by Buyer;

  

  

(iv) any corporate assessments or charges (including any additional
depreciation, amortization or other cash or non-cash expense or income and any
amortization of goodwill or other intangibles resulting from the acquisition
of the Company by Buyer) from Buyer or any of its Affiliates other than the
reimbursement of any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Buyer (or any
Affiliate of Buyer) that the Company would have incurred in the ordinary
course of business on a stand-alone basis (considering competitive market
rates at which the same could be obtained from third-party sources);

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

5  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(v) any impairment, write-off or other charge relating to any uncollected
Receivables for which Buyer is reimbursed pursuant to the provisions of
Section 3.4; and

  

  

(vi) any loss or expense to the extent it relates to a Buyer Indemnifiable
Loss and such Buyer Indemnifiable Loss has been paid to a Buyer Indemnified
Party from the Indemnity Escrow or otherwise (including pursuant to the
Company's insurance policies).

  

  

(e) The Parties agree to treat the Earn-Out Payments as proceeds of an
installment sale for income Tax purposes in accordance with Section 453 of the
Code and any comparable provision of other Tax Law, and shall not take any
position inconsistent therewith in any books, records, or filings or otherwise
voluntarily act inconsistently with such intent, except as otherwise required
by a change of Law effective after the date of this Agreement. Consistent with
such treatment, the Earn-Out Payments shall be deemed to be additional
consideration for the purchase of the Shares only if and when paid to the
Shareholders in accordance with this Agreement, and the Shareholders will not
be treated as the legal or beneficial owner of such Earn-Out Payments until
actually made pursuant to this Agreement; provided, that a portion of each
Earn-Out Payment ultimately paid to the Shareholders will be treated as
interest paid in a contingent installment sale, as required by Sections 453
and 1274 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder, using the
applicable discount rate to determine the amount of imputed interest under
Section 1274 of the Code.

  

  

(f) Buyer may elect to set-off against all or any portion of any Earn-Out
Payment payable to the Shareholders any amount owed to Buyer Indemnified
Parties (as defined in Section 6.1) under the indemnification obligations set
forth in Section 6 to the extent that both (i) such amount represents a Loss
described in Section 6.2(h)(i) or Section 6.2(h)(ii) (in any such case, to the
extent, and only to the extent, that such Loss has not been taken into account
in determining the Pre-Tax Profit during the Earn-Out Term) and (ii) either
(A) such amount exceeds the amount then remaining in the Indemnity Escrow
(taking into account any pending claim) or (B) the Indemnity Escrow has
previously been released to the Shareholders pursuant to Section 3.8.

  

  

(g) During the Earn-Out Term and for so long thereafter as any of the
Promissory Notes remain outstanding, Buyer shall: (i) maintain the separate
corporate existence of the Company, unless (following the request of Buyer)
the Shareholders consent to the consolidation of the Company into another
wholly owned direct or indirect subsidiary of Buyer, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, so long as such consolidation will not reasonably be
expected to adversely impact any computation of Pre-Tax Profit during the
Earn-Out Term and either the remaining outstanding Promissory Notes are
prepaid, in full, or a reasonably acceptable guarantor is substituted for the
Company as guarantor thereunder; and (ii) use its good faith efforts to
conduct the businesses of the Company in the ordinary course and not take any
actions intended to reduce or avoid the payment of any Yearly Earn-Out
Payment.

  

  

(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Section 1.5,
if, during the Earn-Out Term, a Subsequent Sale Transaction diminishes the
Pre-Tax Profit, or otherwise materially impairs the assets, business,
operations, prospects or financial condition or revenue-generating capacity of
the Company, or which otherwise adversely affects the Shareholders' ability to
receive the Earn-Out Payment, Buyer shall, if requested by the Shareholders,
promptly (and, in any event, within five (5) Business Days of the final
determination of the Projected Earn-Out Payments pursuant to this Section 1.5)
pay the Shareholders the amounts equal to their respective Pro Rata Portions
of the amount equal to the difference between (i) the Projected Earn-Out
Payments minus (ii) the sum of all Yearly Earn-Out Payments previously paid
pursuant to this Section 1.5 (the "Earn-Out Reimbursement Amount"). As used
herein: (i) "Projected Earn-Out Payments" means the aggregate of the Yearly
Earn-Out Payments that would have been earned during the Earn-Out Term had the
Subsequent Sale Transaction not occurred, calculated as the sum of (A) the
actual Yearly Earn-Out Payments earned during the period from the beginning of
the Earn-Out Term through the date of the Subsequent Sale Transaction and (B)
a calculation of the then projected Yearly Earn-Out Payments to be earned
during the remainder of the Earn-Out Term, which calculation of projected
Yearly Earn-Out Payments shall be determined based on the most recent internal
forecast for the remainder of the Earn-Out Term prepared in good faith by or
on behalf of the Company; and (ii) "Subsequent Sale Transaction" means (x) a
sale, exchange or other disposition of the capital stock of the Company to a
Person that is not an Affiliate of Buyer or (y) a merger or consolidation (or
any other form of business combination) of the Company with another entity, in
any case where Buyer will not wholly own, directly or indirectly through the
Company, immediately after such transaction, all of the capital stock or other
equity ownership interests in the surviving or resulting entity or (z) the
sale, lease, exchange or other disposition of 15% or more of the assets or
revenue-generating capacity of the Company to a third party that is not an
Affiliate of Buyer in a bona fide arms'-length transaction and that has a
material impact on any Yearly Earn-Out Payment. Buyer shall, or shall cause
the Company to, maintain up-to-date internal forecasts that will permit the
calculation of Projected Earn-Out Payments as contemplated by this Section
1.5(h).

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

6  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(i) During the Earn-Out Term, Buyer shall maintain separate books and records
for the businesses of the Company in accordance with GAAP and separate
internal forecasts for the businesses of the Company to permit the
computations contemplated by Section 1.5(h), in each case in such detail as to
enable the Shareholders to adequately audit or review Buyer's performance
under the provisions of this Section 1.5 and the calculations required under
this Section 1.5. Buyer shall permit the Shareholders to conduct any such
audits or reviews, from time to time, at the Shareholders' cost and expense;
provided that the Shareholders shall provide reasonable notice to Buyer of any
such audit and the Shareholders' audit activities shall not unreasonably
interfere with the operations of the businesses of the Company.

  

  

(j) Within ninety (90) days after the later of (i) the occurrence of a
Subsequent Sale Transaction and (ii) the Shareholders' request for payment of
the Earn-Out Reimbursement Amount pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this
Section 1.5, Buyer shall in good faith prepare and deliver to the Shareholders
a calculation of the Earn-Out Reimbursement Amount (the "Earn-Out
Reimbursement Amount Report"), together with worksheets and data that support
the Earn-Out Reimbursement Amount and any other information that the
Shareholders may reasonably request in order to verify the Earn-Out
Reimbursement Amount. The Earn-Out Reimbursement Amount Report and the Earn-
Out Reimbursement Amount reflected thereon shall be binding upon the Parties
upon the approval of such Earn-Out Reimbursement Amount Report by the
Shareholders, in a written notice that specifically states such approval and
references this Section 1.5(j), or the failure of the Shareholders to object
in writing within sixty (60) days after receipt thereof by the Shareholders.
If the Shareholders do not agree with the Earn-Out Reimbursement Amount Report
and the calculation of the Earn-Out Reimbursement Amount stated thereon, and
Buyer and the Shareholders cannot mutually agree on revisions to the same,
then within seventy-five (75) days following receipt by the Shareholders of
the Earn-Out Reimbursement Amount Report, Buyer, the Company and the
Shareholders shall engage the Neutral Auditor to resolve such dispute. The
Neutral Auditor shall review the Earn-Out Reimbursement Amount Report
(including the projections reflected therein), together with worksheets and
data that support the Earn-Out Reimbursement Amount and any other information
that the Shareholders have previously requested in order to verify the Earn-
Out Reimbursement Amount, as well as any proposed revisions to the same, and,
within thirty (30) Business Days of its appointment, shall make any
adjustments it deems necessary thereto (but only with respect to the items in
dispute), and, upon completion of such review, such Earn-Out Reimbursement
Amount Report and the Earn-Out Reimbursement Amount as determined by the
Neutral Auditor shall be binding upon the Parties. If such a review is
conducted, then the Company shall pay all of the Neutral Auditor's fees and
expenses associated with such review, provided that fifty percent (50%) of
such fees and expenses shall be deemed to be a reduction of the Earn-Out
Reimbursement Amount related thereto.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

7  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(k) The Parties agree and acknowledge that the Shareholders would not have an
adequate remedy at Law for the breach or threatened breach by Buyer of the
covenants and agreements set forth in this Section 1.5, and, accordingly,
Buyer further agrees that, notwithstanding the provisions of Section 7.11, the
Shareholders may, in addition to the other remedies which may be available to
them hereunder, file suit in equity to enjoin Buyer from such breach or
threatened breach, without showing any actual damage or that monetary damages
would not provide an adequate remedy and without any bond or other security
being required by Buyer.

1.8 Section 338 Tax Matters.

  

  

(a) Buyer, the Company and each Shareholder shall make an election under Code
Section 338(h)(10) (and any corresponding election under state, local, and
foreign Tax Law) with respect to the purchase and sale of the Shares
(collectively, a "Code Section 338(h)(10) Election"). The Shareholders shall
include any income, gain, loss, deduction, or other tax item resulting from
the Code Section 338(h)(10) Election on his Tax Returns to the extent required
by applicable Law. The Parties agree that nothing in this Agreement shall
preclude the Company or any of the Shareholders from electing under Section
453(d) of the Code (and any corresponding provision of state or local Tax Law)
not to report under the installment method the gain resulting from the sale of
the Shares, including by reason of the Code Section 338(h)(10) Election. Buyer
shall prepare an allocation of the Purchase Price and the estimated
liabilities of the Company (plus other relevant items) as of the Closing Date
among the assets of the Company and the covenants described in Section 3.3
(the "Asset Allocation"), which Asset Allocation shall be prepared in a manner
consistent with Code Sections 338 and 1060 and the regulations promulgated
thereunder. The Asset Allocation shall include allocations to each category of
assets that would be taxable under Section 1366 of the Code upon disposition
by the Company at a rate in excess of the lowest capital gain rate provided
for under the Code. Not later than one-hundred twenty (120) days after the
Closing Date, Buyer shall provide the Shareholders the Asset Allocation for
the Shareholders' review. The Asset Allocation schedule will be binding on the
Parties if (a) the Shareholders fail to object in writing within thirty (30)
days after receipt of the Asset Allocation or (b) the Shareholders approve the
Asset Allocation in a written notice that specifically states such approval
and references this Section 1.8(a). If the Shareholders do not agree with the
Asset Allocation, and Buyer and the Shareholders cannot mutually agree on
revisions to the same, then within thirty (30) days following the
Shareholders' objection to the Asset Allocation (or such later date as may be
mutually agreed by Buyer and the Shareholders), Buyer, the Company and the
Shareholders shall engage the Neutral Auditor, which shall within thirty (30)
days after such engagement resolve the allocation of the consideration and any
items with respect to which there is a dispute between the Parties. If such a
review is conducted, then each of Buyer, on the one hand, and the Shareholders
(each in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Portions), on the other
hand, shall pay fifty percent (50%) of all the Neutral Auditor's fees and
expenses associated with such review, and the determination of the Neutral
Auditor shall be binding on the Parties. Neither Buyer, the Company, their
respective Affiliates nor the Shareholders shall take any position
inconsistent with the allocation as finally determined pursuant to this
Section 1.8(a) in connection with any Tax Return or other matter related to
Taxes, unless otherwise required by applicable Law. Buyer and the Shareholders
shall cooperate in the filing of any forms (including any Internal Revenue
Service Form 8023 and any other forms required under state, local or foreign
Law) with respect to the allocation described in this Section 1.8(a).

  

  

(b) At the later of the (i) Closing or (ii) the date that is five (5) days
before the last day on which estimated federal income tax payments are due for
the calendar quarter that includes the date of Closing, Buyer shall pay to the
Shareholders their respective Pro Rata Portions of an aggregate amount equal
to $16,186,885, which is an estimate of the Section 338(h)(10) Amount (the
"Estimated Section 338(h)(10) Amount").

  

  

(c) Following the final determination of the Asset Allocation in accordance
with Section 1.8(a), the Shareholders shall provide to Buyer a written
statement containing a computation of the Section 338(h)(10) Amount. Any such
computation will be binding on the Parties if (a) Buyer fails to object in
writing within ten (10) days after receipt of such computation or (b) Buyer
approves such computation in a written notice that specifically states such
approval and references this Section 1.8(c). If Buyer does not agree with such
computation, and Buyer and the Shareholders cannot mutually agree on revisions
to the same, then within ten (10) days following Buyer's objection to such
computation (or such later date as may be mutually agreed by Buyer and the
Shareholders), Buyer, the Company and the Shareholders shall engage the
Neutral Auditor, which shall within thirty (30) days after such engagement
resolve such dispute. If such a review is conducted, then each of Buyer, on
the one hand, and the Shareholders (each in accordance with their respective
Pro Rata Portions), on the other hand, shall pay fifty percent (50%) of all
the Neutral Auditors' fees and expenses associated with such review, and the
determination of the Neutral Auditor shall be binding on the Parties. Not
later than ten (10) days following the final determination of the Section
338(h)(10) Amount under this Section 1.8(c), Buyer shall pay to the
Shareholders their respective Pro Rata Portions of the excess, if any, of the
Section 338(h)(10) Amount over the Estimated Section 338(h)(10) Amount or the
Shareholders, in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Portions, shall pay
to Buyer the excess, if any, of the Estimated Section 338(h)(10) Amount over
the Section 338(h)(10) Amount.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

9  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(d) In the event of any determination, as a result of an audit or other
proceeding (a "Section 338 Audit"), that the amount of income described in
clause (1)(a) or (1)(b) in the definition of Section 338(h)(10) Amount below
is larger or smaller than the amount that was previously taken into account
under Section 1.8(c) or this Section 1.8(d), the Shareholders shall provide to
Buyer a written statement containing a revised computation of the Section
338(h)(10) Amount based on such determination. Any such revised computation
will be binding on the Parties if (a) Buyer fails to object in writing within
ten (10) days after receipt of such revised computation or (b) Buyer approves
such revised computation in a written notice that specifically states such
approval and references this Section 1.8(d). If Buyer does not agree with such
revised computation, and Buyer and the Shareholders cannot mutually agree on
revisions to the same, then within ten (10) days following Buyer's objection
to such revised computation (or such later date as may be mutually agreed by
Buyer and the Shareholders), Buyer, the Company and the Shareholders shall
engage the Neutral Auditor to resolve such dispute. If such a review is
conducted, then each of Buyer, on the one hand, and the Shareholders (each in
accordance with their respective Pro Rata Portions), on the other hand, shall
pay fifty percent (50%) of all the Neutral Auditor's fees and expenses
associated with such review, and the determination of the Neutral Auditor
shall be binding on the Parties. In the event that the redetermined Section
338(h)(10) Amount exceeds the Section 338(h)(10) Amount as previously
determined (as described more fully herein), no later than ten (10) days
following the final determination of the revised Section 338(h)(10) Amount,
Buyer shall pay to the Shareholders their respective Pro Rata Portions of the
sum of (1) the amount by which the redetermined Section 338(h)(10) Amount
exceeds the Section 338(h)(10) Amount as previously determined (or
redetermined) under Section 1.8(c) or this Section 1.8(d) and (2) interest on
the amount described in clause (1) at a rate of five percent (5%), compounded
annually, from the date of the next previous payment of the Section 338(h)(10)
Amount to the date of the payment described in this sentence. In the event
that the redetermined Section 338(h)(10) Amount is less than the Section
338(h)(10) Amount as previously determined (as described more fully herein),
no later than ten (10) days following the final determination of the revised
Section 338(h)(10) Amount, the Shareholders, in accordance with their
respective Pro Rata Portions, shall pay to Buyer the sum of (1) the amount by
which the redetermined Section 338(h)(10) Amount is less than the Section
338(h)(10) Amount as previously determined (or redetermined) under Section
1.8(c) or this Section 1.8(d) and (2) interest on the amount described in
clause (1) at a rate of five percent (5%), compounded annually, from the date
of the next previous payment of the Section 338(h)(10) Amount to the date of
the payment described in this sentence.

  

  

(e) For purposes of this Agreement, "Section 338(h)(10) Amount" means an
amount equal to (1) the sum of (a) the aggregate amount of income recognized
by the Shareholders under Section 1366 of the Code as a result of the Code
Section 338(h)(10) Election that is taxable at ordinary income rates
(including recapture income) multiplied by 20.426%, plus (b) the aggregate
amount of income recognized by the Shareholders under Section 1366 of the Code
as a result of the Code Section 338(h)(10) Election that is taxable under
Section 1(h) of the Code at a 25% rate multiplied by 10.164%, plus (c) the
aggregate amount of income recognized by the Shareholders under Section 1366
of the Code as a result of the Code Section 338(h)(10) Election other than the
income described in clause (a) or (b) multiplied by 0.801%, multiplied by (2)
1.2567. The Section 338(h)(10) Amount shall be determined on a basis
consistent with the allocation described in Section 1.8(a).

  

 

  

(f) In the event that the Company or other person (for purposes of this
Section 1.8(f) only, collectively the "Company") receives notification of an
audit or proceeding that would be defined as a "Section 338 Audit" the Company
shall keep Buyer apprised of the status of the claim, liability or expense and
any resulting suit, proceeding or enforcement action, shall furnish Buyer with
all documents and information that Buyer shall reasonably request and shall
consult with Buyer regarding negotiation and settlement of the matter. Buyer
shall have the option to observe and/or participate in the Section 338 Audit,
at its own expense, and the Company shall cooperate fully with Buyer if Buyer
chooses such option. The provisions of this Section 1.8(f) shall apply only in
the case of a Tax item that affects the computation of the Section 338(h)(10)
Amount.

Agreement Representative"). Carl W. Holmquist, hereby accepts such appointment
to serve as the Escrow Agreement Representative under the Escrow Agreement.

  

  

(b) In the event that the Escrow Agreement Representative dies, becomes

below) as set forth in Schedule 2.7. Except as set forth in Schedule 2.7, as
of the date hereof, no order constituting the Backlog has been cancelled or

ordinary course of business. The term "Backlog" means (a) the value of
incomplete work-in-progress under written, fully executed contracts with

(i) The Company has timely filed all Tax Returns that they were required to
file under all applicable Laws. All such Tax Returns are true, correct and

applicable Laws. All material Taxes due and owing by the Company (whether or
not shown on any Tax Return), except with respect to the Code Section
338(h)(10) Election, have been paid or reserved on the Closing Balance Sheet
and taken into account in the calculation of the Estimated Closing Net Worth
as required by Section 1.4. The Company is not currently the beneficiary of
any extension of time within which to file any Tax Return. During the period
from January 1, 2007 through the date hereof, no written claim has been made
by an authority in a jurisdiction where the Company does not file Tax Returns
that the Company is or may be subject to taxation by that jurisdiction. There
are no Liens for Taxes (other than Taxes not yet due and payable) upon any of

this Agreement, the term "Governmental" shall be used to describe any federal,
state, municipal, tribal or local government or quasi-government. No foreign,
federal, state or local tax audits or administrative or judicial Tax
proceedings are pending or being conducted with respect to the Company. During
the period from January 1, 2007 through the date hereof, the Company has not
received from any Governmental Authority (including jurisdictions where the
Company does not file Tax Returns) any (A) written notice indicating an intent
to open an audit or other review, (B) written request for information related
to Tax matters, or (C) written notice of deficiency or proposed adjustment for
any Tax proposed, asserted, or assessed by any taxing authority against the
Company. Schedule 2.8 lists all federal, state, local, and foreign income Tax
Returns filed with respect to the Company for taxable periods ended on or
after December 31, 2006, indicates those Tax Returns that have been audited,
and indicates those Tax Returns that currently are the subject of audit.

to by the Company filed or received since December 31, 2006, have been made
available to Buyer and are correct and complete in all material respects.

  

  

(iv) During the period from January 1, 2007 through the date hereof, the
Company has not waived any statute of limitations in respect of any material
amount of Taxes or agreed to any extension of time with respect to a material
Tax assessment or deficiency, which waiver or extension of time is still

16

distributed stock of another Person, nor has it had its stock distributed by
another Person, in a transaction that was purported or intended to be governed
in whole or in part by Sections 355 or 361 of the Code.

  

  

(vii) During the period from January 1, 2007 through the date hereof, the
Company has not been a party to any "listed transaction," as defined in
Section 6707A(c)(1) of the Code and Treasury Regulations Section 1.6011-4(b).

  

  

(viii) To the Company's knowledge, each plan that is a "nonqualified deferred
compensation plan" within the meaning of Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code (a
"Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan") subject to Section 409A of the Code
(A) operated in good faith, reasonable compliance with Section 409A of the
Code from January 1, 2008, to December 31, 2010, and (B), except for any
immaterial violations of Section 409A of the Code, has been in compliance with
Section 409A of the Code since January 1, 2011. To the Company's knowledge, no
Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan will result in any participant in such

Code. To the Company's knowledge, the Company does not have any indemnity
obligation for any Taxes imposed under Section 409A of the Code.

  

  

(ix) During the period from January 1, 2007 through the date hereof, the
Company (A) has not been a member of a group filing a consolidated federal

Person (other than the Company's own liability) under Treasury Regulations
Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of state, local, or foreign Law).

  

  

(x) The unpaid Taxes of the Company (A) do not materially exceed the reserve
for Tax liabilities (rather than any reserve for deferred Taxes established to
reflect timing differences between book and Tax income) set forth on the face
of the Interim Balance Sheet (or referred to in any notes thereto) and (B) do
not materially exceed that reserve as adjusted for the passage of time through
the Closing Date in accordance with the past custom and practice of the
Company in filing its Tax Returns. Since the date of the Interim Balance
Sheet, the Company has not incurred any material liability for Taxes arising
from extraordinary gains or losses, as that term is used in GAAP, outside the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice.

  

  

(c) The Company has been a validly electing S corporation within the meaning
of Code Sections 1361 and 1362 at all times since prior to January 1, 2001,
and the Company will continue to be an S corporation up to and including the
Closing Date. Each Shareholder is eligible to own the Shares without causing
the termination of the S corporation status of the Company.

  

  

(d) The Company will not be liable for any Tax under Code Section 1374 in
connection with the deemed sale of the Company's assets caused by the Code
Section 338(h)(10) Election. The Company has not, in the past ten (10) years,
(A) acquired assets from another corporation in a transaction in which the
Company's Tax basis for the acquired assets was determined, in whole or in
part, by reference to the Tax basis of the acquired assets (or any other
property) in the hands of the transferor or (B) acquired stock of any
corporation that is a qualified subchapter S subsidiary.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

17

and have not accelerated any such collections outside the ordinary course of
business. Except as set forth in Schedule 2.9 or Schedule 2.20, as of April

Company arose in bona fide arm's length transactions in the ordinary course of

(a) Schedule 2.21(a) sets forth a list of each employee benefit plan (whether
or not within the meaning of Â§ 3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security
Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA"), and whether or not subject to ERISA),
including each employee pension plan, employee welfare, multiemployer plan
(within the meaning of ERISA Â§Â§ 3(37) or 4001(a)(3) (a "Multiemployer Plan")),
multiple employer welfare arrangement (within the meaning of ERISA Â§ 3(40)),
written or oral employment or consulting agreement, change in control
agreement, severance pay plan or agreement, agreements with respect to leased
or temporary employees, vacation plan or arrangement, sick pay plan, stock
purchase plan, stock option plan, fringe benefit plan, incentive plan, bonus
plan, cafeteria or flexible spending account plan and any deferred
compensation agreement (or plan, program, or arrangement) covering any present
or former employee, director or consultant of the Company and which is
currently sponsored or maintained by or to which contributions are currently
made by (1) the Company, or (2) any other organization which together with the
Company is treated as a single employer under Code Â§Â§ 414(b) or (c) (an "ERISA
Affiliate") or to which the Company or any ERISA Affiliate has any liability.
Each and every such plan, program, policy, practice, arrangement and agreement
is hereinafter referred to as an "Employee Program." In the case of an
Employee Program funded through a trust described in Code Section 401(a) or an
organization described in Code Section 501(c), or any other funding vehicle,
each reference to such Employee Program shall include a reference to such
trust, organization or vehicle.

  

  

(b) Each Employee Program which has been intended to qualify under Section
401(a) or 501(c)(9) of the Code has received a favorable determination or
approval letter from the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") regarding its
qualification under such section and has, to the Company's knowledge, been
qualified under the applicable section of the Code from the effective date of
such Employee Program through and including the Closing Date (or, if earlier,
the date that all of such Employee Program's assets were distributed). No
event or omission has occurred which would reasonably be expected to cause any
Employee Program to lose its qualification or otherwise fail to satisfy the
relevant requirements to provide tax-favored benefits under the applicable
Code Section (including Code Sections 105, 125, 401(a) and 501(c)(9)). No

"prohibited transaction," as defined in Section 406 of the ERISA or Code
Section 4975, (ii) material failure to comply with any provision of ERISA,
other applicable Law, or any agreement, or (iii) non deductible contribution,
which, in the case of either of (i) or (ii), would subject the Company to
liability for any damages, penalties, or taxes, or any other loss or expense.
No litigation or Governmental administrative proceeding (or investigation) or
other proceeding (other than those relating to routine claims for benefits) is
pending or, to the Company's knowledge, threatened with respect to any such
Employee Program. All payments or contributions required to have been made
(under the provisions of any agreements or other governing documents or
applicable Law) with respect to all Employee Programs, for all periods from
January 1, 2001 through the date hereof, either have been made or have been or
will be accrued for in the Closing Balance Sheet (and all such unpaid but
accrued amounts as of December 31, 2010, are described in Schedule 2.21(c)).

"defined benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(35) of ERISA or a defined
contribution plan which is subject to the funding standards of Section 412 of
the Code (e.g., a money purchase plan). Except as set forth on Schedule
2.21(d), during the period from January 1, 2001 through the date hereof, the
Company has not maintained or contributed to or incurred any liability with
respect to a Multiemployer Plan. Except as set forth in Schedule 2.21(d),

Employee Programs has provided health care or any other non-pension benefits
to any employees after their employment is terminated (other than as required
by part 6 of subtitle B of title I of ERISA or other applicable Law) or has
any obligation to provide such post-termination benefits.

  

  

(e) With respect to each Employee Program, complete and correct copies of the
following documents (if applicable to such Employee Program) have previously

Employee Program, and any funding medium for the Employee Program (including

approval letter with respect to such Employee Program under Code Section
401(a) or 501(c)(9), and any applications for determination or approval

5500, with all applicable schedules and accountants' opinions attached

respect to such Employee Program; (v) the summary plan description for such

other filing made pursuant to any federal or state securities law and (viii)

in Schedule 2.21(a) may be amended, terminated or otherwise modified by the
Company or an ERISA Affiliate, as applicable, to the greatest extent permitted
by applicable Law, including the elimination of any and all future benefit
accruals under any Employee Program.

  

  

(g) Each Employee Program has been maintained in compliance in all material
respects with all applicable requirements of federal and state securities laws
including the requirements that the offering of interests in such Employee
Program be registered under the Securities Act of 1933 and/or state "Blue Sky"

2.29 Illegal Payments. Neither the Company nor any of its Affiliates has,
during the past ten (10) years, offered, made or received on behalf of the

Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in this Section 2, the
Company shall not be deemed to have breached any representation or warranty
contained herein based upon the omission of any item required to be set forth
on a particular Schedule if such item has been disclosed in response to any
other Schedule and sufficient information has been provided in connection with
such disclosure (taking into account the context in which the disclosure was
made) to reasonably inform Buyer that such disclosure would also apply to the
subject Schedule. Although any such Schedule may include cross-references to
other Schedules, the failure to include in a Schedule any cross-reference to
any other Schedule shall not be deemed to mean that the disclosures in such
other Schedule do not reasonably inform Buyer of such disclosures for purposes
of the immediately preceding sentence. In addition, the listing of a document
or other item in any of the Schedules shall be adequate to disclose an
exception to a representation or warranty made herein if the nature and
relevance of such exception is reasonably apparent from the listing of such
document or other item.

3.1 Further Assurances. At any time and from time to time after the Closing,
such Shareholder shall, at the request of Buyer and without further

contemplated in this Agreement.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

32  

  

 

 

 

  

  

3.3 Non-competition. From the date of this Agreement and until the fifth (5th)
anniversary thereof (the "Non-Compete Period"), each of Carl W. Holmquist, Tom
R. Braun, Dennis L. Behnke, Richard E. Rust, Cleo Rust, Larry Lunda, Marlee K.
Slifka and Richard S. Slifka (collectively, the "Non-Compete Individuals")
will not, without the prior written consent of Buyer, directly or indirectly,
anywhere within the United States of America, engage in the civil contracting
business, or participate or invest in, or provide or facilitate the provision
of financing to, or assist (whether as owner, part-owner, shareholder, member,
partner, director, officer, trustee, employee, agent or consultant, or in any
other capacity) any Person other than the Company (or an Affiliate of the
Company) that is engaged in the civil contracting business. During the Non-
Compete Period, each of the Non-Compete Individuals shall be prohibited from
(a) hiring or engaging or attempting to hire or engage any officer or employee
of the Company, Buyer or any of its Affiliates, (b) encouraging any such
officer or employee to terminate his or her relationship or employment with
the Company, Buyer or any of its Affiliates, (c) except on behalf of the
Company and its Affiliates, soliciting any customer of the Company, Buyer or
any of its Affiliates engaged in the civil contracting business in the
midwestern United States and (d) diverting to any Person any business
opportunity of the Company, Buyer or any of its Affiliates, in any case in
which such Shareholder is aware that the Company, Buyer or any of such
Affiliates is then pursuing. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary:
(i) the Non-Compete Period for each of Carl W. Holmquist, Tom R. Braun, Dennis
L. Behnke, Richard E. Rust and Cleo Rust shall terminate on the first
anniversary of the date of this Agreement; and (ii) no Non-Compete Individual
shall be prohibited from: (i) making passive investments in any enterprise the
shares of which are publicly traded if such investment constitutes less than
five percent (5%) of the equity of such enterprise; (ii), if applicable,
engaging in any activities permitted under Section 7 of such Non-Compete
Individual's Employment Agreement, or (iii), in the case of Marlee K. Slifka
and Richard S. Slifka, owning and operating Hi-Boom Erecting, Inc., a steel
erecting company based in Wisconsin that bids, as a subcontractor, on bridge-
related structural steel and prestress beam erection, in addition to rebar and
railing installation and other related iron worker tasks (including steel and
prestress beam erection, rebar installation, railing erection and other
miscellaneous activities). The Parties agree that no portion of the Purchase
Price or any other consideration payable under this Agreement shall be
allocated for income Tax purposes to any agreement by any of the Shareholders
pursuant to this Section 3.3. The Parties agree and acknowledge that Buyer
would not have an adequate remedy at Law for the breach by any Non-Compete
Individual of the covenants set forth in this Section 3.3. Accordingly, only
to the extent available under applicable Law, each Non-Compete Individual
acknowledges that Buyer will be entitled to file suit in equity to enjoin such
Non-Compete Individual from any such breach, in addition to any other remedies
which may be available to Buyer hereunder with respect to any such breach.

  

  

3.4 Accounts Receivable. If, as of March 31, 2012, the Company has not
collected in full without set-off or counterclaim all of the Receivables (as
defined below) after using commercially reasonable efforts, then Buyer may
recover from the Indemnity Escrow, subject to the Representation and Warranty
and Covenant Cap and the Shareholder Basket and the provisions of Section 6
related thereto, the amount of the Receivables that has not been collected as
of such date; provided that if any retainage Receivables or notes Receivables
have not been collected prior to such date, Buyer shall only be entitled to
receive that portion of the retainage Receivable or notes Receivable that
Buyer believes in good faith will not be collectible in accordance with the
Company's customary business practices. On or before May 30, 2012, Buyer will
deliver to the Shareholders its good faith estimate of the total amount of
Receivables it reasonably believes will not be so collected or collectible, as
applicable, by June 30, 2012, and for which Buyer is entitled to recourse
under this Section 3.4. Buyer's sole source of recourse for any amounts
payable by the Shareholders under this Section 3.4 that are not so collected
or collectible, as applicable, shall be the Indemnity Escrow. Following any
such payment from the Indemnity Escrow and if requested by the Shareholders,
(a) Buyer shall assign to the Shareholders (in accordance with their
respective Pro Rata Portions), any uncollected Receivables for which the
Shareholders reimbursed Buyer to the extent of their reimbursement, and shall,
if requested by the Shareholders, provide, and shall cause the Company and its
employees to provide, reasonable cooperation to assist the Shareholders in
their efforts to collect any such assigned Receivables (provided that none of
Buyer, the Company or any of their respective employees shall be required to
bear any unreimbursed out-of-pocket costs in connection with providing such
cooperation), and (b) Buyer agrees that if uncollected Receivables for which
Buyer is paid from the Indemnity Escrow are subsequently collected by Buyer,
the Company or any of Buyer's other Subsidiaries, then Buyer shall promptly
(and, in any event within five (5) Business Days of collection) pay a refund
to the Shareholders (in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Portions),
to the extent of such collections. For purposes of this Section 3.4,
"Receivables" means all accounts and notes receivable of the Company (both
current and retainage) set forth on the final Closing Balance Sheet (net of
any reserves).

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

33  

  

 

 

 

  

  

3.5 Realization of Gross Margin.

  

  

(a) The Company represents that Schedule 3.5 sets forth all of the work-in-
progress of the Company as of May 31, 2011, and the projected fee or gross
margin for each project included therein and on Schedule 2.7, on a project-by-
project basis. The Shareholders will deliver to Buyer an updated Schedule 3.5
dated as of the Closing Date ("Updated Schedule 3.5") as soon as reasonably
practicable following the Closing Date but no later than sixty (60) days
thereafter.

  

  

(b) Within five (5) days after final determination of the Gross Margin Results
(as defined below) as provided in Section 3.5(d) below, Buyer may recover from
the Indemnity Escrow, subject to Section 3.5(e), the Representation and
Warranty Cap and the Shareholder Basket, and the provisions of Section 6
related thereto, an amount equal to the excess, if any, of (i) ninety percent
(90%) of the aggregate projected fee or gross margin as of the Closing Date
for all projects listed on Updated Schedule 3.5, as of the Closing Date, less
(ii) the sum of the Gross Margin Results for all of such projects. The term
"Gross Margin Result" for each project shall mean the gross margin for such
project (A) for the twelve month period ended June 30, 2012 (determined in
accordance with GAAP), and (B) any subsequent period for which Buyer, in good
faith, estimates that such gross margin will be recorded in accordance with
the Company's customary business practices.

  

  

(c) Buyer shall use its good faith efforts to realize the Gross Margin Results
on or before June 30, 2012, in accordance with customary construction industry
practices.

  

  

(d) At least ten (10) days prior to the first anniversary of the Closing Date,
Buyer shall in good faith prepare and deliver to the Shareholders a Gross
Margin Results report based on actual and projected (as of a date not more
than thirty (30) days prior to the first anniversary of the Closing Date)
results in accordance with GAAP, together with worksheets and data that
support the Gross Margin Results report and any other information that the
Shareholders may reasonably request in order to verify the Gross Margin
Results. The Gross Margin Results report and the Gross Margin Results
reflected thereon, shall be binding upon the Parties upon the approval of such
Gross Margin Results report by the Shareholders (as reflected in a written
notice that specifically states such approval and references this Section
3.5(d)) or the failure of the Shareholders to object in writing within thirty
(30) days after receipt thereof by the Shareholders. If the Shareholders do
not agree with the Gross Margin Results report and the calculation of Gross
Margin Results stated thereon, and Buyer and the Shareholders cannot mutually
agree on revisions to the same, then within seventy-five (75) days following
receipt by the Shareholders of the Gross Margin Results report, Buyer, the
Company and the Shareholders shall engage the Neutral Auditor to resolve such
dispute. The Neutral Auditor shall review the Gross Margin Results report,
together with worksheets and data that support the Gross Margin Results report
and any other information that the Shareholders had previously requested in
order to verify the Gross Margin Results, as well as any proposed revisions to
the same, and, within thirty (30) days of its appointment, shall make any
adjustments it deems necessary thereto (but only with respect to the items in
dispute), and, upon completion of such review, such Gross Margin Results
report and the Gross Margin Results as of the Closing Date as determined by
the Neutral Auditor shall be binding upon the Parties. If such a review is
conducted, then each of Buyer, on the one hand, and the Shareholders (in
accordance with their respective Pro Rata Portions), on the other hand, shall
pay fifty percent (50%) of all the Neutral Auditor's fees and expenses
associated with such review.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

34  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(e) Buyer's sole source of recourse for any amounts payable under this Section
3.5 shall be the Indemnity Escrow.

  

  

(f) Buyer agrees that, if any projected fee or gross margin is subsequently
recorded by the Company with respect to any project reflected on Updated
Schedule 3.5 on or before December 31, 2015, then Buyer shall, in each such
event, promptly (and in any event within five (5) Business Days of being
realized) pay a refund to the Shareholders (in accordance with their
respective Pro Rata Portions), to the extent of the amount so recorded;
provided, however, that the aggregate amounts refunded to the Shareholders by
Buyer under this Section 3.5(f) shall not exceed the prior payment made from
the Indemnity Escrow under this Section 3.5. From the date hereof through
December 31, 2015, Buyer shall provide the Shareholders with annual reports
(to be delivered as soon as reasonably practicable but in no event later than
March 31 following the applicable year such report relates to) on gross margin
results with respect to the projects contemplated by this Section 3.5(f), in
each case, in such detail as to enable the Shareholders to adequately audit or
review the gross margins of such projects during such period. Buyer shall
permit the Shareholders to conduct any such audits or reviews, from time to
time, at the Shareholders' cost and expense; provided that the Shareholders
shall provide reasonable notice to Buyer of any such audit and the
Shareholders' audit activities shall not unreasonably interfere with the
operations of the business of the Company.

  

  

3.6 Unapproved or Pending Change Orders and Claims.

  

  

(a) The Shareholders will deliver to Buyer updated versions of Schedule
2.24(b) and Schedule 2.24(c), dated as of the Closing Date, as soon as
reasonably practicable after the Closing Date but no later than sixty (60)
days thereafter ("Schedule 3.6"). The pending change orders and claims set
forth on Schedule 3.6, in each case to the extent (and only to the extent)
they are reflected in the Estimated Closing Net Worth, are hereafter referred
to as the "Unapproved or Pending Change Orders and Claims".

  

  

(b) At least ten (10) days prior to the first anniversary of the Closing Date,
Buyer shall in good faith prepare and deliver to the Shareholders a report
(the "Unresolved PCO and Claims Report") setting forth all such Unapproved or
Pending Change Orders and Claims that either remain outstanding (as of a date
not more than thirty (30) days prior to the first anniversary of the Closing
Date) or that have not been offset by any net positive claim, change order or
request for equitable adjustment involving the same customer, subcontractor or
supplier during the period from the Closing Date through the date of such
report (the "Unresolved PCO and Claims"), together with worksheets and data
that support the Unresolved PCO and Claims Report and any other information
that the Shareholders may reasonably request in order to verify the Unresolved
PCO and Claims Report and the Unresolved PCO and Claims reflected thereon. The
Unresolved PCO and Claims Report shall be binding upon the Parties upon the
approval of such Unresolved PCO and Claims Report by the Shareholders (as
reflected in a written notice that specifically states such approval and
references this Section 3.6(b)) or the failure of the Shareholders to object
in writing within thirty (30) days after receipt thereof by the Shareholders
of such report. If the Shareholders do not agree with the Unresolved PCO and
Claims Report, and Buyer and the Shareholders cannot mutually agree on
revisions to the same, then within seventy-five (75) days following receipt by
the Shareholders of the Unresolved PCO and Claims Report, Buyer, the Company
and the Shareholders shall engage the Neutral Auditor to resolve such dispute.
The Neutral Auditor shall review the Unresolved PCO and Claims Report,
together with worksheets and data that support the Unresolved PCO and Claims
Report and any other information that the Shareholders had previously
requested in order to verify the Unresolved PCO and Claims Report, as well as
any proposed revisions to the same, and, within thirty (30) days of its
appointment, shall make any adjustments it deems necessary thereto (but only
with respect to the items in dispute), and, upon completion of such review,
such Unresolved PCO and Claims Report as determined by the Neutral Auditor
shall be binding upon the Parties. If such a review is conducted, then each of
Buyer, on the one hand, and the Shareholders (in accordance with their
respective Pro Rata Portions), on the other hand, shall pay fifty percent
(50%) of all of the Neutral Auditor's fees and expenses associated with such
review.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

35  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) Within five (5) days after final determination of the Unresolved PCO and
Claims as provided in subparagraph (b) of this Section 3.6, Buyer may recover
from the Indemnity Escrow, subject to subparagraph (d) below, the
Representation and Warranty Cap and the Shareholder Basket, and the provisions
of Section 6 related thereto, an amount equal to one hundred percent (100%) of
the Unresolved PCO and Claims.

  

  

(d) Buyer's sole source of recourse for any amounts payable by the
Shareholders under this Section 3.6 shall be the Indemnity Escrow.

  

  

(e) Buyer agrees that, if an amount from any individual Unresolved PCO and
Claim for which Buyer is paid from the Indemnity Escrow is subsequently
recovered by the Company on or before December 31, 2015, whether through
subsequent amendment to such Unresolved PCO and Claim, substitution or
replacement of such change order, claim or adjustment or otherwise, then Buyer
shall, within five (5) Business Days of recovery of any such amount, pay a
refund to the Shareholders (in accordance with their respective Pro Rata
Portions), to the extent of the amount so recovered. From the date hereof
through December 31, 2015, Buyer shall provide the Shareholders with annual
reports (to be delivered as soon as reasonably practicable but in no event
later than March 31 following the applicable year such report relates to) on
amounts subsequently recovered as contemplated by this Section 3.6(e), in each
case, in such detail as to enable the Shareholders to adequately audit or
review the recovery of any such Unresolved PCO and Claims during such period.
Buyer shall permit the Shareholders to conduct any such audits or reviews,
from time to time, at the Shareholders' cost and expense; provided that the
Shareholders shall provide reasonable notice to Buyer of any such audit and
the Shareholders' audit activities shall not unreasonably interfere with the
operations of the business of the Company.

  

  

3.7 Tax Matters.

  

  

(a) In no way as a limit to the rights and obligations of the Parties set
forth in Section 6.6, the Shareholders shall reasonably cooperate, as and to
the extent reasonably requested by Buyer, in connection with any audit,
litigation or other proceeding with respect to Taxes of the Company for all
taxable periods ending on or before the Closing Date and all Straddle Periods
(defined below) for which Buyer has control pursuant to Section 6.6.

  

  

(b) Each Shareholder agrees, upon request, (i) to use his or her commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain any certificate or other document from any
Governmental Authority or any other Person acting on behalf of a Governmental
Authority as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that
could be imposed on the Company (including with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby) for which Buyer is liable hereunder, and (ii) to provide
Buyer with all information that Buyer or the Company may be required to report
pursuant to Code Section 6043 and all Treasury Regulations promulgated
thereunder.

  

  

(c) All Tax sharing agreements or similar agreements with respect to a
consolidated, combined, unitary or similar group for Tax purposes involving
the Company shall be terminated as of the Closing Date and, after the Closing
Date, the Company shall not be bound thereby or have any liability to any of
the Shareholders thereunder.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

36  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(d) The Shareholders shall prepare or cause to be prepared and timely file or
cause to be filed all Internal Revenue Service Forms 1120-S (and any
corresponding Tax Returns for state and local Tax purposes) of the Company,
and any other state or local Tax Returns of the Company for all taxable
periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date, and any Internal Revenue
Service Forms 1065 (and any corresponding Tax Returns for state and local Tax
purposes) of any partnership or other pass-through entity in which the Company
has an interest for all taxable periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date
which the Company is authorized or required to prepare or cause to be prepared
and file or cause to be filed, which are required to be filed after the
Closing Date. The Shareholders shall cause the Tax items recognized by the
Company to be allocated for federal income Tax purposes (and any applicable
state or local Tax purposes) between the portion of the taxable period in
which the Closing occurs during which the Company is an S corporation under
Section 1361(a) of the Code (and any comparable state or local Tax laws) and
the remainder of the taxable period in which the Closing occurs based on an
interim closing of the books as of the close of business on the last day
during which the Company is an S corporation (and for such purpose, the
taxable period of any partnership or other pass-through entity in which the
Company holds a beneficial interest shall be deemed to terminate at such
time). For purposes of any Tax Return of a partnership or other pass-through
entity that is prepared or caused to be prepared by the Shareholders pursuant
to this Section 3.7(d), the Shareholders shall cause the Tax items recognized
by such partnership or other pass-through entity to be allocated for federal
income Tax purposes (and any applicable state or local Tax purposes) between
the taxable period ending on the Closing Date and the taxable period beginning
the day after the Closing Date based on an interim closing of the books as of
the close of business on the Closing Date. The Shareholders shall prepare the
Tax Returns described in this Section 3.7(d) in a manner consistent with the
prior practices of the Company and all applicable Laws, and shall provide such
Tax Returns to Buyer for review and comment at least twenty (20) days prior to
their filing, and shall not file any such Tax Returns without Buyer's prior
written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably delayed or withheld.

  

  

(e) Except as provided in Section 3.7(d), Buyer shall prepare or cause to be
prepared and timely file or cause to be filed all Tax Returns of the Company
and any partnership or other pass-through entity in which the Company has an
interest that are required to be filed after the Closing. In the case of any
such Tax Returns for a taxable period ending on or prior to the Closing Date
or for a Straddle Period, Buyer shall prepare such Tax Returns in a manner
consistent with the prior practices of the Company and the requirements of all
applicable Laws, and shall provide such Tax Returns to the Shareholders for
review and comment at least twenty (20) days prior to their filing, and shall
not file such Tax Returns without the prior written consent of the
Shareholders, which consent shall not be unreasonably delayed or withheld. Not
later than thirty (30) days after any such Tax Return is filed, Buyer shall
deliver a copy of such Tax Return as filed to the Shareholders.

  

  

(f) All refunds (whether payable by payment, credit, offset, reimbursement or
otherwise) of the Taxes of the Company that relate to any taxable period
ending on or before the Closing Date or any portion of a Straddle Period
ending on the Closing Date, to the extent not included in the calculation of
Closing Net Worth, shall be for the benefit of the Shareholders, and Buyer
shall promptly pay the amounts of any such refund received by Buyer, the
Company or any of Affiliates to the Shareholders (in accordance with their
respective Pro Rata Portions), net of (i) Taxes required to be withheld on
such amounts and (ii) any net Taxes imposed on such amounts; provided,
however, Buyer shall not pay the Shareholders any amount which is a result of
a carryback of a net operating loss, deduction or credit attributable to a tax
period that begins after the Closing Date. The Parties shall cooperate in
order to take any steps to claim any such refund.

  

  

3.8 Indemnity Escrow Release. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set
forth herein, on September 28, 2012, Parties agree to instruct the Escrow
Agent to release to the Shareholders from the Indemnity Escrow amounts equal
to their respective Pro Rata Portions of (a) the aggregate amount of the
remaining Indemnity Escrow minus (b) the sum of (i) any unpaid amounts
estimated in good faith to be due to Buyer pursuant to Section 3.4, Section
3.5 and Section 3.6 plus (ii) the amounts estimated in good faith for any
unresolved claims for indemnification under Section 6 as to which notice has
been given on or prior to the Expiration Date (as defined in Section 6.2(d)).

SECTION 5.

  |  

POST-CLOSING COVENANTS OF BUYER.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

Buyer hereby covenants and agrees with the Shareholders as follows:

  

  

5.1 Further Assurances. At any time or from time to time after the Closing,
Buyer shall, at the request of the Shareholders and without further
consideration and, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, execute and
deliver any further instruments or documents and take all such further action
as the Shareholders may reasonably request in order to evidence or otherwise
implement the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

  

  

5.2 Employee Benefits. Following the Closing Date, Buyer, in its sole
discretion shall either (a) continue to maintain the retirement, health and
welfare benefits, programs or arrangements of the Company for the Business
Employees who remain employed by the Company after the Closing Date or (b)
permit such Business Employees to participate in the retirement, health and
welfare benefit plans, programs or arrangements of Buyer (other than the Tutor
Perini Corporation Pension Plan); provided, to the extent that service is
relevant for purposes of eligibility, vesting, calculation of any benefit, or
benefit accrual under any of the retirement, health and welfare benefit plans,
programs or arrangements of Buyer, Buyer shall credit such Business Employees
for service on or prior to the Closing Date that was recognized by the Company
for purposes of the retirement, health and welfare benefit plans, programs or
arrangements maintained by the Company.

  

  

5.3 Tax Matters.

  

  

(a) In no way as a limit to the rights and obligations of the Parties set
forth in Section 6.6, Buyer shall, and shall cause the Company and its
Affiliates to, reasonably cooperate, as and to the extent reasonably requested
by the Shareholders, in connection with the preparation of any Tax Return and
any audit, litigation or other proceeding with respect to Taxes of or with
respect to the Company for all taxable periods ending on or before the Closing
Date and for all Straddle Periods for which the Shareholders have control
pursuant to Section 6.6.

  

  

(b) Buyer agrees, upon request, to use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain any certificate or other document from any Governmental Authority or
any other Person acting on behalf of a Governmental Authority as may be
necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed on
the Company, including with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby,
for which any Shareholder is or may be liable hereunder.

  

  

(c) Buyer shall provide to the Shareholders a copy of any correspondence
received by Buyer, the Company or any of its Affiliates from any Governmental
Authority after the Closing Date in connection with the liability of the
Company for any Taxes for which any Shareholder is or may be liable under this
Agreement.

  

  

(d) Buyer will, and Buyer will cause the Company to, retain all Tax Returns,
books and records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Company
relating to any taxable period beginning before the Closing Date until the
expiration of the applicable statute of limitations for the relevant taxable
periods.

  

  

(e) The Parties agree and acknowledge that the Shareholders would not have an
adequate remedy at Law for the breach by Buyer of the covenants set forth in
this Section 5.3. Accordingly, only to the extent available under applicable
Law, Buyer acknowledges that the Shareholders will be entitled to file suit in
equity to enjoin Buyer from any such breach, in addition to any other remedies
which may be available to the Shareholders hereunder with respect to any such
breach.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

39  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(f) Not later than thirty (30) days after the payment to the Shareholders of
any Indemnity Escrow amount or any Earn-Out Payment, the Shareholders shall
provide to Buyer a written statement containing a computation of the amount of
such payment that is to be treated as interest for federal income Tax purposes
(an "Interest Computation"). Any such Interest Computation will be binding on
the Parties if (a) Buyer fails to object in writing within thirty (30) days
after receipt of such Interest Computation or (b) Buyer approves such Interest
Computation in a written notice that specifically states such approval and
references this Section 5.3(f). If Buyer does not agree with such Interest
Computation, and Buyer and the Shareholders cannot mutually agree on revisions
to the same, then within thirty (30) days following Buyer's objection to such
Interest Computation (or such later date as may be mutually agreed by Buyer
and the Shareholders), Buyer, the Company and the Shareholders shall engage
the Neutral Auditor to resolve such dispute. If such a review is conducted,
then each of Buyer, on the one hand, and the Shareholders (each in accordance
with their respective Pro Rata Portions), on the other hand, shall pay fifty
percent (50%) of all the Neutral Auditor's fees and expenses associated with
such review, and the determination of the Neutral Auditor shall be binding on
the Parties. Neither Buyer, the Company, their respective Affiliates nor the
Shareholders shall take any position inconsistent with any Interest
Computation as finally determined pursuant to this Section 5.3(f) in
connection with any Tax Return or other matter related to Taxes, unless
otherwise required by applicable Law.

  


 

  

5.4 Removal of Guaranties. Buyer will use its reasonable best efforts to
ensure that, within ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, either (i) the
guaranties listed in Schedule 5.4 are terminated or (ii) the indebtedness or
other obligations to which those guaranties relate are retired; provided,
however, that if Buyer is unable to effect the termination of any of those
guaranties or the retirement of any of such indebtedness or other obligations,
Buyer will indemnify and hold harmless the persons listed on Schedule 5.4 (the
"Guarantors") from and against any Losses (as defined in Section 6.1) that the
Guarantors may sustain, suffer or incur and result from or arise out of or
relate to any such guaranties.

  

  

    

SECTION 6.

  |  

INDEMNIFICATION.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

6.1 Indemnification by the Shareholders. Subject to the provisions set forth
in Section 6.2, each Shareholder will indemnify and hold harmless Buyer, its
Subsidiaries and their respective Affiliates and their respective officers,
directors, employees and agents (individually, a "Buyer Indemnified Party" and
collectively, the "Buyer Indemnified Parties") from and against and in respect
of all losses, liabilities, obligations, damages, deficiencies, actions,
suits, proceedings, demands, assessments, orders, judgments, fines, penalties,
costs and expenses (including the reasonable fees, disbursements and expenses
of attorneys, accountants and consultants) of any kind or nature whatsoever
(whether or not arising out of third-party claims and including all amounts
paid in investigation, defense or settlement of the foregoing) sustained,
suffered or incurred by or made against (collectively "Losses" and
individually a "Loss") any Buyer Indemnified Party arising out of, based upon
or in connection with:

  

  

(a) any breach of any representation or warranty made by the Company or by
such Shareholder in this Agreement;

  

  

(b) any breach of any covenant or agreement made by the Company or by such
Shareholder in this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement; and

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

40  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) notwithstanding whether there is a breach of any of the representations
and warranties set forth in Section 2 (including Section 2.8) and except to
the extent already reflected in the calculation of Closing Net Worth, any
liability for Taxes (or the nonpayment thereof) of the Company for (i) all
taxable periods ending on or before the Closing Date and (ii) the portion
through the end of the Closing Date of any taxable period that includes (but
does not end on) the Closing Date (a "Straddle Period"); provided that in no
event shall the Shareholders be required to indemnify Buyer for (A) any such
Taxes (other than Taxes payable by the Shareholders upon the sale of the
Shares to Buyer hereunder) arising from any event occurring on the Closing
Date but after the Closing which is not in the ordinary course of business of
the Company, (B) any such Taxes that are described in Section 1.7 or (C) any
such Taxes arising from a breach described in Section 6.1(a) or (b). For
purposes of clause (ii) of the immediately preceding sentence, the portion
attributable to a Straddle Period of any Income Tax of the Company shall be
determined based on an interim closing of the books as of the close of
business on the Closing Date (and for such purpose, the taxable period of any
partnership or other pass-through entity in which the Company holds a
beneficial interest shall be deemed to terminate at such time), and the
portion attributable to a Straddle Period of any other Tax shall be deemed to
be the amount of such Tax for the entire taxable period multiplied by a
fraction the numerator of which is the number of days in such Straddle Period
up to and including the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the
number of days in the entire Straddle Period.

  

  

Losses described in or arising under subsections (a) through (c) of this
Section 6.1 are collectively referred to as "Buyer Indemnifiable Losses."

  

  

6.2 Limitations on Indemnification by the Shareholders.

  

  

(a) Indemnity Escrow. Subject to the exceptions set forth in Section
1.4(c)(i), Section 1.4(e), Section 1.5(f) and in subsections (g) and (h) of
this Section 6.2, the Parties agree that (i) the Indemnity Escrow shall be the
sole and exclusive source of funds for any claims against, or any amounts due
or payable by or on behalf of, the Shareholders pursuant to or in connection
with this Agreement and (ii) in no event shall Buyer exercise any right to
collect amounts directly or indirectly from the Shareholders, except from the
Indemnity Escrow; provided that the foregoing shall not apply in respect of
any claim against any Shareholder for fraud.

  

  

(b) Maximum Indemnification; Shareholders' Obligations Several. Subject to the
exceptions set forth in subsection (h) of this Section 6.2: (i) the obligation
of the Shareholders to indemnify Buyer Indemnified Parties in respect of any
Buyer Indemnifiable Losses described in or arising under (A) Section 6.1(a) or
(B) Section 6.1(b) (collectively, "Representation and Warranty and Covenant
Losses") shall be limited, in the aggregate, to an amount equal to Eight
Million One Hundred Seventy-Five Thousand Dollars ($8,175,000.00) (the
"Representation and Warranty and Covenant Cap"); and (ii) the obligation of
each Shareholder to indemnify Buyer Indemnified Parties in respect of
Representation and Warranty and Covenant Losses shall be limited, in the
aggregate, to an amount equal to such Shareholder's Pro Rata Portion of the
Representation and Warranty and Covenant Cap; provided, that the foregoing
limitations described in this Section 6.2(b) shall not limit the liability of
a Shareholder with respect to any Buyer Indemnifiable Losses described in or
arising under Section 6.1(a) to the extent attributable to such Shareholder's
fraud. For the avoidance of doubt, the obligations of the Shareholders under
this Agreement are several and not joint.

  

  

(c) Shareholder Basket. Subject to the exceptions set forth in subsection (h)
of this Section 6.2, no indemnification shall be payable with respect to
Representation and Warranty and Covenant Losses except to the extent the
cumulative amount of all Representation and Warranty and Covenant Losses
exceeds Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000.00), individually or in the
aggregate (the "Shareholder Basket"), whereupon the amount of such
Representation and Warranty and Covenant Losses in excess of the Shareholder
Basket shall be recoverable in accordance with the terms hereof.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

41  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(d) Time Limitation. Subject to the exceptions set forth in subsection (h) of
this Section 6.2, no indemnification shall be payable to a Buyer Indemnified
Party with respect to any claim relating to Representation and Warranty and
Covenant Losses asserted after the first anniversary of the Closing Date (the
"Expiration Date"); provided that any claim for indemnification as to which
written notice has been given to the Shareholders prior to the applicable
expiration date shall survive such expiration until final resolution of such
claim.

  

  

(e) Insurance. Any Buyer Indemnifiable Loss shall be net of the dollar amount
of any insurance or other proceeds actually received by the Buyer Indemnified
Parties with respect to the Buyer Indemnifiable Loss. Any Buyer Indemnified
Party seeking indemnity hereunder shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
seek coverage (including both costs of defense and indemnity) under applicable
insurance policies with respect to any such Buyer Indemnifiable Loss. In the
event that a Buyer Indemnified Party receives a payment under any insurance
policy or other proceeds from a third party that would have reduced, pursuant
to this Section 6.2(e), an indemnification payment made out of the Indemnity
Escrow or made directly by the Shareholders hereunder if such payment under
such insurance policy or other third-party source had been received prior to
such indemnification payment on or prior to December 31, 2015, such Buyer
Indemnified Party shall refund to the applicable Shareholders (in proportion
to each such Shareholder's liability that was previously paid pursuant to this
Section 6) an aggregate amount that equals the net amount (taking into account
any costs or expenses, including reasonable attorney's fees, associated with
submitting or otherwise making a claim for, or collecting, such payment or any
increase in any insurance premium based upon the claim made for payment
thereunder) of the reduction that would have so resulted from its earlier
receipt of such payment under such insurance policy or from such third party
(provided that, if the indemnification payment was made out of the Indemnity
Escrow and the Expiration Date has not yet occurred, such Buyer Indemnified
Party may instead deposit such refund into the Indemnity Escrow).

  

  

(f) Materiality. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein,
solely for purposes of Section 6.1 in determining the amount of any Loss
suffered by a Buyer Indemnified Party related to, but not whether there has
occurred, a breach of any representation or warranty of the Company or any
Shareholder, the representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement
shall be considered without regard to any "material," "Material Adverse
Effect" or similar qualifications set forth therein.

  

  

(g) Non-Compete Losses. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in
the event of any Buyer Indemnifiable Loss resulting from, based upon or
arising out of a breach by a Non-Compete Individual who is a Shareholder of
Section 3.3, the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to seek recovery
from such Shareholder; provided, that such Shareholder's liability for any
such Buyer Indemnifiable Loss shall not exceed an amount equal to such
Shareholder's Pro Rata Portion of the Purchase Price.

  

  

(h) No Limitation on Certain Claims. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, but subject to Sections 6.2(d), (e) and (f) and provided that no
Shareholder's liability for any and all Buyer Indemnifiable Losses shall
exceed an amount equal to such Shareholder's Pro Rata Portion of the Purchase
Price, Buyer Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to dollar-for-dollar
indemnification from the first dollar and shall not be subject to the
Shareholder Basket, or the Representation and Warranty and Covenant Cap, or
any limitation as to time (including the Expiration Date) in seeking
indemnification with respect to any of the following:

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

42  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(i) Losses described in or arising under Section 6.1(b) (for the limited
purpose of and to the extent of any Losses due to a breach of Section 3.2 or
Section 3.3) or Section 6.1(c); or

  

  

(ii) Losses described in or arising under Section 6.1(a) involving (A) a
breach by the Company of any of the representations and warranties contained
in (x) Section 2.1, Section 2.2(a), Section 2.3 and Section 2.18, all of which
shall survive indefinitely and (y) Section 2.8 and Section 2.21 (to the extent
the representations and warranties contained in Section 2.21 relate to
violations of any provisions of the Code or ERISA), which shall survive until
thirty (30) days after the expiration of the applicable statue of limitations
(in which case, each Shareholder shall be severally liable up to a maximum
amount equal to such Shareholder's Pro Rata Portion of the resulting Losses)
and (B) a breach by a Shareholder of any of such Shareholder's representations
and warranties contained in Section 2A.1, Section 2A.2 and Section 2A.3, all
of which shall survive indefinitely.

  

  

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, with respect to Losses
described in Sections 6.2(h)(i) and (ii), Buyer Indemnified Parties shall be
entitled to claim against the Indemnity Escrow, set-off against all or any
portion of any Earn-Out Payments (to the extent permitted under Section
1.5(f)) and/or proceed against the Shareholders directly.

  

  

In no event shall the Shareholders be obligated to indemnify a Buyer
Indemnified Party for any Losses arising out of or related to events beyond
the reasonable control of the Company or the Shareholders, including general
economic or political conditions, war, war-like operations, terrorism,
sabotage, shortages, embargos, time extensions (whether pending or granted),
reductions in the capitalization of the Company after the Closing, natural
disasters, changes in Law or the interpretation thereof and changes in
principles or methods of accounting after the Closing.

  

  

6.3 Indemnification by Buyer. Buyer and its successors and permitted assigns
agree to indemnify and hold harmless the Shareholders from and against and in
respect of all Losses arising out of, based upon or in connection with:

  

  

(a) any breach of any representation or warranty made by Buyer in this
Agreement;

  

  

(b) any breach of any covenant or agreement made by Buyer in this Agreement,
the Promissory Note or in the Escrow Agreement; and

  

  

(c) any liability for (i) Taxes of the Company for which the Shareholders are
not liable under Section 1.7 or 6.1(c) and (ii) Taxes of the Shareholders
arising from any event occurring on the Closing Date but after the Closing
which is not in the ordinary course of business of the Company (other than
such Taxes of the Shareholders arising from the Code Section 338(h)(10)

such Shareholder Indemnifiable Losses in excess of the Buyer Basket shall be
recoverable in accordance with the terms hereof.

  

  

(c) No Limitation on Certain Claims. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, Shareholder Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to dollar-for-

expiration until final resolution of such claim.

  

  

6.5 Section 3.3 Indemnity. Each of Larry Lunda, Marlee K. Slifka and Richard
S. Slifka (each a "Nonshareholder Party") will severally and not jointly
indemnify and hold harmless the Buyer Indemnified Parties from and against and
in respect of all Losses any Buyer Indemnified Party arising out of, based
upon or in connection with, a breach by such Nonshareholder Party of Section
3.3; provided, that (i) in the case of Larry Lunda, his liability for any such
Buyer Indemnifiable Loss under this Section 6.5 shall not exceed an amount
equal to the Pro Rata Portion of the Purchase Price received by the Larry
Lunda 2000 Trust Dated December 27, 2000 and (ii) in the case of Marlee K.
Slifka and Richard S. Slifka, their collective liability for any such Buyer
Indemnifiable Loss under this Section 6.5 shall not exceed an amount equal to
the Pro Rata Portion of the Purchase Price received by the Marlee K. Slifka
2000 Trust Dated December 27, 2000. The provisions of Section 6.6(a) shall
apply to any claims for indemnification asserted pursuant to this Section 6.5
as if Section 6.6(a) were incorporated in this Section 6.5 mutatis mutandis.
Each of the Nonshareholder Parties agree and acknowledge that they will
benefit directly and indirectly from the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and that Buyer would not have otherwise consummated the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement without the undertakings made by each
Nonshareholder Party under Section 3.3 and this Section 6.5.

  

  

6.6 Notice; Defense of Claims.

  

  

(a) Notice of Claims. Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party of notice
of any claim, liability or expense to which the indemnification obligations
hereunder would apply, the indemnified party shall give notice thereof in
writing (a "Claim Notice") to the indemnifying party, but the omission to so
notify the indemnifying party promptly will not relieve the indemnifying party
from any liability except (i) to the extent that the indemnifying party shall
have been prejudiced as a result of the failure or delay in giving such Claim
Notice and (ii) that no indemnification will be payable to an indemnified
party with respect to any claim for which the Claim Notice is given after
expiration of the period for which such claim may be made pursuant to Section
6.2(d) or 6.4(d) (as the case may be). Such Claim Notice shall state the
information then available regarding the amount and nature of such claim,
liability or expense, shall specify the provision or provisions of this
Agreement under which the liability or obligation is asserted and transmit a
copy of all papers served with respect to that claim (if any).

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

44  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) Third Party Claims. With respect to third-party claims, if within thirty
(30) days after receiving the Claim Notice the indemnifying party gives
written notice (the "Defense Notice") to the indemnified party stating that
(i) it may be liable under the provisions hereof for indemnity in the amount
of such claim if such claim were successful and (ii) that it disputes and
intends to defend against such claim, liability or expense at its own cost and
expense, then counsel (which, in any matter which relates to Taxes, may
include an accounting firm) for the defense shall be selected by the
indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall not be required to make any
payment with respect to such claim, liability or expense as long as the
indemnifying party is conducting a good faith and diligent defense at its own
expense; provided, however, that the assumption of defense of any such matters
by the indemnifying party shall relate solely to the claim, liability or
expense that is subject or potentially subject to indemnification. The
indemnifying party shall have the right to settle all identifiable matters
related to claims by third parties which are susceptible to being settled,
provided the indemnifying parties' obligation to indemnify the indemnified
party therefore will be fully satisfied; provided, however, that the
indemnifying party shall not settle any matter which (a) relates to Taxes and
may reasonably be expected to have an adverse effect on any Tax liability of
the indemnified party without the consent of the indemnified party, which
consent shall not be unreasonably delayed or withheld, or (b) provides for any
non-monetary relief binding on the indemnified party without the consent of
the indemnified party, which consent shall not be unreasonably delayed or
withheld. The indemnified party shall furnish the indemnifying party with all
information in its possession with respect to the third-party claim and shall
otherwise cooperate with the indemnifying party in the defense of the third-
party claim. The indemnifying party shall keep the indemnified party
reasonably apprised of the status of the claim, liability or expense and any
resulting suit, proceeding or enforcement action, shall furnish the
indemnified party with all documents and information that the indemnified
party shall reasonably request and shall consult with the indemnified party
regarding negotiation and settlement of the claim. Notwithstanding anything
herein stated, except in the case of any matter which relates to Taxes, the
indemnified party shall at all times have the right to fully participate in
such defense at its own expense directly or through counsel; provided,
however, if the named parties to the action or proceeding include both the
indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both
parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate under applicable standards
of professional conduct, the expense of separate counsel for the indemnified
party shall be paid by the indemnifying party. If no Defense Notice is given
by the indemnifying party, the indemnified party shall, at the expense of the
indemnifying party, undertake the defense of (with counsel selected by the
indemnified party), and shall have the right to compromise or settle such
claim, liability or expense. If such claim, liability or expense is one that
by its nature cannot be defended solely by the indemnifying party, then the
indemnified party shall make available all information and assistance that the
indemnifying party may reasonably request and shall cooperate with the
indemnifying party in such defense.

  

  

(c) Non-Third Party Claims. With respect to non-third party claims, if within
thirty (30) days after receiving the Claim Notice the indemnifying party does
not give written notice to the indemnified party that it contests such
indemnity, the amount of indemnity payable for such claim shall be as set
forth in the Claim Notice. If the indemnifying party provides written notice
to the indemnified party within such 30-day period that it contests such
indemnity, the Parties shall attempt in good faith to reach an agreement with
regard thereto within thirty (30) days of delivery of the indemnifying party's
notice. If the Parties cannot reach agreement within such 30-day period, the
matter shall be submitted to J.A.M.S./Endispute, Inc. for arbitration pursuant
to Section 7.11.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

45  

  

 

 

 

  

  

6.7 Survival of Warranties. All representations, warranties, agreements,
covenants and obligations in this Agreement are material and may be relied
upon by the Party receiving the same and shall survive the Closing until the
applicable expiration date regardless of any investigation by or knowledge of
such Party and shall not merge into the performance of any obligation by any
Party, subject to the provisions of this Section 6.

  

  

6.8 Indemnity as Exclusive Remedy. Except as set forth in Sections 1.4, 1.5,
3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6 and 5.3(e), the Parties agree that, from and after the
Closing, their sole and exclusive remedy for any monetary Loss with respect to
any and all claims arising out of or in connection with this Agreement shall
be pursuant and subject to the provisions set forth in this Section 6.

  

  

6.9 No Multiple Recoveries. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
in the event Buyer (or any other Buyer Indemnified Party) is entitled to a
payment or other benefit under more than one provision of this Agreement
arising out of or resulting from the same set of facts or circumstances and
Buyer (or any other Buyer Indemnified Party) has already received payment or
otherwise received a benefit under one of those provisions, in no event shall
Buyer (or any other Buyer Indemnified Party) be entitled to receive a
subsequent payment or benefit under any other provision of this Agreement in
duplication of such prior payment or benefit. For purposes of illustration
(and without limiting the generality of the foregoing), if a set of facts
constitutes a breach of a representation and warranty and gives rise to a Loss
for which the Shareholders have agreed to indemnify the Buyer Indemnified
Parties under this Agreement but a portion of such Loss was previously taken
into account in the determination of Closing Net Worth, then neither Buyer nor
any other Buyer Indemnified Party shall be permitted to claim any right to
indemnification pursuant to this Section 6 with respect to such Loss, to the
extent such Loss was previously taken into account in the determination of
Closing Net Worth. In furtherance of the foregoing, any liability for
indemnification hereunder shall be determined without duplication of recovery
by reason of the state of facts giving rise to such liability constituting a
breach of more than one representation, warranty, covenant or agreement.

  

  

6.10 Waiver of Certain Damages. EXCEPT AS SET FORTH IN SECTIONS 3.4, 3.5 AND
3.6 AND FOR ANY DAMAGES IN CONNECTION WITH A BREACH OF SECTIONS 3.2 AND 3.3,
EACH OF THE PARTIES EXPRESSLY WAIVES AND AGREES NOT TO, AND TO CAUSE ITS
AFFILIATES NOT TO SEEK INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE
(INCLUDING MULTIPLE OR TREBLE DAMAGES) OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES OR DAMAGES FOR
LOST PROFITS OF ANY KIND WITH RESPECT TO ANY MATTER ARISING UNDER, RELATED TO,
OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR BREACH OF THIS AGREEMENT, EXCEPT TO
THE EXTENT ANY PARTY OR ITS AFFILIATES SUFFERS SUCH DAMAGES TO A THIRD PARTY
IN CONNECTION WITH A CLAIM BY A THIRD PARTY, WHICH DAMAGES (INCLUDING COSTS OF
DEFENSE AND REASONABLE ATTORNEYS FEES INCURRED IN CONNECTION WITH DEFENDING
AGAINST SUCH DAMAGES) SHALL NOT BE EXCLUDED BY THIS PROVISION AS TO THE
RECOVERY HEREUNDER.

  

 

  

6.11 Timing Differences. In the event the liability of the Company for Taxes
for which the Shareholders are liable under Section 6.1(c) is increased and
the particular item that produced such increase results in a reduction in the
liability of Buyer, the Company or any of its Affiliates for Taxes for which
the Shareholders are not liable under Section 6.1(c) (a "Buyer Tax Benefit"),
Buyer shall pay to the Shareholders their respective Pro Rata Portions of the
amount of such Buyer Tax Benefit, provided that the total payments under this
sentence by Buyer to the Shareholders with respect to any items shall not
exceed the amount of the additional Taxes paid by the Shareholders under
Section 6.1(c) resulting from such item (a "Shareholder Tax Detriment"). Any
such payment shall be made within ninety (90) days after the due date (with
applicable extensions) of the Tax Return for the taxable period in which the
Buyer Tax Benefit was realized. In the event of the later adjustment, in whole
or in part, of any item that produced the Buyer Tax Benefit or the Shareholder
Tax Detriment, the Shareholders shall refund to Buyer any amounts previously
paid under this Section 6.11 that is determined not to be owing as a result of
such adjustment, or Buyer shall further remit to the Shareholders their
respective Pro Rata Portions of the amount of any increase in the amount to be
paid under this Section 6.11 as a result of such adjustment. Buyer shall
promptly notify the Shareholders of any Buyer Tax Benefit and provide a
statement supporting in reasonable detail the calculation of such Buyer Tax
Benefit. The amount of a Buyer Tax Benefit shall be calculated by comparing
the Taxes payable without the adjustment in question with the Taxes payable
after taking into account such adjustment, in each case determined on a
separate company basis without regard to loss or other carryforwards or
carrybacks.

7.10 Amendments; Waivers. This Agreement may not be amended or modified, nor
may compliance with any condition or covenant set forth herein be waived,
except by a writing duly and validly executed by each of the Parties, or, in
the case of a waiver, the Party waiving compliance. No delay on the part of
any Party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate
as a waiver thereof, nor shall any waiver on the part of any Party of any such
right, power or privilege, or any single or partial exercise of any such
right, power or privilege, preclude any further exercise thereof or the

7.11 Dispute Resolution. Except with respect to injunctive relief, which may
be sought in a court of competent jurisdiction, as more specifically set forth
below, all disputes, claims, or controversies among the Parties and arising
out of or relating to this Agreement or any other agreement executed and
delivered pursuant to this Agreement or the negotiation, validity or
performance hereof and thereof or the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby that are not resolved by mutual agreement shall be resolved solely and
exclusively by binding arbitration to be conducted before J.A.M.S./Endispute,
Inc. or its successor. The arbitration shall be held in Los Angeles,
California, before a single arbitrator and shall be conducted in accordance
with the rules and regulations promulgated by J.A.M.S./Endispute, Inc. unless
specifically modified herein. The Parties covenant and agree that the
arbitration shall commence within ninety (90) days of the date on which any
Party files a written demand for arbitration hereunder. In connection with the
arbitration proceeding, the arbitrator shall have the power to order the
production of documents by each Party and any third-party witnesses. In
addition, each Party may take up to three depositions as of right, and the
arbitrator may in his or her discretion allow additional depositions upon good
cause shown by the moving Party. However, the arbitrator shall not have the
power to order the answering of interrogatories or the response to requests
for admission. In connection with any arbitration, each Party shall provide to
the other, no later than seven (7) Business Days before the date of
commencement of the arbitration hearing, the identity of all persons that may
testify at the arbitration hearing and a copy of all documents that may be
introduced at the arbitration hearing or considered or used by such Party's
witness or expert. The arbitrator's decision and award shall be made and
delivered within six (6) months of the selection of the arbitrator. The
arbitrator's decision shall set forth a reasoned basis for any award of
damages or finding of liability. The arbitrator shall not have the power to
award damages in excess of actual, direct compensatory damages and shall not
multiply actual damages or award punitive damages or any other damages that
are specifically excluded under this Agreement, and each Party hereby
irrevocably waives any claim to such damages. The Parties covenant and agree
that they will participate in the arbitration in good faith, that they will
share equally the fees and expenses of J.A.M.S./Endispute, Inc. and that they
will each bear their own attorneys' fees and expenses, except as otherwise
provided herein. The arbitrator may in his or her discretion assess costs and
expenses (including the reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses of the
prevailing Party) against any Party to a proceeding. Any Party unsuccessfully
refusing to comply with an order of the arbitrator shall be liable for costs
and expenses, including attorneys' fees, incurred by the prevailing Party in
enforcing the award. This Section 7.11 applies equally to requests for
temporary, preliminary or permanent injunctive relief, except that in the case
of temporary or preliminary injunctive relief any Party may proceed in court
without prior arbitration for the limited purpose of avoiding immediate and
irreparable harm. The provisions of this Section 7.11 shall be enforceable in
any court of competent jurisdiction. The prevailing Party in any action for
injunctive relief will be entitled to payment of reasonable attorneys' fees
and expenses. Each of the Parties irrevocably and unconditionally consents to
the exclusive jurisdiction of J.A.M.S./Endispute, Inc. to resolve all
disputes, claims or controversies arising out of or relating to this Agreement
or any other agreement executed and delivered pursuant to this Agreement or
the negotiation, validity or performance hereof and thereof or the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby and further consents to the
jurisdiction of the courts of California for the purposes of enforcing the
arbitration provisions of this Section 7.11. Each Party further irrevocably
waives any objection to proceeding before J.A.M.S./Endispute, Inc. based upon
lack of personal jurisdiction or to the laying of the venue and further
irrevocably and unconditionally waives and agrees not to make a claim in any
court that arbitration before J.A.M.S./Endispute, Inc. has been brought in an
inconvenient forum. Each of the Parties hereby consents to service of process
by registered mail at the address to which notices are to be given. Each of
the Parties agrees that its or his submission to jurisdiction and its or his
consent to service of process by mail are made for the express benefit of the
other Parties.

7.12 Fees and Expenses. Buyer will bear its own expenses in connection with
the negotiation and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the agreements entered into in connection herewith. No expenses
of the Company or the Shareholders relating in any way to the sale of the
Shares hereunder and the transactions contemplated hereby shall in any way be
charged to or paid by Buyer, or paid or accrued by the Company, except to the
extent such expenses (i) have been paid by the Company prior to Closing or
(ii) are accrued by the Company on the Closing Balance Sheet and reflected in
the calculation of the Closing Net Worth as finally determined pursuant to
Section 1.4.

  

  

7.13 Third Party Beneficiaries; Actions by the Shareholders. Except as
expressly provided in this Agreement, each Party intends that this Agreement
shall not benefit or create any right or cause of action in or on behalf of
any Person other than the Parties. Any rights exercisable by the Shareholders
under this Agreement (including any right to object to a determination of
Buyer) may be exercised by any one or more of the Shareholders; provided,
however, that no Shareholder has the authority to bind any other Shareholder
through the exercise of any such right without the joinder of such other
Shareholder.
