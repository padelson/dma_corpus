any lost, stolen, or destroyed Certificate, together with such Pre-Closing
Holder's Concrete Merger Letter of Transmittal, before such Pre-Closing
Holder shall be entitled to receive payment of its applicable portion of the
Merger Consideration pursuant to this _Section 3.2(b)_. Pending such

Company Stock shall have been converted as a result of the Merger.

Contribution Amount;

  



  

(ii) for each Pre-Closing Holder: (w) the number and type of shares

3.4 _Adjustment Amount_.

  



  

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable following the Closing Date,
and in any event (i) within sixty (60) days thereof if the Closing Date is on
the last day of a month or (ii) within ninety (90) days thereof otherwise,
Newco shall prepare and deliver to the Holder Representative (A) an unaudited
consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its Subsidiaries (the " _Final
Closing Balance Sheet_ "), and (B) a reasonably detailed statement (the "
_Closing Statement_ ") setting forth Newco's calculations of: (w) Net Working
Capital as of 11:59 p.m. (Eastern time) on the day immediately prior to the
Closing Date (" _Closing Date Net Working Capital_ "), (x) the aggregate
amount of all Funded Debt of the Company as of immediately prior to the
Closing on the Closing Date (" _Closing Date Funded Debt_ "), (y) the
aggregate Cash of the Company as of immediately prior to the Closing on the
Closing Date not to exceed $3,000,000 (" _Closing Date Cash_ "), and (z) the
aggregate amount of Transaction Expenses as of immediately prior to the
Closing on the Closing Date (the " _Closing Transaction Expenses_ "), in each
case, calculated consistent (except as provided in this _Section 3.4(a)_ )
with the Accounting Principles. The Final Closing Balance Sheet shall be
prepared using the Accounting Principles; _provided_ , _however_ that (I) the
Final Closing Balance Sheet shall not give effect to the consummation of the
Mergers, including any payments of cash in respect of the
Merger Consideration or any Financing transactions in connection therewith
or, after the Concrete Effective Time, any other action or omission by Newco,
the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries that is not in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice, (II) the treatment
of leases as capital leases or operating leases shall be identical to their
treatment in the Interim Balance Sheet, and (III) the Final Closing Balance
Sheet shall not reflect any expense or liability for which Newco is
responsible under this Agreement. From the Closing Date through the final
determination and payment of the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section
3.4_ , Newco shall provide the Holder Representative and its representatives
reasonable access (during normal business hours and upon reasonable advance
notice and at the sole cost and expense of the Holder Representative) to
the records, properties, personnel and (subject to the execution of customary
work paper access letters if requested) auditors of the Company and its
Subsidiaries relating to the preparation of the Closing Balance Sheet and
shall cause the personnel of the Company and its Subsidiaries to cooperate as
promptly as practicable with the Holder Representative in connection with its
review of the Closing Balance Sheet; _provided_ , _however_ , that Newco
shall not be required to provide any information the disclosure of which
would violate applicable Law (including competition or antitrust Law) (
_provided_ , _that_ Newco shall use commercially reasonable efforts to make
alternative arrangements to permit such disclosure in a manner consistent with
applicable Law) or which would, based on the advice of counsel, result in the
waiver of attorney client privilege ( _provided_ , _that_ Newco and the
Holder Representative shall cooperate to permit such disclosure in a manner
consistent with the preservation of such privilege).

  



  

(b) If the Holder Representative shall disagree with the
calculations of Closing Date Net Working Capital, Closing Date Funded Debt,
Closing Date Cash or Closing Transaction Expenses set forth in the Closing
Statement, it shall notify Newco of such disagreement in writing (a "
_Disagreement Notice_ "), setting forth in reasonable detail the particulars
of such disagreement, within thirty (30) days after its receipt of the
Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing Statement. In the event that the Holder
Representative does not provide a notice of disagreement within such thirty
(30)-day period, the Holder Representative and Newco shall be deemed to have
agreed to the Closing Balance Sheet and the calculations of Closing Date Net
Working Capital, Closing Date Funded Debt, Closing Date Cash and Closing
Transaction Expenses set forth in the Closing Statement, which shall be final,
binding and conclusive for all purposes hereunder. In the event any
Disagreement Notice is timely provided, Newco and the Holder Representative
shall use reasonable best efforts for a period of thirty (30) days (or such
longer period as they may mutually agree) to resolve any disagreements with
respect to the calculations of Closing Date Net Working Capital, Closing Date
Funded Debt, Closing Date Cash or Closing Transaction Expenses. If, at the
end of such period, they are unable to resolve such disagreements, then any
such remaining disagreements shall be resolved by Ernst and Young LLP or such
other independent accounting or financial consulting firm of
recognized national standing as may be mutually selected by Newco and the
Holder Representative (such firm, subject to the following proviso, the "
_Accounting Referee_ "). Each of Newco and the Holder Representative shall
promptly provide their respective assertions regarding Closing Date Net
Working Capital, Closing Date Funded Debt, Closing Date Cash and Closing
Transaction Expenses and, to the extent relevant thereto, the Final Closing
Balance Sheet in writing to the Accounting Referee and to each other;
_provided_ ,  _that_ no party shall disclose to the Accounting Referee any
settlement discussions (or the contents thereof) between the parties without
the prior consent of the other party. The Accounting Referee shall be
instructed to render its determination with respect to such disagreements as
soon as reasonably possible (which the parties hereto agree should not be
later than thirty (30) days following the day on which the disagreement is
referred to the Accounting Referee). The Accounting Referee shall base
its determination solely on (i) the written submissions of the parties and
shall not conduct an independent investigation and (ii) the extent (if any)
to which Closing Date Net Working Capital, Closing Date Funded Debt, Closing
Date Cash or Closing Transaction Expenses require adjustment (only with
respect to the remaining disagreements submitted to the Accounting Referee) in
order to be determined in accordance with _Section 3.4(a)_ (including the
definitions of the defined terms used in _Section 3.4(a)_ ), and the parties
shall instruct the Accounting Referee to make all determinations in accordance
with the Accounting Principles, notwithstanding the availability of other
accounting methods, policies, practices and/or procedures under GAAP or
otherwise. The Accounting Referee may not assign a value greater than the
greatest value for a disputed item claimed by either party or smaller than
the smallest value for such item claimed by either party. The determination of
the Accounting Referee shall be final, conclusive and binding on the parties.
The date on which Closing Date Net Working Capital, Closing Date Funded Debt,
Closing Date Cash and Closing Transaction Expenses are finally determined in
accordance with this _Section 3.4(b)_ is hereinafter referred to as the "
_Determination Date_." All fees and expenses of the Accounting Referee
relating to the work, if any, to be performed by the Accounting Referee
hereunder shall be borne pro rata as between Newco, on the one hand, and the
Holder Representative from the Holder Representative Expense Amount, on the
other hand, in proportion to the allocation of the dollar value of the
amounts in dispute as between Newco and the Holder Representative (as set
forth in the written submissions to the Accounting Referee) made by the
Accounting Referee such that the party prevailing on the greater dollar value
of such disputes pays the lesser proportion of the fees and expenses. For
example, if the Holder Representative challenges items underlying the
calculations of Closing Date Net Working Capital, Closing Date Funded Debt,
Closing Date Cash and Closing Transaction Expenses in the net amount of
$1,000,000, and the Accounting Referee determines that Newco has a valid
claim for $400,000 of the $1,000,000, Newco shall bear sixty percent (60%) of
the fees and expenses of the Accounting Referee and the Holder Representative
shall bear the remaining forty percent (40%) of the fees and expenses of the
Accounting Referee from the Holder Representative Expense Amount.

_Section 3.4(b)_ ), _minus_  Estimated Closing Date Cash, _plus_ (iv)
Estimated Transaction Expenses, _minus_ Closing Transaction Expenses (as
finally determined in accordance with _Section 3.4(b)_ ). If the Adjustment
Amount is a positive number, then the Merger Consideration shall be increased
by the Adjustment Amount, and if the Adjustment Amount is a negative number,
then the Merger Consideration shall be decreased by the absolute value of the
Adjustment Amount. The Adjustment Amount shall be paid in accordance with
_Section 3.4(d)_ or _Section 3.4(e)_ , as applicable.

  



  

(d) If the Adjustment Amount is a positive number, then, promptly
following the Determination Date, and in any event within three (3) Business
Days of the Determination Date, (i) Newco shall pay by wire transfer of
immediately available funds (x) to the Exchange Agent (for further delivery
to each Pre-Closing Holder based on such Pre-Closing Holder's Fully-Diluted
Percentage in respect of its shares of Company Stock) an amount in cash equal
to (A) the US Escrow Percentage of the Adjustment Amount, _multiplied by_ (B)
the sum of all Pre-Closing Holders' Fully-Diluted Percentages in respect of
the shares of Company Stock held by all Pre-Closing Holders, (y) to the
Surviving Corporation (for further delivery to each Pre-Closing Holder based
on such Pre-Closing Holder's Option Pro-Rata Share) an amount in cash equal
to (A) the US Escrow Percentage of the Adjustment Amount, _multiplied by_ (B)
the sum of all Pre-Closing Holders' Option Pro-Rata Shares _multiplied by_ (C)
the US Escrow Percentage, and (z) to the UK Rollover Investors an amount in
cash equal to the UK Escrow Percentage of the Adjustment Amount (to be
allocated among the UK Rollover Investors in accordance with the UK Share
Purchase Agreement); and (ii) the parties shall jointly instruct the Escrow
Agent in writing to pay (x) to the Exchange Agent (for further delivery to
each Pre-Closing Holder based on such Pre-Closing Holder's Escrow Percentage
in respect of the shares of Company Stock held by such Pre-Closing Holder
immediately prior to the Concrete Effective Time) an amount in cash equal to
(A) the US Escrow Percentage of the Adjustment Escrow Amount, _multiplied by_
(B) the Aggregate Stock Escrow Percentage, (y) to the Surviving Corporation
(for further delivery to each Pre-Closing Holder based on such Pre-Closing
Holder's Escrow Percentage in respect of the Vested Options held by such Pre-
Closing Holder immediately prior to the Concrete Effective Time) an amount in
cash equal to (A) the US Escrow Percentage of the Adjustment Escrow Amount, 
_multiplied by_ (B) the Aggregate Option Escrow Percentage and (z) to the UK
Rollover Investors an amount in cash equal to the UK Escrow Percentage of the
Adjustment Escrow Amount (to be allocated among the UK Rollover Investors in
accordance with the UK Share Purchase Agreement).

  



    

33 
--- 

 



    



  

(e) If the Adjustment Amount is a negative number (the absolute
value of such amount, the " _Deficit Amount_ "), then, promptly following the
Determination Date, and in any event within three (3) Business Days of the
Determination Date, (i) the parties shall jointly instruct the Escrow Agent
in writing to pay, from the Adjustment Escrow Amount to Newco an amount equal
to the Deficit Amount, and (y) if any of the Escrow Funds remain after such
payment to Newco, (I) to the Exchange Agent (for further delivery to each
Pre-Closing Holder based on such Pre-Closing Holder's Escrow Percentage in
respect of the shares of Company Stock held by such Pre-Closing Holder
immediately prior to the Concrete Effective Time) an amount in cash equal to
(A) the US Escrow Percentage of the remaining Adjustment Escrow Amount,
_multiplied by_ (B) the Aggregate Stock Escrow Percentage, and (II) to the
Surviving Corporation (for further delivery to each Pre-Closing Holder based
on such Pre-Closing Holder's Escrow Percentage in respect of the Vested
Options held by such Pre-Closing Holder immediately prior to the Concrete
Effective Time) an amount in cash equal to (A) the US Escrow Percentage of
the remaining Adjustment Escrow Amount, _multiplied by_ (B) the Aggregate
Option Escrow Percentage and (III) to the UK Rollover Investors an amount in
cash equal to the UK Escrow Percentage of the remaining Adjustment Escrow
Amount (to be allocated among the UK Rollover Investors in accordance with the
UK Share Purchase Agreement).

  



  

(f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, any distributions by the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries in respect of any Vested Options pursuant to this
Agreement, including pursuant to _Section 3.4(d)_ or this _Section 3.4(f)_ to
Pre-Closing Holders who are current or former employees of the Company or its
Subsidiaries shall be subject to _Section 3.8_ below. In no event shall the
Holder Representative or any Pre-Closing Holder have any liability under this
_Section 3.4_ in excess of such holder's allocable share of the Escrow Funds.
In no event shall Newco be entitled to payment pursuant to this _Section
3.4(f)_ of any amount in excess of the Escrow Funds.

  



  

3.5 _Holder Representative Expense Amount_. On the Closing Date,
Newco shall pay to the Holder Representative the Holder Representative
Expense Amount or to such other persons (and in such amounts) as may be
designated by the Holder Representative, by wire transfer to an account or
accounts designated by the Holder Representative in writing at least two (2)
Business Days prior to the Closing Date, in immediately available funds.
Whether or not paid on or prior to the Closing Date, no amount shall be
included on the Closing Balance Sheet with respect to liabilities for the
Holder Representative Expense Amount. The Holder Representative shall retain
the Holder Representative Expenses Amount for the purpose of paying any fees,
costs, expenses and Taxes incurred, or that may in the future be incurred, by
the Holder Representative in connection with the performance of its
obligations under this Agreement and each of the documents to be executed in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.

  



  

3.6 _Exchange Agent_. Following the date which is one year after the
Concrete Effective Time, Newco may instruct the Exchange Agent to deliver to
Newco all cash, Certificate(s) and other documents in its possession relating
to the transactions contemplated hereby, and if so elected by Newco the
Exchange Agent's duties shall terminate. Thereafter, each Pre-Closing Holder
may deliver a Concrete Merger Letter of Transmittal (and surrender any
Certificate(s), if applicable) to Newco and (subject to applicable abandoned
property, escheat and similar Laws) receive in consideration therefor, and
Newco shall promptly pay, the portion of the Merger Consideration deliverable
in respect thereof as determined in accordance with this Article III
without any interest thereon.

  



    

34 
--- 

 



    



  

3.7 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of
this _Article III_ , any shares of Company Stock held by Persons who object
to the Concrete Merger and comply with the provisions of the DGCL concerning
the rights of holders of Company Stock to dissent from the Concrete Merger
and require appraisal of their shares of Company Stock (" _Dissenting Shares_
" and such Persons, " _Dissenting Stockholders_ ") shall not be converted into
a right to receive any portion of the Merger Consideration and the holders
thereof shall be entitled to such rights as are granted by Section 262 of the
DGCL. Each holder of Dissenting Shares who becomes entitled to payment for
such shares pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL shall receive payment
therefor from the Surviving Corporation in accordance with the DGCL;
_provided_ , _however_ , that (i) if any such holder of Dissenting Shares
shall have failed to establish such holder's entitlement to appraisal
rights as provided in Section 262 of the DGCL, or (ii) if any such holder of
Dissenting Shares shall have effectively withdrawn such holder's demand for
appraisal of such shares or lost such holder's right to appraisal and payment
for such holder's shares under Section 262 of the DGCL, such holder shall
forfeit the right to appraisal of such shares and each such share shall not
constitute a Dissenting Share and shall be treated as if it had been a Common
Share or Preferred Share (as applicable) immediately prior to the Concrete
Effective Time and converted, as of the Concrete Effective Time, into a right
to receive from the Surviving Corporation the portion of the Merger
Consideration deliverable in respect thereof as determined in accordance with
this _Article III_ , without any interest thereon (and such holder shall be
treated as a Pre-Closing Holder). The Company shall provide Newco
prompt written notice of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of
shares of Company Stock, any withdrawal of any such demand and any other
demand, notice or instrument delivered to the Company prior to the Concrete
Effective Time pursuant the DGCL that relates to such demand and Newco shall
have the opportunity to participate in, but not control any, negotiations and
proceedings with respect to such demands. Without the prior written consent
of Newco (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed),
the Company shall not voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or settle
or offer to settle, any such demand for payment. From and after the Concrete
Effective Time, no stockholder of the Company who has properly exercised and
perfected appraisal rights pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL shall be
entitled to vote his or her shares of Company Stock for any purpose or
receive payment of dividends or other distributions with respect to his or her
shares of Company Stock (except dividends and distributions payable to
stockholders of record at a date which is prior to the Concrete Effective
Time).

  



  

3.8 _Withholding_. Newco, the Company, the Holder Representative,
the Exchange Agent and the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the consideration otherwise payable or deliverable in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to any Person
such amounts (if any) that Newco, the Company, the Holder Representative, the
Exchange Agent and the Escrow Agent are required to deduct and withhold with
respect to any such deliveries and payments under applicable Law; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that no amounts will be withheld (other than payroll withholding
in respect of the Vested Options) from any payments in respect of Preferred
Shares, Common Shares or Dissenting Shares so long as the Company delivers the
certificate referred to in _Section 8.6(h)_. To the extent that amounts are
so withheld, and duly and timely deposited with the appropriate Governmental
Authority, by Newco, the Company, the Holder Representative, the Exchange
Agent or the Escrow Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made.

  



  

3.9 _Industrea Merger_.

  



  

(a) At the Industrea Effective Time, by virtue of the Industrea
Merger and without any further action on the part of any stockholder
of Newco, Industrea or Industrea Merger Sub, each share of Industrea Stock
held by Newco, Concrete Parent, Concrete Merger Sub or the Company in
treasury or otherwise, shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist,
and no consideration shall be delivered or receivable in exchange therefor
(such shares, " _Industrea Cancelled Shares_ ").

  



    

35

(b) Without in any way limiting the effect of the provisions in the
Expense Reimbursement Letter, at the Industrea Effective Time, by virtue of
the Industrea Merger and without any action on the part of any holder of
Industrea Stock, (i) each share of Industrea Stock (a " _Industrea Share_ ")
that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Industrea Effective
Time (other than Industrea Cancelled Shares and shares of Industrea Stock
redeemed for cash under the terms of Industrea's certificate of
incorporation) shall thereupon be canceled and converted into and become the
right to receive one Newco Common Share as follows: each share of Industrea
Class A Common Stock will be exchanged into one share of Newco Common Stock
and each share of Industrea Class B Common Stock will also be exchanged into
one share of Newco Common Stock and (ii) all shares of Newco capital stock
held by Industrea as of immediately prior to the Industrea Effective Time
shall be automatically cancelled and retired for no consideration.

  



  

(c) At the Industrea Effective Time, by virtue of the Industrea
Merger and without any action on the part of Industrea or Industrea
Merger Sub, each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of
Industrea Merger Sub shall be converted into one share of common stock, par
value $0.0001 per share, of the Industrea Surviving Corporation.

  



  

(d) At and as of the Industrea Effective Time, in accordance with
the terms of the Warrant Agreement, each issued and outstanding Warrant will
become exercisable for one share of Newco Common Stock at the same exercise
price per share and on the same terms in effect immediately prior to the
Industrea Effective Time, and the rights and obligations of Industrea under
the Warrant Agreement will be assigned and assumed by Newco, pursuant to the
terms of a customary assumption agreement in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to the Company.

  



  

(e) _Exchange Procedure_.

  



  

(i) Prior to Closing, Newco, Industrea and the Exchange Agent shall
enter into an exchange agent agreement, in a form reasonable acceptable to
Newco and Industrea.

  



  

(ii) As soon as reasonably practicable following the date hereof,
Industrea shall (x) deposit with the Exchange Agent in trust for the benefit
of the holders of shares of Industrea Stock prior to the Closing, certificates
representing the Newco Common Shares issuable pursuant to _Section 2.3(b)_
hereof (or appropriate alternative arrangements shall be made if such
securities will be issued in book-entry form) and (y) cause the Exchange
Agent to mail or otherwise deliver to each holder of shares of Industrea Stock
(each, a " _Industrea Stockholder_ ") (1) a letter of transmittal in
customary form provided by the Exchange Agent and (2) instructions for use in
surrendering the certificates representing shares of Industrea Stock (the "
_Industrea Certificates_ ") and receiving the Newco Common Shares issuable in
respect of the shares of Industrea Stock represented thereby or otherwise
held by such Industrea Stockholder. After the Industrea Effective Time, each
Industrea Stockholder, upon surrender of an Industrea Merger Letter of
Transmittal, shall be entitled to receive from the Exchange Agent in exchange
therefor such number and type of Newco Common Shares as described in the
Industrea Closing Exchange Schedule. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the
event that, prior to the Closing Date, an Industrea Stockholder delivers an
Industrea Merger Letter of Transmittal, duly completed and validly
executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, such Industrea
Stockholder shall be entitled to receive from the Exchange Agent in exchange
therefor at the Closing such Newco Common Shares as described in the
immediately preceding sentence. In the event that any Industrea Stockholder's
shares of Industrea Stock are certificated, such Industrea Stockholder shall
be required to surrender and deliver to the Exchange Agent all Industrea
Certificates, or a duly completed affidavit of loss (in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to Newco) with respect to any lost, stolen, or
destroyed Industrea Certificate, together with such Industrea
Stockholder's Industrea Merger Letter of Transmittal, before such Industrea
Stockholder shall be entitled to receive payment of its applicable portion of
the Newco Common Shares pursuant to this _Section 3.9(e)(ii)_. Pending such
surrender of an Industrea Stockholder's Industrea Certificate(s), such
Industrea Certificate(s) shall be deemed for all purposes to evidence such
Industrea Stockholder's right to receive the Newco Common Shares into which
such shares of Industrea Stock shall have been converted as a result of
the Industrea Merger.

  



    

36 
--- 

 



    



  

(f) From and after the Industrea Effective Time, (i) Industrea
Stockholders shall cease to have any rights as stockholders of Industrea and
(ii) the consideration paid pursuant to this _Section 3.9_ upon the delivery
of the Industrea Merger Letters of Transmittal (and surrender of Industrea
Certificates, if any) in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to
have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of
Industrea Stock, subject to the continuing rights of Industrea
Stockholders under this Agreement. At the Industrea Effective Time, the
transfer books of Industrea shall be closed and no transfer of shares of
Industrea Stock shall be made thereafter.

  



  

(g) Newco may cause the Exchange Agent to return any Newco Common
Shares remaining unclaimed 180 days after the Industrea Effective Time, and
thereafter each remaining record holder of outstanding shares of Industrea
Stock shall be entitled to look to Newco (subject to abandoned property,
escheat, and other similar laws) as a general creditor thereof with respect to
such shares and warrants and dividends and distributions thereon to which he,
she, or it is entitled upon surrender of his, her, or its certificates.

  



  

(h) The Industrea Parties shall, at or prior to the Industrea
Effective Time, cause any lockup agreements to which Industrea is a party to
be assigned to and assumed by Newco and such lockup agreement shall, from and
after the Industrea Effective Time, govern the Newco Common Shares issued in
exchange for the applicable Industrea Shares.

on a timely basis any term or condition of closing to be satisfied by it
contained in any Subscription Agreement. Except as set forth in the Argand

claims, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any Action, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or
pertaining to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Concrete
Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
Concrete Effective Time, to the fullest extent that the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, as the case may be, would have been permitted under applicable
Law and its respective certificate of incorporation, bylaws or other
organizational documents in effect on the date of this Agreement to indemnify
such person (including promptly advancing expenses as incurred to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable Law). Without limiting the foregoing, Newco
shall cause the Company and each of its Subsidiaries for a period of not less
than six (6) years from the Concrete Effective Time (i) to
maintain provisions in its certificate of incorporation, bylaws or other
organizational documents concerning the indemnification and
exoneration (including provisions relating to expense advancement) of the
Company's and its Subsidiaries' former and current officers, directors and
employees that are no less favorable to those Persons than the provisions of
the certificate of incorporation, bylaws or other organizational documents of
the Company or such Subsidiary, as applicable, in each case, as of the date of
this Agreement, and (ii) not to amend, repeal or otherwise modify such
provisions in any respect that would adversely affect the rights of
those Persons thereunder, in each case, except as required by Law.

  



  

(b) The Company, at its sole cost and expense (which, to the extent
unpaid as of the Closing, shall be deemed a Transaction Expense), shall cause
coverage to be extended under the current directors' and officers' liability
insurance policies by obtaining at or prior to the Closing a prepaid, non-
cancelable six-year "tail" policy containing terms not less favorable
than the terms of such current insurance coverage with respect to matters
existing or occurring at or prior to the Concrete Effective Time. The
aggregate amount actually paid to purchase such "tail" coverage shall be
referred to as the " _D andO Tail Premium_".

  



  

(c) The rights of indemnification and to receive advancement of
expenses as provided by this Agreement shall not be deemed exclusive of any
other rights to which any Person entitled to indemnification under this
_Section 7.2_ (an " _Indemnified Person_ ") may at any time be entitled. No
right or remedy herein conferred by this Agreement is intended to be exclusive
of any other right or remedy, and every other right and remedy shall be
cumulative and in addition to every other right and remedy given hereunder or
now or hereafter existing at Law or in equity or otherwise. The assertion of
any right or remedy hereunder, or otherwise, shall not prevent the concurrent
or subsequent assertion of any other right or remedy. Newco hereby
acknowledges that the Indemnified Persons have or may, in the future, have
certain rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses or insurance
provided by other Persons (collectively, " _Other Indemnitors_ "). Newco
hereby agrees that, with respect to any advancement or
indemnification obligation owed, at any time from and after the Closing, to
an Indemnified Person by Newco, the Concrete Surviving Corporation or any of
its Subsidiaries or any Other Indemnitor, whether pursuant to any certificate
of incorporation, bylaws, partnership agreement, operating agreement,
indemnification agreement or other document or agreement or pursuant to this
_Section 7.2_ , and Newco, the Concrete Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries shall be at all times the indemnitors of first resort (i.e.,
Newco's, the Concrete Surviving Corporation's and its Subsidiaries'
obligations to an Indemnified Person shall be primary and any obligation of
the Other Indemnitors to advance expenses or to provide indemnification for
the same expenses or liabilities incurred by an Indemnified Person shall be
secondary).

(d) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the
contrary, this _Section 7.2_ shall survive the consummation of the Concrete
Merger indefinitely and shall be binding, jointly and severally, on all
successors and assigns of Newco and the Concrete Surviving Corporation. In
the event that Newco or the Concrete Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns consolidates with or merges into any other
Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger, or transfers or conveys all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Newco or
the Concrete Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall succeed to the
obligations set forth in this _Section 7.2_.

  



  

(e) Newco shall assume, and be jointly and severally liable with the
Company and its Subsidiaries for, and shall cause the Company and
its Subsidiaries to honor, each of the covenants in this _Section 7.2_.

  



  

7.3 _Employment Matters_.

  



  

(a) For a period of no less than one (1) year following the Closing
Date, Newco shall, or shall cause the Concrete Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to, provide to each employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries
who continues in employment with the Concrete Surviving Corporation or any of
their Subsidiaries following the Closing Date (the " _Continuing Employees_ ")
with (i) at least the same base salary or wage rate, as applicable, and
annual cash incentive opportunity (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt,
equity compensation, phantom equity compensation, and retention or transaction
bonuses), if any, as those provided to such Continuing Employee immediately
prior to the Closing and (ii) provide other employee benefits (including tax-
qualified retirement, health, welfare and severance, but excluding equity
compensation, phantom equity compensation, and retention or transaction
bonuses) which are no less favorable, in the aggregate, than those provided
to the Continuing Employees immediately prior to the Closing.

  



  

(b) For purposes of determining eligibility, vesting, participation
and benefit accrual (other than for purposes of benefit accrual under any
defined benefit pension, retiree health or welfare, deferred compensation or
supplemental retirement plan) under Newco's and its Subsidiaries' plans and
programs providing employee benefits to Continuing Employees after the Closing
Date (the  " _Industrea Benefit Plans_ "). Newco shall (or shall cause one of
its Subsidiaries to) credit each Continuing Employee with his or her years of
service with the Company and its Subsidiaries (and their predecessors) prior
to the Closing Date to the same extent as such Continuing Employee was (or
would have been) entitled, before the Closing Date, to credit for such
service under Company Benefit Plans, except to the extent providing such
credit would result in any duplication of benefits. In addition, Newco shall
(or shall cause one of its Subsidiaries to) use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause (i) each Continuing Employee to be immediately eligible to
participate, without any waiting time, in any and all Industrea Benefit Plans,
(ii) each Industrea Benefit Plan providing medical, dental, hospital,
pharmaceutical or vision benefits, all pre-existing condition exclusions
and actively-at-work requirements of such Industrea Benefit Plan to be waived
for such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents (except to the
extent that such exclusions or requirements applied to the Continuing Employee
under comparable Company Benefit Plans), and (iii) any co-payments,
deductibles and other eligible expenses incurred by such Continuing Employee
and/or his or her covered dependents during the plan year ending on the
Closing Date to be credited for purposes of satisfying all deductible,
coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such
Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan
year of each comparable Industrea Benefit Plan (to the extent such credit
would have been given under comparable Company Benefit Plans prior to the
Closing).

(c) This  _Section 7.3_ is for the sole benefit of the parties
hereto and shall not, and shall not be construed so as to, (i) create any
third-party right in any Person, including any Continuing Employee, (ii)
confer upon any Person the right to employment or continued employment for
any period of time, or any right to any particular term or condition of
employment, (iii) constitute an amendment or modification of any employee
benefit plan, or (iv) obligate Newco, the Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries to adopt or maintain any compensatory or benefits plan,
agreement arrangement or prevent Newco, the Company or any of their
respective Subsidiaries from modifying or terminating any such plan, program
or other arrangement.

  



  

7.4 _Financing Efforts_.

  



  

(a) The Industrea Parties shall use reasonable best efforts to take,
or cause to be taken, all actions and do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary or advisable to arrange the Debt Financing as promptly as
practicable following the date hereof and to consummate the Debt Financing on
the Closing Date. Such actions shall include, but not be limited to, the
following: (i) maintaining in effect the Debt Commitment Letters; (ii)
causing the Argand Equity Investment to be consummated upon satisfaction of
the Financing Conditions contained in the Argand Subscription Agreement;
(iii) satisfying on a timely basis all Financing Conditions; (iv)
negotiating, executing and delivering definitive agreements and other
documentation ("Debt Financing Documents") that reflect the terms contained
in the Debt Commitment Letters (including any "market flex" provisions related
thereto); (v) enforcing its rights under the Debt Commitment Letters in the
event of a Financing Failure Event and (vi) in the event that the
conditions set forth in _Sections 9.1_ and _9.2_ and the Financing Conditions
have been satisfied or, upon funding would be satisfied, cause the financing
providers to fund the full amount of the Financing. Industrea shall give the
Company prompt notice of any breach, repudiation, or threatened or
anticipated breach or repudiation, by any party to a Debt Commitment Letter of
which Industrea or its Affiliates becomes aware. Without limiting the
Industrea Parties' other obligations under this _Section 7.4_ , if a
Financing Failure Event occurs the Industrea Parties shall (x) promptly notify
the Company of such Financing Failure Event and the reasons therefor, (y) in
consultation with the Company, obtain alternative financing from alternative
financing sources, in an amount sufficient to make the Closing Date Payments
and consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, as
promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event, and (z)
obtain, and when obtained, provide the Company with a copy of, a new
financing commitment, subject only to the Financing Conditions, that provides
for such alternative financing. Neither Industrea nor any of its Affiliates
shall amend, modify, supplement, restate, assign, substitute or replace a Debt
Commitment Letter or any Debt Financing Document except for (a) substitutions
and replacements pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence; or (b)
if such amendment, modification, supplement, restatement, assignment,
substitution or replacement (i) does not contain additional conditions,
modified conditions or other contingencies, in each case to the funding of the
debt financing relative to those contained in Debt Commitment Letters for the
debt financing as in effect on the date of this Agreement, (ii) or is
otherwise not reasonably likely to (x) impair or materially delay the funding
of the Debt Financing or (y) impair or materially delay the Closing and
(iii) does not reduce the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing as of the
date of this Agreement; _provided_ , _that_ , notwithstanding the foregoing,
it is hereby understood and agreed that the Industrea Parties may amend either
Debt Commitment Letter to (A) add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners,
syndication agents or similar entities who had not executed such Debt
Commitment Letter as of the date hereof and provide such lenders, lead
arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities with consent
rights with respect to existing conditions to the consummation of the
financings contemplated by such Debt Commitment Letter to the extent that the
commitments in the aggregate of the lenders to provide the financings
contemplated by such Debt Commitment Letter are not reduced as a result of
any such amendment and (B) implement any "market flex" provisions contained in
a Debt Commitment Letter. Upon any such amendment, supplement, modification
or replacement of a Debt Commitment Letter or Debt Financing Document in
accordance with this _Section 7.4(a)_ , the term "Debt Commitment Letter"
shall include such "Debt Commitment Letter" as so amended, supplemented,
modified or replaced. Upon the request of the Company, Industrea will confirm
(a) with its Financing Sources their intent and ability to perform, and the
availability of the Debt Financing, under the Debt Commitment Letters,
subject only to satisfaction or waiver of the Financing Conditions, and (b)
that neither it nor its Financing Sources are aware of any event or condition
that could reasonably be expected to result in the failure of a Financing
Condition. " _Financing Failure Event_ " shall mean any of the following (A)
the commitments with respect to all or any portion of the Financing expiring
or being terminated, (B) for any reason, all or any portion of the Financing
becoming unavailable, (C) a breach or repudiation, or threatened or
anticipated breach or repudiation, by any party to a Debt Commitment Letter,
or (D) it becoming reasonably foreseeable that any of the events set forth in
clauses (A) through (C) shall occur, or (E) any party to a Debt Commitment
Letter or any Affiliate or agent of such Person shall allege that any of the
events set forth in clauses (A) through (C) has occurred.

(b) The Industrea Parties shall take all reasonable actions
necessary to cause the Existing Notes Redemptions to occur substantially
simultaneously with the Closing. The Industrea Parties shall provide all
funds necessary to consummate the Existing Notes Redemptions at the Closing.

  



  

(c) The Industrea Parties shall not permit any amendment or
modification to be made to, or any waiver of any provision or remedy
under, or any replacement of, any Subscription Agreement or Rollover
Agreement without the consent of the Company if such amendment,
modification or waiver (i) reduces the aggregate amount of the Equity
Financing or the Rollover, (ii) imposes new or additional conditions
or otherwise expands, amends or modifies any of the conditions to the receipt
of the Equity Financing in a manner that would reasonably be expected to (x)
delay or prevent the Closing, (y) materially impair or delay the funding of
the Equity Financing (or satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the
Equity Financing) or (z) adversely affect the ability of Newco to enforce its
rights against the other parties to the Subscription Agreements, the Rollover
Agreements or any of the definitive agreements with respect thereto or (iii)
adds or changes in any material respect any economic or governance rights or
benefits granted to any investor participating in the Equity Financing
(including the Argand Investor). The Industrea Parties shall use reasonable
best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and do, or cause to
be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the
transactions contemplated by the applicable Subscription Agreement on the

Subscription Agreements and using its reasonable best efforts to (i) satisfy
on a timely basis all conditions and covenants applicable to the Industrea
Parties in the Subscription Agreements and otherwise comply with its
obligations thereunder, (ii) in the event that all conditions in the
applicable Subscription Agreement (other than conditions that Newco or any of
its Affiliates control the satisfaction of and other than those conditions
that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing) have been satisfied,
consummate transactions contemplated by the applicable Subscription Agreement
at or prior to Closing and (iii) enforce their rights under the applicable
Subscription Agreement in the event that all conditions in the applicable
Subscription Agreement (other than conditions that Newco or any of its
Affiliates control the satisfaction of and other than those conditions that
by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing) have been satisfied, to
cause, as applicable, (x) the Argand Investor to consummate the Argand Equity
Investment at or prior to the Closing, and (y) the Third Party PIPE Investors
to consummate the Third Party PIPE Investment at or prior to the Closing to
be consummated at or prior to the Closing. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, Industrea shall give the Company, prompt (and, in any event
within three (3) Business Days) written notice: (A) of any amendment to any
Subscription Agreement (together with a copy of such amendment), (B) of any
known breach or default (or any known event or circumstance that, with or
without notice, lapse of time or both, could give rise to any breach or
default) by any party to any Subscription Agreement; (C) of the receipt of
any written notice or other written communication from any party to any
Subscription Agreement with respect to any actual, potential or claimed
expiration, lapse, withdrawal, breach, default, termination or repudiation by
any party to any Subscription Agreement or any provisions of any Subscription
Agreement and (D) if the Industrea Parties do not expect to receive all or
any portion of the Equity Financing on the terms, in the manner or from the
sources contemplated by the Subscription Agreements. The Subscription
Agreement contains all of the conditions precedent to the obligations of the
investors party thereto to contribute to Newco the Equity Financing on the
terms therein.

from the Closing Date, and to make the same available after the Closing for
inspection and copying by the Holder Representative or its representatives at
the Holder Representative's expense, during regular business hours and upon
reasonable request and upon reasonable advance notice. After such seven
(7)-year or longer period, before Newco, the Concrete Surviving Corporation or
any of its Subsidiaries may dispose of any such books and records, Newco
shall give at least ninety (90) days' prior written notice of such intention
to dispose to the Holder Representative, and the Holder Representative shall
be given an opportunity, at its cost and expense, to remove and retain all or
any part of such books and records as it may elect.

(a) As soon as practicable after the execution of this Agreement
(provided, that the Company has provided to Industrea all of the
information described in _Section 7.9(d)_ hereof, including such financial
statements and other information of the Company and its Subsidiaries to be
delivered to Industrea by the Company or its auditors and required to be
included in the Registration Statement), Industrea shall prepare and cause
Newco to file with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-4 that will
include the proxy statement/prospectus to be sent to the stockholders of
Industrea relating to Industrea Stockholders Meeting (such proxy
statement/prospectus, together with any amendments or supplements thereto,
the " _Registration Statement_ ") for the purpose of soliciting proxies from
Industrea stockholders to vote at Industrea Stockholders Meeting in favor of
(i) the adoption of this Agreement and the approval of the transactions
contemplated hereby, (ii) the Newco Charter and Bylaws Amendment and (iii) all
such other proposals the approval of which Industrea and the Company mutually
deem necessary or desirable to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (collectively, the " _Transaction Proposals_ "). In addition
to the foregoing, Industrea shall prepare and cause Newco to file with the
SEC the Registration Statement on or prior to September 11, 2018; _provided_ ,
_that_ Industrea's obligation to prepare and cause Newco to file the
Registration Statement on or prior to such date shall be specifically
contingent upon the Company's satisfaction of all Filing Requirements.
Industrea shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the
Registration Statement to comply with the rules and regulations promulgated
by the SEC. Industrea also agrees to use reasonable best efforts to obtain
all necessary state securities law or "blue sky" permits and approvals
required to carry out the transactions contemplated hereby, and the Company
shall furnish all information concerning the Company, its Subsidiaries and any
of their respective stockholders as may be reasonably requested in connection
with any such action. Promptly after the SEC advises Industrea that the SEC
staff has completed its review of the Registration Statement, Industrea shall
set a record date (which date shall be mutually agreed with the Company) (the
" _Industrea Record Date_ ") for determining the stockholders of Industrea
entitled to attend Industrea Stockholders Meeting. Industrea will cause the
Registration Statement to be mailed to each stockholder who was a stockholder
of Industrea as of Industrea Record Date promptly after the SEC advises
Industrea that the SEC staff has completed its review of the Registration
Statement. Promptly after the SEC advises Industrea that the SEC staff has
completed its review of the Registration Statement, Industrea shall duly
call, give notice of, convene and hold Industrea Stockholders Meeting for
the purpose of obtaining Industrea Stockholder Approval, which meeting shall
be held not more than 45 days after the date on which Industrea mails the
Registration Statement to its stockholders. 

  



  

(b) Industrea will advise the Company, promptly after Industrea
receives notice thereof, of the time when the Registration Statement or any
supplement or amendment has been filed or of any request by the SEC for the

reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Registration
Statement and any other document each time before any such document is filed
with the SEC, and Industrea shall give reasonable and good
faith consideration to any comments made by the Company and its counsel.
Industrea shall provide the Company and its counsel with (i) any comments or
other communications, whether written or oral, that Industrea or its counsel
may receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff with respect to the
Registration Statement promptly after receipt of those comments or other
communications and (ii) a reasonable opportunity to participate in the
response of Industrea to those comments and to provide comments on
that response (to which reasonable and good faith consideration shall be
given), including by participating in any discussions or meetings with the
SEC.

(c) Each of the Company and Industrea shall use their respective
reasonable best efforts to ensure that none of the information supplied by or
on its behalf for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Registration
Statement will, at the date it is first mailed to the stockholders of
Industrea and at the time of Industrea Stockholders Meeting contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. If at
any time prior to the Closing any information relating to the Company,
Industrea or any of their respective Subsidiaries, Affiliates, directors or
officers is discovered by the Company or Industrea that is required to be set
forth in an amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement so that such
document would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make
the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading, the party that discovers such information shall
promptly notify the other party and an appropriate amendment or supplement
describing such information shall be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the
extent required by Law, disseminated to the stockholders of Industrea.

  



  

(d) The Company acknowledges that a substantial portion of the
Registration Statement will include disclosure regarding the Company,
its officers, directors and stockholders, and its business, management,
operations and financial condition. Accordingly, the Company agrees to use
commercially reasonable efforts to provide Industrea with such information
regarding the Company or its Subsidiaries that is required to be included in
the Registration Statement or any other statement, filing, notice or
application required to be made by or on behalf of Industrea to the SEC or
NASDAQ in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.

  



  

(e) Industrea shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain
Industrea Stockholder Approval, including by soliciting proxies as promptly
as practicable in accordance with applicable Law for the purpose of seeking
Industrea Stockholder Approval. Industrea shall, through Industrea board of
directors, recommend to its stockholders that they vote in favor of the
Transaction Proposals (the " _Industrea Board Recommendation_ ") and
Industrea shall include Industrea Board Recommendation in the Registration
Statement. The board of directors of Industrea shall not (and no committee or
subgroup thereof shall) change, withdraw, withhold, qualify or modify, or
publicly propose to change, withdraw, withhold, qualify or modify, Industrea
Board Recommendation (a " _Change in Recommendation_ ");  _provided_ , that
the Industrea board of directors may make a Change in Recommendation if it
determines in good faith that a failure to do so would constitute a breach of
its fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

  



  

(f) Industrea shall take, or cause to be taken, all actions and do,
or cause to be done, all things necessary or advisable to enforce its
rights under the Industrea Letter Agreement in furtherance of obtaining the
Industrea Stockholder Approval and to cause Industrea Alexandria and the
Industrea Insiders (including by maintaining in effect the Industrea Letter
Agreement and seeking an order of specific performance or other equitable
relief or other enforcement actions against Industrea Alexandria and the
Industrea Insiders) to (a) vote all shares of Industrea Common Stock held by
them in favor of the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated
hereby and (b) not redeem any shares of Industrea Common Stock owned by any
of them in connection with the Industrea Stockholder Approval.

  



  

7.10 _Trust Account_. Upon satisfaction or waiver of the conditions
set forth in Article IX and provision of notice thereof to the Trustee (which
notice Industrea shall provide to the Trustee in accordance with the terms of
the Trust Agreement), (a) in accordance with and pursuant to the Trust
Agreement, at the Closing, Industrea (i) shall cause the documents, opinions
and notices required to be delivered to the Trustee pursuant to the Trust
Agreement to be so delivered and (ii) shall use its reasonable best efforts
to cause the Trustee to, and the Trustee shall thereupon be obligated to (A)
pay as and when due all amounts payable to stockholders holding shares of
Industrea Class A Common Stock sold in Industrea's initial public offering
who shall have previously validly elected to redeem their shares of Industrea
Class A Common Stock pursuant to Industrea certificate of incorporation, and
(B) immediately thereafter, pay all remaining amounts then available in the
Trust Account in accordance with this Agreement and the Trust Agreement and
(b) thereafter, the Trust Account shall terminate, except as otherwise
provided therein.

7.11 _Exclusivity_. Until the first to occur of the Closing or the
earlier termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article X_ , Industrea
will not, and will cause its respective Affiliates, directors, officers,
stockholders, employees, agents, consultants and other advisors and
representatives not to, directly or indirectly: (a) solicit, initiate,
encourage, knowingly facilitate any inquiry or the making of any proposal or
offer, (b) enter into, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or
negotiations, (c) furnish to any person any non-public information or grant
any person access to its properties, assets, books, contracts, personnel or
records, (d) approve or recommend, or propose to approve or recommend, or
execute or enter into, any letter of intent, agreement in principal, merger
agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement or other contract, or (e)
propose, whether publicly or to any director or stockholder, or agree to do
any of the foregoing for the purpose of encouraging or facilitating any
proposal, offer, discussions or negotiations; in each case relating to an
Industrea Acquisition Proposal. " _Industrea Acquisition Proposal_ " means
any offer, proposal, request, inquiry regarding a business combination
transaction involving Industrea or any of its Subsidiaries or any other
transaction involving Industrea or any of its Subsidiaries to acquire all or
any material part of the business, properties or assets of any other entity
or any amount of the capital stock of any other entity, whether by merger,
purchase of assets, purchase of equity, tender offer or other similar
transactions, other than with the Company. For the avoidance of doubt, the
provisions of this _Section 7.11_ shall not apply to any transaction that
does not involve (directly or indirectly) Industrea and its subsidiaries,
including any transaction solely involving Argand Partners L.P. or its other
Affiliates (including any portfolio companies) (the " _Argand Parties_ ") or
any activities by such Argand Parties in furtherance thereof. Industrea will
immediately cease and cause to be terminated any such negotiations, discussion
or other communication, or contracts (to the extent unilaterally terminable
by Industrea without the counterparty's consent and without penalty) (other
than with the Company) with respect to the foregoing.

  



  

ARTICLE VIII. 
 JOINT COVENANTS

  



  

8.1 _Support of Transaction_. Without limiting any covenant
contained in _Article VI_ or 
  _Article VII_ , Industrea and the Company shall each, and shall each cause
their respective Subsidiaries to: (a) use reasonable best efforts to
assemble, prepare and file any information (and, as needed, to supplement such
information) as may be reasonably necessary to obtain as promptly as
practicable all governmental and regulatory consents required to be obtained
in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, (b) use reasonable
best efforts to obtain all material consents and approvals of third parties
that any of Industrea, the Company or their respective Affiliates are required
to obtain in order to consummate the Mergers, and (c) take such other action
as may reasonably be necessary or as another party may reasonably request to
satisfy the conditions of Article IX or otherwise to comply with this
Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby as soon as
practicable (but in any event prior to the Termination Date). Notwithstanding
the foregoing, in no event shall the Company or any of its Subsidiaries be
obligated to bear any expense or pay any fee (other than the payment of
nominal administrative, processing or similar fees or charges) or grant any
concession in connection with obtaining any consents, authorizations or
approvals required in order to consummate the Mergers pursuant to the terms
of any Contract to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party.

  



  

8.2 _Escrow Agreement_. Each of the Holder Representative and Newco
shall execute and deliver to one another and the Escrow Agent, at the
Closing, the Escrow Agreement in the form attached hereto as _Annex F_ (the "
_Escrow Agreement_ ").

  



  

8.3 _Further Assurances._ Each party hereto agrees that, from time
to time after the Closing Date, it will furnish, or cause to be furnished,
upon request to each other such further information, execute and deliver, or
cause its Affiliates to execute and deliver, such further instruments, and
take (or cause its Affiliates to take) such other action, as may be
reasonably necessary to carry out the purposes and intents of this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated herein.

8.4 _[Reserved_.]

  



  

8.5 _Section 280G_. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall use
reasonable endeavors to obtain from each "disqualified individual" (as
defined in Section 280G(c) of the Code) with respect to the Company or its
Subsidiaries who may receive payments and/or benefits that could constitute
"parachute payments" (as defined in Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code) in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement a waiver of
any such payments or benefits, such that after giving effect to all waivers,
the Company, its Subsidiaries, and, if applicable, Industrea shall not have
made or provided, nor shall be required to make or provide, any payments or
benefits that would not be deductible under Section 280G of the Code or that
would be subject to an excise Tax under Section 4999 of the Code (the waived
payments and benefits waived shall be collectively referred to as the "
_Section 280G Waived Payments_ "). On or prior to the Closing Date, the
Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to submit, accompanied by
adequate disclosure, for equityholder approval all Section 280G Waived
Payments in accordance with the terms of Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code
and the U.S. Treasury Regulations thereunder. If equityholder approval is
obtained, the Company shall promptly, but in all events prior to the Closing,
deliver to Industrea evidence reasonably satisfactory to Industrea of such
approval. Prior to the Closing Date and prior to solicitation of equityholder
approval, the Company shall provide Industrea with (i) drafts of any waivers
and equityholder disclosure documents relating to the waiver and vote
prepared by the Company in connection with this _Section 8.5_ ; and (ii)
reasonable documentation regarding the determination of the Section 280G
Waived Payments. The Company shall consider in good faith any comments made by
Industrea prior to obtaining the waivers and soliciting the vote.

  



  

8.6 _Tax Matters_.

  



  

(a) Newco agrees that (i) Newco and Concrete Parent will file a
consolidated federal income Tax Return with the Company and its
applicable Subsidiaries starting on the day following the Closing Date,
causing the taxable year of the Company and its applicable Subsidiaries to
end on the Closing Date for federal income tax purposes, (ii) any gains,
income, deductions, losses or other items resulting from any transactions
outside the ordinary course of business occurring on the Closing Date, but
after the Closing, shall not be treated as occurring on the Closing Date and
Newco and the Company shall utilize (and cause their Affiliates to utilize)
the "next day rule" in Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B) (or
any similar provision of foreign, state or local Law) for purposes of
reporting such items on the applicable Tax Returns, (iii) no election will be
made under Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-76(b)(2)(ii) (or any other
similar provision of foreign, state or local Law) for the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries to ratably allocate items in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (iv) no election will be
made under Section 336 of the Code or Section 338 of the Code with respect to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

(b) _Tax Returns_.

  



  

(i) The Company, at its sole cost and expense, shall (A) prepare and
timely file all Tax Returns of the Company and each Subsidiary of the Company
due (after taking into account all appropriate extensions) on or prior to the
Closing Date (" _Company Prepared Returns_ ") and (B) timely pay all Taxes
that are due and payable (after taking into account all appropriate
extensions) on or prior to the Closing Date with respect to the Company
Prepared Returns. Unless otherwise required by Law, all Company
Prepared Returns shall be prepared in a manner consistent with existing
practices and accounting methods of the Company and its Subsidiaries.

  



    

79 
--- 

 



    



  

(ii) Newco shall cause the Company and each Subsidiary of the Company
to prepare and timely file all Tax Returns of the Company and each
Subsidiary of the Company due after the Closing Date (the " _Newco Prepared
Returns_ "). To the extent that a Newco Prepared Return relates to a Pre-
Closing Tax Period or the portion of a Straddle Period ending on the Closing
Date, such Tax Return shall be prepared in a manner consistent with existing
practices and accounting methods of the Company and its Subsidiaries, unless
otherwise required by Law. To the extent a Newco Prepared Return relates to a
Pre-Closing Tax Period or the portion of a Straddle Period ending on the
Closing Date, at least twenty (20) days before filing any Newco Prepared
Return, Newco shall deliver a draft copy of such Newco Prepared Return to the
Holder Representative for the Holder Representative's review, comment and
approval. Newco shall cause any comments provided in writing within ten (10)
days of receipt of such Newco Prepared Return by the Holder Representative to
be reflected in such Newco Prepared Return, to the extent consistent with
existing practices and accounting methods of the Company and its Subsidiaries
and with applicable Law. For the avoidance of doubt, any Tax deductions
arising out of fees, expenses and bonuses paid or accrued by the Company, any
of its Subsidiaries or any Affiliated Group of which the Company is a member
(including any Tax deductions with respect to the Option Consideration or
otherwise with respect to the Vested Options) shall be treated as accruing on
or before the Closing Date and reported on a Tax Return of the Company (or the
Affiliated Group of which the Company is the common parent) for a Pre-Closing
Tax Period.

  



  

(iii) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 8.6(b),
no Company Prepared Return or Newco Prepared Return shall include an
election under Section 965(h) or Section 965(n) of the Code.

  



  

(c) _Apportionment of Taxes_. For purposes of determining the
amount of Taxes that are attributable to a Pre-Closing Tax Period (or portion
of any Straddle Period ending on or prior to the Closing Date) the parties
agree as follows:

  



  

(i) In the case of property Taxes and other similar Taxes imposed on
a periodic basis for a Straddle Period, the amounts that are attributable to
the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date shall be
determined by multiplying the Taxes for the entire Straddle Period by a
fraction, the numerator of which is the number of calendar days in the portion
of the period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the
number of calendar days in the entire Straddle Period; _provided_ , _that_
in the case of any such Taxes that are imposed in arrears, the amount of such
Taxes for the entire Straddle Period shall be based on the amount of such
Taxes that were actually imposed for the immediately preceding period.

  



  

(ii) In the case of Taxes in the form of interest or penalties, all
such Taxes shall be (x) treated as attributable to a Pre-Closing Tax Period
(or the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date) if and to
the extent that such interest or penalties relate to a Company Prepared
Return or otherwise to a breach of this Agreement by the Holder Representative
or (prior to the Closing) by the Company and (y) treated as attributable to a
Post-Closing Tax Period (or the portion of the Straddle Period beginning
after the Closing Date) if and to the extent that such interest or penalties
relate to a Newco Prepared Return or otherwise to a breach of this Agreement
by Newco or its Affiliates (including Industrea, Concrete Parent, Concrete
Merger Sub or (after the Closing) the Company and its Subsidiaries).

  



  

(iii) In the case of Taxes (other than Taxes imposed under Section 965
of the Code) imposed on the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company or on
Newco or any Affiliate of Newco, in each case, as a result of income from any
Flow-Thru Entity directly or indirectly owned by the Company that is realized
by the Flow-Thru Entity prior to the Closing Date (such income being computed
assuming the Flow-Thru Entity had a year that ends on the Closing Date and
closed its books), such Taxes shall be treated as Taxes of the Company or
a Subsidiary of the Company for a Pre-Closing Tax Period.

  



    

80 
--- 

 



    



  

(iv) In the case of all other Taxes for a Straddle Period (including
Income Taxes, employment Taxes, and sales and use Taxes) the
amount attributable to the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the
Closing Date shall be determined for the portion of the Straddle Period
ending on as of the end of the day on the Closing Date using a "closing of the
books methodology." For purposes of clause (ii), any item determined on an
annual or periodic basis (including amortization and depreciation deductions
and the effects of graduated rates) shall be allocated to the portion of the
Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date based on the mechanics set forth
in clause (i) for periodic Taxes.

  



  

(d) _Tax Contests_. Newco shall promptly notify the Holder
Representative of any audit, assessment, investigation or other
proceeding relating to Taxes of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company
for any Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period (a " _Tax Contest_ "). The
Holder Representative shall be entitled to control the conduct of any such Tax
Contest; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that Newco, at its sole cost and expense,
shall have the right to participate in any such Tax Contest, and the Holder
Representative shall not resolve any such Tax Contest without Newco's prior
written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed). Newco shall be entitled to control the conduct of any other Tax
Contest.

  



  

(e) _Cooperation_. To the extent reasonably requested in writing
(and at the requesting party's expense), and subject to the other
provisions of this _Section 8.6_ , Newco, the Company and the Holder
Representative shall, and shall cause their Affiliates to, (i) assist in the
preparation and timely filing of any Tax Return of the Company or any
Subsidiary of the Company, (ii) assist in any audit or other legal proceeding
with respect to Taxes or Tax Returns of the Company or any Subsidiary of the
Company (whether or not a Tax Contest), (iii) make available any information,
records, or other documents reasonably relating to any Taxes or Tax
Returns of the Pre-Closing Holders, the Holder Representative, the Company or
any Subsidiary of the Company (except to the extent such information, records
or other documents are reasonably deemed to be confidential or privileged),
(iv) provide any information reasonably necessary or reasonably requested to
allow the Pre-Closing Holders, the Holder Representative, Newco, the Company,
or any Subsidiary of the Company to comply with any information reporting or
withholding requirements contained in the Code or other applicable Laws or to
compute the amount of payroll or other employment Taxes due with respect to
any payment made in connection with this Agreement.

  



  

(f) _Transfer Taxes_. All federal, state, local, non-U.S. transfer,
excise, sales, use, ad valorem value added, registration, stamp,
recording, property and similar Taxes or fees applicable to, imposed upon, or
arising out of the transfer of the shares in the Company pursuant to this
Agreement (collectively, " _Transfer Taxes_ ") shall be paid one-half by
Newco, Concrete Parent and Industrea, on the one hand, and one-half by the
Pre-Closing Holders (solely through a claim for indemnification pursuant to
clause (c) of the definition of "Indemnified Taxes"), on the other hand. The
parties shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate to the
extent reasonably requested to mitigate the amount of any such Transfer Taxes,
to the extent permitted by applicable Law.

  



    

81 
--- 

 



    



  

(g) _Tax Refunds_. Any Tax refund, credit or similar benefit
(including any interest paid or credited by a Governmental Authority
with respect thereto) relating to a Pre-Closing Tax Period or a portion of a
Straddle Period ending on or before the Closing Date (a  " _Tax Refund_ ")
shall be for the sole benefit of the Pre-Closing Holders. To the extent that
Newco or any of its Affiliates (including the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries) receives or utilizes any Tax Refund, within ten (10) days of
receipt of such Tax Refund or the filing of any Tax Return utilizing such Tax
Refund (in the form of a credit or offset to Taxes otherwise payable), as the
case may be, (x) Newco shall promptly pay or cause its applicable Subsidiaries
to pay, through payroll to each Pre-Closing Holder of Vested Options, subject
to any applicable withholding, an amount equal to the product of (A) the
amount of such Tax Refund net of any incremental Taxes payable by the Company
or any Subsidiary as a result of the receipt thereof and net of any other
expenses that Newco, the Company, or any Subsidiary or any of their Affiliates
incur (or has or will incur) with respect to such Tax Refund (and related
interest), and (B) such Pre-Closing Holder's Option Pro-Rata Share over the
sum of all Pre-Closing Holders' Option Pro-Rata Shares, _provided_ , _that_
to the extent any amounts under this clause (x) would be payable after the
fifth (5th) anniversary of the Closing, no Pre-Closing Holder of Vested
Options shall have any legally binding right to such amounts and the Company
shall have the sole discretion to determine whether to pay any such amounts to
any Pre-Closing Holder of Vested Options and the time(s) and terms and
conditions of any such payments, and (y) Newco shall pay or cause to be paid
to the Exchange Agent (for further delivery to each Pre-Closing Holder based
on such Pre-Closing Holder's Fully-Diluted Percentage in respect of its
shares of Company Stock) the excess of (i) the amount described in the
foregoing clause (x)(A), less (ii) the aggregate amount payable to Pre-
Closing Holders of Vested Options pursuant to clause (x) above (disregarding
any reduction of the amount payable to Pre-Closing Holders of Vested Options
resulting from the operation of the proviso to such clause). The parties
hereto agree that Tax Refunds for any taxable period beginning on or before
the Closing Date and ending after the Closing Date shall be allocated using
the methodologies set forth in _Section 8.6(c)_. Newco and its Affiliates
shall, and shall cause the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to, promptly
take all actions (including those actions reasonably requested by the
Holder Representative) to file for and obtain any Tax Refund. Newco shall,
upon request, permit the Holder Representative to participate in the
prosecution of any proceedings relating to a Tax Refund claim and shall not
settle or otherwise resolve any such proceeding without the prior written
consent of the Holder Representative. Nothing in this _Section 8.6(g)_ shall
require that Newco make any payment with respect to any refund for a Tax (and
such refunds shall be for the benefit of Newco, the Company, and
its Subsidiaries) to the extent it is (i) a refund of Tax that is the result
of the carrying back of any net operating loss or other Tax attribute or Tax
credit incurred in a Post-Closing Tax Period (or portion of any Straddle
Period beginning after the Closing Date), (ii) any refund for Tax that is
reflected as a Current Asset (or offset to a Current Liability) in the Net
Working Capital, as finally determined, or (iii) any refund for Tax that
gives rise to a corresponding dollar-for-dollar payment obligation by
the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company to any Person under applicable
Law or pursuant to a provision of a contract or other agreement entered (or
assumed) by the Company (or any Subsidiary of the Company) on or prior to the
Closing Date, but only if such payment obligation is not indemnifiable under
this Agreement and was not reflected as a Current Liability (or offset to a
Current Asset) in Net Working Capital, as finally determined.

  



  

(h) At or prior to the Closing, the Company shall deliver to
Concrete Parent a certificate substantially in the form of _Annex H_ ; 
_provided_ , _that_ Newco's and Concrete Parent's sole remedy if the Company
fails to deliver such certificate shall be to make an appropriate withholding
of Tax to the extent required pursuant to Section 1445 of the Code (and the
Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder).

  



  

(i) Following the Closing, except as required by law, Newco shall
not, and shall cause its Affiliates (including Concrete Parent, Concrete
Merger Sub and (after the Closing) the Company and its Subsidiaries) not to,
(i) make any Tax election that would have a retroactive effective to any Pre-
Closing Tax Period or a portion of a Straddle Period beginning on or before
the Closing Date, (ii) amend any Tax Return relating to any Pre-Closing Tax
Period or a portion of a Straddle Period beginning on or before the Closing
Date, (iii) take any action outside the ordinary course of business that
would increase the Tax liability of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (or the Pre-Closing Holders) with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax
Period or a portion of a Straddle Period beginning on or before the Closing
Date or (iv) make any voluntary Tax disclosure, Tax amnesty filing or other
similar filing relating to any Pre-Closing Tax Period or a portion of a
Straddle Period ending on or before the Closing Date.

  



    

82

(j) _Tax Treatment_. For U.S. federal and applicable state income
Tax purposes, the parties agree that the Rollover, taken together with the
Industrea Merger, the Argand Equity Investment, the Third Party PIPE
Investment, the UK Rollover Investment and any other relevant contributions
to Newco, is intended to be a contribution of property qualifying under
Section 351 of the Code. The parties further agree to file all Tax Returns in
a manner consistent with the foregoing, to the greatest extent permitted by
applicable Law, and not to knowingly take any actions that would cause the
Rollover not to so qualify. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, from the date hereof through and including the end of the taxable
year in which the Closing occurs, Industrea shall not, and Newco shall cause
Industrea not to, convert, liquidate, dissolve, wind up or take any similar
action.

  



  

8.7 _Confidentiality_. Industrea and the Company shall comply with,
and shall cause of their Affiliates and their respective directors, officers,
stockholders, employees, agents, consultants and other advisors and
representatives (its " _Restricted Persons_ ") to comply with the terms of
that certain Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of April 17, 2018, between
Industrea and the Company (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ") which
Industrea and the Company acknowledge remains in full force and effect and
that all confidential information disclosed to Industrea or its Restricted
Persons is and shall continue to be governed by the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement, the terms of which are incorporated herein by
reference. Beginning on the date of this Agreement until the termination of
this agreement in accordance with Article X, neither the Company nor any
Restricted Person will waive any right under any other
nondisclosure agreement previously entered into by the Company and any other
Person with respect to the evaluation of the sale of the Company without the
prior written consent of Industrea. The Confidentiality Agreement shall
survive the termination of this Agreement in accordance with the terms set
forth therein. In the event of the termination of this Agreement for any
reason, Industrea shall comply with the terms and provisions of the
Confidentiality Agreement, including returning or destroying all Evaluation
Material (as defined in the Confidentiality Agreement), subject to the terms
and conditions set forth in the Confidentiality Agreement.

  



  

8.8 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Prior to the Closing,
Industrea, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, shall
reasonably promptly notify each other in writing of (i) the occurrence or non-
occurrence of any event or the existence of any fact or condition that would
cause any condition set forth in _Section 9.2_ or _Section 9.3_ , as
applicable, to not be satisfied, (ii) any material Actions in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement commenced or, to the
knowledge of Industrea or to the knowledge of the Company, threatened against
Industrea, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, or
(iii) any written notice or other written material communication from any
Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby; _provided_ , _that_ a party's good-faith failure to comply with this
_Section 8.8_ shall not provide the other party the right not to consummate
the Closing or to effect the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

ARTICLE XI.

  

HOLDER REPRESENTATIVE

  



  

11.1 _Designation and Replacement of Holder Representative_. The
parties have agreed that it is desirable to designate a representative to act
on behalf of holders of the Company Stock and the Options for certain limited
purposes, as specified herein (the " _Holder Representative_ "). The parties
have designated PGP Investors, LLC as the initial Holder Representative, and
approval of this Agreement by the holders of Company Stock shall constitute
ratification and approval of such designation. The Holder Representative may
resign at any time, and the Holder Representative may be removed by the
vote of Persons which collectively owned more than fifty percent (50%) of the
Aggregate Fully-Diluted Shares immediately prior to the Concrete Effective
Time (or, in the case of a termination of this Agreement, as of such
termination) (the " _Majority Holders_ "). In the event that a Holder
Representative has resigned or been removed, a new Holder Representative shall
be appointed by a vote of the Majority Holders, such appointment to become
effective upon the written acceptance thereof by the new Holder
Representative. The designation of any Person as the Holder Representative is
and shall be coupled with an interest, and, except as set forth in this
Article XI, such designation is irrevocable and shall not be affected by the
death, incapacity, illness, bankruptcy, dissolution or other inability to act
of any of the holders of Company Stock or any of the holders of Options.

11.2 _Authority and Rights of the Holder Representative; Limitations
on Liability_. The Holder Representative shall have such powers and authority
as are necessary to carry out the functions assigned to it under this
Agreement; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the Holder Representative shall
have no obligation to act, except as expressly provided herein. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Holder Representative shall
have full power, authority and discretion to (i) estimate and determine the
Holder Representative Expense Amount and to pay the Holder Representative
Expense Amount in accordance with _Section 3.5_ , (ii) retain counsel and to
incur such fees, costs and expenses as the Holder Representative deems to be
necessary or appropriate in connection with the performance of its
obligations under this Agreement and each of the documents to be executed in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, (iii) after the
Closing, negotiate and enter into amendments to this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement for and on behalf of the Pre-Closing Holders and (iv) with respect
to any claims for indemnification made pursuant to _Section 12.2_ , exercise
all rights granted to the Holder Representative under Article XII. All actions
taken by the Holder Representative under this Agreement shall be binding upon
the Pre-Closing Holders and their successors as if expressly confirmed and
ratified in writing by each of them. The Holder Representative shall have no
liability to Industrea Parties, the Company or any holder of Company Stock or
Options with respect to actions taken or omitted to be taken in its capacity
as the Holder Representative. The Holder Representative shall at all times be
entitled to rely on any directions received from the Majority Holders;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that the Holder Representative shall not be
required to follow any such direction, and shall be under no obligation to
take any action in its capacity as the Holder Representative, unless the
Holder Representative is holding funds delivered to it under _Section 3.5_
and has been provided with other funds, security or indemnities which, in the
sole determination of the Holder Representative, are sufficient to protect
the Holder Representative against the costs, expenses and liabilities
which may be incurred by the Holder Representative in responding to such
direction or taking such action. The Holder Representative shall be entitled
to engage such counsel, experts and other agents and consultants as it shall
deem necessary in connection with exercising its powers and performing its
function hereunder and (in the absence of bad faith on the part of the Holder
Representative) shall be entitled to conclusively rely on the opinions and
advice of such Persons. The Holder Representative shall be entitled to
reimbursement from funds paid to it under _Section 3.5_ , released from the
Escrow Funds for the benefit of Pre-Closing Holders or otherwise received by
it in its capacity as the Holder Representative pursuant to or in connection
with this Agreement, for all reasonable expenses, disbursements and advances
(including fees and disbursements of its counsel, experts and other agents and
consultants) incurred by the Holder Representative in such capacity, and
shall be entitled to indemnification against any loss, liability or expenses
arising out of actions taken or omitted to be taken in its capacity as the
Holder Representative (except for those arising out of the Holder
Representative's gross negligence or willful misconduct), including the costs
and expenses of investigation and defense of claims. In the event that the
Holder Representative determines, in its sole and absolute discretion, that
the funds paid to the Holder Representative pursuant to _Section 3.5_ exceed
the aggregate amount of fees, costs, expenses and Taxes incurred, or that may
in the future be incurred, by the Holder Representative in connection with the
performance of its obligations under this Agreement and each of the documents
to be executed in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, prior
to the final release of the Escrow Funds, the Holder Representative shall
transfer such excess amount to the Escrow Agent solely for disbursement (or
otherwise cause such excess amount to be disbursed) to the Pre-Closing Holders
as Merger Consideration; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, in no
event shall such excess amount become part of the Escrow Funds or otherwise
become payable to Industrea Parties. The Industrea Parties shall be able to
rely conclusively on the instructions and decisions of the Holder
Representative as to the settlement of any claims for indemnification of
Industrea Parties pursuant to the Escrow Agreement or Article XII below or any
other actions, consents, approvals, agreements and decisions required or
permitted to be taken, given or made by the Holder Representative hereunder,
and no Pre-Closing Holder shall have any cause of action against Industrea
Parties to the extent that Industrea Parties has relied upon the
instructions or decisions of the Holder Representative. The Holder
Representative shall have the right, but not the obligation, exercisable in
its sole discretion, to distribute to the Pre-Closing Holders at any time such
Pre-Closing Holder's Escrow Percentage of the Holder Representative Expenses
Amount. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (A) there can be no assurances that any
of the Holder Representative Expense Amount will be paid or disbursed to the
Pre-Closing Holders and (B) no Pre-Closing Holder not be entitled to receive
any interest on the Holder Representative Expense Amount.

89 
--- 

 



    



  

(b) No indemnification claims for Losses shall be asserted by any
Industrea Indemnitee under _Section 12.2(a)_ unless the aggregate amount of

12.5 _Indemnification Claim Process_.

  



  

(a) All claims for indemnification by an Indemnitee under this
_Article XII_ shall be asserted and resolved in accordance with Sections 
_12.5_ and _12.6_. With respect to any indemnification made by any Industrea
Indemnitee pursuant to _Section 12.3_ , any such claims shall be directed by

not have any liability as an Indemnitor to any Industrea Indemnitee pursuant
to this _Article XII_.

  



  

(b) If an Indemnitee intends to seek indemnification pursuant to
this _Article XII_ , the Indemnitee shall promptly notify, with respect to an
Industrea Indemnitee, the Holder Representative, and with respect to an
Equityholder Indemnitee, Newco, in writing of such claim, describing such

the Indemnitee to deliver such a Claims Notice shall not relieve the
applicable Indemnitors of their obligations under this _Article XII_ , except

Indemnitors.

(c) With respect to any action, lawsuit, proceeding, investigation,
demand or other claim against an Indemnitee by a third party (a "
_Third Party Claim_ "), the Indemnitors shall have ten (10) Business Days
from the date on which the Claims Notice with respect to such Third Party
Claim was delivered to Newco or the Holder Representative (as applicable) to
notify the Indemnitee that the Indemnitor desires to assume control of the
defense or prosecution of the Third Party Claim and any litigation resulting
therefrom by advising the Indemnitee of such in writing that (i) it is
obligated to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Indemnitee under terms
of their indemnification obligations hereunder (and subject to the limitations
on the indemnification obligations set forth herein) and (ii) that it will
undertake, conduct and control, through counsel of its own choosing (which
counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnitee) and at its own
expense, the settlement or defense thereof and in which event the Indemnitee
shall cooperate with it in connection therewith. If the Indemnitor assumes
the defense of such claim in accordance herewith: (i) the Indemnitee may
retain separate co-counsel at the Indemnitee's sole cost and expense and
participate in the defense of such Third Party Claim, but the Indemnitor
shall control the investigation, defense and settlement thereof; (ii) the
Indemnitee shall not file any papers or consent to the entry of any judgment
or enter into any settlement with respect to such Third Party Claim without
the prior written consent of the Indemnitor; and (iii) the Indemnitor shall
not consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with
respect to such Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the
Indemnitee unless the judgment or settlement provides solely for the payment
of money and the applicable Indemnitees receive an unconditional release with
respect to such Third Party Claim. The parties shall act in good faith in
responding to, defending against, settling or otherwise dealing with Third
Party Claims, and cooperate in any such defense and give each other reasonable
access to all information relevant thereto and shall keep each other
reasonably informed with respect to the status thereof. Whether or not the
Indemnitor has assumed the defense of such Third Party Claim, the Indemnitor
will not be obligated to indemnify the Indemnitee hereunder with respect to
any settlement entered into or any judgment consented to without the
Indemnitor's prior written consent.

  



  

(d) If the Indemnitor does not assume the defense of such Third
Party Claim within ten (10) Business Days of receipt of the Claims
Notice, the Indemnitee will be entitled to assume such defense, at its sole
cost and expense (It being understood that Indemnitors shall remain liable to
the extent such costs and expenses constitute a Loss for which the Indemnitee
is entitled to indemnification pursuant to _Article XII_ ), upon delivery of
notice to such effect to the Indemnitor; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Indemnitor shall have the right to participate in the defense of the Third
Party Claim at its sole cost and expense.

  



  

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnitor shall not have the
right to assume the defense of such Third Party Claim, if (i) the claim
seeks an injunction or other equitable relief, (ii) the Indemnitee shall have
been advised by counsel that there are one or more legal or equitable
defenses available to them which are different from or in addition to those
available to the Indemnitor, and, in the reasonable opinion of the
Indemnitee, counsel for the Indemnitor could not adequately represent the
interests of the Indemnitee because such interests could be in conflict with
those of the Indemnitor, (iii) the Indemnitor fails to provide the
Indemnitee with reasonable evidence that the Indemnitor has the financial
wherewithal to pay for such defense, (iv) the Indemnitor shall not have
assumed the defense of such Third Party Claim within the required time period,
(v) such Third Party Claim is brought by the Indemnitee's customers,
suppliers, lenders, equityholders, employees or other business relationships,
(vi) the Third Party Claim involves a criminal matter or (vii) with respect
to claims under _Section 12.2_ , if the potential Losses involved in such
Third Party Claim exceed the amount remaining in the Indemnity Escrow Fund.

  



  

(f) To the extent there is any inconsistency between this _Section
12.5_ and _Section 8.6(d)_ as it relates to a Tax matter, the provisions of
_Section 8.6(d)_ shall govern.

  



    

91 
--- 

 



    



  

12.6 _Indemnification Procedures for Non-Third Party Claims_. The
Indemnitee will deliver a Claims Notice to the Indemnitor promptly upon its
discovery of any matter for which the Indemnitor may be liable to the
Indemnitee hereunder that does not involve a Third Party Claim, which Claims
Notice shall state that the Indemnitee has paid or properly accrued Losses
or anticipates that it will incur liability for Losses for which such
Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Agreement. The
Indemnitee shall reasonably cooperate and assist the Indemnitor in determining
the validity of any claim for indemnity by the Indemnitee and in otherwise
resolving such matters. Such assistance and cooperation shall include
providing reasonable access to and copies of information, records and
documents relating to such matters, furnishing employees to assist in the
investigation, defense and resolution of such matters and providing legal and
business assistance with respect to such matters.

  



  

12.7 _Exclusive Remedy_.

  



  

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, from and after
the Closing, except (i) in the case of an actual (not constructive) fraud
claim based on inaccuracies in the representations and warranties expressly
and specifically set forth in this Agreement and any certificate delivered
pursuant hereto, as qualified by the Schedules, in each case solely against
the Person who committed such fraud, (ii) any claims pursuant to any
Transaction Document other than this Agreement (including for the avoidance of
doubt, any Letter of Transmittal or Restrictive Covenant Agreement) or (iii)
as otherwise provided in _Section 13.14_ , the indemnification provisions of
_Article XII_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the parties following
the Closing for any and all claims arising under this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, including any breach or alleged breach of
the provisions hereof.

  



  

(b) The Indemnity Escrow Amount and any interest accrued thereon
(collectively, the " _Indemnity Escrow Fund_ ") shall be held and disbursed
by the Escrow Agent in accordance with the Escrow Agreement and this
Agreement. The Indemnity Escrow Fund shall be held until the earlier of (x)
the exhaustion of the Indemnity Escrow Fund and (y) the Cut-Off Date. Any
portion of the Indemnity Escrow Fund remaining on the day following the Cut-
Off Date shall be released to the Exchange Agent, less the sum of the
aggregate amount, if any, claimed by the Industrea Indemnitees under _Section
12.2_ pursuant to claims (such claims, the " _Outstanding Claims_ ") properly
made against the Indemnity Escrow Fund in accordance with this _Article XII_
and not fully resolved prior to the Cut-Off Date, which amount shall be
retained by the Escrow Agent (such amount of the retained Indemnity Escrow
Fund, as it may be further reduced after the Cut-Off Date by distributions to
the Exchange Agent as set forth below and by recoveries by the Industrea
Indemnitees pursuant to _Section 12.2_ and the Escrow Agreement, the "
_Retained Indemnity Escrow Amount_ "). In the event and to the extent that,
after the Cut-Off Date, any Outstanding Claim made by any Industrea
Indemnitee pursuant to _Section 12.2_ is resolved by the Holder
Representative and the Industrea Indemnitee or finally determined by a court
of competent jurisdiction (i) the Holder Representative and Newco shall
jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to promptly release from the Indemnity
Escrow Fund to the Exchange Agent, in accordance with payment instructions
provided by the Holder Representative, an aggregate amount of the Retained
Indemnity Escrow Amount equal to any amount of the Outstanding Claim resolved
against such Industrea Indemnitee, and (ii) the Holder Representative and
Newco shall jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to promptly release from the
Indemnity Escrow Fund to Newco, in accordance with payment instructions
provided by Newco, an aggregate amount of the Retained Indemnity Escrow
Amount equal to any amount of the Outstanding Claim resolved in favor of such
Industrea Indemnitee. All amounts released from the Indemnity Escrow Fund to
or on behalf of the Pre-Closing Holders shall be paid to (x) to the
Exchange Agent (for further delivery to each Pre-Closing Holder based on such
Pre-Closing Holder's Escrow Percentage in respect of the shares of Company
Stock held by such Pre-Closing Holder immediately prior to the Concrete
Effective Time) an amount in cash equal to (A) the US Escrow Percentage of
the aggregate amount of such payment, _multiplied by_ (B) the Aggregate Stock
Escrow Percentage, (y) to the Surviving Corporation (for further delivery to
each Pre-Closing Holder based on such Pre-Closing Holder's Escrow Percentage
in respect of the Vested Options held by such Pre-Closing Holder immediately
prior to the Concrete Effective Time) an amount in cash equal to (A) the US
Escrow Percentage of the aggregate amount of such payment, _multiplied by_
(B) the Aggregate Option Escrow Percentage and (z) to the UK Rollover
Investors an amount in cash equal to the UK Escrow Percentage of the
aggregate amount of such payment (to be allocated among the UK Rollover
Investors in accordance with the UK Share Purchase Agreement).

(c) _Calculation of Losses; Limitations_. The amount of any Loss
for which indemnification is provided under this Article _XII_ shall be (i)
net of any amounts actually recovered by any Indemnitee under insurance
policies (including any representation and warranty insurance policy
maintained by or for the benefit of the Company or its Subsidiaries prior to
the Closing (other than the RandW Insurance Policy)), from third parties or
otherwise with respect to such Loss (net of direct collection expenses and any
increase in premiums under insurance policies to the extent attributable to
the recovery of such proceeds), (ii) net of amounts accrued on the Company or
any Subsidiary's balance sheet as of the Closing Date or included in Closing
Date Net Working Capital with respect to such Loss, (iii) reduced to take
account of any net Tax benefit actually realized by the Indemnitees arising
from the incurrence or payment of any such Loss in the year the Loss is
incurred in any of the next three (3) years or in a prior year and reduced to
take account of any net Tax benefit actually realized by the Indemnitee
arising from the incurrence or payment of any such Loss in the year the Loss
is incurred or in a prior year. With respect to any matter giving rise to a
claim for indemnification in this _Article XII,_ should an Indemnitee receive
the amounts described in the preceding sentence after such time as
the Indemnitor has made payment to the Indemnitee with respect to such
matter, the Indemnitee shall promptly pay any such amounts to the Indemnitor.
In the event any Indemnitee determines it is entitled to insurance proceeds
(including proceeds under any representation and warranty insurance policy
maintained by or for the benefit of the Company prior to the Closing (other
than the RandW Insurance Policy)) or any other third-party recoveries in
respect of any Losses (or any of the circumstances giving rise thereto) for
which such Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification pursuant to this
_Article XII_ , such Indemnitee shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain, receive or realize such proceeds, payments or recoveries.
Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to the contrary, no
Indemnitor shall be liable to, or indemnify, any Indemnitee for any Losses (i)
to the extent that such Losses result from or arise out of actions taken by
such Indemnitee or any of its respective Affiliates from and after Closing, or
(ii) that are punitive, or exemplary damages (except to the extent such
damages are actually awarded in connection with a Third Party Claim).

  



  

12.8 _Tax Treatment of Indemnity Payments_. Unless otherwise required
by applicable Law, any indemnity payment made under this Agreement shall be
treated by all parties as an adjustment to the final Merger Consideration for
all federal, state, local and foreign Tax purposes, and the parties shall
file their Tax Returns accordingly.

  



  

12.9 _Determination of Breaches and Losses_. For purposes of this
_Article XII_ , references to the terms  "material," "in all material
respects," Material Adverse Effect or any similar term or phrase contained in
any representation or warranty (except for the representation and warranty in
_Section 4.12_ and _Section 4.23(a)_ ) shall be disregarded for purposes of
determining whether there has been any breach of any representation or
warranty in this Agreement, and for purposes of determining the amount of
Losses resulting therefrom.

  



  

12.10 _Effect of Investigation_. A claim for indemnity may be made by
the Indemnitees under _Section 12.2_ or _Section 12.3_ despite the fact that
such Indemnitee had actual knowledge prior to the execution and delivery of
this Agreement, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby,
of the breach of, or of any facts or circumstances constituting or resulting
in the breach of, such representation or warranty. In furtherance of the
foregoing, each party hereto shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall be
deemed to have relied upon, all representations, warranties and covenants of
each other party set forth in this Agreement which have been or are made in
favor of such party, and the rights of Indemnitees under this _Article XII_
shall not be affected, notwithstanding (i) any investigation or examination
conducted with respect to, or any knowledge acquired (or capable of being
acquired) about the accuracy or inaccuracy of or compliance with, any
representation, warranty, covenant, agreement, undertaking or obligation made
by or on behalf of the parties hereto, (ii) the waiver of any condition based
on the accuracy of any representation or warranty, or on the performance of or
compliance with any covenant, agreement, undertaking or obligation, or (iii)
the consummation of the Closing hereunder.

ARTICLE XIII.

  

MISCELLANEOUS

  



  

13.1 _Waiver_. Any party to this Agreement may, at any time prior to
the Closing, by action taken by its Board of Directors, or officers
thereunto duly authorized, waive any of the terms or conditions of this
Agreement or (without limiting _Section 13.10_ ) agree to an amendment or
modification to this Agreement by an agreement in writing executed in the same
manner (but not necessarily by the same Persons) as this Agreement. No waiver
by any of the parties hereto of any default, misrepresentation or breach of
representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement hereunder, whether
intentional or not, shall be deemed to extend to any prior or
subsequent default, misrepresentation or breach or affect in any way any
rights arising by virtue of any prior or subsequent such occurrence. No
waiver by any of the parties of any of the provisions hereof shall be
effective unless explicitly set forth in writing and executed by the party
sought to be charged with such waiver. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, this _Section 13.1_ , _Section 13.4_ , _Section
13.10_ and _Section 13.17_ (and any definition set forth in, or other
provision of, this Agreement to the extent that a waiver of such definition
or other provision would amend or modify the substance of this  _Section
13.1_ , _Section 13.4_ , _Section 13.10_ and _Section 13.17_ ) may not be
waived in a manner adverse to any Financing Source without the prior written
consent of such Financing Source (and any such waiver without such prior
written consent shall be null and void).

  



  

13.2 _Notices_. All notices and other communications among the parties
shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given (i)
when delivered in person, (ii) when delivered after posting in the United

shall bear its own expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby whether or not such transactions shall be

action based upon, arising out of, or related to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, shall be governed by, and construed in
accordance with, the Laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to
principles or rules of conflict of laws to the extent such principles
or rules would require or permit the application of Laws of another
jurisdiction.

  



  

13.7 _Captions; Counterparts_. The captions in this Agreement are for
convenience only and shall not be considered a part of or affect the
construction or interpretation of any provision of this Agreement. This
Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be
deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and
the same instrument.

  



  

13.8 _Schedules and Annexes_. The Schedules and Annexes referenced
herein are a part of this Agreement as if fully set forth herein. All
references herein to Schedules and Annexes shall be deemed references to such
parts of this Agreement, unless the context shall otherwise require. Any

13.10 _Amendments_. This Agreement may be amended or modified in whole
or in part, only by a duly authorized agreement in writing executed in the
same manner as this Agreement and which makes reference to this Agreement.
The approval of this Agreement by the stockholders of the Company shall not
restrict the ability of the Company Board to terminate this Agreement in
accordance with _Section 10.1_  or to cause the Company to enter into an
amendment to this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 13.10_ to the extent
permitted under Section 251(d) of the DGCL. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, _Section 13.1_ , _Section 13.4_ , this _Section
13.10_ and _Section 13.17_ (and any definition set forth in, or other
provision of, this Agreement to the extent that an amendment or modification
of such definition or other provision would amend or modify the substance of
_Section 13.1_ , _Section 13.4_ , this _Section 13.10_ and _Section 13.17_ )
may not be amended or modified in a manner that is adverse to any Financing
Source without the prior written consent of such Financing Source (and any
such amendment or modification without such prior written consent shall be
null and void).

  



  

13.11 _Publicity_. The parties hereto agree that, from the date hereof
through the Closing Date, no public release or announcement concerning
the transactions contemplated hereby shall be issued or made by or on behalf
of any party without the prior consent of the other parties and otherwise as
a party may reasonably determine is necessary to comply with applicable Law
(including under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act) or the requirements
of any agreement to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Industrea Parties and the Company shall
cooperate to prepare a joint press release to be issued on or promptly (and
in any event within two (2) Business Days) after the date of this Agreement
and a joint press release to be issued on the Closing Date. The Company and
the Industrea Parties agree to keep the terms of this Agreement confidential,
except to the extent and to the Persons to whom disclosure is required by
applicable Law (including under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act)
or for purposes of compliance with financial reporting obligations;
_provided_ , _that_ the parties may disclose such terms to their respective
employees, accountants, advisors and other representatives as necessary in
connection with the ordinary conduct of their respective businesses (so long
as such Persons agree to, or are bound by contract or professional or
fiduciary obligations to, keep the terms of this Agreement confidential and
so long as the parties shall be responsible to the other parties hereto
for breach of this _Section 13.11_ or such confidentiality obligations by the
recipients of its disclosure). The Company and Industrea further acknowledge
and agree that, PGP Investors, LLC and Argand Partners LP may disclose such
terms and the existence of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby to its Affiliates in order that such Persons may provide information
about the subject matter of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby to their respective actual and prospective limited partners and
investors in connection with their fundraising and reporting activities.

  



  

13.12 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid
or unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction, the other
provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. The
parties further agree that if any provision contained herein is, to any
extent, held invalid or unenforceable in any respect under the Laws governing
this Agreement, they shall take any actions necessary to render the remaining
provisions of this Agreement valid and enforceable to the fullest extent
permitted by Law and, to the extent necessary, shall amend or otherwise
modify this Agreement to replace any provision contained herein that is held
invalid or unenforceable with a valid and enforceable provision giving effect
to the intent of the parties.

  



  

13.13 _Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial_.

  



  

(a) Any Action based upon, arising out of or related to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby may be brought in the
Delaware Chancery Court (or, if the Delaware Chancery Court shall be
unavailable, any other court of the State of Delaware or, in the case of
claims to which the federal courts have subject matter jurisdiction, any
federal court of the United States of America sitting in the State of
Delaware), and, in each case, appellate courts therefrom, and each of the
parties irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of each such court
in any such Action, waives any objection it may now or hereafter have to
personal jurisdiction, venue or to convenience of forum, agrees that all
claims in respect of such Action shall be heard and determined only in any
such court, and agrees not to bring any Action arising out of or relating to
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby in any other court.
Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to affect the right of any party to
serve process in any manner permitted by Law or to commence legal proceedings
or otherwise proceed against any other party in any other jurisdiction, in
each case, to enforce judgments obtained in any Action brought pursuant to
this _Section 13.13(a)_.

  



    

97 
--- 

 



    



  

(b) Each party hereto hereby waives, to the fullest extent permitted
by applicable Law, any right it may have to a trial by jury in respect of any
Action arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.
Each party hereto (i) certifies that no representative, agent or attorney of
any other party has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such party would
not, in the event of any Action, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver and
(ii) acknowledges that it and the other parties hereto have been induced to
enter into this Agreement by, among other things, the mutual waiver and
certifications in this _Section 13.13(b)_.

  



  

13.14 _Enforcement_. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage
would occur, and that the parties would not have any adequate remedy at law,
in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed
in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is
accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to specifically enforce
the terms and provisions of this Agreement, without proof of actual damages or
otherwise, in addition to any other remedy to which any party is entitled at
law or in equity. Each party agrees to waive any requirement for the securing
or posting of any bond in connection with such remedy. The parties further
agree not to assert that a remedy of specific enforcement is unenforceable,
invalid, contrary to law or inequitable for any reason, nor to assert that a
remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy. To the extent
any party hereto brings an Action to enforce specifically the performance of
the terms and provisions of this Agreement (other than an Action to enforce
specifically any provision that by its terms requires performance after the
Closing or expressly survives termination of this Agreement), the Termination
Date shall automatically be extended to (i) the twentieth (20th) Business Day
following the resolution of such Action or (ii) such other time period
established by the court presiding over such Action (it being understood that
this _Section 13.14_ shall not be deemed to alter, amend, supplement or
otherwise modify the terms of any Debt Commitment Letter (including the
expiration or termination provisions thereof)).

  



  

13.15 _Non-Recourse_. This Agreement may only be enforced against, and
any claim or cause of action based upon, arising out of, or related to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby may only be brought
against, the entities that are expressly named as parties hereto and then
only with respect to the specific obligations set forth herein with respect to
such party. Except to the extent a named party to this Agreement (and then
only to the extent of the specific obligations undertaken by such named party
in this Agreement and not otherwise), no past, present or future director,
officer, employee, incorporator, member, partner, stockholder,
Affiliate, agent, attorney, advisor or representative or Affiliate of any of
the foregoing shall have any liability (whether in contract, tort, equity or
otherwise) for any one or more of the representations, warranties, covenants,
agreements or other obligations or liabilities of any one or more of the
Company, Industrea or Concrete Merger Sub under this Agreement (whether for
indemnification or otherwise) or of or for any claim based on, arising out
of, or related to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

13.16 _Waiver of Conflicts Regarding Representations; Non-Assertion of
Attorney-Client Privilege_.

  



  

(a) _Conflicts of Interest_. Industrea acknowledges that Latham and
Watkins LLP, Ballard Spahr LLP and other legal counsel (" _Prior Company
Counsel_ ") have, on or prior to the Closing Date, represented one or more of
the Holder Representative, one or more Pre-Closing Holders, the Company, and
its Subsidiaries and other Affiliates, and their respective officers,
employees and directors (each such Person, other than the Company and its
Subsidiaries, a " _Designated Person_ ") in one or more matters relating to
this Agreement or any other agreements or transactions contemplated hereby
(including any matter that may be related a litigation, claim or dispute
arising under or related to this Agreement or such other agreements or in
connection with such transactions) (each, an " _Existing Representation_ "),
and that, in the event of any post-Closing matters (x) relating to this
Agreement or any other agreements or transactions contemplated hereby
(including any matter that may be related to a litigation, claim or dispute
arising under or related to this Agreement or such other agreements or in
connection with such transactions) and (y) in which Industrea or any of its
Affiliates (including the Company and its Subsidiaries), on the one hand, and
one or more Designated Persons, on the other hand, are or may be adverse to
each other (each, a " _Post-Closing Matter_ "), the Designated Persons
reasonably anticipate that Prior Company Counsel will represent them in
connection with such matters. Accordingly, each of Industrea and the Company
hereby (i) waives and shall not assert, and agrees after the Closing to cause
its Affiliates to waive and to not assert, any conflict of interest arising
out of or relating to the representation by one or more Prior Company Counsel
of one or more Designated Persons in connection with one or more Post-Closing
Matters (the " _Post-Closing Representations_ ") _, _ and (ii) agrees that,
in the event that a Post-Closing Matter arises, Prior Company Counsel may
represent one or more Designated Persons in Post-Closing Matter even though
the interests of such Person(s) may be directly adverse to Industrea or any of
its Affiliates (including the Company and its Subsidiaries), and even though
Prior Company Counsel may (i) have represented the Company or
its Subsidiaries in a matter substantially related to such dispute or (ii) be
currently representing Industrea, the Company or any of their respective
Affiliates. Without limiting the foregoing, each of Industrea and the Company
(on behalf of itself and its Affiliates) consents to the disclosure by Prior
Company Counsel, in connection with one or more Post-Closing Representations,
to the Designated Persons of any information learned by Prior Company Counsel
in the course of one or more Existing Representations, whether or not such
information is subject to the attorney-client privilege of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries or Prior Company Counsel's duty of confidentiality as to
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and whether or not such disclosure is
made before or after the Closing.

  



  

(b) _Attorney-Client Privilege_. Each of Industrea and the Company
(on behalf of itself and its Affiliates) waives and shall not assert, and
agrees after the Closing to cause its Affiliates to waive and to not assert,
any attorney-client privilege, attorney work-product protection or
expectation of client confidence with respect to any communication between any
Prior Company Counsel, on the one hand, and any Designated Person or the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Pre-Closing
Designated Persons_ "), or any advice given to any Pre-Closing Designated
Person by any Prior Company Counsel, occurring during one or more Existing
Representations (collectively, " _Pre-Closing Privileges_ ") in connection
with any Post-Closing Representation, including in connection with a dispute
between any Designated Person and one or more of Industrea, the Company and
their respective Affiliates, it being the intention of the parties hereto
that all rights to such Pre-Closing Privileges, and all rights to waiver or
otherwise control such Pre-Closing Privilege, shall be retained by the Holder
Representative, and shall not pass to or be claimed or used by Industrea or
the Company, except as provided in the last sentence of this _Section
13.16(b)_. Furthermore, each of Industrea and the Company (on behalf of
itself and its Affiliates) acknowledges and agrees that any advice given to or
communication with any of the Designated Persons shall not be subject to any
joint privilege (whether or not the Company or one more of its
Subsidiaries also received such advice or communication) and shall be owned
solely by such Designated Persons. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the
event that a dispute arises between Industrea or the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and a third party other than a Designated
Person, on the other hand, the Company shall (and shall cause its Affiliates
to) assert the Pre-Closing Privileges on behalf of the Designated Persons to
prevent disclosure of Privileged Materials to such third party; provided,
however, that such privilege may be waived only with the prior written
consent of the Holder Representative.

  



    

99 
--- 

 



    



  

(c) _Privileged Materials_. All such Pre-Closing Privileges, and
all books and records and other documents of the Company and its
Subsidiaries containing any advice or communication that is subject to any
Pre-Closing Privilege (" _Privileged Materials_ "), shall be excluded from
the purchase, and shall be distributed to the Holder Representative (on behalf
of the applicable Designated Persons) immediately prior to the Closing with
(in the case of such books and records) no copies retained by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries. Absent the prior written consent of the Holder
Representative, neither Industrea nor (following the Closing) the Company
shall have a right of access to Privileged Materials.

  



  

(d) This  _Section 13.16_ shall be irrevocable, and no term of this
_Section 13.16_ may be amended, waived or modified, without the prior written
consent of the Holder Representative and its Affiliates and Prior Company
Counsel affected thereby.

  



  

13.17 _Certain Matters Regarding the Financing Sources_.

  



  

(a) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (i) each of the
Holder Representative (on behalf of itself, the Pre-Closing Holders and its
and their respective officers, directors, employees, members, managers,
partners and controlling Persons), the Company (on behalf of itself and its
officers, directors, employees, members, managers, partners and controlling
Persons) and each of the other parties hereto agrees that any claim,
controversy or dispute of any kind or nature (whether in contract or in tort,
in Law, in equity or otherwise) involving or against a Financing Source that
is in any way related to this Agreement, a Debt Commitment Letter,
the financings contemplated thereby or any of the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby will be governed by and construed in accordance with the
internal Laws of the State of New York without regard to the conflicts of Law
principles that would require the application of any other Law, and (ii) each
of the Holder Representative (on behalf of itself, the Pre-Closing Holders
and its and their respective officers, directors, employees, members,
managers, partners and controlling Persons), the Company (on behalf of itself
and its officers, directors, employees, members, managers, partners and
controlling Persons) and each of the other parties hereto (A) agrees that it
will not bring or support any Person, or permit any of its Affiliates to bring
or support any Person, in any action, suit, proceeding, cause of action,
claim, cross-claim or third-party claim of any kind or description,
whether in Law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise,
against the Financing Sources in any way relating to this Agreement, a Debt
Commitment Letter, the financings contemplated thereby or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby in any forum other than
exclusively in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York,
or, if under applicable Law exclusive jurisdiction is vested in the federal
courts, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York
in the County of New York (and appellate courts thereof), (B) submits for
itself and its property with respect to any such action to the
exclusive jurisdiction of such courts, (C) waives and hereby irrevocably
waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any
objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of, and
the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of, any such action
in any such court, (D) agrees that service of process, summons, complaint,
notice or document or any other process that might be served in any action or
proceeding may be made on any party by sending or delivering a copy of the
process to such party to be served at the address of such party and in the
manner provided for the giving of notices in _Section 13.2_ and shall be
effective service of process against it for any such action brought in any
such court, and (E) HEREBY WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION OR
PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, A DEBT COMMITMENT
LETTER, THE FINANCINGS CONTEMPLATED THEREBY OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY, INCLUDING ANY DISPUTE ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING IN ANY WAY TO A DEBT COMMITMENT LETTER OR THE PERFORMANCE THEREOF OR
THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED THEREBY, WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER
ARISING, AND WHETHER SOUNDING IN CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING ANY
ACTION OR PROCEEDING AGAINST ANY FINANCING SOURCE.

(b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, each of the
Holder Representative (on behalf of itself, the Pre-Closing Holders and its
and their respective officers, directors, employees, members, managers,
partners and controlling Persons), the Company (on behalf of itself and its
officers, directors, employees, members, managers, partners and controlling
Persons) and each of the other parties hereto agrees that (i) none of it, its
Affiliates and its and their respective officers, directors, employees,
members, managers, partners and controlling Persons shall have any rights or
claims against any Financing Source in connection with this Agreement, a
Debt Commitment Letter, the financings contemplated thereby or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, whether at Law or equity, in
contract, in tort or otherwise; _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing
will not limit the rights of the parties to a Debt Commitment Letter or the
definitive documentation for the financings contemplated thereby, and (ii) in
no event will any Financing Source be liable for punitive, special,
exemplary, indirect, consequential or incidental damages or liabilities, or
damages or liabilities argued to be associated with lost profits or diminution
in value or damages or liabilities based on any type of multiple or damages
of a tortious nature in connection with this Agreement, a Debt Commitment
Letter, the financings contemplated thereby or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby, whether at Law or equity, in contract, in tort
