be determined in accordance with <U>Section 3.4(a)</U> (including the definitions of the defined terms used in <U>Section 3.4(a)</U>),
and the parties shall instruct the Accounting Referee to make all determinations in accordance with the Accounting Principles,
notwithstanding the availability of other accounting methods, policies, practices and/or procedures under GAAP or otherwise. The
Accounting Referee may not assign a value greater than the greatest value for a disputed item claimed by either party or smaller
than the smallest value for such item claimed by either party. The determination of the Accounting Referee shall be final, conclusive
and binding on the parties. The date on which Closing Date Net Working Capital, Closing Date Funded Debt, Closing Date Cash and
Closing Transaction Expenses are finally determined in accordance with this <U>Section 3.4(b)</U> is hereinafter referred to as
the &ldquo;<U>Determination Date</U>.&rdquo; All fees and expenses of the Accounting Referee relating to the work, if any, to be
performed by the Accounting Referee hereunder shall be borne pro rata as between Newco, on the one hand, and the Holder Representative
from the Holder Representative Expense Amount, on the other hand, in proportion to the allocation of the dollar value of the amounts
in dispute as between Newco and the Holder Representative (as set forth in the written submissions to the Accounting Referee) made
by the Accounting Referee such that the party prevailing on the greater dollar value of such disputes pays the lesser proportion
of the fees and expenses. For example, if the Holder Representative challenges items underlying the calculations of Closing Date
Net Working Capital, Closing Date Funded Debt, Closing Date Cash and Closing Transaction Expenses in the net amount of $1,000,000,
and the Accounting Referee determines that Newco has a valid claim for $400,000 of the $1,000,000, Newco shall bear sixty percent
(60%) of the fees and expenses of the Accounting Referee and the Holder Representative shall bear the remaining forty percent (40%)
of the fees and expenses of the Accounting Referee from the Holder Representative Expense Amount.</P>

shall have such powers and authority as are necessary to carry out the functions assigned to it under this Agreement; <U>provided</U>,
<U>however</U>, that the Holder Representative shall have no obligation to act, except as expressly provided herein. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, the Holder Representative shall have full power, authority and discretion to (i) estimate and
determine the Holder Representative Expense Amount and to pay the Holder Representative Expense Amount in accordance with <U>Section
3.5</U>, (ii) retain counsel and to incur such fees, costs and expenses as the Holder Representative deems to be necessary or appropriate
in connection with the performance of its obligations under this Agreement and each of the documents to be executed in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby, (iii) after the Closing, negotiate and enter into amendments to this Agreement and the
Escrow Agreement for and on behalf of the Pre-Closing Holders and (iv) with respect to any claims for indemnification made pursuant
to <U>Section 12.2</U>, exercise all rights granted to the Holder Representative under Article XII. All actions taken by the Holder
Representative under this Agreement shall be binding upon the Pre-Closing Holders and their successors as if expressly confirmed
and ratified in writing by each of them. The Holder Representative shall have no liability to Industrea Parties, the Company or
any holder of Company Stock or Options with respect to actions taken or omitted to be taken in its capacity as the Holder Representative.
The Holder Representative shall at all times be entitled to rely on any directions received from the Majority Holders; <U>provided</U>,
<U>however</U>, that the Holder Representative shall not be required to follow any such direction, and shall be under no obligation
to take any action in its capacity as the Holder Representative, unless the Holder Representative is holding funds delivered to
it under <U>Section 3.5</U> and has been provided with other funds, security or indemnities which, in the sole determination of
the Holder Representative, are sufficient to protect the Holder Representative against the costs, expenses and liabilities which
may be incurred by the Holder Representative in responding to such direction or taking such action. The Holder Representative shall
be entitled to engage such counsel, experts and other agents and consultants as it shall deem necessary in connection with exercising
its powers and performing its function hereunder and (in the absence of bad faith on the part of the Holder Representative) shall
be entitled to conclusively rely on the opinions and advice of such Persons. The Holder Representative shall be entitled to reimbursement
from funds paid to it under <U>Section 3.5</U>, released from the Escrow Funds for the benefit of Pre-Closing Holders or otherwise
received by it in its capacity as the Holder Representative pursuant to or in connection with this Agreement, for all reasonable
expenses, disbursements and advances (including fees and disbursements of its counsel, experts and other agents and consultants)
incurred by the Holder Representative in such capacity, and shall be entitled to indemnification against any loss, liability or
expenses arising out of actions taken or omitted to be taken in its capacity as the Holder Representative (except for those arising
out of the Holder Representative&rsquo;s gross negligence or willful misconduct), including the costs and expenses of investigation
and defense of claims. In the event that the Holder Representative determines, in its sole and absolute discretion, that the funds
paid to the Holder Representative pursuant to <U>Section 3.5</U> exceed the aggregate amount of fees, costs, expenses and Taxes
incurred, or that may in the future be incurred, by the Holder Representative in connection with the performance of its obligations
under this Agreement and each of the documents to be executed in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, prior to
the final release of the Escrow Funds, the Holder Representative shall transfer such excess amount to the Escrow Agent solely for
disbursement (or otherwise cause such excess amount to be disbursed) to the Pre-Closing Holders as Merger Consideration; <U>provided</U>,
<U>however</U>, that notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, in no event shall such
excess amount become part of the Escrow Funds or otherwise become payable to Industrea Parties. The Industrea Parties shall be
able to rely conclusively on the instructions and decisions of the Holder Representative as to the settlement of any claims for
indemnification of Industrea Parties pursuant to the Escrow Agreement or Article XII below or any other actions, consents, approvals,
agreements and decisions required or permitted to be taken, given or made by the Holder Representative hereunder, and no Pre-Closing
Holder shall have any cause of action against Industrea Parties to the extent that Industrea Parties has relied upon the instructions
or decisions of the Holder Representative. The Holder Representative shall have the right, but not the obligation, exercisable
in its sole discretion, to distribute to the Pre-Closing Holders at any time such Pre-Closing Holder&rsquo;s Escrow Percentage
of the Holder Representative Expenses Amount. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (A) there can be no assurances that any of the Holder
Representative Expense Amount will be paid or disbursed to the Pre-Closing Holders and (B) no Pre-Closing Holder not be entitled
to receive any interest on the Holder Representative Expense Amount.</P>
