 (a) _Conversion of Common Units_. Subject to _Section 2.1(e)_, each Common Unit issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall thereupon be converted automatically into and shall thereafter represent the right to receive the following consideration (the " _Common Unit Consideration_ "): 

   

 (i) each Common Unit (including each Phantom Unit) with respect to which an election to receive all cash (a " _Cash Election_ ") has been effectively made and not revoked pursuant to _Section 2.2_ and each Non-Electing Common Unit shall be converted into the right to receive $8.15 in cash without interest; and 

   

 (ii) each Common Unit (including each Phantom Unit) with respect to which an election to receive a combination of stock and cash (a " _Mixed Election_ ") has been effectively made and not revoked pursuant to _Section 2.2_ shall be converted into the right to receive (A) $4.075 per Common Unit in cash without interest, and (B) a fraction of a validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable Parent Share equal to the quotient determined 

   ##### 

  

    

by dividing $4.075 by the Parent Share Value and rounding to the nearest ten-
thousandth of a share. 

   

 Each Common Unit converted into the right to receive the Common Unit Consideration pursuant to this _Section 2.1(a)_ shall cease to be outstanding and shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a Common Unit immediately prior to the Effective Time (whether certificated or non-certificated and represented in book-entry form) shall thereafter cease to be a limited partner of the Company or have any rights with respect to such Common Units, except the right to receive the Common Unit Consideration. 

   

 (b) _Conversion of Preferred Units_. Subject to _Section 2.1(e)_, each Preferred Unit issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall thereupon be converted automatically into and shall thereafter represent the right to receive the following consideration (the " _Preferred Unit Consideration_ ") (i) $4.075 per Preferred Unit in cash without interest, and (ii) a fraction of a validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable Parent Share equal to the quotient determined by dividing $4.075 by the Parent Share Value and rounding to the nearest ten-thousandth of a share. Each Preferred Unit converted into the right to receive the Preferred Unit Consideration pursuant to this _Section 2.1(b)_ shall cease to be outstanding and shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a Preferred Unit immediately prior to the Effective Time (whether certificated or non-certificated and represented in book-entry form) shall thereafter cease to be a limited partner of the Company or have any rights with respect to such Preferred Units, except the right to receive the Preferred Unit Consideration. 

   

 (c) _General Partner Units; Incentive Distribution Rights_. Subject to  _Section 2.1(e)_, each General Partner Unit issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall thereupon be converted automatically into and shall thereafter represent the right to receive $8.15 in cash without interest per General Partner Unit (the " _GP Unit Consideration_ "). The Incentive Distribution Rights issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall at the Effective Time be converted automatically into and shall thereafter represent the right to receive consideration of $18,000,000 in cash without interest (the " _GP IDR Consideration_ ," and, together with the GP Unit Consideration, the " _GP Consideration_ "). The General Partner Units and Incentive Distribution Rights converted into the right to receive the GP Consideration pursuant to this _Section 2.1(c)_ shall cease to be outstanding and shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist. Immediately following the admission of Holding Sub as the general partner of the Company pursuant to _Section 2.1(d)_, Company General Partner shall cease to be a general partner of the Company, IDR Holdings shall cease to be a limited partner of the Company and neither Company General Partner nor IDR Holdings will have any rights with respect to the General Partner Units or the Incentive Distribution Rights (whether such interests are certificated or non-certificated and represented in book-entry form), except the right to receive the GP Consideration and the obligations set forth in _Section 6.11_. 

   

 (d) _Conversion of Merger Sub Limited Liability Company Interests; Admission of General Partner and Limited Partner_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (i) Holding Subs limited liability company interest in Merger Sub shall be converted into and become a 1% general partner interest in the Surviving Company and Holding Sub shall be admitted to the Surviving Company as the sole general partner, (ii) LP Subs limited liability company interest in Merger Sub shall be converted into and become a 99% limited partner interest in the Surviving Company, and LP Sub shall be admitted to the Surviving Company as the sole limited partner, and (iii) the Company shall continue without dissolution. Immediately after the Effective Time, such general partner interest and limited partner interest referred to in the preceding sentence will constitute the only 

   ##### 

  

    

outstanding partnership interests in the Surviving Company. At the Effective
Time, Holding Sub and LP Sub shall be automatically bound by the Surviving
Company Partnership Agreement and the books and records of the Surviving
Company shall be revised to reflect the admission of Holding Sub and LP Sub
as the sole general partner and sole limited partner, respectively, of the
Surviving Company and the withdrawal, immediately following such admissions,
of (y) Company General Partner as general partner of the Company, and (z)
all Limited Partners (other than LP Sub) as limited partners of the
Company. 

   

 (e) _Adjustments_. If between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the outstanding Units or capital stock of Parent, including securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for Units or capital stock of Parent, shall be changed into a different number of units, shares or other securities by reason of any split (including reverse split), combination, merger, consolidation, reorganization, reclassification, recapitalization or other similar transaction, or any distribution payable in any equity interests in the Company or Parent shall be declared thereon with a record date within such period, the Merger Consideration, the exchange ratios and any other similarly dependent items described herein, as the case may be, shall be appropriately adjusted to provide the holders of interests of the Company converted into Merger Consideration pursuant to this  _Section 2.1_ the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event, and as so adjusted shall, from and after the date of such event, be the Merger Consideration, the applicable exchange ratio or other dependent item, as applicable, subject to further adjustment in accordance with this sentence; __provided__ , __however__ , that nothing herein shall be construed to permit the Company Entities to take any action with respect to their securities that is expressly prohibited by _Section 5.1_. 

  

 Section 2.2 _Election Procedures_. 

   

 (a) At the time of mailing of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus to holders of record of Common Units entitled to vote at the Unitholder Meeting (such date, the " _Mailing Date_ "), an election form and other appropriate and customary transmittal materials (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates theretofore representing Common Units, or Book-Entry Common Units, shall pass, only upon proper delivery of such Certificates or Book-Entry Common Units, respectively, to the Exchange Agent, upon adherence to the procedures set forth in the letter of transmittal) in such form as Parent and the Company shall reasonably agree (the " _Election Form_ ") shall be mailed to each holder of record of Common Units as of the record date for the Unitholder Meeting. 

   

 (b) Each Election Form shall permit the holder (or the beneficial owner through appropriate and customary documentation and instructions) to specify (i) the number of such holders Common Units with respect to which such holder makes a Cash Election, and (ii) the number of such holders Common Units with respect to which such holder elects to make a Mixed Election. Any Common Units with respect to which the Exchange Agent has not received an effective, properly completed Election Form on or before 5:00 p.m., New York time, on the Business Day that is three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date (which date shall be publicly announced by Parent as soon as reasonably practicable) (or such other time and date as the Company and Parent shall agree in writing) (the " _Election Deadline_ ") shall be deemed to be " _Non-Electing Common Units_." If the Closing Date is delayed to a subsequent date, the Election Deadline shall be similarly delayed to a subsequent date, and Parent shall promptly announce any such delay and, when determined, the rescheduled Election Deadline, if any. 

   

 (c) Parent shall make Election Forms available as may reasonably be requested from time to time by all Persons who become holders (or beneficial owners) of Common Units 

   ##### 

  

    

between the record date for the Unitholder Meeting and the Election Deadline,
and the Company shall provide to the Exchange Agent all information
reasonably necessary for it to perform as specified herein and as specified
in any agreement with the Exchange Agent. 

   

 (d) Any election made pursuant to this _Section 2.2_ shall have been properly made only if the Exchange Agent shall have actually received a properly completed Election Form prior to the Election Deadline. An Election Form shall be deemed properly completed only (i) if accompanied by one or more Certificates representing Common Units duly endorsed in blank or otherwise in form acceptable for transfer on the books of the Company (or by an appropriate guarantee of delivery of such Certificates as set forth in such Election Form from a firm that is an "eligible guarantor institution" (as defined in Rule 17Ad-15 under the Exchange Act), and/or (ii) upon receipt of an "agents message" by the Exchange Agent or such other evidence of transfer of Book-Entry Common Units to the Exchange Agent as the Exchange Agent may reasonably request, collectively representing all Common Units covered by such Election Form, together with duly executed transmittal materials included with the Election Form. Any Election Form may be revoked or changed by the Person submitting such Election Form, by written notice received by the Exchange Agent prior to the Election Deadline. In the event an Election Form is revoked prior to the Election Deadline, the Common Units represented by such Election Form shall become Non-Electing Common Units and Parent shall cause the Certificates representing such Common Units to be promptly returned without charge to the Person submitting the Election Form upon such revocation or written request to that effect from the holder who submitted the Election Form; __provided__ ,  _ _however__ , that a subsequent election may be made with respect to any or all of such Common Units pursuant to this _Section 2.2_. In addition, all Cash Elections and Mixed Elections shall automatically be revoked and all Certificates representing Common Units shall be promptly returned without charge if this Agreement is terminated in accordance with _Article 8_ of this Agreement.

 Section 2.4 _Exchange of Certificates and Book Entry Interests_. 

   

 (a) Prior to the Mailing Date, Parent shall appoint a commercial bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as agent (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") for the purpose of exchanging Certificates and Book-Entry Interests for the Merger Consideration.

 (c) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall (1) issue and deposit or cause to be deposited with the Exchange Agent to be held in trust for the holders of Company Equity Interests, evidence of shares in book-entry form, representing Parent Shares issuable pursuant to _Section 2.1_ in exchange for (x) outstanding Common Units for which a Mixed Election (to the extent such consideration is payable in Parent Shares) has been made, (y) outstanding Preferred Units (to the extent such consideration is payable in Parent Shares), and (z) outstanding General Partner Units (to the extent such consideration is payable in Parent Shares) and an amount of cash representing the aggregate cash consideration payable pursuant to _Section 2.1_, and (2) deposit with the Exchange Agent, from time to time as needed, cash in amounts that are sufficient to pay cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to _Section 2.3_, and to make any dividends or other distributions pursuant to _Section 2.4(g)_, in each case, to be paid in respect of the Certificates and the Book-Entry Interests by holders thereof who have properly delivered to the Exchange Agent their Common Units, Preferred Units, General Partner Units, or Incentive Distribution Rights. Any cash and Parent Shares deposited with the Exchange Agent shall hereinafter be referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_." The Exchange Agent shall, subject to the terms of the exchange agent and nominee agreement entered into with Parent, deliver the Merger Consideration contemplated to be issued pursuant to _Section 2.1_,  _Section 2.2_, and _Section 2.3_ out of the Exchange Fund. Until used for that purpose, the cash portion of the Exchange Fund shall be invested by the Exchange Agent in short-term obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America or short-term obligations of an agency of the United States of America which are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States of America, in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Services Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation, or in deposit accounts, short-term certificates of deposit or bankers acceptances of, or repurchase or reverse repurchase agreements with commercial banks which have capital surplus and undivided profits aggregating more than $10 billion (based on the most recent financial statements of the banks which are then publicly available at the SEC or otherwise); __provided__ ,  _ _however__ , that no such investment or losses thereon shall affect the Merger Consideration payable to former holders of Company Equity Interests entitled to receive such consideration or cash in lieu of fractional interests, and Parent shall promptly provide, or shall cause the Surviving Company to promptly provide, additional cash funds to the Exchange Agent for the benefit of the former holders of Company Equity Interests in the amount of any such losses. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any purpose other than the foregoing.

 (d) Each holder of Company Equity Interests that have been converted into a right to receive the Merger Consideration, upon completion of the calculations required by  _Section 2.1_ and surrender of a Certificate or Book-Entry Interests to the Exchange Agent together with the letter of transmittal, duly executed and completed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, will be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (A) one or more Parent Shares which shall be in uncertificated book-entry form and which shall represent, in the aggregate, the whole number of Parent Shares that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to _Section 2.1_ (after taking into account all Company Equity Interests then held by such holder) and/or (B) a check in the amount equal to any cash that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to this _Article 2_, consisting of the cash consideration pursuant to _Section 2.1_, cash in lieu of any fractional shares pursuant to _Section 2.3_, and any dividends and other distributions pursuant to  _Section 2.4(g)_, in each case, less any required withholding Taxes. The Merger Consideration shall be paid as promptly as reasonably practicable after receipt by the Exchange Agent of the Certificate or Book-Entry Interests and letter of transmittal in accordance with the foregoing. No interest shall be paid or accrued on any Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of fractional shares in accordance with _Article 2_ hereof or on any unpaid dividends and distributions payable to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Interests. Until so surrendered, each such Certificate and Book-Entry Interest shall, from and after the Effective Time, represent for all purposes only the right to receive the Merger Consideration, the issuance or payment of which (including any cash in lieu of fractional shares) shall be deemed to be the satisfaction in full of all rights pertaining to Company Equity Interests converted in the Merger. 

   

 (e) If any cash payment is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the applicable surrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Interest is registered, it shall be a condition of such payment that the Person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other similar Taxes required by reason of the making of such cash payment to a Person other than the registered holder of the surrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Interest or shall establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable. If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be registered in the name of a Person other than the Person in whose name the applicable surrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Interest is registered, it shall be a condition to the registration thereof that the surrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Interest shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such delivery of the Merger Consideration shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other similar Taxes required as a result of such registration in the name of a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Interest or establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable. 

   

 (f) Subject to _Section 2.1(d)_, at the Effective Time, the equity transfer books of the Company shall be closed and there shall be no further registration of transfers of Company Equity Interests thereafter. If, after the Effective Time, any Certificates or Book-Entry Interests representing such Company Equity Interests are presented for transfer to the Exchange Agent, each such interest shall be cancelled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration provided for in this _Article 2_ in accordance with the terms hereof. In the event of a transfer of ownership of any Company Equity Interests prior to the Effective Time that has not been registered in the transfer records of the Company, the Merger Consideration payable in respect of such Company Equity Interests shall be paid to the transferee of such interest if the Certificate or Book-Entry Interest that previously represented such Company Equity Interest is presented to the Exchange Agent accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable transfer Taxes have been paid. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates and Book-Entry Interests representing Company Equity Interests outstanding 

   ##### 

  

    

immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with
respect to such Company Equity Interests except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement or by applicable Law. 

   

 (g) No dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Shares issued in the Merger shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificates or Book-Entry Interests until such Certificates or Book-Entry Interests are surrendered as provided in this  _Article 2_. Following such surrender, subject to the effect of escheat, Tax or other applicable Law, there shall be paid, without interest, to the record holder of the Parent Shares, if any, issued in exchange therefor (i) at the time of such surrender, all dividends and other distributions payable in respect of any such Parent Shares with a record date after the Effective Time and a payment date on or prior to the date of such surrender and not previously paid, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the dividends or other distributions payable with respect to such Parent Shares with a record date after the Effective Time but with a payment date subsequent to such surrender. For purposes of dividends or other distributions in respect of Parent Shares, all Parent Shares to be issued pursuant to the Merger shall be entitled to dividends or other distributions pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence as if issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time. 

  

 Section 2.5 _Termination of Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by holders of Company Equity Interests for twelve (12) months after the Effective Time shall be paid to the Surviving Company or, if so directed by the Surviving Company, to Parent. Any holders of Company Equity Interests who have not theretofore complied with this _Article 2_ shall thereafter look only to Parent and the Surviving Company for payment of the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect of each Company Equity Interest formerly held by such holder as determined pursuant to this Agreement without any interest thereon, and Parent and the Surviving Company shall be responsible with respect to such payment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Company, Parent, the Exchange Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any former holder of Company Equity Interests for any amount delivered in good faith to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by holders of Company Equity Interests prior to the date on which such portion of the Exchange Fund would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law and immediately prior to such date, become the property of the Surviving Company, free and clear of all claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto. 

  

 Section 2.6 _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificate_. In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required, the posting by the holder of a bond in customary amount as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to the Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration such holder has a right to receive pursuant to this _Article 2_. 

  

 Section 2.7 _Withholding_. Parent, the Surviving Company and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration deliverable under this Agreement, and from any other payments made pursuant to this Agreement (including pursuant to _Section 2.3_ ) such amounts as Parent, the Surviving Company and the Exchange Agent are required to deduct and withhold with respect to such delivery and payment under the Code or any provision of applicable Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been delivered and paid to the holder of Company Equity Interests and such other Persons, as applicable, in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent, the Surviving Company and the Exchange Agent. 

   ##### 

  

  

 Section 2.8 _Further Assurances_. At and after the Effective Time, the officers and directors of the Surviving Company or the Surviving Companys general partner shall be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Surviving Company (or in the name and on behalf of the Surviving Companys general partner, on behalf of the Surviving Company, as the case may be), any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances and to take and do, in the name and on behalf of the Surviving Company (or in the name and on behalf of the Surviving Companys general partner, on behalf of the Surviving Company, as the case may be), any other actions and things necessary to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving Company any and all right, title and interest in, to and under any of the rights, properties or assets acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Company as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger.

with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred before the
Effective Time, from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit
rating as the Companys current insurance carrier, in an amount and scope and
on terms and conditions no less favorable to such directors and officers
than those in effect on the date of this Agreement; __provided__ ,
__however__ , that the annual premium for such insurance shall not exceed
300% of the per annum rate of premium currently paid by the Company Entities
for such insurance on the date of this Agreement. In the event that the
annual premium for such insurance exceeds such maximum amount, the
Parent shall purchase as much coverage per policy year as reasonably
obtainable for such maximum amount. 

   

 (c) This covenant is intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties and their respective heirs and legal representatives.

 Section 6.14 _Employee Matters_. 

   

 (a) Parent shall or shall cause the Company to maintain for shoreside employees who continue in the employ of Parent, the Company or any of their Subsidiaries following the Closing Date (" _Continuing Employees_ "), for the one-year period following the Closing Date or such shorter period during which a Continuing Employee remains an employee, the base salary or wages and annual incentive bonus opportunities and other benefit plans and arrangements provided by the Company on the date of this Agreement (" _Compensation Arrangements_ "). 

   

 (b) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall enter into, adopt or amend such Company Benefit Plans or other agreements to provide that if the employment of a Continuing Employee is terminated during the one (1) year period following the Effective Time, then Parent shall or shall cause the Company to provide such employee with severance equal to the greater of (i) the severance amount (and according to the terms) set forth in _Section 6.14(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, or (ii) the severance applicable to the employee under any Contract as in effect on the date hereof. 

   

 (c) From and after the Closing, Parent shall recognize each Continuing Employees service with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and with any predecessor employer, in each case, to the same extent recognized by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries on the date of this Agreement for purposes of eligibility to participate and vesting but not benefit accrual under any employee benefit plans or arrangements (including under any applicable 401(k), savings, medical, dental, life insurance, vacation, severance or separation pay plans) provided, sponsored, maintained or contributed to by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries for such Continuing Employees, except to the extent such credit would result in the duplication of benefits or compensation for the same period of service. 

   ##### 

  

   

 (d) Parent shall (i) use commercially reasonable efforts to waive, in the plan year in which the Closing Date occurs, for each Continuing Employee and his or her dependents any waiting period provision, payment requirement to avoid a waiting period, actively-at-work requirement and any other restriction that would prevent immediate or full participation under the welfare plans or pre-existing condition limitations of health benefit plans of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries applicable to such Continuing Employee to the extent such waiting period, pre-existing condition limitation, actively-at-work requirement or other restriction would not have been applicable to such Continuing Employee under the terms of the welfare benefit plans of the Company and its Subsidiaries on the date of this Agreement and (ii) use commercially reasonable efforts to, in the plan year in which the Closing Date occurs, give full credit under the health benefit plans of Parent and its Subsidiaries applicable to each Continuing Employee and his or her dependents for all co-payments and deductibles satisfied prior to the Closing in the same plan year in which the Closing occurs, and for any lifetime maximums, as if there had been a single continuous employer. 

   

 (e) This _Section 6.14_ shall not limit the obligation of Parent to maintain any compensation arrangement or benefit plan pursuant to an existing Contract set forth on the Company Disclosure Schedule. No provision of this Agreement shall be construed as a guarantee of continued employment of any Continuing Employee and this Agreement shall not be construed so as to prohibit Parent or any of its Subsidiaries from having the right to terminate the employment of any Continuing Employee or any other employee at any time and for any or no reason; __provided__ that any such termination is effected in accordance with applicable Law. 

   

 (f) This Agreement is not intended by the parties to (i) constitute an amendment to any Company Benefit Plan or (ii) obligate Parent, the Company or its Subsidiaries, or any of their respective affiliates (including the Company) to maintain any particular compensation or benefit plan, program, policy or arrangement. Nothing contained in this _Section 6.14_ or any other provision of this Agreement shall be construed to create any third-party beneficiary right in any employee or other Person. 

  

 Section 6.15 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Closing date, Parent, the Company and the Management General Partner and their respective boards of directors, shall use their reasonable best efforts to take all actions to cause any dispositions of Common Units (including derivative securities with respect to Common Units), Preferred Units, General Partner Units and the Incentive Distribution Rights, or acquisitions of Parent Shares (including derivative securities with respect to Parent Shares) resulting from the transactions contemplated hereby by each individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act to be exempt from Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in that certain No-Action Letter, dated January 12, 1999, issued by the SEC to Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP.
