as of the Closing, which cash shall be applied at the Closing to satisfaction
of amounts due and owing under the First Lien Credit Facility.

 

 

2.3 Assumption of Liabilities. On the terms and subject to the conditions
and limitations set forth in this Agreement, at the Closing, Purchaser (or
its subsidiaries), or Essex as provided in Section 3.1(a)(ii), shall assume,
effective as of the Closing, only the following liabilities (collectively,
the "Assumed Liabilities") and no others:

 

 

(a) all Liabilities of Seller under the Assumed Executory Contracts that
arise out of, relate to or accrue in the period from and after the Closing
Date;

 

 

(b) without duplication, all Liabilities of Seller that arise out of, relate
to or accrue during the period from and after the Closing Date related to the
Miscellaneous Secured Debt assumed by Purchaser in accordance with
Section 2.9(d);

 

 

(c) the Assumed Secured Debt (as set forth and defined in Section 3.1(a));

 

 

(d) the Liabilities of Seller under the Manitowoc Agreement;

 

 

(e) the Liabilities under the Hedging Agreements-PNC that arise and become

Crane Group relating to non-equipment related purchases (including, without
limitation, parts and services), including any of the foregoing arising after
the filing of the Bankruptcy Case, in an aggregate amount not to exceed Seven
Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($750,000). Seller covenants that such
trade payables of the Company for the amounts owed to the Manitowoc Crane
Group relating to non-equipment related purchases shall not exceed, at
Closing, Seven Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($750,000);

 

 

(g) the trade payables of the Company for the amounts owed to the Manitowoc
Crane Group relating to unsold cranes (and for the avoidance of doubt,
without duplication of the amounts owed for non-equipment related purchases
described above in Section 2.3(f));


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

15  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(h) trade payables relating to operations of the Company (which specifically
excludes all liabilities listed above in Sections 2.3(a)-(g)) owed to the
trade creditors (the "Trade Creditors") listed on Schedule 2.3(h) hereto in
an aggregate amount not to exceed One Million Seven Hundred Thousand Dollars
($1,700,000) (the "Aggregate Trade Payable Amount"). The amounts estimated to
be paid to each of the Trade Creditors for obligations existing as of the end
of business on the Petition Date (the "Assumed Trade Payables") are set
forth on Schedule 2.3(h). As soon as practicable, Seller and Purchaser
will mutually agree upon a revised Schedule 2.3(h) that reallocates payments
to be made to the Trade Creditors after taking into consideration (A) the
actual amounts owed to each of the Trade Creditors as of the end of business
on the Petition Date and (B) the need to satisfy one hundred percent (100%)
of the obligations assumed under Section 2.3(l); provided, however, that such
reallocation will not result in Assumed Trade Payables plus amounts payable
under Section 2.3(l) exceeding, in the aggregate, the Aggregate Trade Payable
Amount. For the avoidance of doubt, dealings with trade creditors after the
Effective Date shall be conducted in accordance with the Budget and Section
8.2(a) herein;

 

 

(i) Transfer Taxes, which Transfer Taxes shall be paid by Purchaser to Seller
at Closing for remittance by Seller to the appropriate taxing authority;

 

 

(j) Cure Costs, which Cure Costs shall be paid by Purchaser to Seller on or
after the Closing for payment by Seller to the appropriate contracting party;

 

 

(k) without duplication, all other Liabilities relating to amounts required
to be paid by Purchaser hereunder;

 

 

(l) all obligations of Seller that would constitute administrative expenses
under Section 503(b)(9) of the Bankruptcy Code, which obligations shall be
paid by Purchaser after Closing, provided that any amounts assumed and paid
under this Section 2.3(l) shall reduce dollar for dollar for such creditor
so paid, the amount listed in Schedule 2.3(h) for such creditor; and

 

 

(m) all obligations in respect of Unpaid Bonuses and Commissions and Unpaid
Employee Compensation, which such amounts will be paid by Purchaser when due
and payable in conformity with the normal course practices of Seller.

 

 

2.4 Excluded Liabilities. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, Purchaser shall not assume, and shall be deemed not to have
assumed, any Liabilities relating to the Business of Seller or any Affiliate
of Seller except as expressly provided in Section 2.3 hereof or elsewhere in
this Agreement, and Seller and its Affiliates shall be solely and exclusively
liable with respect to all such Liabilities, other than the Assumed
Liabilities (collectively, the "Excluded Liabilities"), including without
limitation, those Liabilities set forth below:

 

 

(a) all Liabilities in respect of any and all products sold and/or services
performed by Seller or its Subsidiaries on or before the Closing Date other
than under Assumed Executory Contracts;

 

 

(b) all Excluded Environmental Liabilities;

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(c) except to the extent specifically provided in Article IX,
all Liabilities arising out of, relating to or with respect to (i)
the employment or performance of services, or termination of employment or
services by Seller or any of its Affiliates of any individual on or before
the Closing Date, including all Liabilities under the Worker Adjustment and
Retraining Notification Act of 1988 or any similar applicable state or local
law requiring notice to employees in the event of a closing or a layoff (the
"WARN Act"), (ii) workers' compensation claims against Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries that relate to the period on or before the Closing Date,
irrespective of whether such claims are made prior to or after the Closing,
(iii) any Employee Benefit Plans or (iv) any stay bonus arrangements or
agreements entered into by the Seller with Dan Goodale, Tom Neary or any
other members of Seller management;

 

 

(d) all Liabilities arising out of, under or in connection with Contracts
that are not Assumed Contracts and, with respect to Assumed Contracts,
Liabilities in respect of a breach by or default of Seller accruing under
such Contracts with respect to any period prior to Closing and all Cure
Costs, except as provided in Section 2.3(j) above;

 

 

(e) all Liabilities for (i) liabilities or obligations of Seller for Taxes
other than Transfer Taxes, (ii) Taxes, other than Transfer Taxes, that relate
to the Purchased Assets or the Assumed Liabilities for taxable periods (or
portions thereof) ending on or before the Closing Date, including, without
limitation, Taxes allocable to Seller pursuant to Section 11.2, and (iii)
payments under any Tax allocation, sharing or similar agreement (whether oral
or written);

 

 

(f) all Liabilities in respect of any pending or threatened Legal Proceeding,
or any claim arising out of, relating to or otherwise in respect of (i)
the operation of the Business to the extent such Legal Proceeding or claim
relates to such operation on or prior to the Closing Date, or (ii) any
Excluded Asset;

 

 

(g) all Liabilities relating to amounts required to be paid by Seller
hereunder; and

 

 

(h) any and all other Liabilities of Seller of whatever nature, whether
presently in existence or arising hereafter, known or unknown, disputed or
undisputed, contingent or non contingent, liquidated or unliquidated or
otherwise, other than the Assumed Liabilities.

 

 

2.5 Executory Contract Designation.

 

 

(a) Purchaser hereby designates the Executory Contract listed on Schedule
2.5(a) as the Executory Contracts that Purchaser elects to be assumed and
assigned to it (with such assumption and assignment to be effective as of the
Closing Date), and Seller shall use its reasonable efforts to seek an
Assumption Order with respect any such Executory Contract so designated (the
"Initial Assumed Executory Contracts"). Seller shall pay, satisfy or
otherwise discharge the obligations with respect to the Cure Costs related to
the Initial Assumed Executory Contracts by the later of (i) the Closing Date,
and (ii) such later date as the Bankruptcy Court may order in connection with
any order authorizing Seller to assume or reject the Executory Contracts
under Section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code (the "Cure Costs Deadline"), and in
each instance Purchaser shall have no liability therefore (except as
expressly set forth in Section 2.3(j) above); provided, however, that the
Cure Costs Deadline shall be extended to a date fifteen (15) days following
the entry of a Bankruptcy Court order resolving any disputed Cure Costs.


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

17  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) By no later than the Final Designation Deadline (the "Additional
Designation Period"), Purchaser shall be entitled to designate any
remaining unassumed Executory Contract that Purchaser may want to assume from
Seller and have assigned to it ("Additional Designated Executory Contract")
and Seller shall use its reasonable efforts to seek entry of an Assumption
Order with respect any such Additional Designated Executory Contract.

 

 

(c) With respect to each Additional Designated Executory Contract, and upon
receipt of sufficient funds pursuant to Section 2.3(j) (which funds shall be
paid by Purchaser to Seller substantially simultaneously with the later of
(x) the Closing and (y) the date of the assumption and assignment of such
Additional Designated Executory Contracts), Seller shall pay, satisfy
or otherwise discharge all obligations with respect to the Cure Costs related
to each Additional Designated Executory Contract to the extent that such
expenses have accrued prior to the Closing Date. Such payment shall be made
on such date as the Bankruptcy Court may order in connection with any
order authorizing Seller to assume or reject such Additional Designated
Executory Contract under Section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code (the Cure Costs
Deadline for all Additional Designated Executory Contracts). Purchaser shall
have no liability for any obligations or indebtedness that may accrue under
any Additional Designated Executory Contract prior to the Closing Date. With
respect to each Additional Designated Executory Contract, Purchaser shall
pay, satisfy or otherwise discharge all expenses of administration allowed by
the Bankruptcy Court in connection with such Additional Designated Executory
Contract to the extent such expenses accrued during the period commencing on
the first day following the Closing Date and ending on the date on which such
Additional Designated Executory Contract is either (i) designated for
rejection in writing by Purchaser or (ii) designated by Purchaser as an
Assumed Executory Contract and assumed by and assigned to Purchaser pursuant
to an Assumption Order (the "Post-Closing Determination Period"); provided,
however, that Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the
entry of an Assumption Order in connection with any Additional Designated
Executory Contract by no later than thirty (30) days after the Final
Designation Deadline. Seller shall have no liability for any obligations or
indebtedness that may accrue under any Additional Designated Executory
Contract during the Post-Closing Determination Period, except for any
obligations or indebtedness arising by as a result of Seller's willful
misconduct or gross negligence.

 

 

(d) From the Effective Date through and including the Final Designation
Deadline, Seller shall not reject or allow for the rejection of any Executory
Contract unless otherwise agreed to in writing by Purchaser. To the extent
that an Executory Contract becomes an Additional Designated Executory
Contract, Seller shall not reject or allow for the rejection of such
Executory Contract until Purchaser designates in writing that such Executory
Contract is to be rejected.


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(e) If, by the Final Designation Deadline, Purchaser fails to instruct Seller
in writing to reject an Executory Contract that is not by that date either an
Assumed Executory Contract or an Additional Designated Executory Contract,
Seller agrees to immediately, but in no event more than two (2) Business Days
following the Final Designation Deadline, provide written notice of its
intention to reject such Executory Contract. Purchaser shall have no more
than two (2) Business Days from its receipt of such notice to provide Seller
with written notice of its decision to designate such Executory Contract as
an Additional Designated Executory Contract. If Purchaser timely designates
such Executory Contract as an Additional Designated Executory Contract,
Purchaser shall have all those obligations and rights set forth in Sections
2.5(c) and (d) above with respect to such Executory Contract. If Purchaser
does not timely so designate such Executory Contract as an Additional
Designated Executory Contract, Purchaser shall have no obligation or
liability on account of such Executory Contract and Seller shall retain any
and all obligations or liabilities in connection therewith; provided that
Purchaser shall pay, satisfy or otherwise discharge all expenses of
administration allowed by the Bankruptcy Court in connection with such
Executory Contract for the period commencing on the first day following the
Closing Date and ending on the effective date of the rejection of such
Executory Contract, so long as Seller (i) files with the Bankruptcy Court its
rejection of such Executory Contract within six (6) Business Days following
the Final Designation Deadline and (ii) requests the earliest possible
hearing date available with the Bankruptcy Court to finalize such
rejection(s).

 

 

2.6 Assignment of Contracts and Rights. To the maximum extent permitted by
the Bankruptcy Code, the Purchased Assets and Seller's rights to the
Intellectual Property shall be assumed and assigned to Purchaser pursuant to
Section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code as of the Closing Date or such other date
as specified in an Order or this Agreement, as applicable. Notwithstanding
any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, this Agreement shall
not constitute an agreement to assign any asset or any right thereunder if an
attempted assignment without the consent of a third party would constitute a
breach or in any way adversely affect the rights of Purchaser or
Seller thereunder.

 

 

2.7 Further Conveyances and Assumptions.

 

 

(a) From time to time following the Closing, Seller shall, or shall cause its
Affiliates to, transfer to Purchaser any Purchased Assets received by or in
the possession of Seller.

 

 

(b) From time to time following the Closing, Seller and Purchaser shall, and
shall cause their respective Affiliates to, execute, acknowledge and deliver
all such further conveyances, notices, assumptions, releases and other
instruments, and shall take such further actions, as may be reasonably
necessary or appropriate to assure fully to Purchaser and its respective
successors or assigns, all of the properties, rights, titles, interests,
estates, remedies, powers and privileges intended to be conveyed to Purchaser
under this Agreement and to assure fully to Seller and its Affiliates and
their successors and assigns, the assumption of the liabilities and
obligations intended to be assumed by Purchaser under this Agreement, and to
otherwise make effective the Transactions.

 

 

2.8 Non-Debtor Subsidiary.

 

 

(a) The ownership rights and equity interests of the Non-Debtor Subsidiary
shall be included in the Purchased Assets.

 

 

(b) Seller shall not reject or otherwise liquidate, sell, assign, transfer or
convey any Non-Debtor Subsidiary unless otherwise agreed to in writing
by Purchaser.


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

19  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2.9 Miscellaneous Secured Facilities.

 

 

(a) Purchaser does not designate any Purchased Asset subject to a lien (the
"Miscellaneous Secured Debt") as an Excluded Asset (any such designated
asset, a "Secured Asset").

 

 

(b) At any time on or prior to twenty (20) days after the Closing Date (the
"Payoff Deadline"), Purchaser may designate any Secured Asset previously
designated as an Excluded Asset pursuant to Section 2.9(a) above as a
Purchased Asset. In such an event, Purchaser shall pay, satisfy or otherwise
discharge all outstanding obligations with respect to the Miscellaneous
Secured Debt secured by any such Secured Asset no later than the Payoff
Deadline.

 

 

(c) From the Effective Date through and including the Payoff Deadline, Seller
shall not, and shall cause the Non-Debtor Subsidiary to not, sell, assign,
transfer or convey any Secured Asset unless otherwise agreed to in writing
by Purchaser.

 

 

(d) From the Closing Date and on or prior to the date of any designation
pursuant to Section 2.9(b) with respect to such designated Secured Asset,
Purchaser shall advance or reimburse all of Seller's costs and expenses
accruing after the Closing Date with respect to such designated Secured
Asset, including under any Miscellaneous Secured Debt related thereto.

(d) In the event First Lien Lenders do not request, under Section 2.3(e) of
this Agreement, that Purchaser assume the Liabilities under the Hedging
Agreements-Other that arise and become due and payable after the Closing
Date, then, as part of the Purchase Price, Purchaser shall pay First Lien
Lenders the following (the "Post-Closing Payments"): an amount equal to
payments that would arise and become due and payable under the Hedging

bound; (iii) any Order of any Governmental Body applicable to Purchaser or
any of its properties or assets as of the date hereof; or (iv) any applicable
Law, other than, in the case of clauses (ii), (iii) and (iv), such conflicts,
violations, defaults, terminations or cancellations that would not reasonably
be expected to cause, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse
effect on Purchaser.

 

 

(b) No consent, waiver, approval, Order, Permit or authorization of, or
declaration or filing with, or notification to, any Person or Governmental
Body is required in connection with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement and each other agreement, document or instrument contemplated
hereby or thereby to which Purchaser is a party, the compliance by Purchaser
with any of the provisions hereof or thereof, the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, its taking of any other action
contemplated hereby or thereby, except for (i) compliance with the applicable
requirements of the HSR Act and (ii) such other consents, waivers, approvals,

failure of which to obtain or make, would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on Purchaser.

commissions or other similar compensation to any broker, finder, investment
banker, financial advisor or other similar Person in connection with the
Transactions.

 

 

6.5 Adequate Assurance. Purchaser will timely provide such information
to Seller, as Seller believes is reasonably necessary to provide
"adequate assurance," as that term is used in Section 365 of the Bankruptcy
Code, with respect to Assumed Leases and Assumed Contracts.

 

 

6.6 Condition of the Purchased Assets. Notwithstanding anything contained in
this Agreement to the contrary, Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that Seller
is not making any representations or warranties whatsoever, express or
implied, beyond those expressly given by Seller in Article V hereof
(as modified by the Schedules hereto), and Purchaser acknowledges and agrees
that, except for the representations and warranties contained therein, the
Purchased Assets are being transferred on a "where is" and, as to condition,
"as is" basis. Purchaser acknowledges that it will conduct its own
due diligence and in making the determination to proceed with the
Transaction, Purchaser will be relying on the results of its own
independent investigation.

consents required pursuant to any Material Contract with the Non-Debtor
Subsidiary (the "Non-Debtor Consents"); provided, however, that
neither Seller nor Purchaser shall be obligated to pay any consideration
therefore to any third party from whom consent or approval is requested or to
initiate any litigation or legal proceedings to obtain any such consent or
approval; provided, further, that if requested by Purchaser, Seller shall
initiate such litigation or legal proceedings requested by Purchaser to
obtain such consents or approvals or an Order but only if Purchaser advances
to Seller, Seller's good faith and reasonable estimate of any and all out of
pocket expenses and costs (including reasonable attorneys fees) related

39  

 

 

 

 

 


 

8.4 Regulatory Approvals.

 

 

(a) If necessary, Purchaser and Seller shall (i) use commercially reasonable
efforts to make or cause to be made all filings required of each of them or
any of their respective Affiliates under the HSR Act or other Antitrust Laws
with respect to the Transactions as promptly as practicable and, in any
event, within two (2) Business Days after entry of the Sale Order in the case
of all filings required under the HSR Act and within ten Business Days in the
case of all other filings required by other Antitrust Laws, (ii) comply, to
the extent practicable, at the earliest practicable date with any request
under the HSR Act or other Antitrust Laws for additional information,
documents, or other materials received by each of them or any of their
respective subsidiaries from Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC"), the
Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice (the "Antitrust
Division") or any other Governmental Body in respect of such filings or the
Transactions, and (iii) cooperate with each other in connection with any such
filing (including, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, providing
copies of all such documents to the non-filing parties prior to filing and
considering all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested in
connection therewith) and in connection with resolving any investigation or
other inquiry of any of the FTC, the Antitrust Division or other Governmental
Body under any Antitrust Laws with respect to any such filing or any
Transaction. Each such party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
furnish to each other all information required for any application or other
filing to be made pursuant to any applicable Law in connection with the
Transactions. Each such party shall promptly inform the other parties hereto
of any oral communication with, and provide copies of written communications
with, any Governmental Body regarding any such filings or any Transaction. No
party hereto shall independently participate in any formal meeting with any
Governmental Body in respect of any such filings, investigation, or other
inquiry without giving the other parties hereto prior notice of the meeting
and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Body, the opportunity to
attend and/or participate.  Subject to applicable Law, the parties hereto
will consult and cooperate with one another in connection with any analyses,
appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and
proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any party hereto relating to
proceedings under the HSR Act or other Antitrust Laws. Seller and Purchaser
may, as each deems advisable and necessary in good faith, reasonably
designate any competitively sensitive material provided to the other under
this Section 8.4 as "outside counsel only." Such materials and the
information contained therein shall be given only to the outside legal
counsel of the recipient and will not be disclosed by such outside counsel to
employees, officers, or directors of the recipient, unless express written
permission is obtained in advance from the source of the materials (Seller or
Purchaser, as the case may be).

 

 

(b) Each of Purchaser and Seller shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to resolve such objections, if any, as may be asserted by any
Governmental Body with respect to the Transactions under the HSR Act, the
Sherman Act, as amended, the Clayton Act, as amended, the Federal Trade
Commission Act, as amended, and any other United States federal or state or
foreign statutes, rules, regulations, orders, decrees, administrative or
judicial doctrines or other laws that are designed to prohibit, restrict or
regulate actions having the purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint
of trade (collectively, the "Antitrust Laws"). In connection therewith, if
any Legal Proceeding is instituted (or threatened to be instituted)
challenging any Transaction is in violation of any Antitrust Law, each of
Purchaser and Seller shall cooperate and use its commercially reasonable
efforts to contest and resist any such Legal Proceeding, and to have vacated,
lifted, reversed, or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other
order whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that
prohibits, prevents, or restricts consummation of the Transactions, including
by pursuing all available avenues of administrative and judicial appeal and
all available legislative action, unless, by mutual agreement, Purchaser and
Seller decide that litigation is not in their respective best interests;
provided, that all expenses incurred with respect to such efforts shall be
borne solely by Purchaser. Each of Purchaser and Seller shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to take such action as may be required to
cause the expiration of the notice periods under the HSR Act or other
Antitrust Laws with respect to the Transactions as promptly as possible after
the execution of this Agreement. In connection with and without limiting the
foregoing, each of Purchaser and Seller agrees to use its commercially
reasonable efforts to take promptly any and all steps necessary to avoid or
eliminate each and every impediment under any Antitrust Laws that may be
asserted by any Federal, state and local and non-United States antitrust or
competition authority, so as to enable the parties to close the Transactions
as expeditiously as possible.


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

40  

 

 

 

 

 


 

8.5 Further Assurances. Subject to the other provisions of this Agreement,
each of Purchaser and Seller shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
(i) take all actions necessary or appropriate to consummate the Transactions
and (ii) cause the fulfillment at the earliest practicable date of all of
the conditions to their respective obligations to consummate
the Transactions.

 

 

8.6 Preservation of Records. Seller or its successors and Purchaser agree
that each of them shall preserve and keep the records held by it or their
Affiliates relating to the Purchased Assets for two (2) years after the
Closing Date (except as provided below) and shall make such records available
to the other as may be reasonably required by such party in connection with,
among other things, any insurance claims by, Legal Proceedings or tax audits
against or governmental investigations of Seller or Purchaser or any of their
Affiliates or in order to enable Seller or Purchaser to comply with their
respective obligations under this Agreement and each other agreement,
document or instrument contemplated hereby. In the event Seller or Purchaser
wishes to destroy such records before or within two (2) years, such party
shall first give ninety (90) days prior written notice to the other and such
other party shall have the right at its option and expense, upon prior
written notice given to such party within such 90-day period, to take
possession of the records within one hundred and eighty (180) days after the
date of such notice.

 

 

8.7 Publicity. None of the parties hereto shall issue any press release
concerning this Agreement or the Transactions without obtaining the prior
written approval of the other party hereto, which approval will not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed, unless, in the sole judgment of Purchaser
or Seller, disclosure is otherwise required by applicable Law or by the
Bankruptcy Court with respect to filings to be made with the Bankruptcy Court
in connection with this Agreement, provided that the party intending to make
such release shall use its commercially reasonable efforts consistent with
such applicable Law or Bankruptcy Court requirement to consult with the other
party with respect to the text thereof.

 

 

8.8 Schedules.  Seller may, at its option, include in the Schedules items
that are not material in order to avoid any misunderstanding, and such
inclusion, or any references to dollar amounts, shall not be deemed to be an
acknowledgement or representation that such items are material, to establish
any standard of materiality or to define further the meaning of such terms
for purposes of this Agreement.  Information provided in one Schedule will
suffice, without repetition or cross reference, as a disclosure of such
information in any other Schedule to which its relevance is reasonably
apparent on its face.

 

 

8.9 Compliance with DIP Credit Agreement. Seller shall not take any action
not in compliance with any covenant or other agreements set forth in the DIP
Credit Agreement.

 

 

8.10 Motions, Orders, etc. Seller shall promptly provide Purchaser with the
proposed final drafts of all documents, motions, orders, or pleadings that
Seller hereafter proposes to file with the Bankruptcy Court which relate to
the approval of this Agreement, the Purchased Assets, the Assumed Contracts
or Assumed Leases or the consummation of the Transactions, or any provision
therein or herein, and shall provide Purchaser and its counsel with a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such documents, motions,
orders, or pleadings prior to filing with the Bankruptcy Court.


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

41  

 

 

 

 

 


 

8.11 [Intentionally omitted]

 

 

8.12 Post-Closing Name Changes. Promptly after Closing, Purchaser will change
its name to "Coast Crane Company" and will cause Seller's name to be changed
from "Coast Crane Company" to a name that does not incorporate any of the
Purchased Intellectual Property.

 

 

8.13 Bonuses and Commissions. During the Bankruptcy Case, Seller shall
continue to pay in full to employees of Seller all bonuses and commissions as
they become due and payable consistent with normal course past practices and
in conformity with any Seller plans applicable to such bonuses and
commissions.

 

 

8.14 Communications with Customers and Suppliers. Prior to the Closing,
Purchaser shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates and representatives not
to, contact, or engage in any discussions or otherwise communicate with, any
of the Business' customers, suppliers and others with whom it has material
commercial dealings without obtaining the prior consent of Seller (which will
not be unreasonably withheld but, if given, may be conditioned on Seller
having the right to designate an officer of Seller reasonably acceptable to
Purchaser, to participate in any meetings or discussions with any such
customers, suppliers or others).

 

 

8.15 Post-Closing Receipts. In the event that after the Closing Seller
receives any funds, checks, deposits or other amounts in respect of, related
to, or arising out of the Purchased Assets ("Post-Closing Receipts"), such
Post-Closing Receipts shall be held in trust for the benefit of Purchaser and
Seller shall promptly remit, pay or otherwise transfer all such Post-Closing
Receipts to Purchaser in the form received.   The Seller hereby designates
Purchaser as Seller's true and lawful attorney-in-fact, with full power of
substitution, to execute or endorse for the benefit of Buyer any checks,
notes or other documents received directly by Purchaser or remitted to
Purchaser by Seller as Post-Closing Receipts or transferred to Purchaser as
Purchased Assets in accordance with Section 2.1(b)(xxi), such power of
attorney being coupled with an interest and irrevocable.  Seller agrees to
execute and deliver to Purchaser from time to time any documents or
instruments reasonably requested by Purchaser to evidence such power of
attorney and to otherwise implement the foregoing.

ARTICLE IX

 

EMPLOYEES AND EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

 

 

9.1 Employees.   Prior to the Closing, Purchaser shall deliver, in writing,
an offer of employment (on an "at will" basis) to each of the Employees who
remain employed immediately prior to the Closing to commence immediately upon
the day following the Closing, subject to Purchaser's standard conditions for
new employees.  Such individuals who accept such offer by the Closing Date
are hereinafter referred to as the "Transferred Employees." Each offer to
each Seller employee provided by Purchaser will include compensation and
provide for a position with Seller identical to those provided to such
employee by Seller immediately prior to the Closing. Subject to applicable
Laws and for the avoidance of doubt, Purchaser shall have no obligation to
Seller with respect to changing the terms and conditions of all Transferred
Employees' employment at any time on and after the Closing Date.

forth therein, (ii) Seller will not be relieved from filing a Form W-2 with
respect to any Transferred Employees, and (iii) Purchaser will undertake to
file (or cause to be filed) a Form W-2 for each such Transferred Employee
only with respect to the portion of the year during which such Employees are
employed by Purchaser that includes the Closing Date, excluding the portion
of such year that such Employee was employed by Seller or its Subsidiaries.

 

 

9.3 Employee Benefits.

 

 

(a) Benefits. As soon as reasonably practicable following the Closing,
Purchaser shall provide the Transferred Employees with benefits under
employee benefit plans to be maintained by Purchaser, including without
limitation commission and bonus plans, a 401(k) plan and health benefits
("Purchaser Plans"), that are substantially similar to the benefit plans
maintained by Seller immediately prior to Closing except with respect to
commission and bonus plans which plans shall be consistent with Purchaser\'s
commission and bonus plans unless the terms of the commission and bonus plans
maintained by Seller are acceptable to Purchaser in its sole discretion.

 



 

(b) Accrued Vacation. Purchaser shall give full credit to each Transferred
Employee for all unused vacation time accrued as of the Closing Date.

 

 

(c) COBRA.  Purchaser shall sponsor and maintain a group health plan,
effective on or before the Closing Date, for the benefit of the Transferred
Employees and their dependents, and to provide for the continuation coverage
required to be made available under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget
Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended ("COBRA") as of the Closing Date for
Seller's "MandA qualified beneficiaries." Seller's MandA qualified beneficiaries
include all of the individual qualified beneficiaries as determined under
COBRA and the applicable regulations whose qualifying event occurred prior to
or in connection with the asset sale transaction contemplated by this
Agreement and who are, or whose respective qualifying events occurred in
connection with, covered employees under Seller's group health plan whose
last employment prior to the qualifying event was with Seller or any
Affiliate of Seller. Purchaser shall be exclusively responsible for providing
such COBRA coverage and Seller shall not have any obligation or liability to
provide rights under COBRA following the Closing Date for such MandA qualified
beneficiaries.

(d) Vesting of Seller Employee Benefit Plan Benefits. Effective as of the
Closing Date, Seller shall cause the tax-qualified 401(k) plan in which
Transferred Employees were eligible to participate immediately prior to the
Closing Date to fully vest such employees' accrued benefit through the
Closing Date thereunder. Seller shall take all such actions that are
reasonably necessary to facilitate such vesting and to terminate the plan.
Purchaser agrees to reasonably cooperate with Seller to facilitate such
vesting and termination of the plan, including providing personnel to Seller
to effectuate such vesting and termination.

 

 

9.4 Indemnification.  Seller shall indemnify and hold Purchaser and its
Affiliates harmless with respect to any Transferred Employee from (i) any
employment- related liability with respect to employment on or prior to the
Closing Date, (ii) any liability relating to, arising under or in connection
with any Employee Benefit Plan, including any liability under COBRA, whether
arising prior to, on or after the Closing Date and (iii) any liability under
the WARN Act.

 

 

9.5 No Obligations.  Other than as set forth in this Article 9,
nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed to require, or prevent
the termination of, employment of any individual, require minimum benefit
or compensation levels or prevent any change in the employee benefits
provided to any individual Transferred Employee. No provision of this
Agreement shall create any third party beneficiary rights in any employee or
former employee of Seller or any other persons or entities (including any
beneficiary or dependent thereof), in respect of continued employment (or
resumed employment) for any specified period of any nature or kind
whatsoever.

ARTICLE XI

 



 

TAXES

 

 

11.1 Transfer Taxes.  Seller shall timely file or caused to be filed all
necessary documents (including all Tax Returns) with respect to any sales,
use, stamp, documentary, filing, recording, transfer, real estate transfer,
stock transfer, gross receipts, registration, duty, securities transactions
or similar fees or taxes or governmental charges (together with any interest
or penalty, addition to tax or additional amount imposed) as levied by any
Taxing Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (collectively, "Transfer Taxes"). Purchaser shall pay to Seller
(which amount shall be allocated solely to the payment of Transfer Taxes to
the extent the Transfer Taxes have not previously been paid in full) within
two (2) Business Days following the Closing Date, the amount of the Transfer
Taxes assumed by Purchaser in accordance with Section 2.3(i).  Seller shall
have provided to the Agent for the First Lien Lenders and Purchaser a
schedule setting forth its determination of the amount of Transfer
Taxes payable in connection with the transfer of assets set forth in this
Agreement no later than ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing Date (the
"Transfer Tax Schedule"). Prior to the Closing, Purchaser shall have
obtained, and delivered to Seller copies of, all necessary resale permits
or certificates.

 

 

11.2 Prorations. All real property taxes, personal property taxes, or ad
valorem obligations and similar recurring taxes and fees ("Periodic Taxes")
that are due and payable with respect to the Purchased Assets for taxable
periods beginning before, and ending after, the Closing Date ("Straddle
Period"), shall be prorated between Purchaser and Seller as of 12:01 a.m.
pacific time on the Closing Date based on the number of days in the Straddle
Period that each party owned the Purchased Assets. Purchaser shall bear all
Periodic Taxes with respect to the Purchased Assets relating to any tax year
beginning after the Closing Date without regard to when such payments are in
fact due and payable. With respect to Periodic Taxes described in this
Section 11.2, Seller shall timely file all Tax Returns due before the Closing
Date with respect to such Taxes and Purchaser shall prepare and timely file
all Tax Returns due after the Closing Date with respect to such Taxes. If
one party remits to the appropriate Taxing Authority payment for Taxes, which
are subject to proration under this Section 11.2 and such payment includes
the other party's share of such Taxes, such other party shall promptly
reimburse the remitting party for its share of such Taxes.

 

 

11.3 Purchase Price Allocation. The Purchase Price and any amounts required
to be taken into account for income tax purposes shall be allocated among the
Purchased Assets in accordance with a schedule (the "Allocation Statement")
to be prepared by Purchaser and delivered to Seller at least five (5) days
prior to the Closing Date. With respect to assets that are subject to
Transfer Taxes, the Allocation Statement shall be consistent with
the Transfer Tax Schedule. Purchaser shall consider in good faith all
changes to the Allocation Statement reasonably requested by Seller. After
the Closing, the parties shall make consistent use of the allocation set
forth on the Allocation Statement for all tax purposes and in all
filings, declarations and reports with the IRS in respect thereof, including
the reports required to be filed under section 1060 of the Code. Purchaser
shall prepare and deliver IRS Form 8594 to Seller within twenty (20) days
following the Closing and both parties shall file such IRS Form 8594 with the
IRS.  Unless required by law, in any litigation or proceeding related to
the determination of any Tax, neither Purchaser nor Seller shall assert that
such allocation is not a correct allocation.

 

 

11.4 Cooperation and Audits. Purchaser and Seller shall cooperate fully with
each other regarding tax matters (including the execution of appropriate
powers of attorney) and shall make available to the other as reasonably
requested all information, records and documents relating to taxes governed
by this Agreement until the expiration of the applicable statute of
limitations or extension thereof or the conclusion of all audits, appeals or
litigation with respect to such taxes. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, Seller shall execute on or prior to the Closing Date a power of
attorney authorizing Purchaser to correspond, sign, collect, negotiate,
settle and administer all tax payments and Tax Returns.

ARTICLE XII

 



 

MISCELLANEOUS

 



 

12.1 No Survival of Representations and Warranties. The parties hereto agree
that the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement shall not
survive the Closing hereunder and no Person shall have any liability for any
breach thereof. The parties hereto agree that the covenants contained in
this Agreement to be performed at or after the Closing shall survive the
Closing hereunder, and each party hereto shall be liable to the other after
the Closing for any breach thereof.

 

 

12.2 Expenses.  Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, each of
Seller and Purchaser shall bear its own expenses incurred in connection with
the negotiation and execution of this Agreement and each other agreement,
document and instrument contemplated by this Agreement and the consummation
of the Transactions.  

 

 

12.3 Injunctive Relief; Limitation on Damages. Damages at law may be an
inadequate remedy for the breach of any of the covenants, promises or
agreements contained in this Agreement, and, accordingly, any party hereto
shall be entitled to injunctive relief with respect to any such breach,
including without limitation specific performance of such covenants, promises
or agreements or an order enjoining a party from any threatened, or from the
continuation of any actual, breach of the covenants, promises or agreements
contained in this Agreement. The rights set forth in this Section 12.3 shall
be in addition to any other rights which a party hereto may have at law or
in equity pursuant to this Agreement provided however that the parties agree
that as liquidated damages for the breach by Purchaser of this Agreement and
failure to consummate the Closing, Seller's sole damage remedy shall be the
forfeiture by Purchaser of the $7,500,000 cash deposit remitted by Purchaser
in connection herewith, which deposit, at Closing, shall be applied towards
the Cash Portion of the Purchase Price.

 

 

12.4 Submission to Jurisdiction; Consent to Service of Process.

 

 

(a) Without limiting any party's right to appeal any order of the Bankruptcy
Court, (i) the Bankruptcy Court shall retain exclusive jurisdiction to
enforce the terms of this Agreement and to decide any claims or disputes
which may arise or result from, or be connected with, this Agreement, any
breach or default hereunder, or the Transactions, and (ii) any and all
proceedings related to the foregoing shall be filed and maintained only in
the Bankruptcy Court, and the parties hereby consent to and submit to the
jurisdiction and venue of the Bankruptcy Court and shall receive notices at
such locations as indicated in Section 12.8 hereof; provided, however, that
if the Bankruptcy Case has closed, the parties agree to unconditionally and
irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States
District Court for the Western District of Washington and any appellate court
thereof, for the resolution of any such claim or dispute. The parties hereby
irrevocably waive, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any
objection which they may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any
such dispute brought in such court or any defense of inconvenient forum for
the maintenance of such dispute. Each of the parties hereto agrees that a
judgment in any such dispute may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit
on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law.


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

48  

 

 

 

 

 


 

(b) Each of the parties hereto hereby consents to process being served by any
party to this Agreement in any suit, action or proceeding by delivery of a
copy thereof in accordance with the provisions of Section 12.8.

 

 

12.5 Waiver of Right to Trial by Jury. Each party to this Agreement waives
any right to trial by jury in any action, matter or proceeding regarding this
Agreement or any provision hereof.

 

 

12.6 Entire Agreement; Amendments and Waivers. This Agreement (including the
schedules and exhibits hereto) collectively represent the entire
understanding and agreement between the parties hereto with respect to the
subject matter hereof. This Agreement can be amended, supplemented or
changed, and any provision hereof can be waived, only by written instrument
making specific reference to this Agreement signed by the party against whom
enforcement of any such amendment, supplement, modification or waiver is
sought. No action taken pursuant to this Agreement, including without
limitation, any investigation by or on behalf of any party, shall be deemed
to constitute a waiver by the party taking such action of compliance with any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained herein. The waiver
by any party hereto of a breach of any provision of this Agreement shall not
operate or be construed as a further or continuing waiver of such breach or
as a waiver of any other or subsequent breach. No failure on the part of any
party to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right, power or remedy
hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial
exercise of such right, power or remedy by such party preclude any other or
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or remedy.
All remedies hereunder are cumulative and are not exclusive of any other
remedies provided by law.

 

 

12.7 Governing Law.  This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware applicable to contracts
made and performed in such State.

 

 

12.8 Notices. All notices and other communications under this Agreement shall
be in writing and shall be deemed given (i) when delivered personally by

12.9 Severability.  If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced by any law or public policy,
all other terms or provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in
full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the
Transactions is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party.
Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal,
or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good
faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the
parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the
Transactions are consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest
extent possible.

 

 

12.10 Assignment.  This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the
benefit of the parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns.
Nothing in this Agreement shall create or be deemed to create any third party
beneficiary rights in any Person or entity not a party to this Agreement. No
assignment of this Agreement or of any rights or obligations hereunder may be
made by either Seller or Purchaser (by operation of law or otherwise) without
the prior written consent of the other parties hereto and any attempted
assignment without the required consents shall be void; provided
that Purchaser may assign some or all of its rights and obligations hereunder
to one or more subsidiaries formed by it prior to the Closing and/or, upon
notice to Seller, to one or more Persons that Purchaser determines, in its
sole discretion, to partner with in connection with the Transactions.
No assignment of any obligations hereunder shall relieve the parties hereto
of any such obligations. Upon any such permitted assignment, the references
in this Agreement to Seller or Purchaser shall also apply to any such
assignee unless the context otherwise requires.

12.11 General Release.

 

 

(a) Effective upon the Closing Date, Seller, on behalf of itself, and any
Person claiming by, through, under, derivatively for, as agent for or on
behalf of such Seller (collectively, the "Seller Group"), acknowledges that
it has no claim, counterclaim, setoff, recoupment, action or cause of action
of any kind or nature whatsoever (including, for the avoidance of doubt,
actions for avoidance, subordination or recharacterization of any
of Purchaser's pre-Petition Date Claims, Interests and Encumbrances and Liens
in respect of Seller) against (1) Purchaser, (2) any of its directors,
officers, control persons (as defined in Section 15 of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1933, as amended, or Section 20 of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1933, as amended), members, employees, agents, attorneys, financial
advisors, legal representatives, shareholders, partners, successors and
assigns solely in their capacity as such, and (3) any of its directors,
officers, control persons, members or employees in their capacity as a member
on, or arising from their involvement with the activities of, the Board of
Directors of Seller (including pursuant to board observer rights), (Purchaser
and all Persons referenced in clauses (1), (2) and (3) are collectively
referred to as the "Purchaser Group"), that directly or indirectly arise out
of, are based upon, or in any manner connected with any Prior Event (as
defined below) (collectively, "Released Claims"); and, should any Released
Claims nonetheless exist, Seller on behalf of itself and all the other
members of the Seller Group hereby (i) releases and discharges each member of
the Purchaser Group from any liability whatsoever on such Released Claims
that directly or indirectly arise out of, are based upon, or in any manner
connected with a Prior Event, and (ii) releases, remises, waives
and discharges all such Released Claims against any member of the
Purchaser Group. As used herein the term "Prior Event" means any
transaction, event, circumstances, action, failure to act or occurrence
of any sort or type, including without limitation any approval or acceptance
given or denied, whether known or unknown, which occurred, existed, was
taken, permitted or begun prior to the consummation of the Transactions
contemplated hereunder. For the avoidance of doubt, "Prior Event" shall not
include any rights of Seller set forth in this Agreement or the rights
set forth in any other agreement to be entered into on or after the Closing
Date in contemplation of the sale of assets to Purchaser set forth herein.

 

 

(b) Without limiting in any way the scope of the release contained in
subparagraph (a) immediately above and effective upon the Closing Date,
Seller, to the fullest extent allowed under applicable law, hereby waives and
relinquishes for themselves and the other members of the Seller Group, all
statutory and common law protections purporting to limit the scope or effect
of a general release, whether due to lack of knowledge of any claim or
otherwise, including, waiving and relinquishing the terms of any law, like
section 1542 of the California Civil Code, which provides that a release may
not apply to material unknown claims. Seller hereby affirms its intent to
waive and relinquish such unknown Claims and to waive and relinquish any
statutory or common law protection available in any applicable jurisdiction
with respect thereto.

 

 

12.12 Counterparts; Facsimile Signatures. This Agreement may be executed in
one or more counterparts and by facsimile, each of which will be deemed to be
an original copy of this Agreement and all of which, when taken together,
will be deemed to constitute one and the same agreement.

A. The Court has jurisdiction over the Sale Motion pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§
157 and 1334, and this matter is a core proceeding pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §
157(b)(2)(A), (M), (N) and (O). Venue of this case and the Sale Motion in
this district is proper under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1408 and 1409.

 

 

B. The statutory predicates for the relief sought in the Sale Motion are 11
U.S.C. §§ 105(a), 363(b), (f), (m), and (n) and 365, and Fed. R. Bankr. P.
2002, 6004, 6006, and 9014.

 

 

C. As evidenced by the affidavits of service previously filed with the Court,
the Debtor provided proper, timely, adequate and sufficient notice of the
Sale Motion, the Sale Hearing, the transactions contemplated under the
Purchase Agreement, including, without limitation, the Sale and the
assumption and assignment of the Assumed Executory Contracts and Leases in
accordance with 11 U.S.C. §§ 102(l), 363 and 365 and Fed. R. Bankr. P. 2002,
6004 (collectively, the "Transactions"), and to: (i) the Office of the
United States Trustee; (ii) counsel for the Coast Crane Acquisition
Corporation and counsel for the Buyer; (iii) counsel for the Creditors\'
Committee; (iv) all entities known to have asserted any interests in or upon
the Purchased Assets; (v) all federal, state, and local regulatory or taxing
authorities or recording offices which have a reasonably known interest in
the relief requested by the Sale Motion, (vi) all parties to
Assumed Executory Contracts and Leases; (vii) the United States Attorney\'s
office; (viii) the Internal Revenue Service; and (ix) the official service
list in this case. Such notice was good and sufficient, and afforded parties
sent notice a reasonable opportunity to object or be heard with respect to
the matters that are the subject of this Order, and no other or further
notice of the Sale Motion, the Sale Hearing or any of the Transactions is or
shall be required.

D. The Debtor marketed the Purchased Assets and conducted the sale process
in compliance with applicable law and rules.

 

 

E. The Debtor (i) has full corporate power and authority to execute the
Purchase Agreement and all other documents contemplated thereby, and the sale
of the Purchased Assets and assumption and assignment of the Assumed
Executory Contracts and Leases by the Debtor have been duly and validly
authorized by all necessary corporate action of the Debtor, (ii) has all of
the corporate power and authority necessary to consummate the Transactions,
(iii) has taken all corporate action necessary to authorize and approve the
Purchase Agreement and the consummation by the Debtor of the Transactions,
and (iv) requires no consents or approvals, other than those expressly
provided for in the Purchase Agreement, in order to consummate such
Transactions.

 

 

F. Approval of the Purchase Agreement and consummation of the Transactions at
this time are in the best interests of the Debtor, its creditors, its estate,
and other parties in interest.

 

 

G. The Debtor has demonstrated both (i) good, sufficient, and sound business
purpose and justification, and (ii) compelling circumstances for the
Transactions pursuant to 11 U.S.C. § 363(b) prior to, and outside of, a plan
of reorganization in that, among other things:

 

 

(1) The Debtor is experiencing liquidity problems that result in it being
unable to fund its operations in the near future;

 

 

(2) There is an immediate and significant risk to the value of the
Debtor's business;

 

 

(3) Such liquidity problems and other operational challenges have caused the
Debtor hardship;

 

 

(4) Given these circumstances, the Buyer is only willing to proceed to
acquire the Debtor's Business if the Transactions can be consummated quickly
and without excessive or onerous liabilities;

(5) The Debtor has diligently and in good faith marketed the Purchased Assets
to secure the highest and best offer therefor. An auction for the
Purchased Assets was held on November 8, 2010 pursuant to the Court's October
12, 2010 Order, Inter Alia, (i) Scheduling a Hearing to Approve the Asset
Purchase Agreement with Coast Ranier Acquisition Company for Sale of the
Debtor's Assets Free and Clear of Liens; (ii) Approving the Form and Manner
of Notice; (iii) Approving Expense Reimbursement; (iv) Approving Bidding
Procedures; and (v) Approving Procedures for Assumption and Assignment of
Executory Contracts (the "Bid Procedures Order").

 

 

(6) The Buyer's bid, pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth in the
Purchase Agreement represents a fair and reasonable purchase price and
constitutes the highest and best offer obtainable for the Purchased Assets.

 

 

H. A sale of the Purchased Assets at this time to the Buyer pursuant to 11
U.S.C. § 363(b) is the best alternative to (i) preserve the enterprise value
of the Purchased Assets, (ii) provide employment for the Debtor's employees,
and (iii) maximize the value of the Debtor's estate for the benefit of
all constituencies. Delaying the sale undoubtedly will result in a loss of
value of the Purchased Assets.

 

 

I. The Purchase Agreement was negotiated and proposed at arms'-length without
collusion or fraud, and in good faith within the meaning of Section 363(m) of
the Bankruptcy Code. The Auction was conducted at arms' length and in good
faith within the meaning of Section 363(m) of the Bankruptcy Code.

 

 

J. The Buyer is a good faith purchaser under Section 363(m) of the Bankruptcy
Code and, as such, is entitled to all of the protections afforded thereby.

 

 

K. The consideration provided by the Buyer for the Purchased Assets pursuant
to the Purchase Agreement (i) is fair and reasonable, (ii) is the highest and
best offer for the Purchased Assets determined following the Auction, (iii)
will provide a greater recovery for the Debtor\'s creditors than would be
provided by any other practical available alternative, and (iv) constitutes
reasonably equivalent value and fair consideration under the Bankruptcy Code
and under the laws of the United States, any state, territory, possession, or
the District of Columbia.

L. The transfer of the Purchased Assets to the Buyer will be a legal, valid,
and effective transfer of the Purchased Assets, will vest the Buyer with all
right, title, and interest of the Debtor to the Purchased Assets free and
clear to the fullest extent permitted under the Bankruptcy Code or other
applicable law of all Interests in such property of any Person or entity,
including, without limitation, all Interests of any kind or nature whatsoever
arising under or out of, or in connection with, or in any way relating to the
operation of the Business prior to the Closing or any acts of Debtor.

 

 

M. The Buyer would not have entered into the Purchase Agreement and would
not consummate the Transactions, thus adversely affecting the Debtor, its
estate, and its creditors, if the sale of the Purchased Assets to the Buyer
and the assignment of the Assumed Executory Contracts to the Buyer was not
free and clear of all Interests, or if the Buyer would, or in the future
could, be liable for any of such Interests.

 

 

N. The Debtor may sell the Purchased Assets free and clear of all Interests
because, in each case, one or more of the prerequisites set forth in 11
U.S.C. § 363(f)(1)-(5) has been satisfied. The Senior Lenders, who hold
first priority liens and security interests in the Purchased Assets and the
Debtor's secured lender (the "Junior Lender") under that certain Term Loan
and Security Agreement, dated May 18,2007 (as amended, restated,
supplemented, refunded, refinanced, or otherwise modified or replaced from
time to time, the "Junior Lender Term Loan Agreement") who holds second
priority liens and security interests in the Purchased Assets, consent to the
Transactions and to the Sale Motion, thereby satisfying the condition set
forth in 11 U.S.C. § 363(f)(2).

O. Those holders of Interests who did not object, or who withdrew their
objections, to the Transactions or the Sale Motion are deemed to have
consented pursuant to 11 U.S.C. § 363(f)(2). Other holders of Interests who
objected to the Sale Motion fall within one or more of the other subsections
of 11 U.S.C. § 363(f) and are adequately protected by having their Interests,
if any, attach to the cash proceeds of the Sale attributable to the property
against or in which they assert an Interest, in the same order of priority
that existed prior to the Closing and subject to all objections,
counterclaims, recoupments and other defenses of the Debtor's estate.

 

 

P. The (i) transfer of the Purchased Assets to the Buyer and (ii) assumption
and assignment to the Buyer of the Assumed Executory Contracts and the
assumption of the Assumed Liabilities expressly stated in the Purchase
Agreement, will not subject the Buyer to any liability with respect to the
operation of the Debtor's business that accrued or arose prior to the Closing
or by reason of such transfer under the laws of the United States, any state,
territory, or possession thereof, or the District of Columbia, based, in
whole or in part, directly or indirectly, on any theory of law or equity,
including, without limitation, any theory of equitable law (including any
theory of antitrust or successor or transferee liability).

 

 

Q. The Debtor has demonstrated that it is an exercise of its sound business
judgment to assume and assign the Assumed Executory Contracts and Leases to
the Buyer in connection with the consummation of the Transactions, and the
assumption and assignment of the Assumed Executory Contracts and Leases is in
the best interests of the Debtor, its estate, and its creditors. The Assumed
Executory Contracts and Leases being assigned to, and any related Assumed
Liabilities being assumed by, the Buyer are an integral part of the Business
being purchased by the Buyer and, accordingly, such assumption and assignment
of Assumed Executory Contracts and Leases and Assumed Liabilities are
reasonable, enhance the value of the Debtor's estate, and do not constitute
unfair discrimination. Except for Assumed Executory Contracts and Leases
in which the non-debtor party waived any existing defaults in connection with
the assumption and assignment to Buyer thereof, the Debtor has (i) cured, or
has provided adequate assurance of cure, of any default existing prior to the
date hereof under any of the Assumed Executory Contracts, within the meaning
of 11 U.S.C. § 365(b)(1)(A), and (ii) provided compensation or adequate
assurance of compensation to any party for any actual pecuniary loss to such
party resulting from a default prior to the date hereof under any of the
Assumed Executory Contracts, with the meaning of 11 U.S.C. § 365(b)(1)(B),
and the Buyer has provided adequate assurance of the future performance of
and under the Assumed Executory Contracts, within the meaning of 11 U.S.C. §
365(b)(1)(C).

R. The Transactions do not constitute a sub rosa Chapter 11 plan for which
approval has been sought without the protections that a disclosure statement
would afford. The Transactions neither impermissibly restructure the rights
of Debtor's creditors nor impermissibly dictate a liquidating plan of
reorganization for the Debtor.

 

 

S. There was no evidence of insider influence or improper conduct by the
Buyer or its affiliates in connection with the negotiation of the Purchase
Agreement with the Debtor. There also was no evidence of fraud or collusion
among the Buyer, its affiliates or any other bidder for the Debtors' assets,
or collusion between the Debtor and the Buyer or its affiliates to the
detriment of any other bidders.

 

 

T. Immediately prior to the entry of this Order, the Buyer was not an
"insider" or "affiliate" of the Debtor, as those terms are defined in the
Bankruptcy Code, and no common identity of incorporators, directors or
stockholders existed between the Buyer and the Debtor. Pursuant to the
Purchase Agreement, Buyer is not purchasing all of the Debtor's assets in
that the Buyer is not purchasing any of the Excluded Assets, and the Buyer is
not holding itself out to the public as a continuation of the Debtor. Those
of the Debtor's employees who are to be employed by the Buyer pursuant to the
Purchase Agreement are being hired under new employment contracts or other
arrangements to be entered into or to become effective at the time of the
Closing.

 

 

NOW THEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED THAT:

7. Except as expressly permitted or otherwise specifically provided by the Purchase Agreement or this Order, all Persons and other entities holding Interests against or in the Debtor or the Purchased Assets, including but not limited to, all debt security holders, equity security holders, governmental, tax, and regulatory authorities, lenders, trade and other unsecured creditors (whether legal or equitable, secured or unsecured, matured or unmatured, contingent or non-contingent, senior or subordinated), arising under or out of, in connection with, or in any way relating to, the Debtor, the Purchased Assets, the operation of the Debtor\'s business prior to the Closing, or the transfer of the Purchased Assets to the Buyer, hereby are forever barred, estopped, and permanently enjoined from asserting against the Buyer, its successors or assigns, its property or interests or the Purchased Assets, such Persons' or other entities' Interests.

 

 

8. The sale of the Purchased Assets by Debtor to Buyer (A) is a legal, valid and effective transfer of the Purchased Assets; (B) vests Buyer with all right, title and interest of such Debtor to the Purchased Assets free and clear of all Interests pursuant to Section 363(f) of the Bankruptcy Code (other than Liens created by Buyer); and (C) constitutes a transfer for reasonably equivalent value and fair consideration under the Bankruptcy Code and the laws of the state in which Debtor is incorporated and any other applicable non-bankruptcy laws.

 

 

Assumption and Assignment to Buyer of Assumed Executory Contracts and Leases

 

 

9. Pursuant to 11 U.S.C. §§ 105(a) and 365, and subject to and conditioned upon the Closing of the Sale, the Debtor\'s assumption and assignment to the Buyer of the Assumed Executory Contracts and Leases is hereby approved, and the requirements of 11 U.S.C. § 365(b)(1) with respect thereto are hereby deemed satisfied.

11. All defaults or other obligations of the Debtor under the Assumed Executory Contracts and Leases arising or accruing prior to the Closing Date (without giving effect to any acceleration clauses or any default provisions of the kind specified in 11 U.S.C. § 365(b)(2)) shall be cured, paid, satisfied or otherwise discharged as follows: (a) if such Assumed Executory Contract constitutes an Initial Assumed Executory Contract, by the Debtor by the Cure Costs Deadline applicable to such Assumed Executory Contract; and (b) if such Assumed Executory Contract is an Additional Designated Executed Contract, subject to Section 2.5 of the Purchase Agreement, by the Debtor by the Cure Costs Deadline applicable to such Additional Designated Executory Contract. In each instance, the Buyer shall have no liability or obligation in connection with any Assumed Executory Contract accruing or arising prior to the Closing Date, except as otherwise expressly provided in the Purchase Agreement.

 

 

12. Each non-Debtor party to an Assumed Executory Contract and Lease hereby is forever barred, estopped, and permanently enjoined from asserting against the Buyer, or the property of the Buyer, any default existing as of the Closing Date, or any counterclaim, defense, setoff or any other claim asserted or assertable against the Debtor in connection with such Assumed Executory Contract and Lease. Each non-Debtor party to an Assumed Executory Contract and Lease that is an Additional Designated Executory Contract hereby is forever barred, estopped, and permanently enjoined from asserting against the Buyer, or the property of the Buyer, any default existing as of the Closing Date, or any counterclaim, defense, setoff or any other claim asserted or assertable against the Debtor in connection with such Additional Designated Executory Contract. Upon payment, satisfaction or other discharge by Buyer of the allowed expenses of administration that have accrued during the Post-Closing Determination Period in connection with an Assumed Executory Contract and Lease that is an Additional Designated Executory Contract, each non-Debtor party to such Assumed Executory Contract and Lease hereby is forever barred, estopped, and permanently enjoined from asserting against the Buyer, or the property of the Buyer, any default existing as of the last day of the Post-Closing Determination Period, or any counterclaim, defense, setoff or any other claim asserted or assertable against the Debtor during such period in connection with such Assumed Executory Contract and Lease. The Debtor shall have no liability for any obligations or indebtedness that may accrue under any Additional Designated Executory Contract during the Post-Closing Determination Period, except for any obligations or indebtedness arising by as a result of the Debtor's willful misconduct or gross negligence.

14.

15. The Buyer\'s right to designate Additional Designated Executory Contracts pursuant to Section 2.5(b) of the Purchase Agreement is hereby preserved.

Such amounts shall be paid first in priority to the Buyer from the proceeds of any sale or other transaction involving the Purchased Assets, whether such sale or other transaction is implemented pursuant to 11 U.S.C. § 363 or through any plan of reorganization or liquidation filed in this bankruptcy case. No liens or security interests shall attach to such amounts.

21. Each and every federal, state, and local governmental agency or department is hereby directed to accept any and all documents and instruments necessary and appropriate to consummate the Transactions.

 

 

22. If any Person that has filed financing statements, mortgages, mechanic\'s liens, lis pendens, or other documents or agreements evidencing an Interest in the Debtor or the Purchased Assets shall not have delivered to the Debtor prior to Closing, in proper form for filing and executed by the appropriate parties, termination statements, instruments of satisfaction, releases of such Interest which such Person has or may hold with respect to the Debtor or the Purchased Assets or otherwise, then (a) the Debtor is hereby authorized and directed to execute and file such statements, instruments, releases and other documents on behalf of such Person with respect to the Purchased Assets, and (b) the Buyer is hereby authorized to file, register, or otherwise record a certified copy of this Order, which, once filed, registered, or otherwise recorded, shall constitute conclusive evidence of the release of all Interests in the Purchased Assets of any kind or nature whatsoever.

The Buyer shall not be liable or responsible for any liability or other obligation of the Debtor arising under or related to the Purchased Assets, except as expressly stated in the Purchase Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and except as otherwise specifically provided herein or in the Purchase Agreement, the Buyer shall not be liable for any Claims against the Debtor or any of its predecessors or affiliates, or as the transferee of the Purchased Assets, and the Buyer shall have no successor or vicarious liabilities of any kind or character whether known or unknown as of the Closing, now existing or hereafter arising or accruing, whether fixed or contingent, with respect to the Debtor or any obligations of the Debtor arising prior to the Closing, including, without limitation, liabilities resulting from or relating to (i) errors or omissions claims, or (ii) Taxes, in either case, arising, accruing, or payable under, out of, in connection with, or in any way relating to the operation of the Business or the sale of the Purchased Assets.

25. Under no circumstances shall the Buyer be deemed a successor of or to the Debtor for any Interest against or in the Debtor or the Purchased Assets of any kind or nature whatsoever. The sale, transfer, assignment and delivery of the Purchased Assets shall not be subject to any Interests, and Interests of any kind or nature whatsoever shall remain with, and continue to be obligations of, the Debtor. All Persons hereby are forever barred, estopped, and permanently enjoined from asserting, prosecuting, or otherwise pursuing any action against the Buyer, any Affiliate of the Buyer or any successor or assign of the Buyer or such Affiliate, the Purchased Assets, or any other property of the Buyer or any Affiliate of the Buyer or any successor or assign of the Buyer or such Affiliate, in each case with respect to any Interest such Person had, has, or may have against or in the Debtor, its estate, officers, directors, shareholders, or the Purchased Assets (as such Purchased Assets existed prior to the Closing). Following the Closing, no holder of any Interest against the Debtor or the Purchased Assets (as such Purchased Assets existed prior to the Closing) shall interfere with the title to, or use and enjoyment of, the Purchased Assets based on or related to such Interest, or based upon actions taken or omissions that occurred in the Debtor's Chapter 11 case.

 

 

26. This Court retains exclusive jurisdiction to (i) interpret, enforce, implement and resolve any disputes arising under or in connection with the terms and provisions of the Purchase Agreement, all amendments thereto, any waivers and consents thereunder, and any agreements executed in connection therewith, the Bidding Procedures Order and this Order, (ii) compel delivery of the Purchased Assets to the Buyer and (iii) protect the Buyer against (a) any liabilities relating to or in connection with the Debtor or the Purchased Assets that do not constitute Assumed Liabilities, or (b) any Interests in the Debtor or the Purchased Assets; provided, however, that in the event that the Bankruptcy Court abstains from exercising or declines to exercise jurisdiction with respect to any matter provided for in this clause or is without jurisdiction, such abstention, refusal or lack of jurisdiction shall have no effect upon and shall not control, prohibit or limit the exercise of jurisdiction of any other court having competent jurisdiction with respect to any such matter.

27. Nothing contained in any order entered in this bankruptcy case subsequent to the entry of this Order, nor in any plan of reorganization (or liquidation) confirmed in this case (or any other case involving the Debtor) or order of this Court confirming such plan shall conflict with or derogate from the provisions of the Purchase Agreement or the terms of this Order. To the extent that there is such a conflict, the Purchase Agreement and this Order control. Furthermore, to the extent that there is any conflict between the terms of the Purchase Agreement and this Order, the Purchase Agreement controls.

 

 

28. Effective upon the Closing Date, this Order shall constitute a general release by the Debtor and its estate of the Purchaser Group (as defined in the Purchase Agreement), to the extent set forth in the Purchase Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, upon and following the Closing Date, the Buyer shall not be deemed to (a) be the successor of the Debtor, (b) have, de facto or otherwise, merged with or into the Debtor, or (c) be a mere continuation or substantial continuation of the Debtor or the enterprise of the Debtor. Nothing in this paragraph shall be deemed to effect a release of the Purchaser Group with respect to Buyer's obligations under the Purchase Agreement.

 

 

29. The transfer of the Purchased Assets pursuant to the Purchase Agreement shall not subject the Buyer to any liability with respect to the operation of the business prior to the Closing Date or by reason of such transfer under the laws of the United States, any state, territory, or possession thereof, or the District of Columbia, based, in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, on any theory of law or equity, including, without limitation, any theory of equitable subordination or successor or transferee liability.

30. The reversal or modification on appeal of the authorization provided herein to consummate the Transactions shall not affect the validity of the Transactions, including, without limitation, the Sale to the Buyer or the assumption and assignment to the Buyer of the Assumed Executory Contracts and Leases, unless such authorization is duly stayed pending such appeal.

 

 

31. The terms and provisions of the Purchase Agreement and this Order shall be binding in all respects upon, and shall inure to the benefit of, the Debtor, its estate, and its creditors and interest holders, the Buyer, and its affiliates, successors and assigns, and any affected third parties including, but not limited to, all non-Debtor parties to Assumed Executory Contracts and Leases, all Persons asserting Interests in the Purchased Assets, and any trustees, examiners, "responsible persons" or other fiduciaries appointed in the Debtor's bankruptcy case or under any chapter of the Bankruptcy Code. The Purchase Agreement shall not be subject to rejection or avoidance under any circumstance.

 

 

32. Neither the Purchase Agreement, nor the consummation of the Transactions contemplated thereby, directly or indirectly (with or without notice or lapse of time) (a) contravenes, conflicts with or results in a violation of, or gives any Governmental Authority or other Person or entity the right to challenge the Transactions or to exercise any remedy or obtain any relief under, any federal, state, county or local law, statute, rule, regulation, ordinance, code or any decree, ruling, order, writ, injunction, award or judgment of any Governmental Authority applicable to the Debtor or with respect to which any of the Purchased Assets is subject, or (b) shall result in the imposition or creation of any Interest or other rights of a third party upon or with respect to any or all of the Purchased Assets.

 

 

33. Neither the Debtor nor the Buyer is required to make any filing with or give any notice to, or to obtain any approval, consent, ratification, permission, waiver or authorization from, any Person or any Governmental Authority in connection with the execution and delivery of the Purchase Agreement or the consummation of the Transactions (other than with respect to governmental licenses which do not constitute Purchased Assets), and the Debtor does not need to seek or obtain shareholder consent to consummate the Transactions.

34. The failure specifically to include any particular provisions of the Purchase Agreement in this Order shall not diminish or impair the effectiveness of such provision, it being the intent of the Court that the Purchase Agreement be authorized and approved in its entirety.
