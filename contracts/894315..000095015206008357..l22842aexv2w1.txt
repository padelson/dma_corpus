69    - iii -    AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER   THIS AGREEMENT AND
PLAN OF MERGER (this "Agreement"), dated as of October 20, 2006, is by and
among Inland Retail Real Estate Trust, Inc., a Maryland corporation (the

H:   WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Company Board"),
on the recommendation of a sub committee of the Company Board (the
"Sub Committee"), has unanimously determined that the merger of the Company
with and into Merger Sub (the "Merger") is advisable and fair to, and in the
best interests of, the Company and the holders of the common stock of the
Company, par value $.01 per share (the "Company Common Stock");   WHEREAS,
the Board of Directors of Parent has unanimously determined that the Merger
and this Agreement are advisable and fair to, and in the best interests of,
Parent and the holders of common shares of the Parent, par value $0.01 per
share ("Parent Common Shares");   WHEREAS, Parent, as the sole member of
Merger Sub, has determined that the Merger and this Agreement are advisable
and fair to, and in the best interests of, Merger Sub and Parent as its sole
member;   WHEREAS, each of the Board of Directors of Parent and the Company
Board have approved this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement on the terms and conditions contained in this
Agreement;   WHEREAS, Parent, as the sole member of Merger Sub, has approved
this Agreement, the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement pursuant to action taken by unanimous written consent in accordance
with the requirements of the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act (the
"DLLC Act") and the certificate of formation and limited liability company
agreement of Merger Sub; and   WHEREAS, Parent, the Company and Merger Sub
intend that for U.S. federal and applicable state income tax purposes the

defined), and the assumption of the Company\'s liabilities, followed by a
liquidating distribution of such Merger Consideration to the holders of the
Company Common Stock pursuant to Section 331 and Section 562 of the Code.  
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements herein contained, and
for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of
which is hereby acknowledged, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the
parties hereto hereby agree as follows:     ARTICLE I   THE MERGER  
Section 1.1 THE MERGER. At the Effective Time (as hereinafter defined)
and upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement and in
accordance with the Maryland General Corporation Law (the "MGCL") and the
DLLC Act, the Company shall be merged with and into Merger Sub. Following the
Merger, the separate corporate existence of the Company shall cease and
Merger Sub shall continue as the surviving entity (the "Surviving Entity")
and as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. The limited liability company
existence of Merger Sub, with all its purposes, rights, privileges,
franchises, powers and objects, shall continue unaffected and unimpaired by
the Merger and, as the Surviving Entity, it shall be governed by the laws of
the State of Delaware.   Section 1.2 EFFECTIVE TIME. Subject to the
provisions of this Agreement, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall cause
the Merger to be consummated by filing such articles and certificate of
merger or other appropriate documents (in any such case, the "Articles of
Merger") with the State Department of Assessments and Taxation of Maryland
and the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, as applicable, in such
form as required by, and executed in accordance with, the relevant provisions
of the MGCL and the DLLC Act and shall make all other filings, recordings or
publications required by the MGCL and the DLLC Act in connection with the
Merger. The Merger shall become effective at the time specified in the
Articles of Merger (the time the Merger becomes effective being the
"Effective Time").   Section 1.3 CLOSING OF THE MERGER. Unless this
Agreement shall have been terminated by either Parent or the Company pursuant
to the provisions of Section 8.1, the closing of the Merger (the "Closing")
will take place (a) at 10:00 a.m., Chicago time, as soon as practicable, but
in no event later than the second Business Day after satisfaction or waiver
of all of the conditions set forth in Article VII (other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the fulfillment or waiver of those conditions), at the offices of
Duane Morris LLP Chicago, Illinois; or (b) at such other time, date or place
as agreed to in writing by the parties hereto (such date and time on and at
which the Closing occurs being referred to herein as the "Closing Date"). At
the Closing, the documents, certificates, opinions and instruments referred
to in Article VII shall be executed and delivered to the applicable
party.   Section 1.4 EFFECTS OF THE MERGER. The Merger shall have the
effects set forth in the MGCL and the DLLC Act. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all
the properties, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and
Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Entity, and all debts, liabilities,
duties and obligations of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts,
liabilities, duties and obligations of the Surviving Entity.   Section 1.5
LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY AGREEMENT. The limited liability company agreement
of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be
the limited liability company agreement of Surviving Entity until thereafter
amended as provided therein or by law (the "LLC Agreement").   - 2 -   
Section 1.6 MEMBERS AND OFFICERS OF SURVIVING ENTITY.   (a) Parent, the sole
member of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the
sole member of the Surviving Entity, and the officers of Merger Sub, if any,
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial officers of
Surviving Entity, each to hold office in accordance with the terms of the LLC
Agreement.   (b) Each of the current directors and officers of the Company
shall resign from such positions and any other position that each such
director or officer may hold in any of the Company\'s subsidiaries, such
resignation to be effective as of and upon the Effective Time.   ARTICLE
II   MERGER CONSIDERATION; CONVERSION OF STOCK;  EFFECTS ON MERGER SUB
INTERESTS   Section 2.1 CONVERSION OF COMPANY CAPITAL STOCK; EFFECTS OF
MERGER ON MERGER SUB INTERESTS. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of any holder thereof:   (a)
Subject to this Article II, each share of Company Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares to be
canceled in accordance with Section 2.1(c) but including restricted shares
granted pursuant to the Company Option Plans (as hereinafter defined)) shall
automatically be converted into, and shall be cancelled in exchange for, the
right to receive the Merger Consideration. The "Merger Consideration"
means the Cash Consideration, together with, if applicable, the Stock
Consideration (as hereinafter defined). The "Cash Consideration" means an
amount in cash, without interest, equal to the sum of (i) $14.00 and (ii)
$0.069167 multiplied by the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the number of
days between (I) the last day of the last month for which full monthly
dividends on the Company Common Stock have been declared and paid and (II)
the Closing Date (including the Closing Date), by (y) the total number of
days in the month during which the Closing Date occurs, without interest,
subject to adjustment as provided in Section 2.10 and Section 6.10.   (b)
All shares of Company Common Stock converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1(a) shall cease to be outstanding
and shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder
of a certificate that immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented such shares of Company Common Stock (a "Certificate") shall
thereafter cease to have any rights with respect to such shares of Company
Common Stock, except the right to receive (i) the Merger Consideration, (ii)
any cash in lieu of fractional Parent Common Shares, if any, to be issued or
paid in consideration therefor upon surrender of such Certificate in
accordance with Section 2.4(b), (iii) with respect to the Stock
Consideration, if any, any dividends or distributions in accordance with
Section 2.5 and (iv) any unpaid dividend declared by the Company in respect
of Company Common Stock in accordance with Section 6.10, in each case without
interest.   - 3 -    (c) Each share of Company Common Stock held in
treasury and not outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
canceled and retired and cease to exist and no payment or distribution shall
be made with respect thereto.   (d) Each limited liability company interest
in Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall remain as issued and outstanding limited liability company interest of
the Surviving Entity.   Section 2.2 EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES.   (a) Prior
to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate KeyCorp or another agent
reasonably acceptable to Parent and the Company to act as agent (the "Paying
Agent") for the payment of the Merger Consideration. At or prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall deliver to the Paying Agent (i) certificates (or
have entered by way of book-entry) representing Parent Common
Shares sufficient to deliver the aggregate Stock Consideration, if any, (ii)
cash sufficient to deliver the Cash Consideration payable to holders of
Certificates, (iii) cash in respect of the Company Warrant Consideration
payable to holders of Company Warrants who have executed Warrant Cash Out
Agreements at or prior to the Effective Time, and (iv) an estimated amount of
cash in lieu of fractional shares, if any, payable pursuant to Section
2.4(b). The Paying Agent shall not be entitled to vote or exercise any rights
of ownership with respect to the Parent Common Shares held by it from time to
time hereunder, except that it shall receive and hold all dividends or other
distributions paid or distributed with respect to such shares for the account
of the Persons entitled thereto. The Paying Agent shall cause the cash,
Parent Common Shares, if any, dividends or distributions with respect thereto
and cash in lieu of fractional shares, if any, deposited by Parent to be (x)
held for the benefit of holders of Certificates and holders of Company
Warrants who executed and delivered a Cash Out Agreement at or prior to the
Effective Time and, as applicable, (ii) promptly applied to making the
exchanges and payments provided for in this Section 2.2 and in Sections 2.3
and 2.4(b). Such cash, Parent Common Shares, dividends or distributions with
respect thereto and cash in lieu of fractional shares shall not be used for
any purpose that is not provided for herein.   (b) As soon as reasonably
practicable after the Effective Time (and in any event not later than five
(5) Business Days after the Effective Time), the Paying Agent shall mail to
each holder of record of a Certificate or Certificates whose shares were
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration a letter of
transmittal in a form prepared prior to the Effective Time and reasonably
acceptable to the Company and Parent (which shall specify that delivery shall
be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only
upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent) and instructions for
use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger
Consideration and the cash, if any, in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to
Section 2.4(b). Upon surrender to the Paying Agent of a Certificate, together
with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed
in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may
be reasonably required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of
such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, after
giving effect to any required Tax withholding pursuant to Section 2.2(e), (i)
cash in respect of the Cash Consideration which such holder has the right to
receive pursuant to Section 2.1(a), (ii) a certificate in respect of the
Stock Consideration representing that number of whole Parent Common Shares,
if any, which such holder has the right to receive pursuant to   - 4
-   Section 2.1(a), (iii) cash in lieu of any fractional Parent Common
Share to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.4(b), (iv) any
dividends or distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to
Section 2.5, in each case without interest, and the Certificate so
surrendered shall forthwith be canceled, and (v) any unpaid dividend or
distribution declared by the Company in respect of Company Common Stock in
accordance with Section 6.10, in each case without interest. The Paying Agent
shall accept such Certificates upon compliance with such reasonable terms and
conditions as the Paying Agent may impose to effect an orderly exchange
thereof in accordance with normal exchange practices.   (c) Each
outstanding Certificate that prior to the Effective Time represented Company
Common Stock and which is not surrendered to the Paying Agent in accordance
with the procedures provided for herein shall, except as otherwise herein
provided, until duly surrendered to the Paying Agent, be deemed to evidence
the right to receive the Merger Consideration into which such Company Common
Stock shall have been converted. After the Effective Time, (i) there shall be
no further transfer on the records of the Company of
Certificates representing shares of Company Common Stock and if such
Certificates are presented to the Company for transfer, they shall be
cancelled against delivery of certificates for the Merger Consideration, and
(ii) the holders of Certificates shall cease to have rights with respect to
the Company Common Stock represented by such Certificates, except the right
to receive the Merger Consideration against delivery of such Certificates in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Parent shall not be obligated to
deliver the Merger Consideration to which a holder of Company Common Stock
would otherwise be entitled as a result of the Merger until such holder
surrenders the Certificate or Certificates representing the shares of Company
Common Stock for exchange as provided in this Section 2.2, or, in default
thereof, an appropriate affidavit of loss and indemnity agreement and/or a
bond as may be required by Parent or the Paying Agent. If any certificates
evidencing Parent Common Shares are to be issued in a name other than that in
which the Certificate evidencing Company Common Stock surrendered in exchange
therefor is registered, it shall be a condition of the issuance thereof that
the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or accompanied by
an executed form of assignment separate from the Certificate and otherwise in
proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such exchange pay to
the Paying Agent any transfer or other tax required by reason of the issuance
of a certificate for Parent Common Shares in any name other than that of the
registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, or otherwise establish to
the satisfaction of the Paying Agent that such tax has been paid or is not
payable.   (d) Any portion of the Merger Consideration that remains
unclaimed by the stockholders of the Company for one year after the Effective
Time (as well as any proceeds from any investment thereof) shall upon demand
be delivered by the Paying Agent to Parent. Any stockholders of Company who
have not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only
to Parent for the consideration deliverable in respect of each share of
Company Common Stock such stockholder holds as determined pursuant to this
Agreement, without any interest thereon. Neither the Paying Agent nor any
party to this Agreement shall be liable to any holder of stock represented by
any Certificate for any consideration paid to a public official pursuant to
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws. Parent and the Paying
Agent shall be entitled to rely upon the stock transfer books of the Company
to establish the identity of those Persons entitled to receive the Merger
Consideration specified in this Agreement, which books shall be conclusive
with respect thereto.   - 5 -    (e) Parent, Merger Sub (in its capacity
as the Surviving Entity or otherwise), the Company, and/or the Paying Agent
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration, the
Company Option Consideration or the Company Warrant Consideration, as the
case may be, otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to the holders of
shares of Company Common Stock, Company Stock Options, Dissenting Shares or
Company Warrants, as applicable, such amounts, if any, as are required to be
deducted or withheld under any provision of U.S. federal tax Law, or any
provision of state, local or foreign tax Law, with respect to the making of
such payment. Amounts so withheld shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holders of shares of Company Common
Stock, Company Stock Options, Dissenting Shares or Company Warrants, as
applicable, in respect of which such deduction or withholding was made.  
(f) The Paying Agent shall invest any cash it so receives, as directed by
Parent, on a daily basis. Any interest and other income resulting from such
investments shall be paid to Parent.   (g) If any Certificate has been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Surviving Entity, the posting by such Person of a bond in
such reasonable amount as the Surviving Entity may direct as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Paying Agent shall issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration and, if applicable, any
unpaid dividend or distribution on the Parent Common Shares deliverable in
respect thereof and any cash in lieu of fractional shares, in each case, due
to such Person pursuant to this Agreement.   Section 2.3 COMPANY WARRANTS.
From and after the date hereof until the Effective Time, the Company shall
use its reasonable best efforts in accordance with applicable law to (a)
cause each outstanding Company Warrant to be exercised and cancelled in
accordance with its terms or (b) cause the holder of any unexercised Company
Warrant to enter into an agreement with the Company, in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to Parent (each, a "Warrant Cash Out Agreement"),
pursuant to which the holder of such Company Warrant agrees to receive from
the Surviving Entity, subject to the consummation of the Merger and in
exchange for the cancellation of such Company Warrant, an amount equal to
the excess, if any, of (x) $14.00 over (y) the per share exercise price of
such Company Warrant, multiplied by the number of shares subject to such
Company Warrant at the Effective Time (such amount, the "Company
Warrant Consideration"). If the exercise price per share of any Company
Warrant is equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration, the Company
shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the holder thereof to enter
into an agreement pursuant to which such Company Warrant shall be canceled at
the Effective Time without any cash payment being made in respect thereof
("Warrant Cancellation Agreement").   Section 2.4 NO FRACTIONAL SHARES OF
PARENT COMMON SHARES.   (a) No certificates or scrip of Parent Common Shares
representing fractional Parent Common Shares shall be issued upon the
surrender for exchange of Certificates and such fractional share interests
will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to have any rights of a
shareholder of Parent or a holder of Parent Common Shares.   - 6 -   
(b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder of
shares of Company Common Stock exchanged pursuant to the Merger who would
otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a Parent Common Share
shall receive from Parent, in lieu thereof, cash (without interest) in
an amount equal to the product of (i) such fractional part of an applicable
Parent Common Share multiplied by (ii) the Parent Common Share Value (as
hereinafter defined).   Section 2.5 DISTRIBUTIONS WITH RESPECT TO
UNEXCHANGED SHARES. No dividends or other distributions declared or made with
respect to Parent Common Shares with a record date after the Effective Time
shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to
the Parent Common Shares that such holder would be entitled to receive upon
surrender of such Certificate and no cash payment in lieu of fractional
Parent Common Shares shall be paid to any such holder pursuant to Section
2.4(b) until such holder shall surrender such Certificate in accordance with
Section 2.2. Subject to the effect of applicable Laws, following surrender of
any such Certificate, there shall be paid to such holder of Parent Common
Shares issuable in exchange therefor, without interest, (a) promptly after
the time of such surrender, the amount of any cash payable in lieu of
fractional Parent Common Shares to which such holder is entitled pursuant to
Section 2.4(b) and the amount of dividends or other distributions with a
record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such
whole Parent Common Shares, and (b) at the appropriate payment date,
the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after
the Effective Time but prior to such surrender and a payment date subsequent
to such surrender payable with respect to such Parent Common Shares.  
Section 2.6 NO LIABILITY. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company,
the Surviving Entity or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person in
respect of any Merger Consideration, any dividends or distributions with
respect thereto or any cash in lieu of fractional Parent Common Shares, in
each case delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate shall not have been
surrendered prior to one (1) year after the Effective Time (or immediately
prior to such earlier date on which any Merger Consideration, any dividends
or distributions payable to the holder of such Certificate or any cash
payable in lieu of fractional Parent Common Shares pursuant to this Article
II, would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental
Entity (as hereinafter defined)), any such Merger Consideration, dividends or
distributions in respect thereof or such cash shall, to the extent permitted
by applicable Law, be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any holders of
Company Common Stock who have not theretofore complied with the provisions of
this Article II shall thereafter look only to Parent only as general
creditors thereof for satisfaction of their claims for the payment of such
Merger Consideration (without any interest thereon).   Section 2.7
DISSENTERS\' RIGHTS. Notwithstanding any provision hereof, shares of Company
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
and held by a holder who has properly exercised and perfected appraisal
rights, if any, under Title 3, Subtitle 2, of the MGCL (the "Dissenting
Shares") shall not be converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration, but the holders of Dissenting Shares shall be entitled
to receive such consideration as shall be determined pursuant to Title 3,
Subtitle 2, of the MGCL; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if any such holder shall
have failed to perfect or shall effectively withdraw or lose his, her or its
right, if any, to appraisal and payment under the MGCL, such holder\'s
shares   - 7 -   of Company Common Stock shall thereupon be deemed to
have been converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive Merger
Consideration, and such shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be
Dissenting Shares. The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any demands
for appraisal received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands, and any
other instruments served pursuant to the MGCL by a holder of Dissenting
Shares and received by the Company. The Parent shall conduct and control all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the
MGCL. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent,
make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal or offer to settle
or settle any such demands.   Section 2.8 STOCK OPTIONS AND RESTRICTED
STOCK.    (a) Effective as of the Effective Time, the Company shall

exercise price per share of any such Company Stock Option is equal to or
greater than the Merger Consideration, the Company shall take all necessary
and appropriate actions so that such Company Stock Option shall be canceled
at the Effective Time without any cash payment being made in respect
thereof.   (b) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, and subject to

Agreement, including the right to receive the Merger Consideration.   (c)
The Company shall take all corporate actions necessary to effectuate the
treatment of Company Stock Options and restricted Company Common Stock
contemplated by this Section 2.8, and to ensure that (i) all awards
issued under any Company Option Plans shall be settled as of the Effective
Time, and (ii) neither any holder of Company Stock Options and restricted
Company Common Stock nor any other participant in any Company Option Plan

Exchange Act (as hereinafter defined), in accordance with the terms and
conditions set forth in that certain No-Action Letter, dated January 12, 1999
(CCH Fed. Sec. L. Rep. 77.515). For purposes of this Agreement, "Section 16

Meeting (as hereinafter defined) (the date such notice is delivered,
"Announcement Date"), to elect (the "Stock Election") to include Stock
Consideration as a part of the Merger Consideration and to reduce the amount
of the Cash Consideration, all in accordance with and as set forth in
the following and the definitions of the various terms set forth below. In
the event the Stock Election is made, and not revoked in accordance with
paragraph (c) below, the following adjustments shall be made:   (i) the
Cash Consideration shall be decreased by an amount specified by Parent

Common Share Value.   (b) As soon as practicable after the Announcement
Date, Parent and the Company shall issue a joint press release announcing
Parent\'s election, subject to its right of revocation, to include Stock
Consideration in the Merger Consideration, the Cash Consideration and the
Stock Election Amount, and as soon as the Parent Common Share Value is
determinable, Parent and the Company shall issue a joint press release
announcing the amount of the Stock Consideration.   (c) Parent may revoke
the Stock Election at any time, provided that no such revocation may be made
if such revocation would make it reasonably necessary, based upon the advice
of the Company\'s outside counsel, to delay the Company Stockholders\'
Meeting for more than 10 Business Days. Following any such revocation, the
Cash Consideration shall again be as defined in Section 2.1(a) and the Merger
Consideration shall not include any Stock Consideration. As soon as
practicable after any such revocation, Parent and the Company shall issue
a joint press release announcing such revocation.   Section 2.11 ADJUSTMENT
TO STOCK CONSIDERATION. In the event that, after the date on which the Parent

split or other similar change in the capitalization of Parent or the Company,

any.   ARTICLE III   REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

contingent liability under Title IV of ERISA, nor does any condition exist
which could reasonably be likely to result in any such liability. No Company
Employee Benefit Plan is a voluntary employees\' beneficiary association, as
defined by Code Section 501(c)(9).   (b) Correct and complete copies of the

all employer contributions and employee salary reduction contributions)
required to have been made under any of the Company Employee Benefit Plans to
any funds or trusts established thereunder, or in connection therewith, have

Knowledge (as hereinafter defined) of the Company, there exists no condition
or set of circumstances in connection with which the Company could be subject
to any liability (other than liability for the payment of benefits   - 20
-   accrued but not yet paid as of the Effective Time) that, individually
or in the aggregate, would reasonably be likely to have a Material Adverse
Effect on the Company under ERISA, the Code or any other applicable law; (vi)
the Company and the Company ERISA Affiliates have no material liability as a
result of any "prohibited transaction" (as defined in Section 406 of ERISA
and Section 4975 of the Code), for any excise Tax or civil penalty or
otherwise; and (vii) to the Company\'s Knowledge, there have been no breaches
of fiduciary obligations under Title I of ERISA with respect to any Company
Employee Benefit Plan.   (d) Each of the Company Employee Benefit Plans
which is intended to be "qualified" within the meaning of Section 401(a) of
the Code has received a determination letter from the IRS to the effect that
such plan is "qualified" and that the trusts maintained pursuant thereto are
exempt from U.S. federal income taxation under Section 501 of the Code. The
Company knows of no fact which would adversely affect the qualified status of
any such Company Employee Benefit Plan or the tax exemption of any trust
maintained pursuant thereto.   (e) Except as set forth in SECTION 3.11(e) OF
THE COMPANY DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE, none of the Employee Benefit Plans provide
benefits, including death or medical benefits (whether or not insured), with

in SECTION 3.11(f) OF THE COMPANY DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE, no stock or other
security issued by the Company forms or has formed a material part of the
assets of any Company Employee Benefit Plan.   (g) Except as specifically
identified and quantified in SECTION 3.11(g) of THE COMPANY DISCLOSURE
SCHEDULE, neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the

former officer, director, independent contractor, or employee of the Company
or any of its subsidiaries; (ii) materially increase any benefits otherwise
payable under any Company Employee Benefit Plan to such individuals set forth

benefits; or (v) result in any payment that will not be deductible for
U.S. federal Tax purposes under Section 280G or Section 162(m) of the
Code.   (h) Except as identified in SECTION 3.11(h) OF THE
COMPANY DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE, no "leased employee" as that term is defined in
Section 414(n) of the Code, performs services for the Company. No leased
employee is eligible to participate in any Company Employee Benefit Plan at
the exclusion of any such person who does not cause any such plan to   - 21
-    lose qualification under Section 401(a) of the Code, nor does it
violate the terms of any Company Employee Benefit Plan.   (i) With respect
to the Company Employee Plans, individually and in the aggregate, there are
no funded benefit obligations for which contributions have not been made or
properly accrued and there are no unfunded benefit obligations which have not
been accrued or otherwise properly disclosed in the footnotes in accordance
with GAAP, in the financial statements of the Company, which obligations
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be likely to have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company.   (j) The aggregate amount of (i)
severance payable under any and all Company Employee Plans, including but not
limited to severance programs, employment agreements, and change of control
agreements or programs to all eligible directors, officers, independent

benefits under such plan as a result of the Merger, (ii) bonuses payable
pursuant to the bonus pool disclosed on SECTION 3.11(a) OF THE COMPANY
DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE and (iii) amounts payable pursuant to the Senior and
Executive Officer Incentive Plan, disclosed on SECTION 3.11(A) OF THE COMPANY

officer, directors, independent contractor, and/or employee would receive a
benefit will not exceed $15,800,000.   (k) No assets of the Company Employee
Plans are invested, directly or indirectly, in any obligation of, or security
or other instrument issued by, the Company or any ERISA Affiliate. No assets
of any of the Company Employee Plans are invested, directly or indirectly, in
real or personal property used by the Company or an ERISA Affiliate. There is
sufficient liquidity of assets in each of the funded Company Employee Plans
to promptly pay for the benefits earned and other liabilities owed under such
Plan. With respect to each of the Company Employee Plans, no insurance
contract, annuity contract, or other agreement or arrangement with any
financial or other organization would impose any penalty, discount or other
reduction on account of the withdrawal of assets from such organization or
the change in the investment of such assets.   (l) With respect to each
Company Employee Plan that is funded wholly or partially through an insurance
policy, there will be no liability of the Company as of the Closing Date,
under any such insurance policy or ancillary agreement with respect to such
insurance policy in the nature of a retroactive rate adjustment, loss sharing
arrangement or other actual or contingent liability arising wholly or
partially out of events occurring prior to the Closing Date.   Section 3.12

of its subsidiaries has constituted either a "distributing corporation" or a
"controlled corporation" (within the meaning of Section 355(a)(1)(A) of the
Code) in a distribution of stock qualifying for tax-free treatment under
Section 355 of the Code (i) in the two years prior to the date of this
Agreement or (ii) in a distribution which could otherwise constitute part of
a "plan" or "series of related transactions" (within the meaning of Section
355(e) of the Code) in conjunction with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.   (t) Other than regular monthly dividends in amounts consistent
with dividends declared and paid during the twelve month period immediately
prior to the date of this   - 28 -    Agreement, the Company will not
be required to make distributions to its shareholders in order to maintain
its REIT status or to avoid the imposition of corporate level Tax or excise
Tax under Section 4981 of the Code (determined without regard to the effects

1999 have been made in accordance with the rights of its shareholders set

made any "preferential dividends" within the meaning of Section 562(c) of the
Code.   (u) The Company is not a foreign person within the meaning
of Section 1445(b)(2) of the Code, and is and has been, at all times during

the Company and Parent shall each notify the other as promptly as practicable
after the receipt by it of any written or oral comments of the SEC on, or of
any written or oral request by the SEC for amendments or supplements to, the
Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Registration Statement, and shall promptly
supply the other with copies of all correspondence between it or any of its
Representatives and the SEC with respect to any of the foregoing filings.

to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each party hereto will use its
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, in good faith, all
actions, and do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or

the parties contained in this Section 6.3, if any objections are asserted
with respect to the Merger contemplated hereby under any antitrust or
competition Law, each of Parent and the Company agrees to use its reasonable
best efforts (which under no circumstances shall involve divesting of
material assets) to resolve any antitrust concerns, federal, state, foreign
or private, obtain all Required Approvals and obtain termination of the
waiting period under the HSR Act or any other applicable Law and the
termination of any outstanding Orders prohibiting the Closing so as to permit

including any proceeding by a private party, is instituted (or threatened in
writing to be instituted) challenging any transaction   - 47
-   contemplated by this Agreement as violative of any Law or regulation,
or if any statute, rule, regulation, Order or injunction is enacted, entered,
promulgated or enforced by a Governmental Entity that would make the Merger

repealed, rescinded or made inapplicable so as to permit consummation of the
Merger.   (e) The Company shall provide, and shall cause its subsidiaries

Section 6.4 COMPANY ACQUISITION PROPOSALS.   (a) From the date hereof until
the earlier of the Effective Time or termination hereof and except as
permitted by the following provisions of this Section 6.4, the Company will
not, nor will it permit any of its subsidiaries to, nor will it permit any
officer, director, employee or agent of, or any financial advisor, attorney,
accountant or other advisor or representative of, the Company or any of its
subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly
encourage (including by furnishing nonpublic information) any inquiries or
the making of any proposal or offer or other action that constitutes, or may
reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal (as hereinafter
defined), (ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations in furtherance
of such inquiries or to obtain an Acquisition Proposal or the making of any
proposal that constitutes any Acquisition Proposal, or release any
Person from any standstill agreement or similar obligation to the Company or
any of its subsidiaries other than the automatic termination of standstill
obligations pursuant to the terms of agreements as in effect as of the date
hereby, (iii) withdraw, modify or amend the Company Recommendation in any
manner adverse to Parent   - 48 -   or Merger Sub, or (iv) enter into
any agreement in principle, arrangement, understanding, contract or agreement
relating to, or approve, endorse or recommend, an Acquisition Proposal;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that subject to the Company\'s compliance with this
Section 6.4, nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent the Company,
the Company Board or the Sub Committee, prior to receipt of the approval by
the stockholders of the Company of Company Voting Proposal and in response to
a bona fide, unsolicited, written Acquisition Proposal from a Third Party
(that does not result from a breach of this Section 6.4), from: (x) entering
into a definitive agreement providing for the implementation of a Superior
Proposal (as hereinafter defined) if the Company or the Company Board has
complied with the procedures of and has not breached the provisions of this
Section 6.4 and is simultaneously terminating this Agreement pursuant to and
in accordance with Section 8.1(e), or (y) furnishing information to or
entering into or participating in discussions or negotiations with, any Third
Party that makes an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal to the
Company if and only to the extent that, prior to taking such action (1)
the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with
independent outside counsel to the Company, that failure to do so would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to stockholders imposed by Law, (2)
the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with
independent financial advisors, that such Acquisition Proposal would be
reasonably likely, if consummated, to constitute a Superior Proposal, (3) the
Third Party has entered into a confidentiality agreement at least as
restrictive as the Confidentiality Agreement in all material respects, and
(4) the Company complies with the procedures set forth in this Section
6.4.   (b) The Company Board will not take any of the actions referred
to in clause (y) of Section 6.4(a) unless the Company has delivered to the
Parent a prior written notice advising the Parent that it intends to take
such action, and the Company will continue to advise the Parent with respect
to such matters after taking such action. In addition, the Company will
notify Parent as soon as practicable (but in any event within 48 hours) after
receipt by an officer or director of the Company or by any of the Company\'s
advisors of any Acquisition Proposal or any request for nonpublic information
in connection with an Acquisition Proposal or for access to the Company\'s
properties, books or records by any Third Party that informs the Company that
it is considering making, or has made, an Acquisition Proposal. Such notice
shall be made orally and in writing and shall indicate in reasonable detail
the identity of the offeror and the terms and conditions of such proposal,
inquiry or contact and copies of any proposed agreement relating thereto. If
the Acquisition Proposal is determined by the Company Board, in accordance
with this Agreement, to be a Superior Proposal, the Company shall promptly
(but in any event within 48 hours) after such determination furnish to Parent
copies of any proposed agreement relating thereto and all information it
provides to the offeror and promptly (but in any event within 48 hours) after
such determination notify Parent in writing of any oral or written changes to
the terms and conditions of any Acquisition Proposal. If the Company Board is
prepared to accept any Acquisition Proposal as a Superior Proposal in
accordance with this Section 6.4, it shall give written notice thereof to
Parent and Merger Sub setting forth the material terms and conditions of such
Superior Proposal, including the amount of consideration per share of Company
Common Stock the stockholders of the Company will receive and the definitive
agreements pursuant to which such Superior Proposal would be implemented (a
"Superior Proposal Notice"). For a period of not less than 48 hours after the
Company delivers to Parent a Superior Proposal Notice, the Company shall and
shall cause its legal and financial advisors to, if requested by Parent,
negotiate in good faith with Parent to revise this Agreement so that the
Acquisition Proposal that   - 49 -   constituted a Superior Proposal no
longer constitutes a Superior Proposal; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that in
determining whether an Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal the
Company must take into account any amendments to this Agreement proposed by
Parent. For the avoidance of doubt, any amendment to the financial or other
terms of an Acquisition Proposal (whether or not a Superior Proposal) shall
be treated as a new Acquisition Proposal for purposes of this Section 6.4 and
shall require a new Superior Proposal Notice if such new Acquisition Proposal
is determined by the Company to be a Superior Proposal.   (c) The Company
will (i) immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing
activities, discussions or negotiations with any Third Parties conducted
heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) use reasonable
efforts to cause all Persons (other than Parent, Merger Sub and
their respective Affiliates and advisors) who have been furnished with
confidential information regarding the Company and its subsidiaries and the
Company Non-Subsidiary Entities in connection with the solicitation of or
discussions regarding any Acquisition Proposal within the 12 months prior to
the date hereof promptly to return or destroy such information, and (iii) use
its reasonable best efforts to enforce and not waive any provision or release
any Person (other than Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Affiliates and
advisors) from any confidentiality, standstill or similar agreement relating
to an Acquisition Proposal. The Company agrees that it will take the
necessary steps to promptly inform the individuals or entities referred to in
the first sentence of Section 6.4(a) of the obligations undertaken in this
Section 6.4.   (d) The Company Board will not withdraw or modify, or propose
to withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent, the Company
Recommendation, and will not approve or recommend an Acquisition Proposal,
unless in connection with a Superior Proposal which is pending at the time
the Company determines to take such action: (i) the Company Board determines
in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel to the Company,
that it must take such action to comply with its fiduciary duties to its
stockholders imposed by Law, (ii) the Company provides Parent with notice of
its decision to withdraw or modify the Company Recommendation, and (iii)
during the period after the Company\'s notice: (A) the Company shall have
offered to negotiate with, and, if accepted, negotiated in good faith with,
Parent to attempt to make such commercially reasonable adjustments in the
terms and conditions of this Agreement as would enable the Company to proceed
with the Merger, and (B) the Company Board shall have concluded, after
considering the results of such negotiations and the revised proposals made
by the Parent, if any, that any Acquisition Proposal could result in a
Superior Proposal.   For purposes of this Agreement, a "Superior Proposal"
means any bona fide written Acquisition Proposal which (i) in the good faith
judgment of the Company Board, is reasonably likely to be consummated, and
(ii) a majority of the Company Board determines in their good faith judgment
after consultation with independent financial advisors of nationally
recognized reputation and taking into account all of the terms and conditions
of the Acquisition Proposal, including any break-up fees, expense
reimbursement provisions and conditions to consummation, to be more favorable
and provide greater value to the Company\'s stockholders from a financial
point of view (which determination may take into account legal matters) than
as provided hereunder and for which financing, if a cash transaction (whether
in whole or in part), is then fully committed or reasonably determined to be
available by the Company Board;   - 50 -   provided that for purposes of
this definition the references in the definition of Acquisition Proposal to
"20%" shall be deemed to be references to "66-2/3%."   (e) Nothing contained
in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the Company Board from (i)
referring any Person to this Section 6.4, or (ii) taking and disclosing to
its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the
Exchange Act or from making any disclosure to the Company\'s stockholders
which, in the good faith judgment of the Company Board, after consultation
with outside legal counsel, that it must take such action to comply with its
fiduciary duties to its stockholders imposed by Law; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that
neither the Company nor the Company Board nor any committee thereof may,
except as expressly permitted by Section 6.4(d), withdraw or modify, or
propose publicly to withdraw or modify, its position with respect to this
Agreement or the Merger or approve or recommend, or propose publicly
to approve or recommend, an Acquisition Proposal; PROVIDED FURTHER, that
disclosure to the Company stockholders pursuant to Rule 14e-2 relating to an
Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be a qualification, withdrawal or
modification, of the Company Recommendation unless the Company Board
expressly, and without qualification, reaffirms the Company Recommendation in
such disclosure.   Section 6.5 RESIGNATIONS. Upon the written request of
Parent, (i) the Company shall cause any or all of the directors (or persons
occupying similar positions in any limited liability company or other entity)
and/or officers of each direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the
Company to resign or be removed or, as to officers, to resign or be
terminated, effective as of the Closing, and (ii) if the Company or any of
its affiliated entities has the right to appoint any director (or person
occupying a similar position in any limited liability company or other
entity) or to cause the resignation or termination of any officer of any
other entity in which the Company (directly or indirectly) owns an equity
interest, the Company shall cause, effective as of the Closing, such director
to resign or to be removed and/or such officer to resign or
be terminated.   Section 6.6 PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENTS. Parent and the Company
will consult with each other before issuing, and provide each other the
opportunity to review and comment upon, any press release or other written
public statements with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and shall not issue any such press release or make any such public
statement prior to such consultation, except as may be required by applicable
Law. The parties agree that the initial press release to be issued with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will be in the
form agreed to by the parties hereto prior to the execution of this
Agreement.   Section 6.7 INDEMNIFICATION; DIRECTORS\' AND OFFICERS\'
INSURANCE.   (a) From and after the Effective Time Parent shall cause
the Surviving Entity to (i) indemnify, defend and hold harmless each present
or former officer or director of the Company or any Company subsidiary and
any person who becomes an officer or director of the Company or any
Company subsidiary after the date hereof but prior to the Effective Time
(each an "Indemnified Party" and, collectively, the "Indemnified Parties"),
to the same extent as such officers or directors are entitled to
indemnification under the Company\'s articles of incorporation, bylaws,
employment agreements or indemnification contracts as in effect on the   -
51 -   date hereof against all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs
and expenses (including, attorneys\' fees and expenses), judgments, fines and
amounts paid in settlement in connection with any actual or threatened
action, suit, claim, proceeding or investigation (each a "Claim") to the
extent any such Claim relates in any manner to actions or omissions occurring
at or prior to the Effective Time (including, without limitation, the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement), regardless of whether such
Claim is asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, and
(ii) advance to such Indemnified Party its fees and expenses (including
attorneys\' fees and expenses) promptly upon request by such Indemnified
Party to the fullest extent permitted under the Company\'s articles of
incorporation, bylaws, employment agreements or indemnification contracts as
in effect on the date hereof, subject to the provision by such Indemnified
Party of an undertaking to reimburse the Surviving Entity the amounts so
advanced in the event of a final and conclusive determination by a court of
competent jurisdiction that such Indemnified Party is not entitled
thereto.   (b) Any Indemnified Parties proposing to assert the right to
be indemnified under Section 6.7(a) shall, promptly after receipt of notice
of commencement of any action against such Indemnified Parties in respect of
which a claim is to be made under Section 6.7(a) against the Surviving
Entity, notify the Surviving Entity of the commencement of such action,
enclosing a copy of all papers served; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the failure to
so notify the Surviving Entity shall not relieve it from any liability which
it may have under Section 6.7(a) unless the Surviving Entity is materially
and adversely prejudiced thereby. If any such action is brought against any
of the Indemnified Parties and such Indemnified Parties notify the Surviving
Entity of its commencement, the Surviving Entity will be entitled to
participate in and, to the extent that the Surviving Entity elects by
delivering written notice to such Indemnified Parties promptly after
receiving notice of the commencement of the action from the Indemnified
Parties, to assume the defense of the action with counsel reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnified Parties after notice from the Surviving
Entity to the Indemnified Parties of its election to assume the defense. The
Surviving Entity will not be liable to the Indemnified Parties for any legal
or other expenses except as provided below. If the Surviving Entity assumes
the defense, the Surviving Entity shall have the right to settle such action
without the consent of the Indemnified Parties; provided, however, that the
Surviving Entity shall be required to obtain such consent if the
settlement includes any admission of wrongdoing on the part of the
Indemnified Parties or any decree or restriction on the Indemnified Parties;
provided, further, that the Surviving Entity, in the defense of any such
action shall not, except with the consent of the Indemnified Parties (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), consent to entry of any judgment
or enter into any settlement that does not include as an unconditional term
thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such Indemnified Parties
of a release from all liability with respect to such action. The Indemnified
Parties will have the right to employ their own counsel in any such action,
but the fees, expenses or other charges of such counsel will be at the
expense of such Indemnified Parties unless (i) the employment of counsel by
the Indemnified Parties has been authorized in writing by the Surviving
Entity, (ii) an actual and apparent conflict exists (based on advice of
counsel to the Indemnified Parties) between the Indemnified Parties and the
Surviving Entity (in which case the Surviving Entity will not have the right
to direct the defense of such action on behalf of the Indemnified Parties) or
(iii) the Surviving Entity has not in fact employed counsel to assume
the defense of such action within a reasonable time after receiving notice of
the commencement of the action, in each of which cases the reasonable
fees, disbursements and other charges of one additional counsel (representing
all of the Indemnified Parties) will be at the   - 52 -   expense of the
Surviving Entity and shall be paid by the Surviving Entity in a timely manner
as statements therefor are received (regardless of whether received prior to
or after final disposition of the claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation). The Surviving Entity shall not be liable for any settlement
of any action or claim effected without its written consent.   (c) The
Surviving Entity shall obtain and maintain in effect at the Effective Time
and continuing until the sixth anniversary thereof "run-off" director and
officer liability coverage with a coverage amount and other terms and
conditions in all material respects no less favorable to the
Indemnified Parties than under the Company\'s current directors and officers
liability insurance policy covering the directors and officers of the Company
with respect to their service as such prior to the Effective Time; provided,
however, that in no event shall the Surviving Entity be required to expend on
an annual basis more than 300% of the current premium paid by the Company to
obtain and maintain such insurance coverage; provided further that, in the
event that the aggregate premiums for maintaining such insurance for the
benefit of the persons currently covered by the Company\'s officers and
directors insurance policy under this Section 6.7(c) are in excess of 300% of
the aggregate amount per annum, then the Surviving Entity shall only be
obligated to maintain such insurance coverage as is reasonably available for
such amount.   (d) In the event the Surviving Entity or any of its
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving entity of such consolidation or
merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person, then and in either such case, proper provision shall be
made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Entity shall assume
the obligations set for in this Section 6.7.   (e) The provisions of this
Section 6.7 are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable
by, each Indemnified Party, his or her heirs and his or her
representatives.   Section 6.8 EMPLOYEE MATTERS.   (a) BENEFIT PLANS.

of control, bonus or similar type program, plan, agreement, or arrangement,
which benefits the Company\'s or the Company\'s Subsidiary\'s officers,
directors, independent contractors, or employees, provides for the deferral
of compensation in accordance with Code Section 409A, the Company

to (i) terminate such program, plan, agreement, or arrangement or (ii) cause
such program, plan, agreement, or arrangement to be operated in reasonable
good faith compliance with Code Section 409A. Such actions shall be done in a
manner that does not result in additional liability to the Company and which

subsidiaries.   (d) Except to the extent provided in paragraph (a) above,
the Company and its subsidiaries shall fully and timely pay (or cause to be
so paid) all Taxes due and payable on or prior to Closing Date.   (e) The
Company shall continue to operate in such a manner so as to permit the
Company to qualify as a REIT for its taxable year ending as of the Effective
Time.   (f) For U.S. federal and other applicable income Tax purposes,
the Company shall report and treat the Merger as a taxable disposition by
the Company of all of the Company\'s assets in exchange for the Merger
Consideration and the assumption of all of the Company\'s liabilities,
followed by a liquidating distribution of such Merger Consideration to

Agreement, "Company Expenses" includes all actual and documented out-of-
pocket expenses (including all reasonable fees and expenses of
counsel, accountants, financial advisors, investment bankers, experts and
consultants) incurred by or on behalf of the Company or its Affiliates in
connection with or related to the authorization, preparation, negotiation,
execution and performance of this Agreement and the other transactions
contemplated hereby, including the preparation, printing, filing and mailing
of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and the solicitation of stockholder

$20,000,000 (the "Maximum Amount") and (ii) the maximum amount, if any,
determined by the independent accountants of Parent, that can be paid to
Parent without causing it to fail to meet the requirements of

and (b) the recipient has $1,000,000 of income from unknown sources during

receipt of all or some portion of the Maximum Amount would either constitute
Qualifying Income or would be excluded from gross income within the meaning
of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code (the "REIT Requirements"),
the Maximum Parent Expenses Amount shall be the Maximum Amount, or if less,
the portion of the Maximum Amount described in the Tax Guidance and the
Company shall, upon receiving notice that Parent has received the Tax
Guidance, pay to Parent any unpaid Maximum Amount or portion thereof, as
applicable, within five Business Days. In the event that Parent is not able

and until Parent receives either one or a combination of the following once
or more often: (i) a letter from Parent\'s independent accountants indicating
the maximum amount thereof that can be paid at that time to Parent without

pay to Parent the lesser of the remaining unpaid Maximum Amount or the
maximum amount stated in the letter referred to in (i) above or such Tax
Guidance within five Business Days after the Company has been notified
thereof. The obligation of the Company to pay any unpaid portion of the
Maximum Amount shall terminate on the December 31 following the date which is
five years from the date of this Agreement. Amounts remaining in escrow after
the obligation of the Company to pay the Maximum Parent Expenses
Amount terminates shall be released to the Company.   (b) In the event that
this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(h), then,
subject to the limitation set forth in Section 8.3(a), Parent shall promptly
(but in no event later than the date of such termination) pay the Company an
amount equal to the Company Expenses by wire transfer of same day funds to an
account designated by the Company. In the event that this Agreement is
terminated (1) by the Company or Parent pursuant   - 64 -  to Section
8.1(f) (assuming the events described in subclauses (A) and (B) of clause

to Section 8.1(i), then, subject to the limitation set forth in
Section 8.3(a), the Company shall promptly (but in no event later than the
date of such termination) pay Parent an amount equal to the Parent Expenses

termination have been received or have been publicly proposed or publicly
announced and within twelve (12) months after such termination, the Company
or any of its Affiliates enters into any definitive agreement with respect

Acquisition Proposal is the same Acquisition Proposal which had been received
at the time of termination of this Agreement), then, in any such case, the
Company shall pay Parent an amount equal to the Termination Fee (as
hereinafter defined). Any payment required by the preceding sentence shall be
made by wire transfer of same day funds to an account designated by Parent,
in the case of a payment as a result of any event referred to in Section
8.3(b)(iii), upon the first to occur of the entering into any definitive
agreement or the consummation of the Acquisition Proposal, and in the case of
a payment as a result of any event referred to in Sections 8.3(b)(i) or (ii)
promptly, but in no event later than the date of such termination.
For purposes of this Section 8.3(b), an "Acquisition Proposal" shall have
the meaning assigned to such term in Section 9.12, except that the reference
to 20% in such definition shall be deemed to be a reference to 50%. As used
in this Agreement, the "Termination Fee" shall be an amount equal to the
"Break-Up Fee" (as defined below) plus the amount of Parent Expenses. The
"Break-Up Fee" shall be an amount equal to the lesser of (i) $80,000,000 (the
"Base Amount") and (ii) the maximum amount, if any, determined by the
independent accountants of Parent, that can be paid to Parent, without
causing it to fail to meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of
the Code for such year determined as if (a) the payment of such amount did
not constitute Qualifying Income, and (b) the recipient has $1,000,000 of
income from unknown sources during such year which was not Qualifying Income
(in addition to any known or anticipated income which was not Qualifying
Income), in each case as determined by independent accountants to Parent.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event Parent receives Tax Guidance
providing that Parent\'s receipt of all or some portion of the Base Amount
would either constitute Qualifying Income or would be excluded from gross
income within the meaning of the REIT Requirements, the Break-Up Fee shall be
the Base Amount, or if less, the portion of the Base Amount described in the
opinion or ruling constituting such Tax Guidance, and the Company shall, upon
receiving notice that Parent has received the Tax Guidance, pay to Parent any
unpaid Base Amount (or portion thereof, as applicable) within five
Business Days. In the event that Parent is not able to receive the full Base
Amount due to the above limitation, the Company shall place the unpaid amount
in escrow (with an escrow agent reasonably acceptable to both Parent and the
Company) by wire transfer within three days of termination and shall not
release any portion thereof to Parent unless and until Parent receives either
one or a combination of the following once or more often: (i) a letter from
Parent\'s independent accountants indicating the maximum amount thereof that
can be paid at that time to Parent without causing Parent to fail to meet the
REIT Requirements (calculated as described above) or (ii) the Tax Guidance,
in either of which events the escrow agent shall pay to Parent the lesser of
the remaining unpaid Base Amount or the maximum amount stated in the letter
referred to in (i) above or such Tax Guidance within five   - 65
-   Business Days after the Company has been notified thereof. The
obligation of the Company to pay any unpaid portion of the Break-Up Fee shall
terminate on the December 31 following the date which is five years from the
date of this Agreement. Amounts remaining in escrow after the obligation of
the Company to pay the Break-Up Fee terminates shall be released to the
Company.   (c) The Company and Parent agree that the agreements contained
in Section 8.3(b) above are an integral part of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and constitute liquidated damages and not a penalty. In the
event that the Company or Parent is required to file to seek all or a portion
of the amounts payable under this Section 8.2, and such party prevails in
such litigation, such party shall be entitled to receive, in addition to all
amounts that it is otherwise entitled to received under this Section 8.3, all
expenses (including attorneys\' fees) which it has incurred in enforcing its
rights hereunder.   Section 8.4 AMENDMENT. This Agreement may be amended by
action taken by the Company, Parent and Merger Sub at any time before or
after approval of the Merger by the Company Requisite Vote but, after any
such approval, no amendment shall be made which requires the approval of any
such stockholders under applicable Law without such approvals. This Agreement
may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of the
parties hereto.   Section 8.5 EXTENSION; WAIVER. At any time prior to the
Effective Time, each party hereto may (a) extend the time for the performance
of any of the obligations or other acts of the other party, (b) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other party
contained herein or in any document, certificate or writing delivered
