represent the right to receive 0.9300 (the " _Exchange Ratio_ ") fully paid

rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger
Consideration payable in respect of such Shares which are issued and

all certificates representing the common stock of Merger Sub shall be deemed

Surviving Corporation into which they were converted in accordance with the
immediately preceding sentence.

 

(d) No certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock shall be issued upon the conversion of Shares pursuant to _Section

the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of capital stock of
the Company or Parent shall occur as a result of any reclassification, stock
split (including a reverse stock split) or combination, exchange or
readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend or stock distribution with a
record date during such period, the Exchange Ratio, the Merger Consideration
and any other similarly dependent items shall be equitably adjusted;
_provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this _Section 3.1(e_) shall be
deemed to permit or authorize any party hereto to effect any such change that
it is not otherwise authorized or permitted to undertake pursuant to this
Agreement.

Section 3.2 _Treatment of Company Equity-Based Awards_.

(a) Each option to purchase shares of Company Common Stock (each, a "
_Company Stock Option_ ") granted under the _Company Stock Plans_ , whether
vested or unvested, that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall, as of the Effective Time, be assumed and automatically and
without any action on the part of the holders thereof, be converted into an
option (each, an " _Assumed Stock Option_ "), on the same terms and conditions
(except as provided in this _Section 3.2(a)_) as were applicable under such
Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, to purchase that
number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product of (i) the total
number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option
and (ii) the Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole number of
shares of Parent Common Stock. The per-share exercise price for the shares of
Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such Assumed Stock Options will
be equal to the

 



17  quotient determined by dividing (i) the exercise price per share of Company
Common Stock at which the Company Stock Options were exercisable immediately
prior to the Effective Time by (ii) the Exchange Ratio, and rounding the
resulting per-share exercise price up to the nearest whole cent. Each Assumed
Stock Option shall be vested immediately following the Effective Time as to
the same percentage of the total number of shares subject thereto as it was
vested immediately prior to the Effective Time, except to the extent such
Assumed Stock Option by its terms in effect prior to the date hereof and not
otherwise amended prior to the Effective Time provides for acceleration of
vesting. As soon as reasonably practicable following the Closing Date, Parent
will deliver to each Person who holds an Assumed Stock Option a document
evidencing the foregoing assumption of such Assumed Stock Option by Parent. 

(b) At the Effective Time, each award of restricted Company Common Stock
granted under a Company Stock Plan that is outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time (the " _Restricted Shares_ ") shall, as of the Effective
Time, become vested on a pro rata basis (determined based on the number of
months from the start of the applicable restricted period to the Effective
Time) in accordance with the applicable Company Stock Plan and award agreement
pursuant to which such award was granted. To the extent such Restricted Shares
become so vested, such Restricted Shares shall be exchanged for Merger
Consideration in accordance with the provisions of _Section 3.1_. To the
extent such Restricted Shares do not become so vested and remain subject to
vesting restrictions as of the Effective Time, such Restricted Shares shall
be assumed and automatically and without any action on the part of the holder
thereof, be converted into, in accordance with _Section 3.1_, a number of
shares of Parent Common Stock (and cash in lieu of fractional shares) equal
to the product of (i) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to such grant of Restricted Shares and (ii) the Exchange Ratio.

(c) Effective as of the Effective Time, each award of restricted share units
with respect to shares of Company Common Stock under a Company Stock Plan that
is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (collectively, the "
_Company RSUs_ ") shall, as of the Effective Time, whether or not then vested
or free of conditions to payment, become vested on a pro rata basis
(determined based on the number of months from the start of the applicable
restricted period to the Effective Time) in accordance with the applicable
Company Stock Plan and award agreement pursuant to which such award was
granted, and shall be assumed and automatically and without any action on
the part of the holder thereof, be converted into the right to receive from
Parent a number of shares of Parent Common Stock (and cash in lieu of
fractional shares to be paid by the Surviving Corporation to the holder) equal
to the product of (i) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to such grant of Company RSUs and (ii) the Exchange Ratio and be
settled in accordance with its terms.

 

(d) As of the Effective Time, each outstanding Company performance unit
granted under the Companys Amended and Restated 2007 Long-Term Incentive
Plan that becomes vested at the Effective Time pursuant to the terms of the
applicable award documents (determined on a pro rata basis by the number of
months from the start of the applicable performance period to the Effective
Time and assuming achievement of the maximum performance level) shall
immediately vest at the Effective Time, with the holder of each such Company
performance unit becoming entitled to receive an amount in cash equal to
$2.00 multiplied by the number of units that have become vested as of the
Effective Time ( _provided_ that (A) amounts payable pursuant to the
cancellation of all outstanding Company performance 

 



18  units pursuant to this sentence shall be paid out within thirty (30) days
following the Effective Time without interest and (B) each outstanding Company
performance unit that does not become vested at the Effective Time pursuant
to the terms of the applicable award documents shall remain outstanding in
accordance with the terms and conditions thereof (with appropriate adjustments
to the applicable performance metrics to account for the consummation of the
Merger).

(e) The Company shall take all steps necessary to cause the
foregoing provisions of this _Section 3.2_ to occur, including but not
limited to obtaining all necessary consents and delivering all required
notices. The Company and Parent will cooperate and coordinate with respect to
any materials to be submitted to the holders of Company Stock Options in
connection with any notice or consent required under this _Section 3.2_.
Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall pass resolutions to effect the
foregoing provisions of this  _Section 3.2_.

(f) Parent shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance
a sufficient number of shares of Parent Common Stock for delivery upon
exercise of Assumed Stock Options or vesting and/or payment of Restricted
Shares and Company RSUs. Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall file
with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor or other
appropriate forms) with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock subject
to Assumed Stock Options, Restricted Shares and Company RSUs to the fullest
extent permitted by Law.

 

Section 3.3 _Appraisal or Dissenters  Rights_. No right to fair value or
appraisal or similar rights shall be available to holders of Company Common
Stock with respect to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated
hereby.

Section 3.4  _Exchange of Shares_.

(a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint
an exchange agent mutually acceptable to Parent and the Company (the "
_Exchange Agent_ ") for the purpose of exchanging Shares for the Merger
Consideration and enter into an agreement reasonably acceptable to the Company
with the Exchange Agent relating to the services to be performed by the
Exchange Agent. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall
cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent, in trust for the benefit of
holders of the Shares and the Restricted Shares, certificates representing
the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to _Section 3.1(a)_ (or
appropriate alternative arrangements shall be made by Parent if uncertificated
shares of Parent Common Stock will be issued). Following the Effective Time,
Parent agrees to make available to the Exchange Agent, from time to time as
needed, cash sufficient to pay cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock pursuant to _Section 3.1(d)_ and any dividends and other
distributions pursuant to _Section 3.4(c)_. All certificates representing
shares of Parent Common Stock (including the amount of any dividends or other
distributions payable with respect thereto pursuant to  _Section 3.4(c)_ and
cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to be paid pursuant
to _Section 3.1(d)_) are hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_."

 



19 (b) _Surrender of Shares_. As soon as reasonably practicable (but not later
than ten (10) Business Days) after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the
Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of Shares, (i) a letter of transmittal
(which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and that risk of
loss and title to the Shares shall pass, only upon delivery of the Shares to
the Exchange Agent) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender
of the Shares in exchange for whole shares of Parent Common Stock (which shall
be in uncertificated book entry form unless a physical certificate is
requested), cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock
pursuant to _Section 3.1(d)_ and any dividends or other distributions payable
pursuant to  _Section 3.4(c)_ in each case in customary form and substance
and reasonably acceptable to the Parent and the Company. Exchange of any
Shares held in book entry form, if any, shall be effected in accordance with
the Exchange Agents customary procedures with respect to securities held in
book entry form. Upon surrender of Shares for cancellation to the Exchange
Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly
executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other
documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of
such Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor that number of
whole shares of Parent Common Stock (after taking into account all Shares
surrendered by such holder) to which such holder is entitled pursuant to
_Section 3.1_ (which shall be in uncertificated book entry form unless a
physical certificate is requested), payment by cash or check in lieu
of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock which such holder is entitled to
receive pursuant to _Section 3.1(d)_ and any dividends or distributions
payable pursuant to _Section 3.4(c)_, and the Shares so surrendered shall
forthwith be cancelled. If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be
registered in the name of a Person other than the Person in whose name the
applicable surrendered Share is registered, it shall be a condition to the
registration thereof that the surrendered Share be in proper form for
transfer and that the Person requesting such delivery of the Merger
Consideration pay any transfer or other similar Taxes required as a result of
such registration in the name of a Person other than the registered holder of
such Share or establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such
Tax has been paid or is not payable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this
_Section 3.4(b)_, each Share shall be deemed at any time after the Effective
Time to represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration (and any
amounts to be paid pursuant to _Section 3.1(d)_ or _Section 3.4(c)_) upon
such surrender. No interest shall be paid or shall accrue on any amount
payable pursuant to _Section 3.1(d)_ or _Section 3.4(c)_.

(c)  _Distributions_. No dividends or other distributions with respect to
shares of Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time
shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Share with respect to the
shares of Parent Common Stock represented thereby, and no cash payment in
lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be paid to any such
holder pursuant to _Section 3.1(d)_, until such Share has been surrendered in
accordance with this _Article III_. Subject to applicable Laws, following
surrender of any such Share, there shall be paid to the recordholder thereof,
without interest, (i) promptly after such surrender, the number of whole
shares of Parent Common Stock issuable in exchange therefor pursuant to this
_Article III_ , together with any cash payable in lieu of a fractional share
of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section
3.1(d)_ and the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date
after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of
Parent Common Stock and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time
and a payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to such
whole shares of Parent

 



20  Common Stock. The Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from the consideration otherwise payable under this Agreement to any holder of
Shares or holder of Restricted Shares, such amounts as are required to be
withheld or deducted under any Tax Law with respect to the making of such
payment. To the extent that amounts are so withheld or deducted and paid over
to the applicable Governmental Entity, such withheld or deducted amounts
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
holder of the Shares or holder of the Restricted Shares in respect of which
such deduction and withholding were made.

 

(d) _Closing of Stock Transfer Books of the Company_. All shares of Parent
Common Stock issued upon the surrender for exchange of Shares in accordance
with the terms of this _Article III_ and any cash paid pursuant to _Section
3.1(d)_ or _Section 3.4(c)_ shall be deemed to have been issued (or paid) in
full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Shares previously
represented by such Shares. After the Effective Time, the stock transfer books
of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no further registration of
transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the
Shares which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If,
after the Effective Time, Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation or
the Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged
as provided in this _Article III_.

(e) _Undistributed Portions of the Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the
Exchange Fund (including the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains
undistributed to the former holders of Shares for twelve (12) months after the
Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent upon demand, and any holders of
Shares who have not theretofore complied with this _Article III_ shall
thereafter look only to Parent for payment of their claim for the Merger
Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock
pursuant to  _Section 3.1(d)_ and any dividends or distributions pursuant to
_Section 3.4(c)_.

(f)  _Unclaimed Amounts_. None of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, the
Surviving Corporation, the Exchange Agent or any other Person shall be liable
to any former holder of Shares for any amount properly delivered to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
Law. Any Merger Consideration remaining unclaimed by holders of shares of
Company Common Stock immediately prior to such time as such amounts would
otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Entity shall, to
the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of Parent free and
clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

 

(g) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any certificates representing
Shares shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Shares to be lost, stolen
or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond,
in such reasonable amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any
claim that may be made against it with respect to such Shares, the Exchange
Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Shares the
Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of such Shares as contemplated by
this  _Article III_.

 



21 ARTICLE IV

_REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY_

Except as disclosed in (a) the Company SEC Documents filed on or prior to
April 26, 2011 (excluding any risk factor disclosure and disclosure of risks
included in any "forward-looking statements" disclaimer or similar statements
included in such Company SEC Documents that are predictive, forward-looking
or primarily cautionary in nature); _provided_ that this clause (a) shall not
qualify _Section 4.2_ (solely to the extent related to the securities of the
Company),  _Section 4.3(a)_ or _Section 4.3(b)_, or (b) in the disclosure
schedule delivered by the Company to Parent prior to the execution of this
Agreement (the " _Company Disclosure Schedule_ "), which shall be arranged to
correspond with specified sections of this Agreement but which shall serve to

to have such power and authority would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a material impact on the Company. Each of
the Company and its Subsidiaries is qualified or licensed to do business and
is in good standing as a foreign corporation in each jurisdiction where the
ownership, leasing or operation of its assets or properties or conduct of its
business requires such qualification or license, except where the failure to

and, as of Closing, none of the forms, documents and reports filed with the
SEC subsequent to the date hereof will contain, any untrue statement of a
material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

(b) The consolidated financial statements (including the related notes and
schedules) of the Company included in the Company SEC Documents fairly

thereof, and the consolidated results of their operations and their
consolidated cash flows for the respective periods then ended (subject, in the
case of the unaudited statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments and to
any other adjustments described therein, including the notes thereto) in
conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles ("
_GAAP_ ") (except, in the case of the unaudited statements, as permitted by
the SEC) applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved (except as

Section 4.5 _Internal Controls and Procedures_. The Company has established
and maintains disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over
financial reporting (as such terms are defined in paragraphs (e) and (f),
respectively, of Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act) as required by Rule
13a-15 under the Exchange Act. The Companys disclosure controls
and procedures are reasonably designed to ensure that all material
information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it
files or furnishes under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the
SEC, and that all such material information is accumulated and communicated to
the Companys management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure and to make the certifications required pursuant to
Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The Companys management has
completed an assessment of the effectiveness of the Companys internal control
over financial reporting in compliance with the requirements of Section 404
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the year ended December 31, 2010, and such
assessment concluded that such controls were effective.

liabilities and obligations incurred since December 31, 2010 in the ordinary
course of business and (d) for liabilities or obligations which have been

of any nature, whether or not accrued, contingent or otherwise, that would be
required by GAAP to be reflected on a consolidated balance sheet of the
Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries (or in the notes thereto), other
than those which would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a material impact on the Company. Neither the Company nor any
of its Subsidiaries is a party to, or has any commitment to become a party to,
any joint venture, offbalance sheet partnership or any similar material
Contract (including any material Contract relating to any transaction or
relationship between or among the Company and any of its Subsidiaries, on the
one hand, and any unconsolidated Affiliate, including any structured finance,
special purpose or limited purpose entity or Person, on the other hand, or
any "offbalance sheet arrangement" (as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation
S-K of the SEC), where the result, purpose or effect of such Contract is to
avoid disclosure of any material transaction involving, or material
liabilities of, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, in the Companys or
any of its Subsidiarys audited financial statements or other Company SEC
Documents)). This  _Section 4.6_ excludes any representation or warranty by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any Company Joint Venture with
respect to matters relating to or arising under Environmental Laws or
Hazardous Materials, which are addressed in _Section 4.8_.

(a) The Company, each of its Subsidiaries and each Company Joint Venture are
in compliance with and are not in default under or in violation of any
applicable Laws, except where such non-compliance, default or violation would

material impact on the Company. Since January 1, 2008, neither the Company,
any of its Subsidiaries nor any Company Joint Venture has received any written

Company Joint Ventures to own, lease and operate their properties and assets
or to carry on their businesses as they are now being conducted (the "
_Company Permits_ "), except where the failure to have any of the Company
Permits would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a material impact on the Company. All Company Permits are valid
and in full force and effect, except where the failure to be in full force and
effect would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a material impact on the Company. The Company is, and each of its
Subsidiaries and the Company Joint Ventures is, in compliance in all respects
with the terms and requirements of such Company Permits, except where the
failure to be in compliance would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a material impact on the Company.

(c) This _Section 4.7_ excludes any representation or warranty by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any Company Joint Venture with respect
to matters relating to or arising under Environmental Laws or Hazardous
Materials, which are addressed in _Section 4.8_. 

Section 4.8 _Environmental Laws and Regulations_. Except as would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a material
impact on the Company: (i) there is no Environmental Claim pending or
threatened against the Company, any Company Subsidiary or any Company Joint
Venture or, to the Knowledge of the Company, each Company Subsidiary and each
Company Joint Venture, against any Person whose liability for any
Environmental Claim the Company, any Company Subsidiary or any Company Joint
Venture have retained or assumed either contractually or by operation of law,
(ii) the Company, its Subsidiaries and the Company Joint Ventures are and,
except for matters that have been fully resolved, since January 1, 2008 have

any written communication, whether from a Governmental Entity or any other
Person, alleging that the Company, any Company Subsidiary or any Company Joint
Venture is not in such compliance, (iii) the Company is not obligated to
conduct or pay for, and is not conducting or paying for, any 

 



28  Cleanup at any location, (iv) there are no present, or to the Knowledge of
the Company, each Company Subsidiary and each Company Joint Venture, past
actions, activities, circumstances, conditions, events or incidents,
including the Release, threatened Release or presence of any Hazardous
Material, which would reasonably be expected to form the basis of any
Environmental Claim against the Company, any Company Subsidiary or
any Company Joint Venture, or to the Knowledge of the Company, each Company
Subsidiary and each Company Joint Venture, against any Person whose liability
for any Environmental Claim the Company, any Company Subsidiary or any Company
Joint Venture has retained or assumed either contractually or by operation of
law, (v) neither the Company, any Company Subsidiary nor any Company Joint
Venture is a party to any order, judgment or decree that imposes any
obligations or liabilities under any Environmental Law, and (vi) neither this

Environmental Laws.

Section 4.9 _Employee Benefit Plans_.

(a)  _Section 4.9(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule lists all material
Benefit Plans sponsored, maintained or contributed to by the Company or CENG
or any of their ERISA Affiliates (the " _Company Benefit Plans_ "). 

(b) Each Company Benefit Plan has been maintained and administered in
compliance with its terms and with applicable Law, including ERISA and the
Code to the extent applicable thereto, except for such non-compliance which
would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
material impact on the Company. Any Company Benefit Plan intended to be
qualified under Section 401(a) or 401(k) of the Code has received a
determination letter (or the prototype plan on which such Company Benefit Plan
is based has received a favorable opinion letter) from the Internal
Revenue Service. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries maintains or
contributes to any plan or arrangement which provides retiree medical or
welfare benefits, except as required by applicable Law. Except as would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a material
impact on the Company, there does not now exist, nor to the Companys
Knowledge do any circumstances exist that would reasonably be expected to
result in, any Controlled Group Liability that would be a liability of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries following the Effective Time.

(c) No Company Benefit Plan is subject to Title IV or Section 302 of ERISA or
Section 412 or 4971 of the Code, and neither the Company nor any of its ERISA
Affiliates has any liability thereunder except as would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a material impact on the
Company. None of the Company Benefit Plans is a "multiple employer welfare
arrangement" (as defined in Section 3(40) of ERISA), a "multiple employer
plan" (as defined in Section 413(c) of the Code) or a "multiemployer plan"
(as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA).

(d) The consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will
not, either alone or in combination with another event, (i) entitle any
current or former employee, consultant or officer of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries to severance

 



29  pay, unemployment compensation or any other payment, except as expressly
provided in this Agreement or as required by applicable Law or (ii) accelerate
the time of payment or vesting, or increase the amount of compensation due to
any such employee, consultant, officer or director, except as expressly
provided in this Agreement.

(e) Each Company Benefit Plan has been operated in good faith compliance in
all material respects with Section 409A of the Code and has since January 1,
2009 been operated in compliance in all material respects with Section 409A
of the Code. Except as set forth on _Section 4.9(e)_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, no director, officer, employee or service provider of the
Company or its Affiliates is entitled to a gross-up, make-whole or
indemnification payment with respect to taxes imposed under Section 409A or
Section 4999 of the Code.

(f) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a material impact on the Company, there are no pending or, to the
Companys Knowledge, threatened claims with respect to any Company Benefit
Plan, by any employee or beneficiary covered under any Company Benefit Plan or
otherwise involving any Company Benefit Plan (other than routine claims for
benefits).

 

(g) Except as provided in this Agreement or as required under applicable Law,
neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will (either alone or together
with any other event where such other event would not alone have an effect
described in this sentence): (i) result in any material payment (including
any bonus, severance, deferred compensation, forgiveness of indebtedness or
golden parachute payment) becoming due to any current or former employee under
any Company Benefit Plan; (ii) increase in any material respect any benefit
otherwise payable under any Company Benefit Plan; (iii) result in the
acceleration in any material respect of the time of payment or vesting of any
such benefits under any Company Benefit Plan; (iv) result in any obligation to
fund any trust or other arrangement with respect to compensation or benefits
under a Company Benefit Plan; or (v) limit, in any way, Parents ability to
amend or terminate any Company Benefit Plan. No payment or benefit which has
been, will or may be made by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with
respect to any current or former employee in connection with the execution and
delivery of this Agreement or the consummation of the transaction contemplated
by this Agreement could result in a material amount of "excess parachute
payments" within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code or material
nondeductibility under Section 162(m) of the Code.

 

(h) Correct and complete copies have been delivered or made available to
Parent by the Company of all written Company Benefit Plans (including all
amendments and attachments thereto), other than any Company Benefit Plan
sponsored, maintained or contributed to by CENG or its ERISA Affiliates, all
related trust documents; all material insurance Contracts or other funding
arrangements to the degree applicable; the two most recent annual information
filings (Form 5500) and annual financial reports for those Company Benefit
Plans (where required); the most recent determination letter from the Internal
Revenue Service (where required); and the most recent summary plan
descriptions; if any, for those Company Benefit Plans (including, for any such
Company Benefit Plan that is not embodied in a document, a written description
of such Company Benefit Plan). 

 



30 (i) To the Companys Knowledge, neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate
has any liability or obligation, contingent or otherwise, with respect to
Benefit Plans sponsored, maintained or contributed to by CENG, except as would
not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
material impact on the Company.

Agreement, the businesses of the Company and its Subsidiaries have been
conducted in the ordinary course of business in all material respects, and

occurrence that, individually or in the aggregate, has been or would
reasonably be expected to have, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

any Company Joint Venture, (b) there are no actions, suits, inquiries,

equity and (c) there are no Orders, judgments or decrees of, or before, any
Governmental Entity, in the cases of each of clauses (a), (b) or (c), that
would reasonably be expected to have a material impact on the Company. This
_Section 4.11_ excludes any representation or warranty by the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries or any Company Joint Venture with respect to matters
relating to or arising under Environmental Laws or Hazardous Materials, which
are addressed in _Section 4.8_.

the registration statement on Form S-4 to be filed with the SEC by Parent in
connection with the issuance of Parent Common Stock in the Merger (including
any amendments or supplements, the " _Form S-4_ ") will, at the time the Form
S-4 becomes effective under the Securities Act, contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or (b) the
proxy statement/prospectus relating to matters to be submitted to the

_Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus_ ") will, at the date it is first mailed to
the Companys stockholders and Parents stockholders or at the time of the
Company Stockholders Meeting or the Parent Stockholders Meeting, contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading; _provided_ , _however_ , that, with respect to
projected financial information provided by or on behalf of the Company, the
Company represents only that such information was prepared in good faith by
management of the Company on the basis of assumptions believed by such
management to be reasonable as of the time made. The Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus (other than the portion thereof relating solely to the
Parent Stockholders Meeting) and the Form S-4 (solely with respect to the
portion thereof relating to the Company Stockholders Meeting) will comply as
to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act
and the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.

requirements of applicable statutes and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder, except for filings the failure of which to make or the failure of

ARTICLE V

 

 _REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT AND MERGER SUB_

 

Except as disclosed in (a) the Parent SEC Documents filed on or prior to April
26, 2011 (excluding any risk factor disclosure and disclosure of risks
included in any "forward-looking statements" disclaimer or similar statements
included in such Parent SEC Documents that are predictive, forward-looking or
primarily cautionary in nature); _provided_ that this clause (a) shall not
qualify _Section 5.2_ (solely to the extent related to the securities of
Parent) _Section 5.3(a)_ or _Section 5.3(b)_, or (b) in the disclosure
schedule delivered by Parent to the Company prior to the execution of this
Agreement (the " _Parent Disclosure Schedule_ "), which shall be arranged to
correspond with specified sections of this Agreement but which shall serve to
disclose exceptions or to qualify any other sections of this Agreement if it
is reasonably apparent that such disclosure is applicable to or qualifies such
other sections, Parent and Merger Sub represent and warrant to the Company as
follows:

 

Section 5.1 _Qualification, Organization, Subsidiaries, etc_.

 

(a) Each of Parent and its Subsidiaries is a legal entity duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of its respective
jurisdiction of organization and has all requisite corporate or similar power
and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and assets, to carry on
its business as presently conducted, except where the failure of
any Subsidiary to be so organized, existing or in good standing or to have
such power and authority would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a material impact on Parent. Each of Parent
and its Subsidiaries is qualified or licensed to do business and is in good
standing as a foreign corporation in each jurisdiction where the ownership,
leasing or operation of its assets or properties or conduct of its business
requires such qualification or license, except where the failure to be so
qualified, licensed or in good standing would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a material impact on Parent.

 

(b) Parent has made available to the Company prior to the date of this
Agreement a true and complete copy of the Organizational Documents of Parent
as amended and in effect through the date hereof.

 



40 (c) _Section 5.1(c)_ of the Parent Disclosure Schedule lists
each Significant Subsidiary of Parent and its jurisdiction of organization
and specifies each of the Subsidiaries of Parent that is (i) a "public
utility" within the meaning of Section 201(e) of the FPA or (ii) a
"qualifying facility" within the meaning of PURPA, or that owns such a
qualifying facility. Parent has made available to the Company true, correct
and complete copies of the Organizational Documents of each Significant
Subsidiary of Parent, as amended and in effect on the date hereof.

(d) Parent is, directly or indirectly, the owner of all of the
outstanding shares of capital stock or other equity interests of each
Subsidiary of Parent, free and clear of any Liens and free of any other
limitation or restriction (including any limitation or restriction on the
right to vote, sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of such capital stock or
other equity interests). All of such capital stock or other equity interests
so owned by Parent have been duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable (and no such shares have been issued in violation of any
preemptive or similar rights). Except for the shares of capital stock or other
equity interests of each Subsidiary and Joint Venture of Parent, Parent does
not own, directly or indirectly, any shares of capital stock or other
equity or ownership interests in any Person.

Section 5.2 _Capital Stock_.

 

(a) The authorized capital stock of Parent consists of 2,000,000,000 shares of
Parent Common Stock and 100,000,000 shares of preferred stock (the " _Parent

662,418,406 shares of Parent Common Stock were outstanding, (ii) 34,743,157

(iv) no shares of Parent Preferred Stock were issued or outstanding. All
outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock are duly authorized, validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable and free of pre-emptive rights and all shares of
Parent Common Stock authorized for issuance as noted in clause (iii), when
issued in accordance with the respective terms thereof, will be duly
authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and free of pre-
emptive rights.

 

(b) Except as set forth in subsection (a) above (and other than the 75,139
outstanding Commonwealth Edison Company warrants (the " _ComEd Warrants_ ")
as of December 31, 2010, pursuant to which 25,046 shares of Commonwealth
Edison Company common stock were reserved for the conversion of ComEd
Warrants), there are no outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants, calls,
convertible securities or other similar rights, agreements or commitments
relating to the issuance of capital stock to which Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party obligating Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to (i)
issue, transfer or sell any shares of capital stock or other equity interests
of Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent or securities convertible into or
exchangeable for such shares or equity interests, (ii) grant, extend or enter
into any such subscription, option, warrant, call, convertible securities or
other similar right, agreement or arrangement, (iii) redeem or otherwise
acquire any such shares of capital stock or other equity interests or (iv)
provide a material amount of funds to, or make any material investment (in
the form of a loan, capital contribution or otherwise) in, any Subsidiary.

Parent Common Stock under the Parent Incentive Plan, neither Parent nor any
of its Subsidiaries has outstanding bonds, debentures, notes or other
obligations, the holders of which have the right to vote (or which are
convertible into or exercisable for securities having the right to vote) with
the stockholders of Parent on any matter.

(d) There are no voting trusts or other agreements or understandings to which
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is a party with respect to the voting or
registration of the capital stock or other equity interest of Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries.

 

(e) As of the date of this Agreement, the authorized capital stock of Merger
Sub consists of 1,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, 100
of which are validly issued and outstanding. All of the issued and outstanding
capital stock of Merger Sub is, and at the Effective Time will be, owned by
Parent. Merger Sub has outstanding no option, warrant, right or any other
agreement pursuant to which any Person other than Parent may acquire any
equity security of Merger Sub. Merger Sub has not conducted any business prior
to the date hereof and has, and prior to the Effective Time will have, no
assets, liabilities or obligations of any nature other than those incident to
its formation and pursuant to this Agreement and the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(f) Parent has delivered or made available to the Company an accurate and
complete copy of the Parent Incentive Plan and the forms of Parent Stock
Options or Parent RSUs (collectively, " _Parent Equity Awards_ "). There have
been no repricings of any stock options granted under any Parent Incentive
Plan through amendments, cancellation and reissuance or other means during
the current or prior two (2) calendar years. None of the Parent Equity Awards
has been granted in contemplation of the Merger or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and no Parent Equity Awards have been
granted other than in the ordinary course since March 18, 2011. None of the
stock options granted under any Parent Incentive Plan was granted with an
exercise price below or deemed to be below fair market value on the date of
grant. All grants of Parent Equity Awards were validly made and properly
approved by the Board of Directors of Parent (or a duly authorized committee
or subcommittee thereof) in compliance with all applicable Laws and recorded
on the consolidated financial statements of Parent in accordance with GAAP,
and, where applicable, no such grants involved any "back dating," "forward
dating" or similar practices with respect to grants of stock options granted
under any Parent Incentive Plan.

 

Section 5.3 _Corporate Authority Relative to this Agreement; No Violation_.

 

(a) Each of Parent and Merger Sub has requisite corporate power and authority
to enter into this Agreement and, subject to receipt of the Parent
Stockholder Approval, to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby have been duly and validly authorized by
the Board of Directors of Parent and the Board of Directors of Merger Sub and
by Parent, as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub and, except for the Parent
Stockholder Approval, no other corporate proceedings on the part of Parent or
Merger Sub are necessary to authorize the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and
delivered by Parent and Merger Sub and, assuming this

 



42  Agreement constitutes the legal, valid and binding agreement of the Company,
constitutes the legal, valid and binding agreement of each of Parent and
Merger Sub, enforceable against Parent and Merger Sub in accordance with its
terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization,
moratorium and similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting
creditors rights and to general equity principles. 

(b) The Board of Directors of Parent, at a meeting duly called and held, duly
and unanimously adopted resolutions (i) determining that the terms of the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement are
advisable, fair to and in the best interests of Parent and its stockholders,
(ii) approving this Agreement, the Merger, the Stock Issuance and the other

authorization, consent, Order, license, permit or approval of, or
registration, declaration, notice or filing with, any Governmental Entity is
necessary, under applicable Law, for the consummation by Parent or Merger Sub
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except for such
authorizations, consents, approvals or filings that, if not obtained or made,
would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
material impact on Parent.

(d) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub does
not, and, except as described in _Section 5.3(c)_, the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and compliance with the provisions hereof
will not, (i) result in any violation of, or default (with or without notice
or lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise to a right of termination,
cancellation or acceleration of any material obligation or to the loss of a
material benefit under any loan, guarantee of indebtedness or credit
agreement, note, bond, mortgage, indenture, lease, agreement, Contract,

any of its Subsidiaries or any Joint Venture of Parent with respect to matters
relating to or arising under Environmental Laws or Hazardous Materials which
are addressed in _Section 5.8_.

 



43 Section 5.4 _Reports and Financial Statements._

 

(a) Parent and each of its Subsidiaries has timely filed or furnished all
forms, documents and reports required to be filed or furnished prior to the
date hereof by it with the SEC since January 1, 2007 (the " _Parent SEC
Documents_ "). As of their respective dates or, if amended, as of the date of
the last such amendment, the Parent SEC Documents complied, and as of the
Closing, all forms, documents and reports filed with the SEC subsequent to the
date hereof will comply, in all material respects with the requirements of the
Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as the case may
be, and none of the Parent SEC Documents contain, and as of the Closing, none
of the forms, documents and reports filed with the SEC subsequent to the date
hereof will contain, any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make
the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading.

 

(b) The consolidated financial statements (including the related notes and
schedules) of Parent included in the Parent SEC Documents fairly present, and
as of the Closing, all consolidated financial statements (including the
related notes and schedules) of Parent included in the forms, documents and
reports filed with the SEC subsequent to the date hereof will fairly present,
in all material respects the consolidated financial position of Parent and its
consolidated Subsidiaries, as at the respective dates thereof, and the
consolidated results of their operations and their consolidated cash flows for
the respective periods then ended (subject, in the case of the unaudited
statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments and to any other adjustments
described therein, including the notes thereto) in conformity with GAAP
(except, in the case of the unaudited statements, as permitted by the SEC)
applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be
indicated therein or in the notes thereto).

Section 5.5 _Internal Controls and Procedures_. Parent has established and
maintains disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over
financial reporting (as such terms are defined in paragraphs (e) and (f),
respectively, of Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act) as required by Rule
13a-15 under the Exchange Act. Parents disclosure controls and procedures are
reasonably designed to ensure that all material information required to be
disclosed by Parent in the reports that it files or furnishes under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such
material information is accumulated and communicated to Parents management
as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to
make the certifications required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Parents management has completed an assessment of the
effectiveness of Parents internal control over financial reporting in
compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for
the year ended December 31, 2010, and such assessment concluded that such
controls were effective.

Section 5.6 _No Undisclosed Liabilities_. Except (a) as reflected or reserved

for liabilities and obligations incurred since December 31, 2010 in the
ordinary course of business and (d) for liabilities or obligations which have
been discharged or paid in full in the ordinary course of business, neither
Parent nor any Subsidiary of

 



44  Parent has any liabilities or obligations of any nature, whether or not
accrued, contingent or otherwise, that would be required by GAAP to be
reflected on a consolidated balance sheet of Parent and its consolidated
Subsidiaries (or in the notes thereto), other than those which would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a material
impact on Parent. Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to,
or has any commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, offbalance
sheet partnership or any similar material Contract (including any material
Contract relating to any transaction or relationship between or among Parent
and any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated
Affiliate, including any structured finance, special purpose or limited
purpose entity or Person, on the other hand, or any "offbalance sheet
arrangement" (as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K of the SEC), where
the result, purpose or effect of such Contract is to avoid disclosure of any
material transaction involving, or material liabilities of, Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries, in Parents or any of its Subsidiarys audited financial
statements or other Parent SEC Documents)). This _Section 5.6_ excludes any
representation or warranty by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or any Joint
Venture of Parent with respect to matters relating to or arising under
Environmental Laws or Hazardous Materials, which are addressed in _Section
5.8_.

 

Section 5.7 _Compliance with Law; Permits_.

(a) Parent and each of its Subsidiaries are in compliance with and are not in
default under or in violation of any applicable Laws, except where such non-
compliance, default or violation would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a material impact on the Parent. Since
January 1, 2008, neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any
written notice or, to Parents Knowledge, other communication from any
Governmental Entity regarding any actual or possible violation of, or failure
to comply with, any Law, except as would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a material impact on Parent. 

(b) Parent and its Subsidiaries are in possession of all franchises, grants,
authorizations, licenses, permits, easements, variances, exceptions,
consents, certificates, approvals, clearances, permissions, qualifications and
registrations and Orders of any Governmental Entity necessary for Parent and
its Subsidiaries to own, lease and operate their properties and assets or to
carry on their businesses as they are now being conducted (the " _Parent
Permits_ "), except where the failure to have any of the Parent Permits would
not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
material impact on Parent. All Parent Permits are valid and in full force and
effect, except where the failure to be in full force and effect would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
material impact on Parent. Parent is, and each of its Subsidiaries is, in
compliance in all respects with the terms and requirements of such Parent
Permits, except where the failure to be in compliance would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a material impact on
Parent.

(c) This _Section 5.7_ excludes any representation or warranty by Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries with respect to matters relating to or arising under
Environmental Laws or Hazardous Materials, which are addressed in _Section
5.8_.

reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a material
impact on Parent: (i) there is no Environmental Claim pending or threatened

communication, whether from a Governmental Entity or any other Person,
alleging that Parent or any Parent Subsidiary is not in such compliance, (iii)
Parent is not obligated to conduct or pay for, and is not conducting or
paying for, any Cleanup at any location, (iv) there are no present, or to the
Knowledge of Parent and each Parent Subsidiary, past actions, activities,

threatened Release or presence of any Hazardous Material, which would
reasonably be expected to form the basis of any Environmental Claim against
Parent or any Parent Subsidiary, or to the Knowledge of Parent and each
Parent Subsidiary, against any Person whose liability for any Environmental

Section 5.9 _Employee Benefit Plans_.

(a) _Section 5.9(a)_ of the Parent Disclosure Schedule lists all material
Benefit Plans sponsored, maintained or contributed to by Parent or any of its
ERISA Affiliates (the " _Parent Benefit Plans_ ").

(b) Each Parent Benefit Plan has been maintained and administered in
compliance with its terms and with applicable Law, including ERISA and the
Code to the extent applicable thereto, except for such non-compliance which
would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
material impact on Parent. Any Parent Benefit Plan intended to be qualified
under Section 401(a) or 401(k) of the Code has received a determination letter
(or the prototype plan on which such Parent Benefit Plan is based has received
a favorable opinion letter) from the Internal Revenue Service. Neither Parent
nor any of its Subsidiaries maintains or contributes to any plan or
arrangement which provides retiree medical or welfare benefits, except as
required by applicable Law. Except as would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a material impact on Parent, there
does not now exist, nor to Parents Knowledge do any circumstances exist that
would reasonably be expected to result in, any Controlled Group Liability
that would be a liability of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries following the
Effective Time.

(c) No Parent Benefit Plan is subject to Title IV or Section 302 of ERISA or
Section 412 or 4971 of the Code, and neither the Parent nor any of its ERISA

 



46  Affiliates has any liability thereunder except as would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a material impact on
Parent. None of the Parent Benefit Plans is a "multiple employer welfare
arrangement" (as defined in Section 3(40) of ERISA), a "multiple employer
plan" (as defined in Section 413(c) of the Code) or a "multiemployer plan" (as
defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA).

(d) The consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will
not, either alone or in combination with another event, (i) entitle any
current or former employee, consultant or officer of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries to severance pay, unemployment compensation or any other payment,
except as expressly provided in this Agreement or as required by applicable
Law or (ii) accelerate the time of payment or vesting, or increase the amount
of compensation due to any such employee, consultant, officer or director,
except as expressly provided in this Agreement. 

(e) Each Parent Benefit Plan has been operated in good faith compliance in all
material respects with Section 409A of the Code and has since January 1, 2009
been operated in compliance in all material respects with Section 409A of the
Code. Except as set forth on _Section 5.9(e)_ of the Parent Disclosure
Schedule, no director, officer, employee or service provider of Parent or its
Affiliates is entitled to a gross-up, make-whole or indemnification payment
with respect to taxes imposed under Section 409A or Section 4999 of the Code.

 

(f) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a material impact on Parent, there are no pending or, to Parents
Knowledge, threatened claims with respect to any Parent Benefit Plan, by any
employee or beneficiary covered under any Parent Benefit Plan or otherwise
involving any Parent Benefit Plan (other than routine claims for benefits).

(g) Except as provided in this Agreement or as required under applicable Law,
neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will (either alone or together
with any other event where such other event would not alone have an effect
described in this sentence): (i) result in any material payment (including
any bonus, severance, deferred compensation, forgiveness of indebtedness or
golden parachute payment) becoming due to any current or former employee under
any Parent Benefit Plan; (ii) increase in any material respect any benefit
otherwise payable under any Parent Benefit Plan; (iii) result in the
acceleration in any material respect of the time of payment or vesting of any
such benefits under any Parent Benefit Plan; (iv) result in any obligation to
fund any trust or other arrangement with respect to compensation or benefits
under a Parent Benefit Plan; or (v) limit, in any way, Parents ability to
amend or terminate any Parent Benefit Plan. No payment or benefit which has
been, will or may be made by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to
any current or former employee in connection with the execution and delivery
of this Agreement or the consummation of the transaction contemplated by this
Agreement could result in a material amount of "excess parachute payments"
within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code or material
nondeductibility under Section 162(m) of the Code. Neither the execution and
delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement will constitute a "change in control" (within
the meaning of such term or terms of like import) under any Parent Benefit
Plan. 

 



47 (h) Correct and complete copies have been delivered or made available to
the Company by Parent of all written Parent Benefit Plans (including all

Governmental Entity, in the cases of each of clauses (a), (b) or (c), that
would reasonably be expected to have a material impact on Parent. This

its Subsidiaries or any Joint Venture of Parent with respect to matters
relating to or arising under Environmental Laws or Hazardous Materials which
are addressed in _Section 5.8_.

 

Section 5.12 _Information Supplied_. None of the information provided by or on
behalf of Parent or its Subsidiaries for inclusion or incorporation by
reference in (a) the Form S-4 will, at the time the Form S-4 becomes effective
under the Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements therein not misleading or (b) the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus will, at the date it is first mailed to Parents
stockholders and the Companys stockholders or at the time of the

required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading; _provided_ , _however_ , that, with respect to projected financial
information provided by or on behalf of Parent or its Subsidiaries, Parent
represents only that such information was prepared in good faith by
management of Parent on the basis of assumptions believed by such management
to be reasonable as of the time made. The Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus
(other than the portion thereof relating solely to the Company Stockholders
Meeting) and the Form S-4 (other than the portion thereof relating solely to
the Company Stockholders Meeting) will comply as to form in all material
respects with the requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and
the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.

 



48 Section 5.13 _Regulatory Matters_.

 

(a) Each of Parents Subsidiaries that engages in the sale of electricity at

their respective dates, with all applicable requirements of applicable
statutes and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, except for

the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a material impact on
Parent.

(c) Since January 1, 2008, neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has

Management Group of Parent except as is required by Law.

Agreement, dated as of January 7, 2011, between the Company and Parent (the "

relating to any Company Acquisition Transaction (other than a confidentiality
agreement as contemplated by this  _Section 6.4(a)_); _provided_ , _however_
, that this _Section 6.4_ shall not prohibit (A) the Board of Directors of
the Company, directly or indirectly through any officer, employee or
Representative of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, prior to obtaining

misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading, the party which discovers such information shall

provided on a basis that substantially comparable benefits are provided to
similarly situated employees of Parent or its Subsidiaries as in effect at
such time, and nothing herein shall be construed to require the Surviving
Corporation to continue to employ any Continuing Employee for any specific
period. Except to the extent necessary to avoid the duplication of benefits,

to Continuing Employees), (ii) for purposes of eligibility and vesting under

amended in accordance with or permitted by this Agreement) that apply to any
current or former employee, or current or former director, of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries; _provided_ , _however_ , that the undertakings
set forth in this sentence are not intended to prevent Parent and its
Affiliates from enforcing such contracts, agreements, plans and commitments
(as such may be amended in accordance with this Agreement) in accordance with
their respective terms, including any reserved right to amend, modify,
suspend, revoke or terminate any such contract, agreement, plan or commitment.

 

(d) With respect to each individual who is employed by the Company or any of

the Merger is not consummated; _provided_ , _further_ , that Parent shall use
its reasonable best efforts to consult with the Company prior to making any
proposal or settlement offer to or entering into any understanding,
undertaking or agreement, directly or indirectly, with any non-governmental
Person related to activities in Maryland that would not bind or prejudice the
Company or its Subsidiaries in the event the Merger is not consummated.
Neither the Company nor Parent shall independently participate in any meeting,
or engage in any substantive conversation, with any Governmental Entity
in respect of any such filings, investigation or other inquiry without giving

prohibited by such Governmental Entity, the opportunity to attend or
participate. The Company and Parent will consult and cooperate with one
another in connection with any analyses, appearances, presentations,
memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals made or submitted by or
on behalf of any party in connection with proceedings under or relating to
the Regulatory Laws.

(c) Parent and the Company agree that the reasonable best efforts obligations
set forth in this _Section 6.8_ preclude Parent and the Company from
knowingly or intentionally taking any actions (including, as applicable,
entering into transactions to acquire other generation facilities or
regulated utility operations or Persons having a direct or indirect interest
in generation facilities or regulated utility operations) that would
reasonably be expected to (i) make it more likely that any of the conditions
to the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby would not be
satisfied, including the receipt of any authorization, consent, order,
declaration or approval of any Governmental Entity necessary to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the expiration or termination
of any applicable

 



76  waiting period, or (ii) without limitation to clause (i), make it more
likely that any Governmental Entity would enter an Order prohibiting the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or that any
such Order would not be able to be removed on appeal or otherwise.

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement,
nothing in this _Section 6.8_ shall limit a partys right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)(i)_ or _8.1(b)(ii)_ so long as such
party has, prior to such termination, complied with its obligations under this
Agreement, including this _Section 6.8_.

Section 6.9 _Takeover Statute_. If any Takeover Law may become, or may purport
to be, applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby, each of the Company
and Parent shall grant such approvals and take such actions as are reasonably
necessary so that the transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act to
eliminate or minimize the effects of such statute or regulation on the
transactions contemplated hereby.

Section 6.10 _Public Announcements_. Except with respect to any (a) Company

its Board of Directors pursuant to, and in accordance with, _Section 6.4_ or

parties shall use reasonable best efforts to consult with each other before
issuing any press release or making any public announcement primarily relating
to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and, except for any
press release or public announcement as may be required by applicable Law,
court process or any listing agreement with any national securities exchange
(and then only after as much advance notice and consultation as is
feasible), shall not issue any such press release or make any such public
announcement without the consent of the other parties, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed. Parent and the Company agree to issue a
mutually acceptable initial joint press release announcing this Agreement.

Section 6.11 _Indemnification and Insurance_.

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to honor all rights to exculpation, indemnification and
advancement of expenses now existing in favor of the current or former
directors, officers or employees, as the case may be, of the Company or its
Subsidiaries (each, an " _Indemnified Party_ ") as provided in
their respective Organization Documents or in any Contract to which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, which rights shall survive the
Merger and shall continue in full force and effect to the extent permitted by
Law. For a period of six years from the Effective Time, Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to maintain in effect the exculpation,
indemnification and advancement of expenses provisions of the Companys and
any Company Subsidiarys Organization Documents in effect as of the date
hereof or in any indemnification agreements of the Company or its Subsidiaries
with any of their respective directors, officers or employees in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time for any action or failure to
act prior to

 



77  the Effective Time, and shall not amend, repeal or otherwise modify any such
provisions in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder for
any action or failure to act prior to the Effective Time of any individuals
who immediately before the Effective Time were current or former directors,
officers or employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that all rights to indemnification in respect of any claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative pending or asserted or any claim made within
such period shall continue until the disposition of such claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative or resolution of such claim. Parent shall assume, be jointly and
severally liable for, and honor, guaranty and stand as a surety for, and shall
cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to honor, in accordance
with their respective terms, each of the covenants contained in this _Section
6.11_ without limit as to time.

 

(b) For a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, Parent shall cause
to be maintained in effect the coverage provided by the policies of
directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance
in effect as of the date hereof maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries
with respect to matters arising on or before the Effective Time either
through the Companys existing insurance provider or another provider
reasonably selected by Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that, after the
Effective Time, Parent shall not be required to pay annual premiums in excess
of 300% of the last annual premium paid by the Company prior to the date
hereof in respect of the coverages required to be obtained pursuant hereto,
but in such case shall purchase as much coverage as reasonably practicable for
such amount;  _provided_ _further_ , _however_ , that in lieu of the
foregoing insurance coverage, Parent may direct the Company to purchase "tail"
insurance coverage, at a cost no greater than the aggregate amount which the
Surviving Corporation would be permitted to spend during the sixyear period
provided for in this _Section 6.11(b)_, that provides coverage no materially
less favorable than the coverage described above.

 

(c) Parent shall pay all reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorneys
fees, that may be incurred by any Indemnified Party in enforcing the
indemnity and other obligations provided in this _Section 6.11_.

 

(d) The rights of each Indemnified Party hereunder shall be in addition to,
and not in limitation of, any other rights such Indemnified Party may have
under the Organization Documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
the Surviving Corporation, any other indemnification arrangement, the MGCL or
otherwise. The provisions of this _Section 6.11_ shall survive the
consummation of the Merger and expressly are intended to benefit, and are
enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties.

(e) In the event that the Surviving Corporation or any of its respective
successors or assigns consolidates with or merges into any other person and
shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such
consolidation or merger or transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any person, then, and in either such case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving
Corporation shall assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 6.11_.

(f) The obligations of the Surviving Corporation under this _Section 6.11_
shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect
any indemnitee to whom this _Section 6.11_ applies without the consent of
such indemnitee (it being expressly 

 



78  agreed that the indemnitees to whom this _Section 6.11_ applies shall be
third party beneficiaries of this _Section 6.11_.

 

Section 6.12 _Control of Operations_. Without in any way limiting any partys
rights or obligations under this Agreement, the parties understand and agree
that (a) nothing contained in this Agreement shall give Parent, directly or
indirectly, the right to control or direct the Companys operations prior to
the Effective Time and (b) prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete
control and supervision over its operations.

Section 6.13 _Certain Transfer Taxes_. Any liability arising out of any real
estate transfer Tax with respect to interests in real property owned directly
or indirectly by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to
the Merger, if applicable and due with respect to the Merger, shall be borne
by the Surviving Corporation and expressly shall not be a liability of
stockholders of the Company.

 

Section 6.14 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and
the Company shall take all such steps as may be required to cause any
dispositions of Company Common Stock (including derivative securities with
respect to Company Common Stock) or acquisitions of Parent Common Stock
(including derivative securities with respect to Parent Common Stock)
resulting from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each
individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of
the Exchange Act to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange

Section 6.15 _Reorganization Treatment_. The parties to this Agreement intend
that the Merger qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Code, and each shall not, and shall not permit any of
their respective Subsidiaries to, take any action, or fail to take any
action, that would reasonably be expected to jeopardize the qualification of
the Merger as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Code. Provided that the opinion conditions contained in _Sections 7.2(e)_ and
_7.3(e)_ have been satisfied, Parent shall file the opinions described in

the Form S-4 shall have been declared effective by the SEC) and signed by an
officer of Parent and Merger Sub, containing representations of Parent and
Merger Sub. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to deliver to

officer of the Company, containing representations of the Company, in each
case (notwithstanding _Sections 4.29_ and _5.28_ ) as shall be reasonably
necessary or appropriate to enable the Companys Counsel

 



79  to render the opinion described in _Section 7.2(e)_ and Parents Counsel to
render the opinion described in _Section 7.3(e)_.

 

Section 6.17 _Stock Exchange Listing_. Parent shall use its reasonable efforts
to cause the shares of Parent Common stock to be issued in the Merger to be
approved for listing on the NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance,
prior to the Closing Date.

prompt written notice to the other (and will subsequently keep the other
informed on a current basis of any developments related to such notice) upon
its becoming aware of the occurrence or existence of any fact, event or
circumstance that is reasonably likely to result in any of the conditions set
forth in _Article VII_ not being able to be satisfied prior to the Termination
Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant to
this _Section 6.18_ shall not, and shall not be deemed to, cure any breach

prior to the date of this Agreement or affect any of the conditions set forth
in _Article VII_ or otherwise limit or affect the remedies available. 

Section 6.19 _Stockholder Litigation_. Each party shall promptly advise the

shall give the other the opportunity to participate in, subject to a customary

until the Effective Time, Parent and the Company shall coordinate with each
other regarding the declaration and payment of dividends in respect of the
shares of Parent Common Stock and Company Common Stock and the record dates
and payment dates relating thereto, it being the intention of Parent and the
Company that no holder of Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock shall
receive two dividends, or fail to receive one dividend, for any single
calendar quarter with respect to its shares of Parent Common Stock or Company
Common Stock (including Parent Common Stock issued in connection with the
Merger), as the case may be.

This Agreement (including the exhibits and schedules hereto) and the Existing
Agreements 

 



90  constitute the entire agreement, and supersede all other prior agreements
and understandings, both written and oral, between the parties, or any of

damages for their loss of economic benefits) in the event of Parents or
Merger Subs Willful Breach of this Agreement, which right is

(b) is not intended to create any right of the Companys stockholders to bring
an action against Parent or Merger Sub pursuant to this Agreement), and (c)
from and after the Effective Time, holders of Company Common Stock, Company
Stock Options, the Restricted Shares and the Company RSUs shall have the right
to receive the applicable Merger Consideration set forth in _Article III_. The
Company acknowledges that Parent shall have the right to pursue damages

any provision of this Agreement may be amended or waived if, and only if, such

the Company, Parent and Merger Sub or, in the case of a waiver, by the party
against whom the waiver is to be effective; _provided_ , _however_ , that
after receipt of Company Stockholder Approval or Parent Stockholder Approval,
if any such amendment or waiver shall by applicable Law or in accordance with
the rules and regulations of the NYSE require further approval of the
stockholders of the Company or Parent, the effectiveness of such amendment or
waiver shall be subject to the approval of the stockholders of the Company or
Parent, as applicable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or delay by
the Company or Parent in exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a
waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any
other or further exercise of any other right hereunder.
