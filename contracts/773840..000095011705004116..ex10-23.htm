**Section 2.04**

_Purchase Price Adjustment_. 

---|---|--- 
  

(a) Within ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, Seller shall
prepare and deliver to Purchaser a statement (the " _Statement_ "), setting
forth the Net Cash as of the close of business on the Closing Date (the "
_Closing Net Cash_ ") determined in accordance with _Section 2.03_ , together
with any supporting information that Purchaser may reasonably request. In
connection with preparing the Statement, Seller shall have the right, but not
the obligation, to conduct, at Sellers expense, an audit of the balance sheet
of the Company as of the Closing Date in accordance with generally accepted
auditing standards;  _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this sentence
shall either change the definition of Net Cash from that set forth in _Section
2.03_ or extend the time frame in which Seller must deliver the Statement to
Purchaser. After the Closing Date, at Sellers request, Purchaser shall, and
shall cause the Company to, assist Seller and its representatives in the
preparation of the Statement and the conduct of the audit and shall provide
Seller and its representatives any information reasonably requested and shall
provide them access at all reasonable times to the personnel, properties and
books and records of the Company for such purposes.

  

(b) Within thirty (30) days after receipt of the Statement, Purchaser
shall deliver to Seller a written statement describing its objections, if any,
to the Statement (the " _Statement of Objections_ "). If Purchaser does not
deliver a Statement of Objections to Seller within such thirty-day period, the
Statement shall become final and binding upon the parties. If Purchaser
delivers a Statement of Objections to Seller within such thirty-day period,
and the parties cannot resolve any such objection within ten (10) Business
Days after the receipt by Seller of such Statement of Objections, any
remaining disputes shall be resolved by Ernst and Young LLP (the " _Accounting
Firm_ "). The Accounting Firm shall be instructed to resolve such disputes
within thirty (30) days after receipt by the Accounting Firm of the materials
delivered by Seller to Purchaser pursuant to _Section 2.04(a)_ and by
Purchaser to Seller pursuant to this _Section 2.04(b)_ , which materials shall
be delivered by Seller and Purchaser to the Accounting Firm within five (5)
Business Days following the expiration of the ten (10) Business Day period
referenced in the preceding sentence. The resolution of disputes by the
Accounting Firm shall be set forth in writing and shall be conclusive and
binding upon the parties, and the Statement, as modified by such resolution,
shall become final and binding upon the date of such resolution. The
determination of the Accounting Firm for any item in dispute cannot be in
excess of, nor less than, the greatest or lowest value, respectively, claimed
for that particular item in the Statement, in the case of Seller, or in the
Statement of Objections, in the case of Purchaser. The Accounting Firm shall
have no right to make any determination with respect to the undisputed
portions of the Statement, and no such determination with respect to the
undisputed portions of the Statement shall be binding on Seller or Purchaser.
The Accounting Firm shall be instructed to calculate Net Cash in accordance
with _Section 2.03_. The fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be
apportioned between Seller and Purchaser by the Accounting Firm based on the
degree to which Sellers and Purchasers claims were unsuccessful and shall be
paid by Seller and Purchaser in accordance with such determination.

  

(c) Upon the Statement becoming final and binding in accordance with
_Section 2.04(b)_, the Initial Purchase Price shall be increased by fifty
percent (50%) of the amount by which the Closing Net Cash exceeds the
Estimated Closing Net Cash or decreased

  



  

5

   



  
   

by  fifty percent (50%) of the amount by which the Closing Net Cash is less
than  the Estimated Closing Net Cash. If the Closing Net Cash exceeds the
Estimated  Closing Net Cash, Purchaser shall pay to Seller fifty percent
(50%) of the amount  of such excess, together with a sum equivalent to
interest thereon at a rate  equal to the LIBOR Rate from the Closing Date to
the date of payment. If the  Estimated Closing Net Cash exceeds the Closing
Net Cash, Seller shall pay to  Purchaser fifty percent (50%) of the amount of
such excess, together with a  sum equivalent to interest thereon at a rate
equal to the LIBOR Rate from the  Closing Date to the date of payment. Any
such payment hereunder shall be made  in accordance with _Section 9.04_
within five (5) Business Days after final  determination of the Statement to
an account designated in writing by Purchaser  or Seller, as the case may be.

---|--- 
   

(a) For purposes of Section 706(c)(2) and 706(d) of the Code, the
Companys taxable year with respect to Seller shall end as of the close of
business on the Closing Date, and Sellers distributive share of the Companys
income, gain, loss, deduction and credit and items thereof as determined for
federal income Tax purposes with respect to its interest in the Company shall
be allocated between Seller and Purchaser based on a closing of the books of
the Company as of the close of business on the Closing Date; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that any event not in the ordinary course of business occurring on
the Closing Date but after the Closing shall, for purposes of this  _Section
9.05(a)_ be treated as occurring after the close of business on the Closing
Date. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the parties
acknowledge that Purchaser intends, as soon as possible after the Closing, to
cause the Company to transfer its interest in its foreign subsidiaries to
various foreign subsidiaries of Honeywell International Inc., the sole member
of Purchaser. Any such transfer occurring on the Closing Date, but after the
Closing, shall, for purposes of this _Section 9.05(a)_ , be treated as
occurring after the close of business on the Closing Date.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein or in
the LLC Agreement, (i) following the Closing, Purchaser agrees to indemnify
Seller for any foreign income Taxes imposed on the Company (but not any
foreign income Taxes imposed on Seller with respect to income of the Company)
for any Tax period or portion thereof ending on or prior to the Closing Date
and (ii) the foreign Tax credits with respect to any such foreign income Taxes
shall be specially allocated to Purchaser.

  

 **Section 9.06** _Publicity_. Neither party shall issue any publicity,
release or announcement concerning the execution of this Agreement, any of the
provisions of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby without
the advance written approval of the form and content thereof by the other
party, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that no such consent shall be required when such disclosure is
required by applicable Law or the rules or regulations of a national or
foreign securities exchange.

  

 **Section 9.07** _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement
shall be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the validity, legality or
enforceability of the other provisions hereof shall not be affected thereby,
and there shall be deemed substituted for the provision at issue a valid,
legal and enforceable provision as similar as possible to the provision at
issue.

  

 **Section 9.08** _Successors and Assigns_. This Agreement shall be
binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns, including any successor of
Purchaser to the Membership Interests (in whole or in part) or any interest in
the Company; _provided_ , that no assignment of any rights or obligations
hereunder, by operation of law or otherwise, shall be made by either party
without the prior written consent of the other party.

  

 **Section 9.09** _Applicable Law_. This Agreement shall be construed and
enforced in accordance with and governed by the laws of the State of New York,

hereby, each party to this Agreement hereby (a) agrees that any such
litigation, proceeding or other legal action may be brought in a court of
competent jurisdiction of the State of New York and the federal courts of the
United States, located in the City of New York; (b) agrees that in connection
with any such litigation, proceeding or action, such party will consent and
submit to personal jurisdiction in any such court described in _clause (a)_ of
this _Section 9.10_ and to service of process upon it in accordance with the
rules and statutes governing service of process; (c) agrees to waive to the
full extent permitted by law any objection that it may now or hereafter have
to the venue of any such litigation, proceeding or action in any such court or
that any such litigation, proceeding or action was brought in an inconvenient
forum; and (d) designates, appoints and directs either CT Corporation System
or Corporation Service Company as its authorized agent to receive on its
behalf service of any and all process and documents in any such litigation,
proceeding or action in the State of New York.

 **Section 9.11** _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in
counterparts, including by facsimile, each of which shall be deemed an
original, but both of which together shall constitute one and the same
instrument.

  

 **Section 9.12** _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement in combination,
where appropriate, with the LLC Agreement and other written agreements between
Seller and Purchaser constitute the entire agreement and understanding between
the parties with respect to the transfer of Sellers Membership Interest to
Purchaser, and this Agreement supercedes the various drafts and discussions
leading hereto. The parties agree that no inferences may be based on prior
verbal discussions or the deletion or revision of any language to this
Agreement proposed by either party, including with respect to the
interpretation of the LLC Agreement or any other written agreement between the
parties.

  

 **Section 9.13** _Waiver_. Any waiver of rights hereunder must be set
forth in a writing signed by the party against whom the waiver is to be
effective. A waiver of any breach or failure to enforce any of the terms or
conditions of this Agreement shall not in any way affect, limit or waive any
partys rights at any time to enforce strict compliance thereafter with every
term or condition of this Agreement for any other breach or failure to comply
with the terms of this Agreement.

  

 **Section 9.14** _Further Assurances_. From time to time after the
Closing, without further consideration, Seller and Purchaser shall cooperate
with each other and shall execute and deliver instruments of transfer or
assignment or assumption or such other documents to the other as the other
reasonably may request to evidence or perfect Purchasers right, title and
interest to Sellers Membership Interest and to otherwise carry out the
transactions contemplated hereby.
