instruct the Exchange Agent to mail to each record holder of Public Common
Units as of the Effective Time (i) a letter of transmittal (specifying that in
respect of certificated Public Common Units, delivery will be effected, and
risk of loss and title to the Certificates will pass, only upon proper
delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent, and which will be in
customary form and agreed to by Parent and the Partnership prior to the
Effective Time) and (ii) instructions (in customary form and agreed to by
Parent and the Partnership prior to the Effective Time) for use in effecting
the surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Units in exchange for the
Merger Consideration payable in respect of Public Common Units represented by
such Certificates or Book-Entry Units, as applicable. Promptly after the
Effective Time, upon surrender of Certificates, if any, for cancellation to
the Exchange Agent together with such letters of transmittal, properly
completed and duly executed, and such other documents (including in respect
of Book-Entry Units) as may be reasonably required pursuant to such
instructions, each holder who held Public Common Units immediately prior to
the Effective Time will be entitled to receive upon surrender of
the Certificates or Book-Entry Units therefor (subject to any applicable
withholding Tax) (A) Parent Shares representing, in the aggregate, the whole
number of Parent Shares that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to
this _Article III_ (after taking into account all Public Common Units then
held by such holder) and/or (B) a check in an amount equal to the aggregate
amount of cash that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to this
_Article III_ , including dividends or other distributions pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 3.3(c)_, if any. No interest will be paid or accrued on any
dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.3(c)_.
In the event of a transfer of ownership of Public Common Units that is not
registered in the transfer records of the Partnership, the Merger
Consideration payable in respect of such Public Common Units may be paid to a
transferee if the Certificate representing such Public Common Units or
evidence of ownership of the Book-Entry Units is presented to the Exchange
Agent, and in the case of both certificated and book-entry Public Common
Units, accompanied by all documents reasonably required to evidence
and effect such transfer, and the Person requesting such exchange will pay to
the Exchange Agent in advance any transfer or other Taxes required by reason
of the delivery of the Merger Consideration in any name other than that of the
record holder of such Public Common Units, or will establish to the
satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Taxes have been paid or are not
payable. Until all such required documentation has been delivered and
Certificates, if any, have been surrendered as contemplated by this _Section_
__ _ 3.3(b)_, each Certificate or Book-Entry Unit will be deemed at any time
after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the Merger
Consideration upon such delivery and surrender, and any cash or dividends or
other distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section_ __
_ 3.3(c)_.

 



18

    

(c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Public Common Units_. No
dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Shares issued in the
Merger shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificates or Book-
Entry Units until such Certificates or Book-Entry Units are surrendered
as provided in this _Section_ __ _ 3.3_. Following such surrender, subject
to the effect of escheat, Tax or other applicable Laws, there shall be paid,
without interest, to the record holder of the Parent Shares issued in
exchange therefor (i) at the time of such surrender, all dividends and other
distributions payable in respect of any such Parent Shares with a record date
after the Effective Time and a payment date on or prior to the date of such
surrender and not previously paid and (ii) at the appropriate payment date,
the dividends or other distributions payable with respect to such Parent
Shares with a record date after the Effective Time but with a payment date
subsequent to such surrender. For purposes of dividends or other
distributions in respect of Parent Shares, all Parent Shares to be issued
pursuant to the Merger shall be entitled to dividends and other distributions
pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence as if issued and outstanding
as of the Effective Time.

(d) _No Fractional Parent Shares_. No certificates or scrip for
Parent Shares representing fractional Parent Shares or book entry credit of
the same will be issued upon the surrender of Public Common Units outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time in accordance with _Section_ __ _
3.3(b)_, and such fractional interests will not entitle the owner thereof to
vote or to have any rights as a holder of any Parent Shares. Notwithstanding
any other provision of this Agreement, in lieu of receiving any fraction of a
Parent Share, all fractions of Parent Shares to which a holder of Public
Common Units converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration in
the Merger would otherwise have been entitled shall be aggregated and the
resulting fraction of a Parent Share will be rounded up to a whole Parent
Share.

(e) _No Further Rights in Public_ _Common Units_. The
Merger Consideration issued upon conversion of a Public Common Unit in
accordance with the terms hereof will be deemed to have been issued and/or
paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Public Common Unit
(other than the right to any distribution in respect of the Common Units with
a record date occurring prior to the Effective Time that may have been
declared by the Partnership on the Common Units in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement and the Partnership Agreement and which remains unpaid at
the Effective Time).

(f) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of Public Common Units on the one-year
anniversary of the Effective Time will be delivered to Parent upon demand by
Parent and, from and after such delivery, any former holders of Public Common
Units who have not theretofore complied with this _Article III_ will
thereafter look only to Parent for the Merger Consideration payable in respect
of such Public Common Units or any dividends or other distributions with
respect to Parent Shares to which they are entitled pursuant to _Section_ __ _
3.1_ or _Section_ __ _ 3.3(c)_, respectively, in each case, without any
interest thereon. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of Public Common
Units immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat
to or become the property of any Governmental Authority will, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, become the property of Parent. Without
limitation of the foregoing, after the date that is the one-year anniversary
of the Effective Time, any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of Public
Common Units will become the property of Parent, subject to the legitimate
claims of any Person previously entitled thereto hereunder or under abandoned
property, escheat or similar Laws.

 



19

    

 Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, none of Parent,
Holdings, the Partnership, Merger Sub, the Surviving Entity, the General
Partner, the Exchange Agent, or any other Person shall be liable to any
former holder of Public Common Units for any amount properly delivered to a
public official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

 

(g) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate is lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by Parent, the posting by such Person of an indemnity agreement or a
bond, in a customary amount, as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate and affidavit the
Merger Consideration payable in respect of Public Common Units represented by
such Certificate as contemplated by this _Article III_ and pay any dividends
and other distributions pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.3(c)_.

 

(h) _Withholding Taxes_. Each of Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Entity
and the Exchange Agent, as applicable, are entitled to deduct and withhold
from any amounts, including the Merger Consideration, payable pursuant to this
Agreement to any Person such amounts as Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving
Entity or the Exchange Agent, as applicable, reasonably deems it is required
to deduct and withhold under the Code or any provision of state, local, or
foreign Tax Law, with respect to the making of such payment. Such deduction
and withholding may be taken in securities, in which case Parent, Merger
Sub, the Surviving Entity or the Exchange Agent, as applicable, shall be
treated as having sold such securities for an amount of cash equal to the fair
market value of such securities at the time of such deemed sale. To the extent
that deducted and withheld amounts (including deemed proceeds from the deemed
sale of securities) are paid over to the appropriate Governmental Authority,
such amounts (including securities) will be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid or issued to the Person in respect of whom such
deduction and withholding was made.

(i) _Book Entry Shares_. All Parent Shares to be issued in the Merger
will be issued in book-entry form, without physical certificates.

 

Section 3.4 _No Dissenters_ __ _Rights_. No dissenters or appraisal
rights shall be available with respect to the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

Section 3.5 _Anti-Dilution Provisions_. Notwithstanding any provision of
this _Article III_ to the contrary, if between the date of this Agreement and
the Effective Time the number of outstanding Common Units or shares of Parent
Common Stock shall have been changed into a different number of units or
shares or a different class or series by reason of any subdivisions,
reclassifications, splits, share distributions, combinations or exchanges of
Common Units or shares of Parent Common Stock, as applicable, then the Merger
Consideration, the Exchange Ratio and any other similar dependent item, as
applicable, will be correspondingly adjusted to provide to the holders of
Public Common Units the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement
prior to such event; _provided_ _,_ _however_ , that nothing in this 
_Section_ __ _ 3.5_ shall be deemed to permit or authorize any party hereto
to effect any such change that it is not otherwise authorized or permitted to
undertake pursuant to this Agreement.

 



20

    

Section 3.6 _Treatment of Awards_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent,
the General Partner and the Partnership shall take all action as may be
necessary or required in accordance with applicable Law and each Partnership
Long-Term Incentive Plan and Parent Equity Plan (including the award
agreements in respect of awards granted thereunder) to give effect to this
_Section_ __ _ 3.6_ as follows:

 

(a) As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of the holders thereof, (i) each Partnership LTIP Award
(other than the Director LTIP Awards), whether or not vested, that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall cease to relate to
or represent any right to receive Common Units and shall be converted at the
Effective Time, into an equivalent award of restricted stock units relating to
Parent Common Stock (" _Parent RSUs_ ") on the same terms and conditions as
were applicable to the corresponding Partnership LTIP Award, including any
applicable payment timing provisions and dividend equivalent rights, as
applicable, except as adjusted hereby and (ii) each Partnership LTIP Award
held by a non-employee director whose service to the Partnership or its
Affiliates will terminate upon the consummation of the Merger (each a "
_Director LTIP Award_ ") shall become fully vested and shall be automatically
converted into the right to receive, with respect to each Common Unit subject
thereto, the Merger Consideration (plus any accrued but unpaid amounts in
relation to distribution equivalent rights). The cancellation of a Director
LTIP Award as provided in the second clause of the immediately
preceding sentence shall be deemed a release of any and all rights the holder
thereof had or may have had in respect of such Director LTIP Award. From and
after the Effective Time, the former holder of any canceled Director LTIP
Award shall only be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration (plus any
accrued but unpaid amounts in relation to distribution equivalent rights) in
respect of each Common Unit subject to such canceled Director LTIP Award.
Payment of the Merger Consideration (and any accrued but unpaid amounts in
relation to distribution equivalent rights) with respect to canceled Director
LTIP Awards shall be subject to withholding taxes in accordance with _Section_
__ _ 3.3(h)_. From and after the Effective Time, the former holder of any
Partnership LTIP Award (other than the Director LTIP Awards) shall only be
entitled to receive Parent RSUs in respect of such Partnership LTIP Awards,
which Parent RSUs will include a right to receive payment of any amounts
with respect to accrued distribution equivalent right payments as of the
Closing in accordance with and subject to the same vesting, forfeiture,
payment timing and other provisions as applied under the corresponding
Partnership LTIP Award.

 

(b) As of the Effective Time, unless otherwise determined by the Parent
Board, Parent shall assume the outstanding unused unit reserve (the "
_Partnership LTIP Reserve_ ") under the Partnership Long-Term Incentive Plans
for the purpose of making future grants relating to Parent Shares to
applicable employees and other service providers of Parent and its
Subsidiaries, which Partnership LTIP Reserve shall (i) be adjusted as
reasonably determined by the Parent Board or a committee thereof to give
effect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (ii) be added
to the Parent Equity Plans in such manner as determined by the Parent Board
or a committee thereof; _provided, however_ , that the number of Parent Shares
comprising the Partnership LTIP Reserve, as adjusted pursuant to this 
_Section_ __ _ 3.6(b)_, shall not, when combined with the other Parent Shares
issued or to become issued in connection with the Merger or any related
transactions, exceed 19.99% of the number of Parent Shares
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.

consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, subject only to
adoption of this Agreement by the affirmative vote or consent of the holders

Partnership Approval is the only approval of the holders of units representing
limited partner interests of the Partnership that is necessary under
applicable Law and the Partnership Agreement to adopt, approve and authorize

executed and delivered by the Partnership and the General Partner and,
assuming due authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement by the
other parties hereto, constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of
the Partnership and the General Partner, enforceable against them in

applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent
conveyance or other similar Laws affecting the enforcement of creditors
rights and remedies generally and by general principles of equity (whether
applied in a Proceeding at law or in equity) (collectively, the "
_Enforceability Exceptions_ "). The GP Board has taken all necessary action so
that any takeover, anti-takeover, moratorium, "fair price," "control share" or
similar Law (collectively, " _Takeover Laws_ ") and any takeover provision of
the Partnership Agreement applicable to the Partnership, the General Partner
or any of their respective Subsidiaries do not, and will not, apply to this
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the Merger.

(b) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the
Partnership or the General Partner nor the consummation by the Partnership and

control payment (or similar payment) under, accelerate the performance
required by, or result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the respective

of the terms, conditions or provisions of any loan or credit agreement,
debenture, note, bond, mortgage, indenture, deed of trust, license, lease,
contract or other agreement, instrument or obligation (each, a " _Contract_

is a party or by which they or any of their respective properties or assets

to purchase or acquire any material asset of the Partnership or any of its
Subsidiaries, except, in the case of _clause (ii)_ of this sentence, for such
violations, conflicts, losses, defaults, terminations, cancellations,
accelerations or Liens that have not had and would not reasonably be expected
to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Partnership Material Adverse
Effect.

of which was obtained prior to the execution of this Agreement, the Requisite
Partnership Approval is the only vote or approval of the holders of any class

Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Controls_.

 

(a) The Partnership and its Subsidiaries have filed or furnished all
reports, schedules, forms, certifications, prospectuses, and registration,

filed or publicly furnished on a voluntary basis on Form 8-K, and in each case
including all exhibits and schedules thereto and documents incorporated by
reference therein, the " _Partnership SEC Documents_ "). The Partnership SEC
Documents, as of their respective effective dates (in the case of Partnership
SEC Documents that are registration statements filed pursuant to the

as finally amended prior to the date of this Agreement, complied in all
material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act, the Securities
Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, and the rules

Partnership SEC Documents as of such respective dates contained any untrue
statement of a material fact or omitted

 



26

    

 to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order
to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading. As of the date of this Agreement, there are

to Parents knowledge, no third party operator) has violated any provision
of, or taken or failed to take any act that, with or without notice, lapse of
time, or both, would constitute a default under the provisions of any Parent
Oil and Gas Lease (or entitle the lessor thereunder to cancel or terminate
such Parent Oil and Gas Lease) included in the Parent Oil and Gas Properties
owned or held by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries.

 

(d) All proceeds from the sale of Hydrocarbons produced from the Parent Oil
and Gas Properties are being received by such selling entities in a timely
manner and no material proceeds from the sale of Hydrocarbons produced from

Partner, until the Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement,
retaining ownership and voting control over all Common Units and the non-

Section 6.5 _Access to Information_. Upon reasonable advance notice and

Subsidiaries properties, commitments, books, Contracts, records and
correspondence (in each case, whether in physical or electronic form),
officers, employees, accountants, counsel, financial advisors and other
Representatives, in each case for the purpose of completing diligence related
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ , that such
access shall be provided on a basis that minimizes the disruption to the
operations of the requested party and its Representatives. Subject to
applicable Laws, from the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time,
Parent and the Partnership shall furnish promptly to one another (i) a copy
of each report, schedule, registration statement and other document filed,
published, announced or received by it in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement during such period pursuant to the requirements
of federal, state or foreign Laws (including pursuant to the Securities Act,
the Exchange Act and the rules of any Governmental Authority thereunder), as
applicable (other than documents which such party is not permitted to disclose
under applicable Laws) (which such furnishing will be deemed to have occurred
in the case of any document filed with or furnished to the SEC without further
action on the part of the furnishing party), and (ii) all information
concerning Parents or the Partnerships business, properties and personnel
as the other party may reasonably request, including all information relating
to environmental matters, for the purpose of completing the other partys due
diligence. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no party shall have an obligation
to provide access to any information the disclosure of which the other party
has concluded may jeopardize any privilege available to such party or any of
its Affiliates relating to such information or would be in violation of a
confidentiality obligation binding on such party or any of its Affiliates.

 

Section 6.6 _Indemnification and Insurance_.

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted
under applicable Laws, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Entity to,
(i) indemnify and hold harmless an Indemnified Person against any reasonable
costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and all other
reasonable costs, expenses and obligations (including experts fees, travel
expenses, court costs, retainers, transcript fees, duplicating, printing and
binding costs, as well as telecommunications, postage and courier charges)
paid or incurred in connection with investigating, defending, being a witness
in or participating in (including on appeal), or preparing to investigate,
defend, be a witness in or participate in, any Proceeding, including any
Proceeding relating to a claim for indemnification or advancement brought by
an Indemnified Person), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or
liabilities, penalties and amounts paid in settlement (including all interest,
assessments and other charges paid or payable in connection with or in respect
of any thereof) in connection with any actual or threatened Proceeding, and,
upon receipt by Parent of an undertaking by or on behalf of the Indemnified
Person to repay such amount if it shall be determined in a final and non-
appealable judgment entered by a court of competent jurisdiction that the
Indemnified Person is not entitled to be indemnified, provide advancement of
expenses with respect to each of the foregoing to, all Indemnified Persons and
(ii) honor the provisions regarding elimination of liability of officers and
directors, indemnification of officers, directors and employees and
advancement of expenses contained in the Organizational Documents of the
Partnership and the General Partner immediately prior to the Effective Time,
and ensure that

 



51

    

 the Organizational Documents of the Partnership and the General Partner or
any of their respective successors or assigns, if applicable, shall, for a
period of six years following the Effective Time, contain provisions no less
favorable with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses and
exculpation of present and former directors, officers and employees of the
Partnership and the General Partner than are presently set forth in such
Organizational Documents. Any right of an Indemnified Person pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 6.6(a)_ shall not be amended, repealed, terminated or
otherwise modified at any time in a manner that would adversely affect
the rights of such Indemnified Person as provided herein, and shall be
enforceable by such Indemnified Person and their respective heirs and
Representatives against Parent, the Partnership and the General Partner and
their respective successors and assigns.

(b) The Surviving Entity shall maintain in effect for a period of six years
following the Effective Time the Partnerships current directors and
officers liability insurance policies covering acts or omissions occurring at
or prior to the Effective Time with respect to Indemnified Persons (
_provided_ , that the Surviving Entity may substitute therefor policies with
reputable carriers of at least the same coverage containing terms and
conditions that are no less favorable to the Indemnified Persons); _provided,
however_ , that in no event shall the Surviving Entity be required to expend
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.6(b)_ more than an amount per year equal to
300% of current annual premiums paid by the Partnership for such insurance
(the " _Maximum Amount_ "). In the event that, but for the proviso to the
immediately preceding sentence, the Surviving Entity would be required to
expend more than the Maximum Amount, the Surviving Entity shall obtain the
maximum amount of such insurance as is available for the Maximum Amount. If
the Partnership in its sole discretion elects, then, in lieu of the
obligations of the Surviving Entity under this _Section_ __ _ 6.6(b)_, the
Partnership may (but shall be under no obligation to), prior to the Effective
Time, purchase a "tail policy" with respect to acts or omissions occurring or
alleged to have occurred prior to the Effective Time that were committed or
alleged to have been committed by such Indemnified Persons in their capacity
as such;  _provided_ , that in no event shall the cost of such policy exceed
the Maximum Amount.

(c) The rights of any Indemnified Person under this _Section_ __ _ 6.6_
shall be in addition to any other rights such Indemnified Person may have
under the Parent Organizational Documents, the Organizational Documents of
each of the Partnership, the General Partner, the Surviving Entity or any
Subsidiary of Parent or the Partnership, any indemnification agreements, or
the DLLCA or DRULPA. The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 6.6_ shall survive
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and are
expressly intended to benefit each of the Indemnified Persons and their
respective heirs and Representatives. If Parent, the Surviving Entity and/or
the General Partner, or any of their respective successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other Person, or (ii) transfers or
conveys all or substantially all of their businesses or assets to any other
Person, then, in each such case, to the extent necessary, a proper provision
shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent, the Surviving
Entity and/or the General Partner shall assume the obligations of Parent, the
Surviving Entity and the General Partner set forth in this  _Section_ __ _
6.6_.

Section 6.7 _Fees and Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided in 
_Section_ __ _ 8.2_ and _Section_ __ _ 8.3_, all fees and expenses incurred
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement including
all legal, accounting, financial advisory, consulting and all other fees and
expenses of third parties incurred by a party in connection with the
negotiation and effectuation of

 



52

    

 the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, shall be the obligation of the respective party incurring
such fees and expenses, except (a) Parent and the Partnership shall each bear
and pay one half of the expenses incurred in connection with the filing,
printing and mailing of the Registration Statement and the Consent
Statement/Prospectus and (b) Parent shall pay all costs and fees of the
Exchange Agent and all expenses associated with the exchange process.

 

Section 6.8 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Partnership shall take all such steps as may be required (to the extent
permitted under applicable Laws) to cause any dispositions of Common Units
(including derivative securities with respect to Common Units) or acquisitions
of Parent Common Stock (including derivative securities with respect to
Parent Common Stock) resulting from the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement by each individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Partnership, or will
become subject to such reporting requirements with respect to Parent, to be
exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 

Section 6.9 _Stock Exchange Listing, Delisting and Deregistration_.

 

(a) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Parent Shares
to be issued in connection with the Merger to be listed on the NYSE, subject
to official notice of issuance, prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the
Closing, Parent shall submit a supplemental listing application with the NYSE
(the " _NYSE Listing Application_ ") with respect to such Parent Shares in
accordance with the requirements of the NYSE. Parent shall use its reasonable
best efforts to have the NYSE Listing Application approved (subject to
official notice of issuance) as promptly as practicable after such submission
(including by responding to comments of NYSE). The Partnership shall furnish
all information as may be reasonably requested by Parent in connection with
any such action and the preparation and submission of the NYSE Listing
Application. No submission of, or amendment or supplement to, the NYSE
Listing Application will be made by Parent without providing the Partnership
with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon. In addition,
Parent agrees to provide the Partnership and its legal counsel with copies of
any written comments, and shall inform the Partnership of any oral comments,
that Parent or its counsel may receive from time to time from the NYSE or its
staff with respect to the NYSE Listing Application promptly after receipt of
such comments, and any written or oral responses thereto. The Partnership and
its legal counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review any such
written responses and Parent shall give due consideration to the additions,
deletions or changes suggested thereto by the Partnership and its counsel.

(b) The Partnership will cooperate and use its reasonable best efforts to
cause the delisting of Common Units from the NYSE and the deregistration of
such securities under the Exchange Act as promptly as practicable following
the Closing in compliance with applicable Law. 

Section 6.10 _Conflicts Committee_. Prior to the earlier of the Effective
Time and the termination of this Agreement, Parent shall not and it shall not
permit any of its Subsidiaries to, and it shall not and shall not permit any
of its Subsidiaries to take any action intended to cause the General Partner
(or the sole member of the General Partner) to, without the consent of a
majority of the then existing members of the Conflicts Committee, eliminate
the Conflicts Committee,

 



53

    

 revoke or diminish the authority of the Conflicts Committee or remove or
cause the removal of any director of the General Partner who is a member of
the Conflicts Committee either as a director or as a member of such
committee. For the avoidance of doubt, this _Section_ __ _ 6.10_ shall not
apply to the filling, in accordance with the provisions of the General Partner
Company Agreement, of any vacancies caused by the resignation, death or
incapacity of any such director.

Section 6.11 _Performance by the General Partner_. Parent will cause the
General Partner, the Partnership and their respective Subsidiaries to comply
with the provisions of this Agreement and the Support Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is understood and agreed that actions or
inactions by the Partnership and the General Partner and their respective
Subsidiaries shall not be deemed to be breaches or violations or failures to
perform by Parent of any of the provisions of this Agreement unless such
action or inaction was or was not taken, in either case, at the direction of
Parent. In no event shall the General Partner or the Partnership have any
liability for, or be deemed to breach, violate or fail to perform any of the
provisions of this Agreement by reason of, any action taken or omitted to be
taken by the General Partner, the Partnership, any of their respective
Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives at the direction of
Parent, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives.

Section 6.12 _Tax_ _Matters_. For U.S. federal income tax purposes (and
for purposes of any applicable state, local or foreign Tax that follows the
U.S. federal income tax treatment), the parties agree to treat the Merger as a
taxable sale of the Public Common Units to Parent in exchange for the Merger
Consideration. The parties will prepare and file all Tax Returns consistent
with the foregoing and will not take any inconsistent position on any Tax
Return, or during the course of any Proceeding with respect to Taxes, except
as otherwise required by applicable Law following a final determination by a
court of competent jurisdiction or other administrative settlement with or
final administrative decision by the relevant Governmental Authority.

 

Section 6.13 _Takeover Statutes_. Parent shall not, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries not to, take any action that would, or would reasonably be
expected to, cause any Takeover Law to become applicable to this Agreement,
the Merger, the Parent Stock Issuance or the other transactions contemplated
hereby or related thereto. If any Takeover Law shall become applicable to
this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby or
related thereto, Parent, the Parent Board, the General Partner, the GP Board
and the Conflicts Committee shall use reasonable best efforts to take such
actions so that the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger
and the Parent Stock Issuance, may be consummated as promptly as practicable
on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise use reasonable best efforts to
eliminate or minimize the effects of such statute or regulation on the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger and the Parent Stock
Issuance.

 

Section 6.14 _Securityholder Litigation_. The Partnership and the General
Partner shall give Parent prompt notice and the opportunity to participate in
the defense or settlement of any securityholder litigation against the
Partnership and the General Partner and/or their directors (as applicable)
relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and no such
settlement shall be agreed to without the prior written consent of Parent,
which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; _provided_ ,
that the Partnership and the General Partner shall in any event control such
defense and/or settlement and shall not be required to provide information if
doing so would be reasonably expected to violate the confidentiality

Merger_. The obligation of the Partnership to effect the Merger is further
subject to the satisfaction (or waiver, if permissible under applicable Laws)
on or prior to the Closing Date of the following conditions:

(a) _Representations and Warranties_. (i) The representations and
warranties of Parent contained in _Section_ __ _ 5.3(a)_, _Section_ __ _
5.3(c)_ and _Section_ __ _ 5.6_ shall be true and correct in all respects, in
each case both when made and at and as of the Closing Date, as if made at and
as of such time (except to the extent expressly made as of an earlier date, in
which case as of such date); (ii) the representations and warranties of Parent
contained in _Section_ __ _ 5.2(a)_ and  _Section_ __ _ 5.2(e)_ shall be
true and correct in all respects, other than immaterial misstatements or
omissions, both when made and at and as of the Closing Date, as if made at and
as of such time (except to the extent expressly made as of an earlier date,
in which case as of such date); and (iii) all other representations and
warranties of Parent set forth herein shall be true and correct both when made
and at and as of the Closing Date, as if made at and as of such time (except
to the extent expressly made as of an earlier date, in which case as of such
date), except, in the case of this _clause (iii)_, where the failure of such
representations and warranties to be so true and correct (without
giving effect to any limitation as to "materiality" or "Parent Material
Adverse Effect" set forth in any individual representation or warranty, other
than in _Section_ __ _ 5.5_ and  _Section_ __ _ 5.9_ and the definition of
Parent Material Contract does not have, and would not reasonably be expected
to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect)
does not have, and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or
in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect. The Partnership shall have
received a certificate signed on behalf of Parent by an executive officer of
Parent to such effect.

 

(b) _Performance of Obligations of Parent and Merger Sub_. Each of Parent
and Merger Sub shall have performed in all material respects all obligations
required to be performed by it under this Agreement at or prior to the Closing

56

    

Section 7.4 _Frustration of Closing Conditions_.

 

(a) Neither the Partnership nor the General Partner may rely on the failure
of any condition set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 7.1_, _Section_ __ _ 7.2_ or
_Section_ __ _ 7.3_, as the case may be, to be satisfied if such failure was
due to the failure of either such party to perform and comply in all material
respects with the covenants and agreements in this Agreement to be performed
or complied with by it prior to the Closing.

 

(b) Neither of Parent nor Merger Sub may rely on the failure of any
condition set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 7.1_, _Section_ __ _ 7.2_ or
_Section_ __ _ 7.3_, as the case may be, to be satisfied if such failure was
due to the failure of any such party to perform and comply in all
material respects with the covenants and agreements in this Agreement to be
performed or complied with by it prior to the Closing.

ARTICLE VIII 

_TERMINATION_

 

Section 8.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement abandoned at any time prior to
the Effective Time:

(a) by the mutual written consent of Parent and the Partnership duly
authorized by the Parent Board and the Conflicts Committee, respectively
(whether before or after the Written Consent of holders of Common Units
referred to in _Section_ __ _ 7.1(a)_ shall have been obtained).

 

(b) by either of the Parent or the Partnership:

 

(i) if the Closing shall not have been consummated on or before January 31,
2021, whether such date is before or after the Written Consent of holders of
Common Units referred to in _Section_ __ _ 7.1(a)_ shall have been obtained
(the " _Outside Date_ "); _provided, however_ , that the right to terminate
this Agreement under this _Section_ __ _ 8.1(b)(i)_ shall not be available
(A) to Parent or the Partnership if the inability to satisfy such condition
was due to the failure of, in the case of Parent, Parent or Merger Sub, or,
in the case of the Partnership, the Partnership or the General Partner, to
perform and comply in all material respects with the covenants and agreements
to be performed or complied with by it prior to the Closing or (B) to Parent
or the Partnership if, in the case of Parent, the Partnership or the General
Partner, or, in the case of the Partnership, Parent or Merger Sub, has filed
(and is then pursuing) an action seeking specific performance as permitted
by  _Section_ __ _ 9.9_; or

(ii) if any Restraint having the effect set forth in  _Section_ __ _
7.1(b)_ shall be in effect and shall have become final and nonappealable
(whether before or after the Written Consent of holders of Common Units
referred to in _Section_ __ _ 7.1(a)_ shall have been obtained); _provided,
however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement under this _Section_ __
_ 8.1(b)(ii)_ shall not be available to Parent or the Partnership if such
Restraint was due to the failure of, in the case of Parent, Parent or Merger
Sub, or, in the case of the Partnership, the Partnership or the General
Partner, to perform any of its obligations under this Agreement.

 



57

    

(c) by Parent if the Partnership or the General Partner shall
have breached or failed to perform any of its representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement (or if any of the
representations or warranties of the Partnership or the General Partner set
forth in this Agreement shall fail to be true), which breach or failure (A)
would (if it occurred or was continuing as of the Closing Date) give rise to
the failure of a condition set forth in _Section_ __ _ 7.2(a)(i)_ or 
_Section_ __ _ 7.2(b)_ and (B) is incapable of being cured, or is not cured,
by the Partnership or the General Partner within 30 days following receipt of
written notice from Parent of such breach or failure; _provided, however_ ,
that Parent shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
this _Section_ __ _ 8.1(c)_ if Parent or Merger Sub is then in material
breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements
contained in this Agreement.

(d) by the Partnership (which termination may be effected for
the Partnership by the Conflicts Committee without the consent, authorization
or approval of the GP Board) if Parent shall have breached or failed to
perform any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set
forth in this Agreement (or if any of the representations or warranties of
Parent set forth in this Agreement shall fail to be true), which breach or
failure (A) would (if it occurred or was continuing as of the Closing Date)
give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in _Section_ __ _
7.3(a)(i)_ or _Section_ __ _ 7.3(b)_ and (B) is incapable of being cured, or
is not cured, by Parent within 30 days following receipt of written notice
from the Partnership of such breach or failure; _provided_ , that the
Partnership shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
this _Section_ __ _ 8.1(d)_ if the Partnership or the General Partner is then
in material breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements contained in this Agreement.

 

Section 8.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of the termination of
this Agreement as provided in  _Section_ __ _ 8.1_, written notice thereof
shall be given to the other party or parties, specifying the provision of this
Agreement pursuant to which such termination is made, and this Agreement shall
forthwith become null and void (other than the provisions in the last
sentence of _Section_ __ _ 6.5_, the provisions in _Section_ __ _ 6.7_, this
_Section_ __ _ 8.2_, _Section_ __ _ 8.3_ and _Article IX_ , all of which
shall survive termination of this Agreement), and, except as otherwise
provided in this _Section_ __ _ 8.2_, there shall be no liability on the part
of any of Parent, Holdings, Merger Sub, the Partnership and the General
Partner or their respective representatives, directors, officers and
Affiliates; _provided, however_ , that no such termination shall relieve any
party hereto from (a) its obligation to pay the Parent Expense Reimbursement
or the Partnership Expense Reimbursement, as applicable, if, as and when
required pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.3_, (b) any liability for any failure
to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement when required pursuant to this Agreement or (c) any liability for
intentional fraud or a Willful Breach of any covenant or other agreement
contained in this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall
the General Partner or the Partnership have any liability for any matter set
forth in the proviso of the preceding sentence for any action taken or omitted
to be taken by the General Partner, the Partnership, any of their respective
Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives at the direction of
Parent, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives.
For purposes of this Agreement, " _Willful Breach_ " shall mean a material
breach of this Agreement that is a consequence of a deliberate act or a
deliberate failure to act by the breaching party with the knowledge that the
taking of such act (or the failure to take such act) would (i) cause a
material breach of this Agreement and (ii) prevent or materially delay the
Closing.

 



58

    

Section 8.3 _Expenses_.

 

(a) In the event of termination of this Agreement by Parent pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 8.1(c)_ ( _Partnership or General Partner Uncured Breach_ ),
then the Partnership shall promptly, but in no event later than two Business
Days after receipt of an invoice (with supporting documentation) therefor from
Parent, pay Parents designee all of the reasonably documented out-of-pocket
expenses (including all fees and expenses of counsel, accountants, investment
bankers, financing sources, hedging counterparties, experts and consultants)
incurred by Parent and its Affiliates in connection with this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby up to a maximum amount of $3,500,000 (the
" _Parent Expense Reimbursement_ "). 

(b) In the event of termination of this Agreement by the Partnership
pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 8.1(d)_ ( _Parent Uncured Breach_ ), then Parent
shall promptly, but in no event later than two Business Days after receipt of
an invoice (with supporting documentation) therefor from the Partnership, pay
the Partnerships designee all of the reasonably documented out-of-pocket
expenses (including all fees and expenses of counsel, accountants, investment
bankers, financing sources, hedging counterparties, experts and consultants)
incurred by the Partnership and its Affiliates in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby up to a maximum amount of
$3,500,000 (the " _Partnership Expense Reimbursement_ "); _provided_ , that
the Partnership Expense Reimbursement shall not exceed the maximum amount, if
any, that the Partnership reasonably determines can be paid to the Partnership
without causing the Partnership to fail the gross income requirement in
Section 7704(c)(2) of the Code, treating the Partnership Expense Reimbursement
as non-qualifying income and after taking into consideration all other
sources of non-qualifying income of the Partnership, unless the Partnership
receives an opinion of counsel or a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service
to the effect that the Partnerships receipt of the Partnership Expense
Reimbursement will either constitute qualifying income (as defined in Section
7704(d) of the Code) or be excluded from gross income for purposes of Section
7704 of the Code.

 

(c) Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that the Parent Expense
Reimbursement and Partnership Expense Reimbursement are not intended to be a
penalty, but rather are liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will
compensate the other party, as applicable, in the circumstances in which such
amounts are due and payable and which do not involve fraud or Willful Breach,
for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities forgone while
negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the
expectation of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, which
amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision. In no event
shall a party be entitled to more than one payment of the Parent Expense
Reimbursement and Partnership Expense Reimbursement, as applicable, in
connection with a termination of this Agreement pursuant to which such
amounts are payable.

(d) The parties acknowledge that the provisions of this  _Section_ __ _
8.3_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated hereby and that,
without these agreements, none of the Partnership, the General Partner,
Parent, Holdings or Merger Sub would enter into this Agreement.

ARTICLE IX

 

 _MISCELLANEOUS_

 

Section 9.1 _No Survival, Etc._ The representations, warranties and
agreements in this Agreement (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any
schedule, instrument or other document delivered pursuant to this Agreement)
shall terminate at the Effective Time or, except as otherwise provided in
_Section_ __ _ 8.2_ or  _Section_ __ _ 8.3_, upon the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.1_, as the case may be, except that
the agreements set forth in _Article I_ , _Article II_ , _Article III,_
the last sentence of _Section_ __ _ 6.5_, _Section_ __ _ 6.7_ and _Article
IX_ and any other agreement in this Agreement that contemplates performance
after the Effective Time shall survive the Effective Time. 

Section 9.2 _Amendment or Supplement_. At any time prior to the Effective
Time, this Agreement may be amended or supplemented in any and all respects
by written agreement of the parties, by action taken or authorized by the
Parent Board and the GP Board; _provided, however_ , that the GP Board may not
take or authorize any such action unless it has been approved by the
Conflicts Committee.

Section 9.3 _GP Board Consent_. Unless otherwise expressly set forth in
this Agreement, whenever a determination, decision, approval, consent, waiver
or agreement of the Partnership or the General Partner is required pursuant to
this Agreement (including any determination to exercise or refrain
from exercising any rights under _Article VIII_ or to enforce the terms of
this Agreement (including _Section_ __ _ 9.9_)), such determination,
decision, approval or consent must be authorized by the GP Board;
_provided, however_ , that the GP Board may not take or authorize any such
action unless it has been approved in writing by the Conflicts Committee.

 

Section 9.4 _Extension of Time, Waiver, Etc._ At any time prior to the
Effective Time, any party may, subject to applicable Law, (a) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of any other party hereto,
(b) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or acts of
any other party hereto, (c) waive compliance by the other party with any of
the agreements contained herein or, except as otherwise provided herein, waive
any of such partys conditions or (d) make or grant any consent under this
Agreement; _provided, however_ , that the GP Board may not take or authorize
any such action unless it has been approved in writing by the Conflicts
Committee. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or delay by the
Partnership, the General Partner, Parent, Holdings or Merger Sub in exercising
any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or
partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right hereunder. Any agreement on the part of a party
hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party.

 

Section 9.5 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by
operation of Law or otherwise, by any of the parties without the prior written
consent of the other parties, but no such assignment shall relieve Merger Sub

Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable
by, the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns.
Any purported assignment not permitted under this  _Section_ __ _ 9.5_ shall
be null, void and ineffective.

 



60

    

Section 9.6 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in
counterparts (each of which shall be deemed to be an original but all of which
taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement) and shall become
effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the
parties and delivered to the other parties. Signatures to this Agreement
transmitted by facsimile transmission, by electronic mail in "portable
document format" form, or by any other electronic means intended to preserve
the original graphic and pictorial appearance of a document, will have the
same effect as physical delivery of the paper document bearing the original
signature.

 

Section 9.7 _Entire Understanding; No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This
Agreement, the Partnership Disclosure Schedule, the Parent Disclosure
Schedule, the Support Agreement and any certificates delivered by any party
pursuant to this agreement (a) constitute the entire agreement and
understanding, and supersede all other prior agreements and understandings,
both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the subject matter of
this Agreement and thereof and (b) shall not confer upon any Person other than
the parties hereto any rights (including third-party beneficiary rights or
otherwise) or remedies hereunder, except for, in the case of _clause (b)_ of
this sentence, (i) the right of a holder of Public Common Units to receive the
Merger Consideration (a claim by any holder of Public Common Units with
respect to which may not be made unless and until the Closing shall have
occurred), the right of a holder of a Partnership LTIP Award to receive the
Merger Consideration (a claim by any holder of Partnership LTIP Award with
respect to which may not be made unless and until the Closing shall have
occurred) and (ii) the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 6.6_ and _Section_ __ _
9.12_.

 

Section 9.8 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial_.

 

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with,
the laws of the State of Delaware, applicable to contracts executed in and to
be performed entirely within that State.

(b) Each of the parties hereto irrevocably agrees that any legal action or
Proceeding with respect to this Agreement and the rights and obligations
arising hereunder, shall be brought and determined exclusively in the Delaware
Court of Chancery and any state appellate court therefrom within the State of
Delaware (or, if the Delaware Court of Chancery declines to accept
jurisdiction over a particular matter, any state or federal court within the
State of Delaware). Each of the parties hereto consents to service being made
through the notice procedures set forth in _Section_ __ _ 9.10_, irrevocably
submits with regard to any such action or Proceeding for itself and in respect
of its property, generally and unconditionally, to the personal jurisdiction
of the aforesaid courts and agrees that it will not bring any action relating
to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in
any court other than the aforesaid courts. Each of the parties
hereto irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert as a defense,
counterclaim or otherwise, in any action or Proceeding with respect to this
Agreement, (i) any claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction
of the above named courts for any reason other than the failure to serve in
accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 9.8_, (ii) any claim that it or its
property is exempt or immune from the jurisdiction of any such court or from
any legal process commenced in such courts (whether through service of
notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of
judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise) and (iii) to the fullest extent
permitted by the applicable Laws, any claim that (A) the suit, action or
Proceeding in such court is brought in an inconvenient forum, (B) the venue of
such suit, action or Proceeding is improper or (C) this

 



61

    

 Agreement, or the subject matter hereof, may not be enforced in or by such
courts. Each party hereto expressly acknowledges that the foregoing waiver is
intended to be irrevocable under the Law of the State of Delaware and of the
United States of America; _provided, however_ , that each such partys consent
to jurisdiction and service contained in this _Section_ __ _ 9.8(b)_ is
solely for the purpose referred to in this _Section_ __ _ 9.8(b)_ and shall
not be deemed to be a general submission to such courts or in the State of
Delaware other than for such purpose.

 

(c) EACH PARTY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION,
PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE)
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
BY THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ACTIONS OF ANY PARTY IN THE NEGOTIATION,
ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT OF THIS AGREEMENT AND
THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT.

Section 9.9 _Specific Performance_. The parties agree that irreparable
damage would occur and that the parties would not have any adequate remedy at
law in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached
and it is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, in each case, in
accordance with this  _Section_ __ _ 9.9_ in the Delaware Court of Chancery
or any other state or federal court sitting in the State of Delaware, this
being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in
equity. Each of the parties agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an
injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief as provided herein
on the basis that (a) either party has an adequate remedy at law or (b) an
award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at
law or equity (it being understood that nothing in this sentence shall
prohibit the parties hereto from raising other defenses to a claim for
specific performance or other equitable relief under this Agreement). Each
party further agrees that no party shall be required to obtain, furnish or
post any bond or similar instrument in connection with or as a condition to
obtaining any remedy referred to in this  _Section_ __ _ 9.9_, and each
party irrevocably waives any right it may have to require the obtaining,
furnishing or posting of any such bond or similar instrument.

 

Section 9.10 _Notices_. All notices and other communications hereunder
must be in writing and will be deemed duly given if delivered personally or

Corporation, a Delaware corporation, CNX Resources Holdings LLC, a Delaware
limited liability company (" _Merger Sub_ "), the Partnership and CNX
Midstream GP LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and the general partner
of the Partnership (the " _General Partner_ "), are entering into an

_Merger Agreement_ "), pursuant to which (and subject to the terms and
conditions set forth therein) Merger Sub shall be merged with and into
the Partnership, the separate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and the
Partnership shall survive and continue to exist as a Delaware limited

of, the number of common units representing limited partner interests in the
Partnership (" _Common Units_ ") set forth opposite such Unitholders name on
_Schedule A_ hereto (the " _Existing Units_ "); 

WHEREAS, as a condition and inducement to the Partnerships willingness to
enter into the Merger Agreement and to proceed with the transactions
contemplated thereby, including the Merger, the Unitholders are entering into
this Agreement; and

WHEREAS, the Unitholders acknowledge that the Partnership is entering into
the Merger Agreement in reliance on the representations, warranties, covenants
and other agreements of the Unitholders set forth in this Agreement and would
not enter into the Merger Agreement if the Unitholders did not enter into

the Termination Date (as defined herein), each Covered Unitholder, severally
and not jointly, irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that it shall (a)
within two Business Days after the Registration Statement becomes effective
under the Securities Act (but, for the avoidance of doubt, not until such
Registration Statement becomes effective), deliver (or cause to be delivered)
a written consent pursuant to Section 13.11 of the Partnership Agreement
covering all of the Covered Units approving the adoption of the Merger, the
Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement,
(b) not revoke any such written consent delivered in accordance with clause

meeting), however called and in connection with the Merger, appear at such
meeting or otherwise cause the Covered Units to be counted as present thereat
for purpose of establishing a quorum and vote (or consent), or cause to be
voted at such meeting (or validly execute and return and cause such consent to

manners and by each applicable class): (i) in favor of the Merger, the
approval of the Merger Agreement and any other matter necessary or desirable
for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement, including the Merger, and (ii) against any action, agreement,
transaction or proposal that is intended, would reasonably be expected, or the
result of which would reasonably be expected, to impede, interfere with,
delay, postpone, discourage, frustrate the purposes of, or adversely affect
any of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the
Merger. For the avoidance of doubt, no Covered Unitholder (in its capacity as
a unitholder) shall be under any obligation

 whatsoever to require or request that the limited partners of the
Partnership vote on, consent to or otherwise approve or reject any matter or
issues; notwithstanding the foregoing, if any Covered Unitholder is the
beneficial owner, but not the Record Holder, of any Covered Units, such
beneficial owner agrees to take all actions necessary to cause the Record
Holder and any nominees to vote (or execute a consent with respect to) all
of such Covered Units in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 2_.

3\. _Grant of Irrevocable Proxy; Appointment of Proxy_.

DESIGNEE, EACH OF THEM INDIVIDUALLY, SUCH COVERED UNITHOLDERS, AS APPLICABLE,
PROXY AND ATTORNEY-IN-FACT (WITH FULL POWER OF SUBSTITUTION) TO VOTE (OR
EXERCISE A WRITTEN CONSENT WITH RESPECT TO) THE COVERED UNITS SOLELY IN
ACCORDANCE WITH _SECTION 2_. THIS PROXY IS IRREVOCABLE (UNTIL THE TERMINATION
DATE AND EXCEPT AS TO ANY PROXY DESIGNEE WHOSE DESIGNATION AS A PROXY DESIGNEE
IS REVOKED BY THE CONFLICTS COMMITTEE) AND COUPLED WITH AN INTEREST AND EACH
COVERED UNITHOLDER SHALL TAKE SUCH FURTHER ACTION OR EXECUTE SUCH
OTHER INSTRUMENTS AS MAY BE NECESSARY TO EFFECTUATE THE INTENT OF THIS PROXY
AND HEREBY REVOKES ANY OTHER PROXY PREVIOUSLY GRANTED BY SUCH COVERED
UNITHOLDER, AS APPLICABLE, WITH RESPECT TO THE COVERED UNITS (AND EACH COVERED
UNITHOLDER HEREBY REPRESENTS TO THE PARTNERSHIP THAT ANY SUCH OTHER PROXY IS
REVOCABLE AND HEREBY REVOKES ANY SUCH OTHER PROXIES). EACH COVERED UNITHOLDER
HEREBY AFFIRMS THAT THE IRREVOCABLE PROXY SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION IS GIVEN
IN CONNECTION WITH THE MERGER AGREEMENT, AND THAT SUCH IRREVOCABLE PROXY IS
GIVEN TO SECURE THE PERFORMANCE OF THE DUTIES OF SUCH COVERED UNITHOLDER UNDER
THIS AGREEMENT.

(b) The proxy granted in this _Section_ __ _ 3_ shall automatically expire
upon the termination of this Agreement.

 

4\. _No Inconsistent Agreements_. Each Unitholder hereby represents, covenants
and agrees that, except as contemplated by this Agreement, it (a) has not
entered into, and shall not enter into at any time prior to the Termination
Date, any voting agreement or voting trust with respect to any Covered Units
and (b) has not granted, and shall not grant at any time prior to the
Termination Date, a proxy or power of attorney with respect to any Covered
Units, in either case, which is inconsistent with the Unitholders obligations
pursuant to this Agreement.

 

5\. _Termination_. This Agreement shall terminate upon the earliest of (a) the
Effective Time, (b) the termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance
with its terms and (c) the mutual written agreement of the parties hereto to

_Termination Date_ ");  _provided_ that the provisions set forth in

 



3

    

  _Sections 13_ to _19_ shall survive the termination of this Agreement;
_provided further_ that any liability incurred by any party hereto as a result
of a breach of a term or condition of this Agreement prior to such
termination shall survive the termination of this Agreement. Upon termination
of this Agreement, none of the Covered Unitholders shall have any further
obligations or liabilities hereunder.

 

6\. _Representations and Warranties of each Covered Unitholder_. Each Covered
Unitholder, severally (but not jointly) and making representations only as to
itself, hereby represents and warrants to the Partnership as follows:

(a) Such party is the Record Holder and beneficial owner of, and has good and
valid title to, its respective Covered Units, free and clear of Liens other
than as created by this Agreement, the Merger Agreement or arising under
generally applicable securities Laws. Such party has voting power, power of
disposition, and power to agree to all of the matters set forth in this
Agreement, in each case with respect to all of such Covered Units. As of the
date hereof, other than the Covered Units , such party is not the
Record Holder and does not own beneficially any (i) units or voting
securities of the Partnership, (ii) securities of the Partnership convertible
into or exchangeable for units or voting securities of the Partnership or
(iii) options or other rights to acquire from the Partnership any units,
voting securities or securities convertible into or exchangeable for units or
voting securities of the Partnership. The Covered Units are not subject to any
voting trust agreement or other contract to which such party is a party
restricting or otherwise relating to the voting or Transfer of the Covered
Units. Such party has not appointed or granted any proxy or power of attorney
that is still in effect with respect to any Covered Units, except as
contemplated by this Agreement.

(b) Such party is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under
the Laws of Delaware, or such other Laws of its jurisdiction, and has all
requisite power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and to
perform its obligations hereunder. The execution and delivery of this
Agreement by such party, the performance by such party of its obligations
hereunder and the consummation by such party of the transactions contemplated
hereby have been duly and validly authorized by such party and no other
actions or proceedings on the part of such party are necessary to authorize
the execution and delivery by such party of this Agreement, the performance by
such party of its obligations hereunder or the consummation by such party of
the transactions contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been duly
and validly executed and delivered by such party and, assuming due
authorization, execution and delivery by the Partnership, constitutes a legal,
valid and binding obligation of such party, enforceable against such party in
accordance with its terms, except as enforcement may be limited by applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar Laws affecting
creditors rights generally and by general principles of equity (regardless of
whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).

(c) Except for the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act, (i) no filing
with, and no permit, authorization, consent or approval of, any Governmental
Authority is necessary on the part of such party for the execution, delivery
and performance of this Agreement by such party or the consummation by such
party of the transactions contemplated hereby and (ii) neither the execution,
delivery or performance of this Agreement by such party nor the consummation
by such party of the transactions contemplated hereby nor compliance by such
party with any of the 

 



4

    

 provisions hereof shall (A) conflict with or violate, any provision of the
Organizational Documents of such party, (B) result in any breach or violation
of, or constitute a default (or an event which, with notice or lapse of time
or both, would become a default) under, or give to others any rights of
termination, amendment, acceleration or cancellation of, or result in the
creation of a Lien on such property or asset of such party pursuant to, any
contract to which such party is a party or by which such party or any property
or asset of such party is bound or affected or (C) violate any order, writ,
injunction, decree, statute, rule or regulation applicable to such party or
any of such partys properties or assets except, in the case of clause (B) or
(C), for breaches, violations or defaults that would not, individually or in
the aggregate, materially impair the ability of such party to perform
its obligations hereunder.

(d) As of the date of this Agreement, there is no action, suit, investigation,
complaint or other proceeding pending against such party or, to the actual
knowledge of such party, any other Person or, to the actual knowledge of such
party, threatened against such party or any other Person that restricts or
prohibits (or, if successful, would restrict or prohibit) the Partnership of
their rights under this Agreement or the performance by any party of its
obligations under this Agreement.

 

(e) Such party understands and acknowledges that the Partnership is entering
into the Merger Agreement in reliance upon such partys execution and
delivery of this Agreement and the representations and warranties of such
party contained herein.

(f) Each Unitholder is an Affiliate (as defined in the Partnership Agreement)
of the General Partner.

7\. _Certain Covenants of each Covered Unitholder_. Each Covered Unitholder,
severally (but not jointly) hereby covenants and agrees, in each case, only on
its own behalf as follows, in each case except as otherwise approved in
writing by Conflicts Committee:

 

(a) Prior to the Termination Date, and except as contemplated hereby, such
party shall not (i) Transfer, or enter into any contract, option, agreement
or other arrangement or understanding with respect to the Transfer of any of
the Covered Units or beneficial ownership or voting power thereof or therein
(including by operation of law), (ii) grant any proxies or powers
of attorney, deposit any Covered Units into a voting trust or enter into a
voting agreement with respect to any Covered Units or (iii) knowingly take any
action that would make any representation or warranty of such party contained
herein untrue or incorrect or have the effect of preventing or disabling such
party from performing its obligations under this Agreement. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, such party may Transfer any or all
of the Covered Units, in accordance with applicable Law, to each other or any
Affiliate of the General Partner; _provided_ that prior to and as a condition
to the effectiveness of such Transfer, each Person to whom any of such Covered
Units or any interest in any of such Covered Units is or may be Transferred
shall have executed and delivered to the Partnership a counterpart of this
Agreement pursuant to which such Person shall be bound by all of the terms and
provisions of this Agreement as if such Person were a party with the
obligations of a Covered Unitholder. Any Transfer in violation of this
provision shall be void.

 



5

    

(b) Prior to the Termination Date, in the event that such party becomes the
Record Holder or acquires beneficial ownership of, or the power to vote or
direct the voting of, any additional Common Units or other voting interests
with respect to the Partnership, such Covered Unitholder shall promptly notify
the Partnership of such Common Units or voting interests, such Common Units
or voting interests shall, without further action of the parties, be deemed
Covered Units and subject to the provisions of this Agreement, and the number
of Common Units held by such party set forth on  _Schedule A_ hereto shall be
deemed amended accordingly and such Common Units or voting interests shall
automatically become subject to the terms of this Agreement.

 

8\. _Transfer Agent_. Each Covered Unitholder hereby authorizes the
Partnership or its counsel to notify the Partnerships transfer agent that
there is a stop transfer order with respect to all Covered Units (and that
this Agreement places limits on the voting and Transfer of such Covered
Units); _provided, however_ , the Partnership or its counsel shall further
notify the Partnerships transfer agent to lift and vacate the stop transfer
order with respect to the Covered Units on the Termination Date.

 

9\. _Unitholder Capacity_. This Agreement is being entered into by each
Covered Unitholder solely in its capacity as a holder of Common Units, and
nothing in this Agreement shall restrict or limit the ability of such Covered
Unitholder or any of its respective Affiliates or any employee thereof who is
a director or officer of the Partnership to take any action in his or her
capacity as a director or officer of the Partnership to the extent
specifically permitted by the Merger Agreement.

 

10\. _Disclosure_. Each Covered Unitholder hereby authorizes the Partnership
to publish and disclose in any announcement or disclosure required by the SEC
and in the Consent Statement/Prospectus such partys identity and ownership of
the Covered Units and the nature of such partys obligations under this
Agreement.

 

11\. _Non-Survival of Representations and Warranties_. The representations
and warranties of each Covered Unitholder contained herein shall not survive
the Termination Date or the closing of the transactions contemplated hereby
and by the Merger Agreement.

 

12\. _Amendment and Modification_. This Agreement may not be amended, modified
or supplemented in any manner, whether by course of conduct or otherwise,
except by an instrument in writing specifically designated as an amendment
hereto, signed on behalf of each party hereto and otherwise as expressly set
forth herein.

 

13\. _Waiver_. No failure or delay of any party in exercising any right or
remedy hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or
partial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or
discontinuance of steps to enforce such right or power, or any course of
conduct, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise
of any other right or power. The rights and remedies of the parties hereunder
are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies which they
would otherwise have hereunder. Any agreement on the part of a party to any
such waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument executed
and delivered by such party.
