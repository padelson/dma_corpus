prior to the Effective Time, shall be the by-laws of the Surviving
Corporation after the Effective Time, and thereafter may be amended in
accordance with their terms and as provided by applicable law.



(b) The certificate of formation of Merger Sub II, as in effect immediately
prior to the Subsequent Merger Effective Time, shall be the certificate of
formation of the Surviving Corporation after the Subsequent Merger Effective
Time, and thereafter may be amended in accordance with its terms and as
provided by applicable law;



1.9 _Manager_. Gateway shall be the sole member and manager of the Surviving
Corporation at the Subsequent Merger Effective Time.



1.10 _Officers_. The officers of eMachines immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation after the Effective
Time and after the Subsequent Merger Effective Time, and shall serve in
such capacity until the earlier of their resignation or removal, or until
their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified, as
the case may be.



1.11 _Further Actions_. At and after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall take all action as shall be required in connection with the
Merger and the Subsequent Merger, as applicable, including, but not limited
to, the execution and delivery of any further deeds, assignments, instruments
or documents as are necessary or desirable to carry out and effectuate the
Merger, the Subsequent Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby.



1.12 _Effect on Capital Stock of eMachines and Merger Sub_. At the Effective
Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further action on the part of
the holder of any securities of eMachines or Merger Sub: 



(a) _Capital Stock_. Subject to the adjustments described in Section 1.17,
each issued and outstanding share of eMachines Common Stock shall be converted
automatically into the right to receive from the Surviving Corporation the
number of shares of Gateway Common Stock (the " _Stock Merger Consideration_
") determined by dividing 47,666,655 by the sum of (i) the number of shares of
eMachines Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Closing plus (ii)
the number of shares of eMachines Common Stock to be outstanding prior to the
Closing that are issued in respect of the Phantom Plan, as set forth on the
Phantom Stock Notice (such sum, the " _eMachines Share Equivalents_ ") and the
amount of cash determined by dividing $28,000,000 by the number of eMachines
Share Equivalents (the " _Cash Merger Consideration_ ," and together with the
Stock Merger Consideration, the " _Merger Consideration_ "), payable, without
interest to the holder of such share, at the Closing upon surrender of the
certificate that formerly evidenced such share. At the Effective Time, all
shares of eMachines Common Stock upon which the Merger Consideration is
payable pursuant to this Section 1.12 shall no longer be outstanding and
shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and
each holder of a certificate representing



 

6 any such shares of eMachines Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration in
respect of such holders shares.



(b) _Treatment of Phantom Stock Rights_.



(i) Prior to the Closing Date, eMachines shall terminate the eMachines 2003
Phantom Stock Plan (the " _Phantom Stock Plan_ ") and related agreements and
cancel all awards granted under such plan (a " _Phantom Stock Award_ ") to any
current or former officer, director, employee or agent (each, a " _Phantom
Stock Holder_ ") in return for the issuance to each such Phantom Stock Holder
of Shares of eMachines Common Stock or shares of eMachines restricted stock as
follows:



(A) Each Phantom Stock Holder whose Phantom Stock Award, as of the date
hereof, is vested in accordance with the terms of the original vesting
schedule of the Phantom Stock Plan, shall be entitled to receive, prior to the
Closing Date, an award of a number of shares of eMachines Common Stock set
forth opposite the name of such Phantom Stock Holder in the Phantom Stock
Notice. 



(B) Each Phantom Stock Holder whose Phantom Stock Award, as of the date
hereof, would have remained subject to future vesting in accordance with the
original vesting schedule of the Phantom Stock Plan, shall be entitled to
receive, prior to the Closing, a restricted stock unit award pursuant to a
restricted stock unit plan or arrangement to be established by eMachines, in
an amount set forth opposite the name of such Phantom Stock Holder in the
Phantom Stock Notice of the eMachines Disclosure Schedule. Such restricted
stock unit award shall, upon the Closing, be converted into the Merger
Consideration. The Stock Merger Consideration represented thereby shall, after
the Merger continue to be subject to the same vesting schedule as provided in
the Phantom Stock Plan unless otherwise accelerated by Gateway, in its sole
discretion. Such grants shall be subject to forfeiture upon termination by the
Company for "Cause" or voluntary termination without "Good Reason". Such
grants shall, however, fully vest upon termination of the recipients
employment by the Company without "Cause" or voluntarily by the recipient for
"Good Reason" or upon the recipients death or disability. For purposes of
this Section 1.12(b)(i)(B), "Cause" and "Good Reason" shall be defined in the
same manner as in the Employment Agreement, dated as of April 30, 2001,
between eMachines and Adam Andersen, except that Cause for this purpose shall
not include clause (vi) of such definition. Any forfeiture hereunder which
results in release of shares of Gateway Common Stock under the restricted
stock unit plan or arrangement shall be returned to Mr. Lap Shun Hui (the "
_Reallocation Shares_ ") and deposited in the Escrow (as defined below)
pursuant to Section 1.14 of this Agreement, unless at such time the Escrow



 

7 shall have been terminated, in which case such shares shall be returned
directly to Mr. Lap Shun Hui.



(ii) eMachines shall take such actions as may be necessary to properly effect
the foregoing provisions in Section 1.12(b)(i) and (ii) including, but not
limited to, obtaining such written consent, if any, from each Phantom Stock
Holder in connection with termination of the Phantom Stock Awards prior to,
and conditional upon, the execution of this Agreement. Copies of such consents
shall be provided to Gateway.



(c) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each share of Merger Sub common stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into and become one fully paid and nonassessable share of capital
stock of the Surviving Corporation (" _Surviving Corporation Common Stock_ ").



1.13 _eMachines Dividend_. Prior to the Closing and to the conversion of the
Phantom Stock Plan as provided in Section 1.12(b), eMachines shall declare
and pay to the eMachines Stockholders a cash dividend in the amount of
$20,000,000 (the " _eMachines Dividend_ ").



 

1.14 _Indemnification Escrow_. At the Closing, Gateway shall deposit 10
million shares of Gateway Common Stock to be received by Mr. Lap Shun Hui as
Stock Merger Consideration (the " _Indemnification Shares_ ") into an escrow
(the " _Escrow_ ") to secure the indemnification obligations of the Gateway
Share Recipients as set forth in the Indemnification Agreement pursuant to
the terms of an escrow agreement substantially in the form of Exhibit F (the "
_Indemnification Escrow Agreement_ ") to be entered into at or prior to the
Closing among Mr. Lap Shun Hui, Gateway and a financial
institution designated by Gateway and reasonably acceptable to Mr. Lap Shun
Hui, as the escrow agent for the Indemnification Shares (the " _Escrow Agent_
").



 

1.15 _Gateway Stock Grants_. At the Effective Time of the Merger, Gateway
shall grant to each of the employees of eMachines identified by eMachines in
a notice provided to Gateway not less than five (5) business days prior to the
Closing, other than any employee who is a participant in the Phantom Stock
Plan on the date hereof or is otherwise entitled to receive a cash bonus
pursuant to Section 1.16, a total number of shares of Gateway Common Stock
set forth in such notice. The allocation of such shares shall be in the sole
discretion of Gateway; __provided__ , that the aggregate number of shares of
Gateway Common Stock to be granted pursuant to this Section 1.15 shall be
2,333,345 shares. As a condition to such receipt, each such employee shall
enter in to the Stockholders Agreement; __provided_ ,_ that all of the shares
so granted shall be fully vested at the Closing unless such shares are
granted to any Employee who is a Participant in the Stock Plan on the date
hereof, in which case such shares shall vest on the same schedule as the
shares to be issued pursuant to Section 1.12(b)(i). 



1.16 _Payment of Bonuses to Certain eMachines Employees_. Immediately prior
to the Merger, eMachines shall pay to the employees of eMachines, other than
any employee who is a participant in the Phantom Stock Plan on the date



 

8 hereof or is otherwise entitled to receive shares of Gateway Common Stock
pursuant to Section 1.15, cash bonuses in an aggregate amount of $2,000,000
(such bonuses, in the aggregate, the " _Bonus_ "). The allocation of the
bonuses among any such employees shall be in the sole discretion of eMachines.
To the extent that the cash resources of eMachines are insufficient to pay
any such amounts, the amounts will be advanced to eMachines by Gateway at the
Effective Time of the Merger.



1.17 _Working Capital; Adjustments to Merger Consideration_.



(a) The Merger Consideration is subject to adjustment as provided in Section
1.17(b) if as of 11:59 p.m. on the day preceding the Closing Date (as defined
below) the (" _Adjustment Time_ ") (i) the Working Capital (as defined below)
is less than $0, not taking into account payment of the eMachines Dividend, or
the Bonus, except to the extent advanced by Gateway pursuant to Section 1.16,
or (ii) there is any outstanding Debt (as defined below). " _Working Capital_
" shall mean the sum of the current assets of eMachines and its Subsidiaries
(as defined below) at the Adjustment Time, excluding any tax assets resulting
from the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, as
determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the
United States (" _GAAP_ "), less the sum of the current liabilities of
eMachines and its Subsidiaries at the Adjustment Time as determined in
accordance with GAAP. " _Debt_ " shall mean all debt properly includable in a
balance sheet of eMachines prepared in accordance with GAAP, other than debt
included in Working Capital provided, however, that the amount outstanding
under any letters of credit that have not been drawn as of the Adjustment Time
shall not be considered to be Debt.



(b) If the Working Capital of eMachines and all of its Subsidiaries on a
consolidated basis as of the Adjustment Time is less than $0, not taking into
account payment of the eMachines Dividend, or the Bonus, except to the extent
advanced by Gateway pursuant to Section 1.16, then the Merger
Consideration shall be decreased by the excess of $0 over the amount of
Working Capital of eMachines and all of its Subsidiaries on a consolidated
basis as of the Adjustment Time divided by the number of eMachines Share
Equivalents. In addition, the Merger Consideration shall be decreased by the
amount of Debt of eMachines and all of its Subsidiaries on a consolidated
basis as of the Adjustment Time divided by the number of shares of eMachines
Share Equivalents. " _Subsidiary_ " shall mean, with respect to any Person,
any corporation or other organization, whether incorporated or unincorporated,
of which at least a majority of the securities or other interests having by
their terms ordinary voting power to elect a majority of the Board of
Directors or others performing similar functions with respect to such
corporation or other organizations directly or indirectly owned or controlled
by such Person or by any one or more of its Subsidiaries, or by such Person
and one or more of its Subsidiaries, or by such Person and one or more of its
partner (excluding any such partnership where such Person or any Subsidiary of
such party does not have a majority of the voting interest in such
partnership).



(c) A preliminary determination of the adjustment of the Merger Consideration
under Section 1.17(b) shall be made by eMachines in good faith



 

9 after consultation with Gateway and its auditors in a preliminary settlement
statement (the " _Preliminary Settlement Statement_ ") delivered to Gateway
not later than two (2) business days before the Closing Date, which
Preliminary Settlement Statement (i) shall contain all information reasonably
necessary to determine such adjustment (if any) and such other information as
may be reasonably requested by Gateway, and (ii) shall be certified by an
authorized officer of eMachines, to be true, correct and complete as of the
date thereof.



(d) If the Preliminary Settlement Statement requires any adjustment in the
Merger Consideration, as described in Section 1.17(b), then such adjustment
shall be reflected first in the payment of the Cash Merger Consideration on
the Closing Date pursuant to Section 1.12(a), and if such adjustment
exceeds the amount of Cash Merger Consideration, then the adjustment in
excess of the Cash Merger Consideration (the " _Excess_ ") shall be reflected
as an adjustment to the Stock Merger Consideration. If an adjustment is
required to the Stock Merger Consideration pursuant to the previous sentence,
then the Stock Merger Consideration shall be computed pursuant to the
following formula;



     |  |  |  |  |  | 
---|---|---|---|---|---|--- 
   |  |  | 
   _A_  |  | _=_  |  | _T  _ |  | _ _ E __

    |  |  |  |

* * * 

   |  | 
    |  |  |  |

_O_ 

 



    _A_ = | the Stock Merger Consideration as adjusted 
---|--- 



    _T_ = | the Total Number of shares of Gateway Common Stock to be
issued in connection with the Merger prior to any adjustment pursuant to this
Section 1.17(d) 
---|--- 


    _E_ = | the total amount of the Excess

    _P_ = | the average closing price per share of Gateway Common Stock on

ending on the trading day before the Closing Date (the " _Trading Price_ ") 
---|--- 



    _O_ = | the total number of eMachines Share Equivalents outstanding at
the Effective Time 
---|--- 



(e) A final determination of the adjustment of the Merger Consideration
required to be made under Section 1.17(b) shall be made in good faith by
Gateway in a separate final settlement statement (the " _Final Settlement
Statement_ ") delivered to Mr. Lap Shun Hui not later than sixty (60) days
after the Closing Date, which Final Settlement Statement shall (i) cover
those adjustments not adjusted as of the Closing Date under the Preliminary
Settlement Statement and those adjustments (if any) which require subsequent
adjustment, (ii) contain all information reasonably necessary to determine
such adjustments and such other information as may be reasonably requested by
Mr. Lap Shun Hui, and (iii) be certified by an authorized officer of Gateway
to be true, correct and complete as of the date thereof. Mr. Lap Shun Hui
shall review the Final Settlement Statement and, if he disapproves of any
determination contained in such statement, shall give Gateway written notice
stating his objections thereto and identifying



 

10 the reasons therefore within thirty (30) days after receipt of such Final
Settlement Statement (" _Objection Period_ "). If Mr. Lap Shun Hui has not
given Gateway any such written objections within said Objection Period, then
the amount payable pursuant to the Final Settlement Statement shall be paid by
the responsible party therefore within three (3) business days after the
expiration of said Objection Period as described below. If Mr. Lap Shun Hui
makes any such objections, then during the thirty (30) days next following the
date of Mr. Lap Shun Huis written notice of objections (the " _Discussion
Period_ "), Mr. Lap Shun Hui and Gateway shall attempt to resolve their
disagreements concerning the Final Settlement Statement or, if they are unable
to do so, they shall agree upon the amount, if any, which is not in dispute.
During such Discussion Period, Mr. Lap Shun Hui and Gateway may, at its or his
cost and expense, utilize its or his public accountants to assist in
attempting to resolve their differences or in agreeing upon the undisputed
amount, if any. Any undisputed amounts shall be paid by the responsible party
as described below therefore to the other party within three (3) business days
after the expiration of the Discussion Period, as described below, and
the remaining disputed amounts shall be determined within forty-five (45)
days after the expiration of the Discussion Period by one partner with
substantial experience in the personal computer industry (as appropriate)
selected by the Los Angeles office of Ernst and Young LLP, independent
certified public accountants, which partner may be from said firm or from
another accounting firm (other than eMachines or Gateways independent public
accounting firms), (" _Arbiter_ "), which determination shall be final and
conclusive. Either Gateway or Mr. Lap Shun Hui may submit the disputed amounts
to the Arbiter. If neither Gateway nor Mr. Lap Shun Hui submits the disputed
amounts to the Arbiter within fifteen (15) days after the expiration of the
Discussion Period, then such amounts shall be deemed conclusively resolved in
the manner set forth in the Final Settlement Statement. The date ("
_Resolution Date_ ") on which the Final Settlement Statement shall be
considered resolved shall be the earlier of the following dates: (a) the date
of expiration of the Objection Period if Mr. Lap Shun Hui has not delivered
any written notice of objection thereto prior to such date; (b) the date of
expiration of the Discussion Period if Gateway and Mr. Lap Shun Hui have
resolved all disputed amounts prior to such date; (c) the date on which the
Arbiter determines the disputed amounts. Gateway, on the one hand, and Mr. Lap
Shun Hui, on the other, shall bear equally the expenses of the Arbiter. All
payments due under the Final Settlement Statement pursuant to this Section
1.17(e) shall be made either (i) by Gateway to Mr. Lap Shun Hui in cash; or
(ii) by Mr. Lap Shun Hui to Gateway in cash, as applicable, within three (3)
business days after the Resolution Date.

Except as set forth in the disclosure schedule prepared by eMachines and

this Agreement (or, if made as of a specified date, as of such date) and will

warranties that speak as of a specific date).

and in good standing to do business in each jurisdiction in which the nature
of its business or the ownership, operation or leasing of its properties, or
its tax status, makes such qualification necessary, except in the case of
clauses (ii) and (iii) above, where the failure to be so qualified would
not, individually or in the aggregate, have a eMachines Material Adverse
Effect. " _eMachines Material Adverse Effect_ " shall mean a material adverse
effect on the financial condition, assets and liabilities (taken together),
results of operations or businesses of eMachines and its Subsidiaries, taken
as a whole; _provided_ , _however_ , that none of the following shall be or
will be at the Closing, deemed to constitute and shall not be taken into
account in determining the occurrence of a eMachines Material Adverse Effect:
(i) any effect or change that results from the announcement or pendency of the
Merger or any other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
without limitation, the transactions contemplated by the Indemnification
Agreement, the Indemnification Escrow Agreement, the Stockholders Agreement,
the Standstill Agreement, the Non-Competition Agreements and the Employment

expressly permitted by the consent of Gateway or Merger Sub pursuant to this
Agreement, (iii) any effect or change relating to the economy or securities
markets in general, and (iv) any effect or change relating to the industries
in which eMachines operates, except to the extent that it has a materially
disproportionate effect (relative to other industry participants) on

necessary to authorize the execution and delivery by eMachines of this
Agreement or the consummation by it of the Merger and the Transactions.



2.3 _Binding Agreement_. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered
by eMachines and, assuming the due and valid authorization, execution and
delivery hereof by Gateway and Merger Sub, this Agreement is a valid and
binding



 

12 obligation of eMachines enforceable against eMachines in accordance with its
terms, except as limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent conveyance and other similar laws of

(a) Section 2.4(a) of the eMachines Disclosure Schedule sets forth the number
of authorized and issued and outstanding shares of the capital stock of
eMachines and each of its Subsidiaries as of the date hereof and as of the
Closing. All of the shares of eMachines Common Stock are, or will be at the

in Section 2.4(a) of the eMachines Disclosure Schedule, there are not, and at
the Closing there will not be, any capital stock or other equity interests in

subscriptions, options, warrants, calls, rights, convertible securities or
other agreements or commitments of any character obligating eMachines or any
of its Subsidiaries or any Affiliate (as defined below), to issue, transfer or
sell or register for sale any capital stock or other equity interests in
eMachines or any of its Subsidiaries. Neither eMachines nor any of its
Subsidiaries have granted any person rights to cause the registration for sale

2.5 of the eMachines Disclosure Schedule, the execution, delivery or
performance of this Agreement by eMachines, the consummation by eMachines of

provisions hereof will not (i) conflict with or result in any breach of any
provision of the certificate of incorporation, the bylaws or similar
organization documents of eMachines or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) require
any filing with, or permit, authorization, consent or approval of,
any Governmental Entity (as defined below) or other Person (as defined below)
(including, without limitation, consents from parties to loans, contracts,
leases and other agreements to which eMachines or any of its Subsidiaries is a
party), other than the filing of a premerger notification and report by
eMachines under the Hart-Scott Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as
amended (the " _HSR Act_ "), (iii) require any consent, approval or notice
under, or result in a violation or breach of, or constitute (with or without
due notice or the passage of time or both) a default (or give rise to any
right of termination, amendment, cancellation or acceleration) under, any of
the terms, conditions or provisions of any agreement to which eMachines or
any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which the assets or properties of
eMachines or any of its Subsidiaries is bound except where the failure to
obtain any such consent or approval or to file or make such notice or
such violation, breach or default would not reasonably be expected to have a
eMachines Material Adverse Effect, or (iv) violate any order, writ,
injunction, decree, statute, rule or regulation applicable to eMachines or any
of its Subsidiaries or any of their assets or properties, except for any
violation that would not reasonably be expected to result in a eMachines
Material Adverse Effect. To the knowledge of eMachines, no state takeover
statute is applicable to the Merger or the Transactions. " _Governmental
Entity_ " shall mean a court, arbitral tribunal, administrative agency or
other governmental or other regulatory authority or agency. " _Person_ " shall

2.6 _Financial Statements_.



 

(a) Section 2.6(a)(i) of the eMachines Disclosure Schedule contains the
audited balance sheet of eMachines as of December 28, 2002 (the " _2002
Balance Sheet_ ") and the related audited statements of operations, changes in
stockholders equity and cash flows for the year then ended, including in each
case the notes thereto (together with the 2002 Balance Sheet, the " _2002
Audited Financial Statements_ "). The 2002 Audited Financial Statements fairly
present in all material respects the consolidated financial condition of
eMachines and its Subsidiaries as of such date and the consolidated
results of their operations and their consolidated cash flows for the year
then ended. Section 2.6(a)(ii) of the eMachines Disclosure Schedule contains
(x) the unaudited balance sheet for eMachines as of December 27, 2003 (the "
_Unaudited Balance Sheet_ ") and (y) the unaudited statement of operations
for eMachines for the fiscal year ended December 27, 2003, (collectively, with
the Unaudited Balance Sheet, the " _Unaudited Financial Statements_ "). The
Unaudited Financial Statements fairly present in all material respects the
consolidated financial condition of eMachines and its Subsidiaries as of such
date and the consolidated results of their operations and cash flows for the
year then



 

14 ended subject, in each case, to normal year-end audit adjustments (which are
not expected to be, in the aggregate, materially adverse to eMachines and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole) and except to the extent such Unaudited
Financial Statements do not contain any notes. On or prior to the Closing
Date, eMachines shall deliver to Gateway the audited balance sheet of
eMachines as of December 27, 2003 (the " _2003 Balance Sheet_ ") and the
related audited statements of operations, changes in stockholders equity and
cash flows for the year then ended, including in each case the notes thereto
(the " _2003 Financial Statements_ " and together with the 2002 Audited
Financial Statements, the " _Audited Financial Statements_ "). The 2003
Financial Statements will be substantially the same as the Unaudited
Financial Statements except (i) for normal year-end audit adjustments (which
shall not be, in the aggregate, materially adverse to eMachines and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole), (ii) that the 2003 Financial Statements will
contain notes and (iii) that the 2003 Financial Statements will contain an
unqualified opinion of the auditor in substantially the same form as contained
in the 2002 Audited Financial Statements. The 2003 Financial Statements when
delivered will fairly present in all material respects the consolidated
financial condition of eMachines and its Subsidiaries as of such date and the
consolidated results of their operations and their consolidated cash flows for
the year then ended.



(b) The Audited Financial Statements, including the related schedules and
notes thereto, and except for normal year-end adjustments and the absence of
notes, the Unaudited Financial Statements have all been prepared (or will be
prepared) in accordance with GAAP applied consistently throughout the
periods involved except as disclosed therein.



2.7 _Books and Records_. The books of account, minute books, stock record
books and other records (collectively, the " _Records_ ") of eMachines and its
Subsidiaries are complete and correct in all material respects and have been
maintained in accordance with reasonable business practices.



2.8 _Absence of Undisclosed Liabilities_. Except as reflected or reserved
against in the 2002 Balance Sheet (including the notes thereto), or the
Unaudited Balance Sheet, or as disclosed in Section 2.8 of the eMachines
Disclosure Schedule, neither eMachines nor any of its Subsidiaries at
December 27, 2003 or at the date hereof or on the Closing Date had, have or
will have any liabilities (whether contingent or absolute, direct or indirect,
known or unknown or matured or unmatured) other than (i) trade accounts
payable and other liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business and
consistent with past practices after December 27, 2003, or (ii) liabilities
which individually or in the aggregate are not material to the business of
eMachines and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole.



2.9 _Absence of Certain Changes_. Except as set forth in Section 2.9 of the
eMachines Disclosure Schedule, and other than the execution and delivery of
this Agreement and the Transactions to take place pursuant hereto on or prior
to the Closing Date, since December 27, 2003 there has not been any material
adverse change, nor any event or development which, individually or together
with other such events, would reasonably be expected to result in a material
adverse change, in the financial condition, 



 

15 assets and liabilities, results of operations or businesses of eMachines and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and neither eMachines nor its
Subsidiaries has:



(a) suffered any material adverse change in its working capital, financial
condition, results of operation, assets, liabilities (absolute, accrued or
contingent), reserves, business, operations or prospects;



(b) with respect to eMachines, declared, paid or set aside for payment any
dividend or other distribution in respect of eMachines Common Stock or
redeemed, purchased or otherwise acquired, directly or indirectly, any shares

McCloy LLP, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Gateway, dated as
of the Closing Date, on the basis of facts, representations and assumptions
set forth in such opinion, and certificates obtained from officers of Gateway,
Merger Sub and eMachines, all of which are consistent with the state of facts

shall have become final and non-appealable;



 

48 (c) by either Gateway or eMachines if the Merger shall not have been
consummated before June 30, 2004, (unless the failure to consummate the

This INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENT (this " _Agreement_ ") is made and entered into
as of [ _ _], 2004, between Mr. Lap Shun (John) Hui (" _Mr. Hui"_

WHEREAS, the execution and delivery of this Agreement constitutes a condition
precedent to Gateways obligations to consummate the transactions contemplated
in the Merger Agreement.



WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, Mr. Hui, Gateway
and the Escrow Agent have entered into an Indemnification Escrow Agreement,
dated as of the date hereof (the " _Indemnification Escrow Agreement_ ").



WHEREAS, the parties hereto desire that this Agreement become effective
immediately upon, and only upon, the Effective Time.

 



NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and of the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements set forth in this Agreement, the parties
hereto, intending to be legally bound, agree as follows:



1\. _Indemnification_.



(a) Except as provided in Section 2 hereof and subject to the provisions of
Sections 3, 4 and 5 hereof, from and after the Closing, Mr. Hui shall
indemnify and hold harmless Gateway and its Affiliates (including, after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation), each of their respective direct or
indirect parent entities, officers, directors, employees, agents
and representatives, and each of the heirs, executors, successors and assigns
of any of the foregoing (each individually, an " _Indemnified Party_ " and, collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ "),
against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities and reasonable expenses
whenever arising or incurred (including, without limitation, amounts paid in
settlement, reasonable costs of investigation and reasonable attorneys and
experts fees and expenses), whether or not involving a third party claim
(hereinafter " _Losses_ "):



(i) arising out of or resulting from any breach of or inaccuracy in any
representation or warranty (without giving effect to any materiality or
eMachines Material Adverse Effect qualification or exception therein (other
than with respect to the representations and warranties contained in Sections
2.6, 2.7, 2.8, 2.9, 2.16 and 2.18 of the Merger Agreement)) made by eMachines
in the Merger Agreement;



(ii) arising from or in connection with any breach of any covenant or
agreement of eMachines in the Merger Agreement;



(iii) arising from or in connection with the litigation captioned _Packard v.
eMachines, Inc._ filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern
District of Texas, _Gabriele v. eMachines, Inc._ filed in the 58th Judicial
District Court of Jefferson County, Texas, and _Stroud v. eMachines, Inc._
filed in the Oklahoma District Court for Cleveland County, or resulting case
if any such case is refiled (arising out of substantially the same facts and
circumstances and without regard to a new representative plaintiff or new
case number), transferred, removed or assigned or a plaintiff is substituted
in any such case; _provided_ , _however_ , that the fees and expenses of
counsel (including, without limitation, the fees and expenses of experts and
others retained to provide services in connection with such proceeding) and
the out-of-pocket expenses incurred (collectively, " _Defense Costs_ ") in
defending such litigation shall not be included as Losses pursuant to this
clause (iii);



(iv) arising from or in connection with the litigation captioned _Gholl v.
eMachines, Inc._ relating to a petition for appraisal filed in the Delaware
Court of Chancery, to the extent such Losses are not covered by the
approximately $1,400,000 deposited in escrow on behalf of the former
stockholders, or resulting case if such case is refiled (arising out of
substantially the same facts and circumstances and without regard to a new
representative plaintiff or new case number), transferred, removed or
assigned or a plaintiff is substituted in such case; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the Defense Costs incurred in defending such litigation shall not be
included as Losses pursuant to this clause (iv); and

 



 

2 (v) arising from or in connection with the litigation captioned _Dvorchak v.

Losses are not covered by insurance proceeds, or resulting case if such case
is refiled (arising out of substantially the same facts and circumstances and
without regard to a new representative plaintiff or a new case number),
transferred, removed or assigned or a plaintiff is substituted in such case;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Defense Costs incurred in defending such
litigation shall not be included as Losses pursuant to this clause (v).



(b) Mr. Hui shall not be entitled to make any claim for indemnity or
contribution against eMachines or any of its Subsidiaries in respect of his
indemnification obligations under this Section 1 or otherwise in the event of
any breach of or inaccuracy in the representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements of eMachines or its Subsidiaries in the Merger Agreement, it
being understood that it is the intention of the parties that Mr. Hui shall
be solely responsible for any such breaches and inaccuracies to the extent
provided herein.



2\. _Tax Matters_.



(a) Notwithstanding any matter listed on the eMachines Disclosure Schedule,
from and after the Closing, Mr. Hui shall indemnify and hold harmless, each
of the Indemnified Parties against any Losses and any and all liabilities with
respect to:



(i) Taxes imposed on eMachines or any of its Subsidiaries for any period
beginning before and ending on or before December 27, 2003 (the "Cut-off
Date" and the period ending thereon a "Pre-Cut-off Period") and any Pre-Cut-
off Straddle Period (as defined below) except to the extent such Taxes are
expressly accrued for in the Unaudited Financial Statements in accordance
with GAAP in an amount not to exceed $3.5 million and taking into account any
permitted carryback of net operating losses from the tax period beginning on
December 28, 2003; _provided_ , _however_ , in the event of any
such carryback of net operating losses, Mr. Hui shall pay eMachines an amount
equal to the product of (x) the effective income tax rate of eMachines and/or
its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, (y) the amount of such net operating
losses carried back and used in such



 

3 Pre-Cut-off Period and (z) 20%. Any such payment by Mr. Hui in respect of such
carryback shall be made at the time of filing of the tax return on which the
use of the net operating loss carryback is reported. Such accrual for Taxes in
the Unaudited Financial Statement includes current income taxes payable and
contingent income tax liability (and not book versus tax timing reserves);



(ii) a breach of any representation or warranty contained in Section 2.21 of
the Merger Agreement or any covenants of eMachines, or any of its Subsidiaries
or Mr. Hui relating to Taxes set forth herein or the Merger Agreement except
to the extent such Taxes are expressly accrued for in the Unaudited Financial
Statements in accordance with GAAP in an amount not to exceed $3.5 million.
Such accrual for Taxes includes current income taxes payable and contingent
income tax liability (and not book versus tax timing reserves); and



(iii) all Taxes of a person other than the eMachines or its Subsidiaries that
are imposed on eMachines or its Subsidiaries under section 1.1502-6 of the
Treasury Regulations (and corresponding provisions of state, local or foreign
Law) as a result of being a member of any federal, state, local or foreign
consolidated, unitary, combined or similar group for any taxable period ending
on or before, or that includes, the Cut-off Date.



(b) Mr. Hui shall not be entitled to make any claim for indemnity or
contribution against eMachines or any of its Subsidiaries in respect of the
indemnification obligations of Mr. Hui under this Section 2 or otherwise in
the event of any breach of or inaccuracy in the representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements of eMachines or its Subsidiaries in the Merger
Agreement or in this Agreement, it being understood that it is the intention
of the parties that Mr. Hui shall be solely responsible for any such breaches
and inaccuracies to the extent provided herein.



(c) eMachines shall be responsible for all Tax Returns to be filed by
eMachines or any of its Subsidiaries (or by Mr. Hui on the behalf of such
entities). All Tax Returns filed in respect of a Pre-Cut off Period ("a Pre-
Cut-off Period Tax Return") (and any amended Pre-Cut-off Tax Returns) shall
be prepared and filed in a manner that is consistent with the prior practice
of eMachines and its Subsidiaries with respect to its 2002 Income Tax Returns,
except as required by applicable law. Mr. Hui shall cause to be prepared, at
eMachines expense, all Pre-Cut-off Tax Returns to be filed by eMachines or
its Subsidiaries with respect to their Pre-Cut-off Period Tax Returns (and
amended



 

4 Pre-Cut-off Tax Returns) provided that Mr. Hui shall pay and indemnify out-of
pocket costs paid after the date hereof by eMachines and/or its Subsidiaries
with respect to such Tax Returns in excess of $75,000. Mr. Hui shall provide
Gateway with such Tax Returns to be filed after the Closing at least 30 days
prior to their due date (taking into account extensions) together with Mr.
Huis calculation of the Tax for the Pre-Cut-off Period and the details
supporting such calculation. Gateway may, after receipt of such draft Tax
Return and calculation (with supporting details), notify Mr. Hui, in writing,
of any disagreement with such Tax Return and/or calculation to the extent it
determines that any position proposed to be taken in such Tax Return lack
"substantial authority" within the meaning of Treasury Regulation
Section 1.6662-4(d)(2) ("Substantial Authority"). If Gateway notifies Mr.
Hui, in writing, of any such disagreement, Gateway and Mr. Hui shall proceed
in good faith to attempt to resolve such disagreement. If they do not resolve
such disagreement by the due date for the filing of such Tax Return
(including extensions), Gateway shall cause the Tax Return to be filed
consistent with its determination of the item(s) in dispute and an independent
certified accounting firm mutually acceptable to each of Mr. Hui and Gateway
(the " _Neutral Auditors_ ") shall be retained to determine whether
Substantial Authority exists for the positions proposed to be taken by Mr. Hui
that are disputed by Gateway. Any such determination by the Neutral Auditors
shall be in writing and final and conclusive. Gateway, on the one hand, and
Mr. Hui, on the other, shall bear equally the expenses of the Neutral
Auditors. No later than five (5) Business Days prior to the filing of Pre-Cut-
off Date Tax Returns, Mr. Hui shall pay eMachines and/or its Subsidiaries all
Taxes due in respect of a Pre-Cut-off Period Tax Return and his share of Taxes
of eMachines or its Subsidiaries (determined in accordance with this Section
2(c)) in respect of a Straddle Period except to the extent such Taxes are
expressly accrued for in the Unaudited Financial Statements in accordance with
GAAP in an amount not to exceed $3.5 million provided that if any items in
respect of such Tax Return are unresolved at such time, such items shall be
determined in accordance with Gateways determination of such items in
calculating the Taxes due and to be paid by Mr. Hui. Such accrual for Taxes
includes current income tax payables and contingent income tax liability (and
not book versus tax timing reserves). If the disputed items, as determined by
the Neutral Auditors, for the Pre-Cut-off Period are consistent with the
proposed position of Mr. Hui, Gateway shall amend the Tax Returns reflecting
any such position to reflect the position of Mr. Hui and to the extent
Gateway actually receives any refund attributable to such amendment with
respect to the treatment of the disputed item, Gateway will pay such amounts
to Mr. Hui. Subject to this Section 2(c) and Section 2(a), eMachines and its
Subsidiaries shall file the Tax Returns prepared by Mr. Hui and shall pay or
cause to be paid all Taxes due and payable in respect of all Pre-Cut-off
Period Tax Returns (or, in the case of items in dispute (as described above)



 

5 that are not resolved by the due date for the filing of such Tax Return
(including extensions), such Tax Return shall be filed in accordance with
Gateways determination of the items in dispute.



For purposes of this Section 2(c), in order to apportion appropriately any
Taxes relating to a period of eMachines or any of its Subsidiaries that
begins before the Cut-off Date and ends after the Cut-off Date (a " _Straddle
Period_ "), Gateway and Mr. Hui shall, to the extent permitted under
applicable law, elect with the relevant Tax Authority to treat for all Tax
purposes the Cut-off Date as the last day of the taxable year or period of
eMachines or its Subsidiaries. In any case where applicable Law does not
permit eMachines to treat the Cut-off Date as the last day of the taxable year
or period, the portion of any Taxes that are allocable to the portion of the
Straddle Period ending on and including the Cut-off Date (the _"Pre-Cut-off
Straddle Period"_ ) shall be: (A) in the case of Taxes that are imposed on a
periodic basis (and not based on invoices, receipts, sales or payments),
deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for the entire period multiplied by a
fraction the numerator of which is the number of calendar days in the Straddle
Period ending on (and including) the Cut-off Date and the denominator of
which is the number of calendar days in the entire relevant Straddle Period,
and (B) in the case of Taxes not described in clause (A) (such as taxes that
are either (x) based upon or related to income or receipts, or (y) imposed in
connection with any sale or other transfer or assignment of property (real or
personal, tangible or intangible)), deemed equal to the amount that would be
payable if the taxable year or period ended and the books closed at the close
of the Cut-off Date.



In the case of a Tax Return other than a Pre-Cut-off Tax Return, Gateway,
eMachines or any of their respective Subsidiaries shall prepare any such Tax
Return in their sole and absolute discretion provided that in the case of any
net operating loss generated for income tax purposes in a Tax year of
eMachines or any of its Subsidiaries beginning December 28, 2003 and ending on
the Closing Date, Gateway shall not cause to be made, and neither eMachines
nor any of its Subsidiaries shall make, an election pursuant to Section
172(b)(3) of the Code or any corresponding provision of state law with respect
to such Tax period of eMachines or any of its Subsidiaries.



 

(d) After the Closing Date, each of Gateway and eMachines, on the one hand,
and Mr. Hui, on the other, shall (i) provide, or cause to be provided, to
each others respective Subsidiaries, officers, employees, representatives and
Affiliates, such assistance as may reasonably be requested by any of them in
connection with the preparation of any Tax Return or any Audit of eMachines
in respect of which Gateway,



 

6 eMachines or Mr. Hui, as the case may be, is responsible pursuant to Sections
2(c) hereof, (ii) retain, or cause to be retained, for so long as any such
Taxable years or Audits shall remain open for adjustments, any records or
information which may be relevant to any such Tax Returns or Audits, and (iii)
compensate the other party for all reasonable costs incurred by such other
party in connection with providing any assistance requested pursuant to clause
(i). The assistance provided for in this Section 2(d) shall include without
limitation each of Gateway, eMachines and Mr. Hui (x) making their agents and
employees and the agents and employees of their respective Subsidiaries and
Affiliates available to each other on a mutually convenient basis to provide
such assistance as might reasonably be expected to be of use in connection
with any such Tax Returns or Audits and (y) providing, or causing to be
provided, such information as might reasonably be expected to be of use in
connection with any such Tax Returns or Audits, including without limitation
records, returns, schedules, documents, work papers, opinions, letters or
memoranda, or other relevant materials relating thereto.



(e) Each of Gateway and eMachines and Mr. Hui shall promptly inform, keep
regularly apprised of the progress with respect to, and notify the other in
writing after the receipt of any notice of any Audit in respect of any Tax
Return for which it was responsible hereunder which could affect the Tax
liability of such other party for any taxable year.



(f) Mr. Hui shall cause all Tax sharing agreements, Tax indemnification
agreements or similar contracts or arrangements with respect to or involving
eMachines or its Subsidiaries to be terminated as of the Closing and, after
the Closing, eMachines and its Subsidiaries shall not have any
further obligations under any such agreement.



(g) Any refunds or overpayment credits received by Gateway, eMachines or its
Subsidiaries or their successors of Taxes relating to taxable periods or
portions thereof ending on or before the Closing Date shall be for the account
of Gateway, eMachines or its Subsidiaries or their successors, as the case
may be; _provided_ , _however_ , that 80% of any refunds received by Gateway,
eMachines or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to any Pre-Cut-off Period of
eMachines or any of its Subsidiaries ending in 2000, 2001, 2002 or 2003 as a
result of the carryback of net operating losses from the tax period beginning
on December 28, 2003 shall be paid to Mr. Hui.



 

7 (h) Gateway shall prepare and timely file all relevant Tax Returns required to
be filed in respect of all sales (including bulk sales), use, transfer,
recording, ad valorem, privilege, documentary, gains, gross receipts,
registration, conveyance, excise, license, stamp, duties or similar Taxes and
fees together with any interest thereon, penalties, fines, costs, additions
to tax or additional amounts with respect thereto ( _"Transfer Taxes"_ )
arising out of, in connection with, or attributable to the transactions
effected pursuant to the Merger Agreement and notify the other parties in
writing of the Transfer Tax shown on such Tax Return and how such Transfer Tax
was calculated. No later than five (5) business days prior to the filing of
such Tax Return, Mr. Hui shall pay Gateway in immediately available funds 50%
of the amount of the Transfer Tax, as calculated by Gateway.



(i) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, any
obligations of the parties pursuant to this Section 2 and all representations
and warranties contained in Section 2.21 of the Merger Agreement shall be
unconditional and absolute and shall survive until sixty (60) days after the
expiration of the applicable statute of limitations (taking into account
any applicable extensions or tollings thereof) relating to the Taxes at
issue.



(j) If Mr. Hui is required to pay any amounts to any Indemnified Parties
pursuant to Section 2(a), then Mr. Hui shall also pay 50% of any expenses
incurred by Gateway eMachines or their Subsidiaries relating to
the preparation by Mr. Hui or his representative of Tax Returns pursuant to
Section 2(c) and 2(h).



3\. _Time Limitation on Certain Claims for Indemnification_.



(a) Any claim for indemnification under this Agreement must be asserted in
writing in accordance with the provisions of Section 5 of this Agreement;
_provided_ , _however_ , that (i) any claim pursuant to Section 1 (except for
claims relating to any indemnification obligations under Section 1(a)(iii),
Section 1(a)(iv) and Section 1(a)(v) hereof) must be asserted on or prior to
the thirtieth (30th) day after the delivery by Gateways independent
accountants to Gateway of the audited consolidated financial statements of
Gateway, as of, and for the year ended December 31, 2004, as appropriate,
(ii) any claim pursuant to Section 1(a)(iii), Section 1(a)(iv) and Section
1(a)(v) must be asserted within the periods contemplated by Section 10, and
(iii) any claim pursuant to Section 2 must be asserted on or prior to the
sixtieth (60th) day after the expiration of the applicable statute of
limitations (taking into account any applicable extensions or tollings
thereof) relating to the Taxes at issue.



 

8 (a) So long as any claim is asserted in writing in accordance with the
provisions of Section 5 of this Agreement on or prior to the time limitations
set forth in this Section 3, any right to indemnification under this Agreement
shall survive such time period through and until final determination of the
merits of any claim hereunder for indemnification and the amount of Losses
related thereto pursuant to written agreement, binding arbitration or final
nonappealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction.



4\. _Limitations on Indemnification_.



(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary and except in
respect of any Basket Exclusion (as hereinafter defined), Mr. Hui shall not
be obligated to pay any amounts pursuant to the indemnification obligations
hereof in respect of any Losses until the aggregate of such amounts exceeds
$2,000,000, and then Mr. Hui shall only be liable to pay amounts hereunder in
excess of $2,000,000 (the " _Deductible Amount_ ").



(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary and except in
respect of the Cap Exclusions (as hereinafter defined), the total maximum
aggregate indemnification payments hereunder for Mr. Hui for all claims for
Losses suffered by the Indemnified Parties pursuant to the indemnification
obligations in Section 1 shall not exceed the Fair Market Value (as defined in
the Indemnification Escrow Agreement and calculated with reference to the
date any indemnification claim is "finally determined" in accordance with the
provisions thereof) relating to the shares of Gateway Common Stock held in
escrow in accordance with the provisions of Section 10 hereof (the " _Maximum
Aggregate Indemnification_ "). Losses with respect to any Cap Exclusion shall
not be limited by the Maximum Aggregate Indemnification; that is, Mr. Hui
shall be obligated to pay all amounts pursuant to the indemnification
obligations hereof in respect of any Cap Exclusion. For purposes of this
Agreement, " _Cap Exclusion_ " shall mean:



(i) any indemnification obligations under Section 1(a)(v) hereof; and



(ii) any indemnification obligations pursuant to Section 2 hereof.



(c) Losses with respect to any Basket Exclusion shall not be subject to the
Deductible Amount; that is, Mr. Hui shall be obligated to pay all amounts
pursuant to the indemnification obligations hereof in respect of any Basket
Exclusion. For purposes of this Agreement, _"Basket Exclusion"_ shall mean:



 

9 (i) any Losses arising from or in connection with any breach of or inaccuracy
in the representations and warranties made by eMachines in Section 2.4
(Capitalization; Ownership of Shares; Subsidiaries) of the Merger Agreement;



(ii) any indemnification obligations under Section 1(a)(v) hereof; and



(iii) any indemnification obligations pursuant to Section 2 hereof.



(d) Each Indemnified Party shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
pursue responsive and available third party insurance, indemnification,
contribution or similar claims in respect of which a Claims Notice (as
hereinafter defined) is submitted. The amount of an Indemnifying
Partys liability under this Agreement shall be determined taking into
account any applicable insurance proceeds paid to the Indemnified Party and
any indemnity, contribution or other similar payment recovered by the
Indemnified Party from any third party with respect thereto, in each case to
the extent paid or recovered prior to the time the Indemnified Party receives
a payment (an " _Indemnity Payment_ ") required by this Agreement in respect
of any claim hereunder. In addition, if an Indemnified Party receives an
Indemnity Payment and subsequently receives any proceeds from any third party
indemnification, contribution, insurance or similar claim with respect to such
claim (the " _Recovered Proceeds_ "), then the Indemnified Party will pay to
the Indemnifying Party an amount equal to the excess of the Indemnity Payment
received over the amount of the Indemnity Payment that would have been due if
the Recovered Proceeds had been received, realized or recovered before the
Indemnity Payment was made. __



5\. _Procedures Relating to Indemnification_.



(a) _Notice of Asserted Liability_. With respect to third party claims, all
claims for indemnification by any Indemnified Party under this Section 5 shall
be asserted and resolved as follows: promptly after discovery of or receipt
by an Indemnified Party of notice of any demand, claim or circumstances,
which, with the lapse of time, are reasonably expected to give rise to a claim
or the commencement (or the threatened commencement) of any
action, proceeding or investigation (an " _Asserted Liability_ "), that may
result in Losses which are subject to indemnification hereunder, the
Indemnified Party shall give written notice thereof (the " _Claims Notice_ ")
to the 



 

10 Indemnifying Party. The Claims Notice shall describe the Asserted Liability in
reasonable detail, to the extent possible, and shall indicate the amount
(estimated, if necessary, and to the extent feasible) of the Losses that have
been or may be suffered by the Indemnified Party. The failure of an
Indemnified Party to provide a Claims Notice with reasonable promptness shall
not affect any indemnification obligations hereunder except to the extent that
the Indemnifying Party is actually and materially prejudiced thereby. Mr. Hui
acknowledges that this Agreement constitutes a Claims Notice that the
litigation referred to in Sections 1(a)(iii), 1(a)(iv) and 1(a)(v) constitutes
an Asserted Liability



(b) _Opportunity to Defend_.



(i) Except as provided in the last sentence of this clause (i) and except with
respect to the litigation referred to in Sections 1(a)(iii), 1(a)(iv) and
1(a)(v), which litigation Gateway shall defend, the Indemnifying Party may
elect to compromise or defend, at its own expense and by its own counsel, any
Asserted Liability; _provided_ , _however_ , that counsel for the
Indemnifying Party shall be approved by the Indemnified Party (whose approval
shall not unreasonably be withheld or delayed). If the Indemnifying Party
elects to compromise or defend such Asserted Liability, it shall, within 30
days (or sooner, if the nature of the Asserted Liability so requires), notify
the Indemnified Party of its intent to do so, and the Indemnified Party shall
cooperate, at the expense of the Indemnifying Party, in the compromise of, or
defense against, such Asserted Liability. If the Indemnifying Party elects
not to compromise or defend the Asserted Liability or fails to notify the
Indemnified Party of its election as herein provided, the Indemnified Party
may pay, compromise or defend such Asserted Liability with counsel reasonably
acceptable to the Indemnifying Party (at the Indemnifying Partys sole cost
and expense in the event that the Indemnifying Party is determined to be
liable hereunder). Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Indemnifying
Party nor the Indemnified Party may settle or compromise any claim over the
objection of the other; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the claim is for
money damages only, the Indemnifying Party can settle or compromise any
such claim solely for money damages without the consent of the Indemnified
Party unless such Asserted Liability relates to Taxes, in which case the
Indemnifying Party can settle or compromise any such claim without the consent
of the Indemnified Party;  _provided_ , _further_ , _however_ , that such
settlement or compromise could not, in the reasonable determination of Gateway
give rise or result in an increase in any current or future Tax liability of
Gateway, eMachines,



 

11 or any of their Affiliates in an amount equal to or greater than the Tax
liability which is the subject of such settlement. No settlement or
compromise may be entered into by an Indemnifying Party without an
unconditional and full release of the Indemnified Party reasonably acceptable
to its counsel. In any event, the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying
Party may participate, at their own expense, in defense of such Asserted
Liability. If the Indemnifying Party elects to defend any claim, the
Indemnified Party shall make available to the Indemnifying Party any books,
records or other documents within its control that are necessary or
appropriate for such defense (in the judgment of counsel engaged by the
Indemnifying Party). With respect to any Asserted Liability that relates to
Taxes and involves any period after the Cut-off Date, Gateway shall control
the conduct of any such Asserted Liability, through counsel of Gateways own
choosing, and Gateway shall have all rights to settle, compromise and/or
concede such Asserted Liability. Expenses of counsel for any Asserted
Liability in respect of a Straddle Period shall be allocated between the
parties consistent with the principles of the second paragraph of Section
2(c).



(ii) The Indemnified Party has the right to employ its own counsel in any
compromise of, or defense against, any Asserted Liability, or in connection
with the Indemnified Partys provision of reasonable cooperation and
assistance to the Indemnifying Party or the Indemnifying Partys counsel as
provided above, but the fees, expenses and other charges of such counsel
employed by the Indemnified Party will be at the expense of the Indemnified
Party unless (a) the employment of counsel by the Indemnified Party has been
authorized in writing by the Indemnifying Party or (b) the Indemnifying Party
has not in fact employed counsel to compromise or defend against the Asserted
Liability within the period provided in Section 5(b)(i). It is understood that
the Indemnifying Party shall not, in connection with any proceeding or
related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the reasonable
fees, disbursements and other charges of more than one separate firm (plus, if
required, one separate firm admitted to practice in a local jurisdiction) at
any one time retained by the Indemnified Party unless the employment of more
than one counsel has been authorized in writing by the Indemnifying Party.



(c) _Notice of Direct Claim._ In the event that an Indemnified Party has a
claim for indemnification that does not involve a third party (a " _Direct
Claim_ "), the Indemnified Party shall provide a written notice to the
Indemnifying Party of such Direct Claim with reasonable promptness,
specifying, to the extent known, the nature and



 

12 circumstances of such Direct Claim and the amount (estimated, if necessary,
and to the extent feasible) of the Losses incurred or reasonably expected to
be incurred in respect of such Direct Claim (a " _Gateway Payment Request_ ");
_provided_ , _however_ , the failure of an Indemnified Party to provide such
Gateway Payment Request with reasonable promptness shall not adversely affect
any indemnification obligations hereunder except to the extent that the
Indemnifying Party is actually and materially prejudiced thereby.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the failure to give such notice with
reasonable promptness will relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligation
under this Agreement in respect of the particular matter that is the subject
of the notice if the survival of the representation, warranty, covenant
or indemnification provision to which such claim related has expired, as set
forth in Section 3 of this Agreement. If, after delivery of a Gateway Payment
Request, the Indemnifying Party desires to dispute the propriety and/or amount
of the Direct Claim, the Indemnified Party and Indemnifying Parties shall
follow the procedures in Article III of the Indemnification Escrow Agreement
to resolve such dispute.



6\. _Certain Other Indemnity Matters_. From and after the Closing, the parties
agree that, except with respect to the Cap Exclusion, (a) the sole and
exclusive remedy in the absence of fraud with respect to any and all claims
arising out of or relating to a breach of or inaccuracy in any representations
or warranties or breach of any covenants or agreements under the Merger
Agreement and transactions contemplated thereby shall be pursuant to the
indemnification provisions set forth in this Agreement, (b) the sole recourse
of the Indemnified Parties with respect to the indemnification provisions set
forth in this Agreement shall be to the shares of Gateway Common Stock
deposited in escrow pursuant to the Indemnification Escrow Agreement and (c)
the Indemnifying Party shall not have any obligation or liability to make any
payments in respect of the indemnification provisions set forth in this
Agreement other than pursuant to the Indemnification Escrow Agreement.



7\. _Effect of Indemnification Payments_. The parties hereto agree that any
payments by Mr. Hui in respect of his indemnification obligations pursuant to
this Agreement shall be treated as an adjustment to the Merger Consideration.



8\. _Payment of Indemnified Losses_. In the event that an amount hereunder
shall become due and payable by Mr. Hui to an Indemnified Party (a " _Claim
Amount_ "), the Indemnified Party shall send a Gateway Payment Request (as
defined in the Indemnification Escrow Agreement) or a Final Determination
Notice (as defined in the Indemnification Escrow Agreement), as applicable,
to Mr. Hui and to the Escrow



 

13 Agent. The portion of the Claim Amount that is equal to or less than the Fair
Market Value (as determined in accordance with the provisions of the
Indemnification Escrow Agreement) of the Escrow Shares (as defined in the
Indemnification Escrow Agreement) shall be disbursed to the Indemnified Party
from the Escrow Shares, subject to the terms of, and in accordance with the
procedures set forth in, the Indemnification Escrow Agreement . Solely with
respect to Losses with respect to any Cap Exclusion, within ten (10) business
days after receipt of a Gateway Payment Request or a Final
Determination Notice, as applicable, with a Claim Amount in excess of the
Fair Market Value of the Escrow Shares, Mr. Hui shall pay to the Indemnified
Party in cash in immediately available funds and/or Gateway Common Stock that
portion of the Claim Amount in excess of the Fair Market Value of the Escrow
Shares (the " _Excess Escrow Claim Amount_ ").



9\. _Representations and Warranties of Mr. Hui and Gateway; Covenant of
Gateway_.



(a) _Representations and Warranties of Mr. Hui._ Mr. Hui hereby represents

effect on the ability of Gateway to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement or perform its obligations hereunder.



(c) _Covenant of Gateway._ Gateway covenants to defend vigorously the
litigation referred to in Section 1(a)(iii) as agreed upon between Gateway

(b) If the litigation referred to in Sections 1(a)(iii), 1(a)(iv) and 1(a)(v)
has been resolved by written agreement or final nonappealable judgment by a
court of



 

15 competent jurisdiction by the 18th month anniversary of the Closing Date and

Fair Market Value equal to any claims validly made under Sections 1(a)(i),
1(a)(ii) or 2 of this Agreement that are pending on such anniversary;
_provided_ , _however_ , that as each such pending claim is paid, Mr. Hui

Agreement. To the extent permitted by law, the parties waive any provision of
law which renders any such provision prohibited or unenforceable in any
respect. 



20\. _Effectiveness_. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the
contrary, this Agreement shall become effective upon, and only upon, the
Effective Time.



 

19 If the Merger Agreement is terminated prior to the Effective Time, then this
Agreement shall be of no force or effect.



21\. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed by the parties in
multiple counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original and all which
together constitute one and the same instrument.



22\. _Expenses_. All costs and expenses incurred in connection with this
Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring such expense.



23\. _Section 7.1 of Merger Agreement_. Mr. Hui acknowledges and agrees that
notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, his obligations
pursuant to Section 7.1 of the Merger Agreement are separate and apart from
his rights and obligations pursuant to this Agreement.



* * * 



 

20 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed this Agreement to be
effective for all purposes as of the Effective Time.

  _EXHIBIT A-1_



_GATEWAY INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENT_



This GATEWAY INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENT (this " _Agreement_ ") is made and
entered into as of [ _ _], 2004, between Mr. Lap Shun (John) Hui ("
_Mr. Hui"_ ) and Gateway, Inc., a Delaware corporation (" _Gateway_ ").
Capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined in this Agreement shall have
the meanings ascribed to such terms in the Merger Agreement (as hereinafter
defined).



WHEREAS, Gateway, Gateway Sub, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and a
wholly owned subsidiary of Gateway, Gateway Sub II, LLC, a Delaware limited
liability company and a wholly owned subsidiary of Gateway, Mr. Hui and Marble
have entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of January 30,
2004 (the " _Merger Agreement_ ").



WHEREAS, the execution and delivery of this Agreement constitutes a condition
precedent to Mr. Huis obligations to consummate the transactions contemplated
in the Merger Agreement.



WHEREAS, the parties hereto desire that this Agreement become effective
immediately upon, and only upon, the Effective Time.

 



NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and of the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements set forth in this Agreement, the parties
hereto, intending to be legally bound, agree as follows:



1\. _Indemnification_



(a) From and after the Closing, Gateway shall indemnify and hold harmless Mr.
Hui (the " _Indemnified Party_ ") against any losses, claims, damages,
liabilities and reasonable expenses whenever arising or incurred (including,
without limitation, amounts paid in settlement, reasonable costs of
investigation and reasonable attorneys and experts fees and expenses),
whether or not involving a third party claim (hereinafter " _Losses_ "):



(i) arising out of or resulting from any breach of or inaccuracy in any
representation or warranty made by Gateway in the Merger Agreement; and (ii) arising from or in connection with any breach of any covenant or
agreement of Gateway in the Merger Agreement.



2\. _Time Limitation on Certain Claims for Indemnification_



(a) Any claim for indemnification under this Agreement must be asserted in
writing in accordance with the provisions of Section 4 of this Agreement and
must be asserted on or prior to the thirtieth (30th) day after the delivery
by Gateways independent accountants to Gateway of the audited consolidated
financial statements of Gateway, as of, and for the year ended December 31,
2004, as appropriate.



(b) So long as any claim is asserted in writing in accordance with the
provisions of Section 4 of this Agreement on or prior to the time limitations
set forth in this Section 2, any right to indemnification under this Agreement
shall survive such time period through and until final determination of the
merits of any claim hereunder for indemnification and the amount of Losses
related thereto pursuant to written agreement, binding arbitration or final
nonappealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction.



3\. _Limitations on Indemnification_



(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Gateway shall
not be obligated to pay any amounts pursuant to the indemnification
obligations hereof in respect of any Losses until the aggregate of such
amounts exceeds $2,000,000, and then Gateway shall only be liable to pay
amounts hereunder in excess of $2,000,000 (the " _Deductible Amount_ ").



(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the total
maximum aggregate indemnification payments hereunder for Gateway for all
claims for Losses suffered by the Indemnified Party pursuant to the
indemnification obligations herewith shall not exceed the Fair Market Value
(as defined in Section 4(d)(vi) and calculated with reference to the date any
indemnification claim is "finally determined" in accordance with the
provisions thereof) of eight (8) million shares of Gateway Common Stock (the
" _Maximum Aggregate Indemnification_ "). Such eight (8) million shares (the "
_Indemnification Shares_ ") will be subject to reduction from time to time to
the extent any Claim Amounts (as defined below) are paid by Gateway. The
reduction in number of Indemnification Shares with respect to any Claim Amount
will be equal to the Claim Amount paid divided by the Fair Market Value
calculated with respect to such Claim Amount.



 

2 (c) The Indemnified Party shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
pursue responsive and available third party insurance, indemnification,
contribution or similar claims in respect of which a Claims Notice (as
hereinafter defined) is submitted. The amount of the Indemnifying Partys
liability under this Agreement shall be determined taking into account any
applicable insurance proceeds paid to the Indemnified Party and any indemnity,
contribution or other similar payment recovered by the Indemnified Party from
any third party with respect thereto, in each case to the extent paid or
recovered prior to the time the Indemnified Party receives a payment (an "
_Indemnity Payment_ ") required by this Agreement in respect of any claim
hereunder. In addition, if an Indemnified Party receives an Indemnity Payment
and subsequently receives any proceeds from any third party indemnification,
contribution, insurance or similar claim with respect to such claim (the "
_Recovered Proceeds_ "), then the Indemnified Party will pay to the
Indemnifying Party an amount equal to the excess of the Indemnity Payment
received over the amount of the Indemnity Payment that would have been due if
the Recovered Proceeds had been received, realized or recovered before the
Indemnity Payment was made.



4\. _Procedures Relating to Indemnification_.



(a) _Notice of Asserted Liability_. With respect to third party claims, all
claims for indemnification by the Indemnified Party under this Section 4 shall
be asserted and resolved as follows: promptly after discovery of or receipt by
the Indemnified Party of notice of any demand, claim or circumstances, which,
with the lapse of time, are reasonably expected to give rise to a claim or the
commencement (or the threatened commencement) of any action, proceeding or
investigation (an " _Asserted Liability_ "), that may result in Losses which
are subject to indemnification hereunder, the Indemnified Party shall give
written notice thereof (the " _Claims Notice_ ") to the Indemnifying Party.
The Claims Notice shall describe the Asserted Liability in reasonable detail,
to the extent possible, and shall indicate the amount (estimated, if
necessary, and to the extent feasible) of the Losses that have been or may be
suffered by the Indemnified Party. The failure of the Indemnified Party to
provide a Claims Notice with reasonable promptness shall not affect any
indemnification obligations hereunder except to the extent that the
Indemnifying Party is actually and materially prejudiced thereby.



(b) _Opportunity to Defend_.



(i) The Indemnifying Party may elect to compromise or defend, at its own
expense and by its own counsel, any Asserted Liability;



 

3 _provided_ , _however_ , that counsel for the Indemnifying Party shall be
approved by the Indemnified Party (whose approval shall not unreasonably be
withheld or delayed). If the Indemnifying Party elects to compromise or defend
such Asserted Liability, it shall, within 30 days (or sooner, if the nature of
the Asserted Liability so requires), notify the Indemnified Party of its
intent to do so, and the Indemnified Party shall cooperate, at the expense of
the Indemnifying Party, in the compromise of, or defense against, such
Asserted Liability. If the Indemnifying Party elects not to compromise or
defend the Asserted Liability or fails to notify the Indemnified Party of its
election as herein provided, the Indemnified Party may pay, compromise or
defend such Asserted Liability with counsel reasonably acceptable to
the Indemnifying Party (at the Indemnifying Partys sole cost and expense in
the event that the Indemnifying Party is determined to be liable hereunder).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Indemnifying Party nor the
Indemnified Party may settle or compromise any claim over the objection of
the other; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the claim is for money damages
only, the Indemnifying Party can settle or compromise any such claim solely
for money damages without the consent of the Indemnified Party. No settlement
or compromise may be entered into by an Indemnifying Party without an
unconditional and full release of the Indemnified Party reasonably acceptable
to its counsel. In any event, the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying
Party may participate, at their own expense, in defense of such Asserted
Liability. If the Indemnifying Party elects to defend any claim, the
Indemnified Party shall make available to the Indemnifying Party any books,
records or other documents within its control that are necessary or
appropriate for such defense (in the judgment of counsel engaged by the
Indemnifying Party).



(ii) The Indemnified Party has the right to employ its own counsel in any
compromise of, or defense against, any Asserted Liability, or in connection
with the Indemnified Partys provision of reasonable cooperation and
assistance to the Indemnifying Party or the Indemnifying Partys counsel as
provided above, but the fees, expenses and other charges of such counsel
employed by the Indemnified Party will be at the expense of the Indemnified
Party unless (a) the employment of counsel by the Indemnified Party has been
authorized in writing by the Indemnifying Party or (b) the Indemnifying Party
has not in fact employed counsel to compromise or defend against the Asserted
Liability within the period provided in Section 4(b)(i). It is understood that
the Indemnifying Party shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related
proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the reasonable fees,



 

4 disbursements and other charges of more than one separate firm (plus, if
required, one separate firm admitted to practice in a local jurisdiction) at
any one time retained by the Indemnified Party unless the employment of more
than one counsel has been authorized in writing by the Indemnifying Party.



(c) _Notice of Direct Claim_. In the event that the Indemnified Party has a
claim for indemnification that does not involve a third party (a " _Direct
Claim_ "), the Indemnified Party shall provide a written notice to the
Indemnifying Party of such Direct Claim with reasonable promptness,
specifying, to the extent known, the nature and circumstances of such Direct
Claim and the amount (estimated, if necessary, and to the extent feasible) of
the Losses incurred or reasonably expected to be incurred in respect of
such Direct Claim (a " _Mr. Hui Payment Request_ "); _provided_ , _however_ ,
the failure of the Indemnified Party to provide such Mr. Hui Payment Request
with reasonable promptness shall not adversely affect any
indemnification obligations hereunder except to the extent that the
Indemnifying Party is actually and materially prejudiced thereby.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the failure to give such notice with reasonable
promptness will relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligation under this
Agreement in respect of the particular matter that is the subject of the
notice if the survival of the representation, warranty, covenant or
indemnification provision to which such claim related has expired, as set
forth in Section 2 of this Agreement.



(d)  _Payment Disputes._ If, after delivery of a Mr. Hui Payment Request, the
Indemnifying Party desires to dispute the propriety and/or amount of the
Direct Claim, then the Indemnified Party and Indemnifying Party shall follow
the following procedures:



(i) Gateway may challenge the propriety and/or the amount of the Direct Claim
prior to the tenth (10th) Business Day after a Mr. Hui Payment Request is
received by Gateway by delivering to Mr. Hui written notice (a " _Dispute
Notice_ ") describing in reasonable detail the amount of the requested claim
to be challenged and the basis for such challenge (or, in the alternative,
stating that Gateway does not possess information sufficient to determine the
propriety and/or amount of the requested disbursement). 



(ii) Within twenty (20) Business Days after timely delivery of a Dispute
Notice, the chief executive officer (or other authorized representative) of
Gateway and Mr. Hui will meet to attempt amicably to resolve the matters which
are the basis for such Dispute Notice (a " _Dispute_ "). If such Dispute has
not been



 

5 amicably resolved within 30 Business Days, then either party may give notice
to the other of the inability to resolve the Dispute (a " _Non-Resolution
Notice_ "). If the Dispute is amicably resolved, such resolution shall be
agreed upon in writing by Gateway and Mr. Hui and such written resolution will
be final and binding upon Gateway and Mr. Hui.



(iii) (A) The arbitration procedures described in this Section 4(d)(iii) will
be the sole and exclusive method of resolving and remedying Disputes that have
not been resolved pursuant to Section 4(c) hereof. The arbitration shall be
conducted in accordance with the rules for complex cases of the American
Arbitration Association (" _AAA_ ") then in effect (the " _Rules_ ").



(B) If Gateway and Mr. Hui do not amicably resolve their Dispute and either
party properly gives a Non-Resolution Notice, then such disagreements will be
submitted to binding arbitration. The arbitral proceeding will take place in
San Diego, California or another place agreeable to Gateway and Mr. Hui,
before an arbitration panel consisting of three individuals experienced
in matters of the type involved in the challenge (the " _Arbitration Panel_
"). Within twenty (20) Business Days after delivery of the Dispute Notice,
Gateway will choose one such individual and Mr. Hui will choose one such
individual to serve as its representative on the Arbitration Panel, and those
two individuals jointly will choose a third such individual within ten (10)
Business Days thereafter; provided, that if those two individuals cannot agree
upon an acceptable third member of the Arbitration Panel within such period,
the third member will be chosen under the Rules. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if either Gateway or Mr. Hui fails to choose an individual to serve
as its representative on the Arbitration Panel within such twenty-day period,
the representative selected by the other party shall resolve the dispute
individually; provided, however, that the party who selected a representative
must first give notice to the party failing to select a representative of
such partys failure and such non-selecting party shall have 10 Business Days
from the date of such notice to cure its failure to select a representative.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Mr. Hui and Gateway may agree to choose a
single arbitrator who is agreeable to them to resolve the dispute
individually.



 

6 (C) The arbitration (including discovery) will be conducted under the Rules,
as the same may be modified by any written agreement between Gateway and Mr.
Hui. The Arbitration Panel will conduct the arbitration in a manner so that
the final result, determination, finding, judgment or award determined by the
Arbitration Panel (the " _Final Arbitration Award_ ") is made or rendered as
soon as practicable, and Gateway and Mr. Hui will use reasonable efforts to
cause a Final Arbitration Award to occur within ninety (90) days after the
Arbitration Panel is selected. Any Final Arbitration Award will be final and
binding upon Gateway and Mr. Hui and there will be no appeal from or
reexamination of any Final Arbitration Award, except in the case of fraud or
perjury or misconduct by the Arbitration Panel prejudicing the rights of
Gateway or Mr. Hui or to correct manifest clerical errors.



(D) A Final Arbitration Award may be enforced in any state or federal court
having jurisdiction over the subject matter of the related Payment Dispute.



(E) As part of the Final Arbitration Award, the prevailing party in any
arbitration proceeding described in this Section 4(d)(iii) will be entitled to
recover from the non-prevailing party its reasonable attorneys fees and
disbursements and other out-of-pocket costs, and the non-prevailing party
also will be required to pay all other reasonable costs and expenses
associated with the arbitration if the Arbitration Panel determines that the
non-prevailing partys claim or defense, as the case may be, was without
merit. As part of any Final Arbitration Award, the Arbitration Panel may
designate the prevailing party for purposes of this Section 4(d)(iii).



(iv) _Fair Market Value of Indemnification Shares_. For purpose of this
Agreement, the Fair Market Value of each of the Indemnification Shares shall
be the average closing price per share of Gateway Common Stock on the New York
Stock Exchange (" _NYSE_ ") for the five-day trading period ending on the day
prior to the date on which the indemnification claim was "finally determined"
(as defined below), with appropriate adjustment to take into account any stock
split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization or other similar
capital adjustments with respect to the Gateway Common Stock. The date on
which an indemnification claim was "finally determined" shall mean (A) in the



 

7 case of Section 4(c), the payment date stated in the Mr. Hui Payment Request,
if no Dispute Notice has been delivered pursuant to Section 4(d)(i); (B) in
the case of Section 4(d)(ii), the payment date stated in the written
resolution described in Section 4(d)(ii) and (C) in the case of Section
4(d)(iii), the payment date stated in the Final Arbitration Notice.



(v) _Calculation_. The Fair Market Value shall be calculated jointly by
Granite and Mr. Hui within five (5) Business Days after the date on which an
indemnification claim has been "finally determined" (as defined in Section
4(d)(iv).



5\. _Certain Other Indemnity Matters_. From and after the Closing, the
parties agree that the sole and exclusive remedy in the absence of fraud with
respect to any and all claims arising out of or relating to a breach of or
inaccuracy in any representations or warranties or breach of any covenants
or agreements under the Merger Agreement and transactions contemplated
thereby shall be pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in this
Agreement.



6\. _Effect of Indemnification Payments_. The parties hereto agree that any
payments by Gateway in respect of its indemnification obligations pursuant to
this Agreement shall be treated as an adjustment to the Merger Consideration.



7\. _Payment of Indemnified Losses_. In the event that an amount hereunder
shall become due and payable by Gateway to the Indemnified Party (a " _Claim
Amount_ "), the Indemnified Party shall send a payment request to Gateway. The
portion of the Claim Amount that is equal to or less than the Fair Market
Value of the Indemnification Shares shall be disbursed to the Indemnified
Party in cash, subject to the aggregate Maximum Aggregate Indemnification.



8\. _Representations and Warranties of Mr. Hui and Gateway_



(a) _Representations and Warranties of Mr. Hui._ Mr. Hui hereby represents and
warrants to Gateway that:

ARTICLE II



LOCK-UP OF SHARES



2.1 _Restrictions on Transfers_. No Stockholder specified on f 2.1 hereto
(each a " _Restricted Stockholder_ ") shall transfer, sell, assign, encumber
or otherwise dispose of any of the Shares except in accordance with this
Article II and, with respect to Mr. Hui, Article I of that certain Standstill
Agreement between Mr. Hui and Gateway, dated as of the date hereof (the "
_Standstill Agreement_ "). Any transfer, sale, assignment encumbrance or other
disposition of any of the Shares by a Restricted Stockholder, other than in
accordance with this Article II and, with respect to Mr. Hui, Article I of
the Standstill Agreement, is void _ab initio_ and transfers no right, title
or interest in or to such Shares, or any of them to the purported transferee,
buyer, assignee, or encumbrance holder.



2.2 _Lock-Up of the Shares of the Restricted Stockholders_.

 



(a) Except as set forth in Section 2.2(b) and Section 2.2(c), each of the
Restricted Stockholders agrees, for a period of two years after the Closing
Date, not to offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge or otherwise dispose of,
directly or indirectly, any of the Shares, enter into a transaction
which would have the same effect, or enter into any swap, hedge or other
arrangement that transfers, in whole or in part, any of the economic
consequences of ownership of the Shares, whether any such aforementioned



 

4 transaction is to be settled by delivery of the Shares, in cash or otherwise,
or publicly disclose the intention to make any such offer, sale, pledge or
disposition, or enter into any such transaction, swap, hedge or other
arrangement.



(b) Notwithstanding Section 2.2(a), (i) in the event that any Restricted
Stockholder certifies to Gateway in writing that such
Restricted Stockholders Current Tax Liability exceeds the net cash proceeds
(on an after tax basis) received by such Restricted Stockholder in the Merger,
such Restricted Stockholder may sell Shares (which Shares will no longer be
subject to the restrictions in Section 2.2(a)) to the extent necessary to
result in net proceeds to such Restricted Stockholder in an amount equal to
such excess, provided, that the number of Shares released from the
restrictions in Section 2.2(a) on each three-month anniversary of the Closing
Date pursuant to clause (ii) and clause (iii) of this Section 2.2(b) shall be
reduced until the aggregate amount of such reductions equals the number of
Shares sold pursuant to this clause (i), (ii) on the three-month anniversary
of the Closing Date (a " _Release Date_ "), 12.5% of the Shares will no longer
be subject to the restrictions set forth in Section 2.2(a), and (iii) on the
last day of each subsequent three-month period (also a " _Release Date_ "),
an additional 12.5% of the Shares will no longer be subject to the
restrictions in Section 2.2(a), with the result that on the second anniversary
of the Closing Date, none of the Shares will be subject to the restrictions
set forth in Section 2.2(a).



(c) Notwithstanding Section 2.2(a), the Shares will no longer be subject to
the restrictions set forth in Section 2.2(a), except as provided in Section
2.2(c)(iii) below, immediately upon the occurrence of either of the follow
events (each, a " _Lock-Up Termination Event_ "), and Shares held by the
Stockholders other than Mr. Hui will no longer be subject to the restrictions
set forth in Section 2.2(a) in the case of the Lock-Up Termination Event
described in Section 2.2(c)(i):



(i) Gateway breaches any material provision of any of the Non-Competition
Agreement, the Employment Agreement, or this Agreement, and fails to
substantially cure such breach within 45 days of written notice thereof; or



(ii) if WXY disposes of shares of Gateway Common Stock and the aggregate
amount of shares of Gateway Common Stock disposed of by WXY during any three-
month period ending on a Release Date exceeds 12.5% of the total number of
shares of Gateway Common Stock held by WXY on the date hereof, then in
addition to any shares no longer subject to the restrictions set forth in
Section 2.2(a) pursuant to Section 2.2(b), Mr. Hui shall no longer be subject
to the restrictions set forth in Section 2.2(a), in an amount of shares equal
to Y% of the number of shares received by Mr. Hui as Stock Merger
Consideration, where Y equals the aggregate number of shares of Gateway
Common Stock disposed of by WXY after the date of this Agreement, expressed as
a percentage of the total number of shares of Gateway Common Stock held by WXY
on the date hereof, less 12.5%. 



 

5 (d) In the event that (i) the employment of Mr. Wayne R. Inouye ("
_Mr. Inouye_ ") as Chief Executive Officer of Gateway is terminated by the
Company other than for Cause (as defined in his Employment Agreement with
Gateway, dated January 30, 2004 (the " _Employment Agreement_ ")) or by Mr.
Inouye for Good Reason (as defined in the Employment Agreement) and (ii) Mr.
Inouye is not replaced by a person who is acceptable to Mr. Hui, as determined
in Mr. Huis sole and absolute discretion, then, notwithstanding Section
2.2(a) and Section 2.2(b)(ii) and 2.2(b)(iii), on each Release Date on or
following such termination, in the case of the first Release Date, 25% and in
the case of each subsequent Release Date, an additional 25% of Huis Shares
will no longer be subject to the restrictions set forth in Section 2.2(a).



(e) In determining which of the Hui Shares will be released from the
restrictions set forth in Section 2.2(a) as provided by Sections 2.2(b) and
2.2(c), the Escrow Shares (as defined in the Indemnification Escrow Agreement)
will be released from such restrictions pursuant to Section 2.2(b) and
Section 2.2(c) only after all Shares other than the Escrow Shares have been so
released.



ARTICLE III



REGISTRATION RIGHTS



3.1 _Shelf Registration._



(a) Upon the receipt of a written request from any Stockholder following the
Closing Date, Gateway shall prepare and file a "shelf" registration statement
(the " _Shelf Registration Statement_ ") with respect to the Registrable
Securities to be issued to the Stockholders and any other holders of equity
interests in eMachines pursuant to the Merger Agreement, on Form S-3 or other
available form for an offering to be made on a delayed or continuous basis
pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act. Subject to the provisions of
Section 3.8 hereof, Gateway shall use commercially reasonable efforts to file
the Shelf Registration Statement no later than 30 days following the receipt
of such written request. Gateway shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
have the Shelf Registration Statement declared effective promptly thereafter
and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to keep the Shelf Registration
Statement continuously effective, subject to the provisions of Section 3.8
hereof, during the time (the " _Effectiveness Period_ ") from the date such
Shelf Registration Statement is declared effective (the " _Effective Time_ ")
until the earlier of (i) two years after the Closing, (ii) such time as all of
the Registrable Securities cease to be Registrable Securities and (iii) the
date on which all Registrable Securities may be sold without registration
pursuant to Rule 144(k) of the Securities Act (the " _Shelf Termination Date_
"). At the Effective Time, each Stockholder shall be named as a selling
securityholder in the Shelf Registration Statement and related Prospectus in
such a manner as to permit such Stockholder (and its designees) to deliver
such Prospectus to purchasers of Registrable Securities in accordance with
applicable law under ordinary circumstances, subject to compliance with blue
sky laws.



 

6 (b) If the Shelf Registration Statement ceases to be effective for any reason
at any time during the Effectiveness Period, Gateway shall, subject to the
provisions of Section 3.8 hereof, use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain the prompt withdrawal of any order suspending the effectiveness
thereof, and in any event within 15 days of such cessation of effectiveness
amend the Shelf Registration Statement in a manner reasonably expected by
Gateway to obtain the withdrawal of such order suspending the effectiveness
thereof or, as promptly as practicable thereafter, file an additional
registration statement (the " _Subsequent Registration Statement_ ") covering
the resale by the Stockholders of all of the then Registrable Securities on a
delayed or continuous basis pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act. If
the Subsequent Registration Statement is filed, Gateway shall use commercially
reasonable efforts, subject to the provisions of Section 3.8 hereof, to cause
the Subsequent Registration Statement to become effective under the Securities
Act and remain continuously effective during the Effectiveness Period.



(c) Gateway shall pay all Registration Expenses incurred in connection with
the Shelf Registration Statement, any Subsequent Registration Statement and
any supplements or amendments to them, whether or not they become effective,
and whether all, none or some of the Registrable Securities are sold pursuant
to any Registration Statement. It is understood and agreed that Gateway may
also register for public offering and sale pursuant to the Shelf
Registration Statement or any Subsequent Registration Statement, initially or
by amendment, securities other than Registrable Securities, but in doing so
shall not limit any Stockholders rights hereunder (including any limitation
arising by application of applicable rules under the Securities Act with
respect to Registrable Securities sold pursuant to such Shelf Registration
Statement or Subsequent Registration Statement by any Person other than a
Stockholder) or materially and adversely affect any Stockholders ability to
sell its Registrable Securities.



3.2 _Demand Registrations._



(a) Subject to the conditions of this Section 3.2, if Gateway shall receive
at any time after the Shelf Termination Date a written request from Mr. Hui
requesting that Gateway file a Registration Statement under the Act, on the
appropriate form covering the sale of Registrable Securities, then Gateway
shall:



(i) within ten (10) days of the receipt thereof, give written notice of the
proposed registration to all other Stockholders of Registrable Securities, and



(ii) subject to the limitations of this Section 3.2, use its best efforts to
effect, as soon as practicable, such registration and all qualifications or
compliances as may be so requested and as would permit or facilitate the sale
and distribution of all or such portion of Mr. Huis Registrable Securities as
specified in such request, together with all or such portion of the
Registrable Securities of any other Stockholders joining in such request as
are specified in a written request given within twenty (20) days after receipt
of such written notice from Gateway;



 

7 _provided_ , _however_ , that Mr. Hui shall only be permitted to request two
registrations pursuant to this Section 3.2(a).



(b) The Company shall not be obligated to effect any such registration
pursuant to this Section 3.2, after Gateway has effected two (2) registrations
pursuant to this Section 3.2, and such registrations have been declared or
ordered effective, and have remained effective for at least a period of 90
days provided that no stop order shall have been issued with respect thereto.



3.3 _Underwritten Offerings_



(a) Upon the request of any Stockholder, the Registrable Securities covered by
any Shelf Registration Statement may be sold in an underwritten offering in
which the investment banker or investment bankers and manager or managers that
will manage the offering will be selected by such Stockholder(s). Each
applicable Stockholder, with respect to Registrable Securities that
such Stockholder then desires to sell, and Gateway, shall enter into an
underwriting agreement with such underwriters and Gateway shall cause such
underwriters to include in any such underwriting all of the Registrable
Securities that a Stockholder then desires to sell. If any Stockholder
disapproves of the terms of any such underwriting, such Stockholder may elect
to withdraw therefrom by written notice to Gateway and the managing
underwriter.



3.4 _Registration Procedures_

.

(a) In connection with each Registration Statement, Gateway shall, as
promptly as practicable, subject to the provisions of Section 3.8 hereof:

Act with respect to the disposition of all Registrable Securities covered by

Registrable Securities have been disposed of in accordance with the intended

summary prospectus) and any other Prospectus filed under Rule 424 under the
Securities Act, in conformity with the requirements of the Securities Act, and
such other documents, as such seller may reasonably request;



(iv) use commercially reasonable efforts (1) to register or qualify all

reasonably request, (2) to keep such registration or qualification
continuously in effect during the Effectiveness Period, (3) to prevent the
issuance of, or, if issued, to obtain the withdrawal at the earliest
practicable time of, any order or other determination suspending such

any other action which may be reasonably necessary or advisable to enable
such sellers to consummate the disposition in such jurisdictions of the
securities to be sold by such sellers, except that Gateway shall not for any
such purpose be required to qualify generally to do business as a foreign
corporation in any jurisdiction wherein it would not but for the requirements
of this clause (iv) be obligated to be so qualified, to subject itself to
taxation in any such jurisdiction or to consent to general service of process
in any such jurisdiction;



(v) use commercially reasonable efforts to cause all Registrable Securities
covered by the Registration Statement to be registered with or approved by

disposition of such Registrable Securities within the United States of
America;



(vi) use commercially reasonable efforts to furnish at the effective date of

counterpart of an opinion of counsel for Gateway, dated the effective date of

(vii) give notice to all holders of Registrable Securities (1) when the
Registration Statement, any Prospectus or Prospectus supplement relating
thereto or post-effective amendment to the Registration Statement has been
filed with theCommission, (2) of any request, following the Effective Time, by
the Commission or any other federal or state Governmental Entity for
amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or related Prospectus
or for additional information, (3) of the issuance by the Commission  



 

9  or any other federal or state Governmental Entity of any stop order
suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or the initiation
or threat in writing of any proceedings for that purpose, (4) of the receipt
by Gateway of any notification with respect to the suspension of the
qualification or exemption from qualification of any of the Registrable
Securities for sale in any jurisdiction or the initiation or threat in
writing of any proceeding for such purpose, (5) of the occurrence of (but not
the nature of or details concerning) any of the events described in Section
3.8(a) ( _provided_ , _however_ , that no notice by Gateway shall be required
pursuant to this clause (5) in the event that Gateway either promptly files a
Prospectus supplement or amendment to update the Prospectus or a Form 8-K or
other appropriate Exchange Act report that is incorporated by reference
into the Registration Statement, which, in either case, contains the
requisite information with respect to such event that results in the
Registration Statement no longer containing any untrue statement of material
fact or omitting to state a material fact necessary to make the statements
contained therein not misleading) and (6) of the determination by Gateway that
a post-effective amendment to a Registration Statement will be filed with the
Commission;



(viii) otherwise use commercially reasonable efforts to comply with all
applicable rules and regulations of the Commission, and, if requested, make
available to its security holders, as soon as reasonably practicable, an
earnings statement covering the period of at least 12 months, but not more
than 18 months, beginning with the first full calendar month after the
effective date of the Registration Statement, which earnings statement shall
satisfy the provisions of Section 11(a) of the Securities Act and Rule 158

Registrable Securities a copy of any amendment or supplement to the

contain any restrictive legend (including the legends set forth in Section
1.2) and are eligible for deposit with The Depository Trust Company; and

its obligations under an underwriting agreement, in usual and customary form,
with the managing underwriter of such offering and enter

facilitate the disposition of such Registrable Securities, including, without
limitation, preparing for, and participating in, "road shows" and all other
customary selling efforts, all as the underwriters reasonably request;



(xiii) request that the independent public accountants who have issued an
audit report on Gateways financial statements included in the Registration
Statement furnish to each selling Stockholder a signed counterpart of a
"comfort" letter, dated the effective date of the Registration Statement
(and, if any registration includes an underwritten public offering, the date
of the closing under the underwriting agreement), signed by such accountants
and covering such matters as are customarily covered in accountants
letters delivered to the underwriters in underwritten public offerings of
securities and such other matters as may be reasonably requested by the
Stockholders, if any; and



(xiv) use its commercially reasonable efforts to take all other steps
necessary to effect the registration and disposition of such Registrable
Securities as contemplated hereby.



(b) Gateway may (i) require each seller of Registrable Securities as to which
any registration is being effected to furnish Gateway such information
regarding such seller and the distribution of such securities as Gateway may
from time to time reasonably request in writing and (ii) require each seller
of Registrable Securities to agree to comply with the Securities Act and the
Exchange Act and all applicable state securities laws and to use
commercially reasonable efforts to comply with all applicable regulations in
connection with the registration and distribution of the Registrable
Securities.



(c) Each holder of Registrable Securities agrees by acquisition of such
Registrable Securities that, upon receipt of any notice from Gateway of the
happening of any event of the kind described in clauses (i) and (ii) of the
first sentence of Section 3.8(b), such holder shall forthwith discontinue such
holders disposition of Registrable Securities pursuant to the Registration
Statement until such holder receives copies of the supplemented or amended
Prospectus contemplated by Section 3.4(a)(i) or 3.4(a)(ii) and, if so directed
by Gateway, will promptly deliver to Gateway (at Gateways expense)
all copies, other than permanent file copies, then in such holders
possession of the Prospectus relating to such Registrable Securities current
at the time of receipt of such notice.

persons against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several,
to which such seller or any such director, officer, partner,



 

11 Stockholder, employee, affiliate or controlling person may become subject
under the Securities Act or otherwise, including the reasonable fees and
expenses of legal counsel, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or
liabilities (or actions or proceedings, whether commenced or threatened, in
respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or
alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in any Registration
Statement under which such securities were registered under the Securities
Act, any preliminary prospectus, final prospectus or summary prospectus
contained therein, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any omission or
alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein in light of the
circumstances in which they were made not misleading, and Gateway will
promptly reimburse each such seller and each such director, officer, partner,
Stockholder, employee, affiliate and controlling Person for any legal or any
other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating
or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability, action or proceeding;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Gateway shall not be liable (i) in any such case
to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage, liability (or action
or proceeding in respect thereof) or expense arises out of or is based upon
an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged
omission made in such registration statement, any such preliminary prospectus,
final prospectus, summary prospectus, amendment or supplement in reliance
upon and in conformity with written information furnished to Gateway by or on
behalf of such seller, specifically for use in the preparation thereof and
(ii) for any loss, claim, damage, liability, action or proceeding if (1)
Gateway has notified the seller to suspend use of the Prospectus pursuant to
Section 3.4(c), (2) the seller continues to use the relevant Prospectus
notwithstanding such notice, and (3) such loss, claim, damage, liability,
action, or proceeding arises from, is in connection with or relates to an
untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact or omission
to state a material fact that was cured in the supplemented or amended
Prospectus contemplated by Section 3.4(a)(i) or 3.4 (a)(ii). Such indemnity
shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by
or on behalf of any such seller or any such director, officer, partner,
Stockholder, employee, affiliate or controlling person and shall survive the
transfer of such securities by such seller.



(b) _Indemnification by the Sellers_. Each seller of any Registrable
Securities and each other Person who controls such seller, within the meaning
of the Securities Act shall, and hereby does, indemnify and hold harmless (in
the same manner and to the same extent as set forth in Section 3.5(a))
Gateway, and each director, officer, employee and Stockholder of Gateway and
each other Person who controls Gateway within the meaning of the Securities
Act, with respect to any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a
material fact contained in or any omission or alleged omission to state
therein a material fact in any such Registration Statement, any preliminary
prospectus, final prospectus or summary prospectus contained therein, or any
amendment or supplement thereto, but only if and to the extent that such
untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission
was made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished
to Gateway by or on behalf of such seller specifically for use in the
preparation of such Registration Statement, preliminary prospectus, final
prospectus, summary prospectus, amendment or supplement; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that (i) the liability of such indemnifying party under this
Section 3.5(b) shall be limited to the amount of net proceeds received by such
indemnifying party in the



 

12 offering giving rise to such liability, and (ii) such indemnifying party shall
not be liable under this Section 3.5(b) for any loss, claim, damage,
liability, action or proceeding arising from, in connection with or relating
to such an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or
omission or alleged omission to state a material fact if such party provided
Gateway with information for inclusion in such Registration Statement,
preliminary prospectus, final prospectus, summary prospectus, amendment or
supplement that would have cured such untrue statement or alleged
untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state
a material fact, and Gateway did not timely include such information in such
Registration Statement, preliminary prospectus, final prospectus, summary
prospectus, amendment or supplement. Such indemnity shall remain in full
force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of
Gateway or any such director, officer, employee, Stockholder or controlling
person and shall survive the transfer of such securities by such seller.



(c) _Notices of Claims, etc_. Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party
of notice of the commencement of any action or proceeding involving a claim
referred to in Section 3.5(a) or (b), such indemnified party will, if a claim
in respect thereof is to be made against an indemnifying party, give written
notice to the indemnifying party of the commencement of such action or
proceeding; _provided_ , _however_ , that the failure of any indemnified party
to give notice as provided herein shall not relieve the indemnifying party of
its obligations under Section 3.5(a) or (b), as the case may be, except to the
extent that the indemnifying party is actually materially prejudiced by such
failure to give notice. In case any such action is brought against an
indemnified party, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate in
and to assume the defense thereof, jointly with any other indemnifying party
similarly notified to the extent that it may wish, with counsel
reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party, and after notice from the
indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the
defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such
indemnified party for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by
the latter in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable out of
pocket costs (excluding professional fees) incurred in connection with
complying with requests for production, depositions, interrogatories and the
like; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the indemnified party reasonably
believes it is advisable for it to be represented by separate counsel because
it has been advised by counsel that there exists a conflict of interest
between its interests and those of the indemnifying party with respect to such
claim, or there exist defenses available to such indemnified party which may
not be available to the indemnifying party, or if the indemnifying party shall
fail to assume responsibility for such defense, the indemnified party may
retain counsel satisfactory to it and the indemnifying party shall pay all
fees and expenses of such counsel in accordance with Section 3.5(a) or (b)
hereof, as applicable. No indemnifying party shall be liable for any
settlement of any action or proceeding effected without its prior written
consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed. No indemnifying party shall, without the consent of the indemnified
party, consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement which
does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant
or plaintiff to such indemnified party of a release from all liability
in respect to such claim or litigation or which requires action or provides
relief other than the payment of money by the indemnifying party (without any
recourse to, or contribution by, an  



 

13  indemnified party). No indemnified party shall consent to entry of judgment
or enter into any settlement of such action the defense of which has been
assumed by an indemnifying party without the consent of such indemnifying
party. Each indemnified party shall furnish such information regarding itself
or the claim in question as an indemnifying party may reasonably request in
writing and as shall be reasonably requested in connection with the defense
of such claim and litigation resulting therefrom.



(d) _Contribution_. If the indemnification provided for in this Section 3.5
shall for any reason be held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be
unavailable to an indemnified party under Section 3.5(a) or (b), as the case
may be, in respect of any loss, claim, damage or liability, or any action or
proceeding in respect thereof, then, in lieu of the amount paid or
payable under Section 3.5(a) or (b), as the case may be, the indemnified
party and the indemnifying party under Section 3.5(a) or (b), as the case may
be, shall contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities
(including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with
investigating the same), (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect
the relative fault of Gateway and the prospective sellers of Registrable
Securities covered by the Registration Statement in connection with the
statements or omissions which resulted in such loss, claim, damage or
liability, or action or proceeding in respect thereof, as well as any other
relevant equitable considerations (the relative fault of Gateway and
such prospective sellers to be determined by reference to, among other
things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or
the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to
information supplied by Gateway or such prospective sellers and the parties
relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct
or prevent such statement or omission) or (ii) if the allocation provided by
clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as shall be
appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by Gateway and such
prospective sellers from the offering of the securities covered by such
registration statement. The parties hereto acknowledge that in no event shall
the obligation of any indemnifying party to contribute under this Section 3.5
exceed the amount that such indemnifying party would have been obligated to
pay by way of indemnification if the indemnification provided for under
Sections 3.5(a) or (b) had been available under the circumstances. Gateway
and each holder of Registrable Securities agree that it would not be just and
equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 3.5(d) were determined by
pro rata allocation (even if such holders were treated as one entity for such
purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of
the equitable considerations referred to in the first sentence of this Section
3.5(d). No Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning
of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from
any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. Such
prospective sellers obligations to contribute as provided in this Section
3.5(d) are several in proportion to the relative value of their respective
Registrable Securities disposed of pursuant to such Registration Statement and
not joint. In no event shall any prospective seller be obligated to make a
contribution pursuant to this Section 3.5(d) in excess of the amount of net
proceeds received by such prospective seller in the offering giving rise to
such obligation. In addition, no Person shall be obligated to contribute
hereunder any amounts in payment for any settlement of any action or claim
effected without such



 

14 Persons consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. 



(e) _Indemnification Payments_. The indemnification and contribution required
by this Section 3.5 shall be made by prompt periodic payments of the amount
thereof during the course of the investigation or defense, as and when bills
are received or expense, loss, damage or liability is incurred.



3.6 _Rule 144_. Gateway shall timely file the reports required to be filed by
it under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
adopted by the Commission thereunder (including but not limited to the reports
under Sections 13 and 15(d) of the Exchange Act referred to in subparagraph
(c) of Rule 144) and will take such further action as the holder or any broker
facilitating such sale may reasonably request to enable holders of Registrable
Securities to sell such securities without registration under the Securities
Act within the limitation of the exemptions provided by (a) Rule 144 under the
Securities Act, as such Rule may be amended from time to time, or (b) any
similar rules or regulations hereafter adopted by the Commission, including
filing on a timely basis all reports required to be filed by the Exchange
Act. Upon the request of any holder of Registrable Securities, Gateway will
deliver to such holder a written statement as to whether it has complied with
such requirements.

 



3.7 _Transfer of Registration Rights_.



(a) Each Stockholder may transfer Registrable Securities with the associated
registration rights under this Agreement to a Permitted Transferee; _provided_
, _however_ , that (A) the transferring Stockholder shall give Gateway written
notice prior to the time of such transfer or pledge stating the name and
address of the Permitted Transferee and identifying the Registrable Securities
with respect to which the rights under this Agreement are to be transferred,
(B) such Permitted Transferee shall agree in writing to be bound as a
Stockholder by the provisions of this Agreement insofar as it pertains to the
holding, owning and disposition of Registrable Securities and (C) immediately
following such transfer or pledge, the further disposition of such Registrable
Securities by such Permitted Transferee would be restricted under the
Securities Act.



(b) Upon any transfer of Registrable Securities other than as set forth in
this Section 3.6, such securities shall no longer constitute Registrable
Securities for purposes of this Agreement.



(c) If a Stockholder assigns its rights under this Agreement in connection
with the transfer of less than all of its Registrable Securities, the
Stockholder shall retain its rights under this Agreement with respect to its
remaining Registrable Securities. If a Stockholder assigns its rights under
this Agreement in connection with the transfer of all of its Registrable
Securities, the Stockholder shall have no further obligations under this
Agreement, except under Sections 3.5, 4.1, 4.12 and 4.14 hereof.



3.8 _Suspension of Sales_.



 

15 (a) Gateway shall promptly notify each holder of Registrable Securities (A)
upon discovery that, or upon the happening of any event as a result of which,
the Prospectus or the Registration Statement includes an untrue statement of a
material fact or omits to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or any event
specified in clause (b) below; (B) of the issuance by the Commission of any
stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or (C)
of any request by the Commission for (I) amendments to the Registration
Statement or any document incorporated or deemed to be incorporated by
reference in the Registration Statement, (II) supplements to the
Prospectus or (III) additional information. Immediately following any such
event (x) upon the request of Gateway, the holders of Registrable Securities
shall suspend the use of the Prospectus and shall not sell any Registrable
Securities until such holder has received copies of the supplemented or
amended Prospectus or until it is advised by Gateway that the Prospectus may
be used, and (y) Gateway shall use commercially reasonable efforts to, as
promptly as practicable or in the case of an event specified in clause (b)
below, by the end of the Deferral Period (as defined below), prepare and file
a post-effective amendment to the Registration Statement or a supplement to
the related Prospectus or any document that would be incorporated
by reference into the Registration Statement and Prospectus so that the
Registration Statement does not contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and such Prospectus
does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading and thereafter deliver to the holders of the Registrable
Securities a reasonable number of copies of the supplement to amendment of
such Prospectus complying with the foregoing, and, in the case of a post-
effective amendment to a Registration Statement, use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause it to be declared effective as promptly as is reasonably
practicable.



(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Gateway will
not be required to file any registration statement pursuant to this
Agreement, file any amendment thereto, furnish any supplement to a prospectus
included in a Registration Statement pursuant to Section 3.4(a)(i) or
3.4(a)(ii) hereof, make any other filing with the Commission, cause any
registration statement or other filing with the Commission to become
effective, or take any similar action, and any and all sales of Registrable
Securities by a holder thereof pursuant to an effective registration statement
shall be suspended: (i) if such filing or similar action would, in the good-
faith judgment of Gateway, materially interfere with business activities or
plans of Gateway, or (ii) if such filing or similar action would, in the good-
faith judgment of counsel of Gateway, require the disclosure of material non-
public information which in the good-faith judgment of Gateway, Gateway has a
bona fide business purpose for preserving as confidential and which, in the
opinion of nationally-recognized counsel to Gateway, Gateway would not
otherwise be required to disclose; provided that Gateway may not delay any
such actions or suspend any such sales pursuant to clause (i) or (ii) of the
first sentence of this Section 3.8(b) for more than an aggregate of 120
consecutive days or, except as otherwise provided in the third sentence of
this Section 3.8(b), for an aggregate



 

16 of 120 days in twelve consecutive months. Upon the occurrence of any condition
described in clauses (i) or (ii) of the first sentence of this Section
3.8(b), Gateway shall give prompt notice thereof to the holders of the
Registrable Securities. Upon the termination of the condition described in
clauses (i) or (ii) of the first sentence of this Section 3.8(b), Gateway
shall give prompt notice to the holders of Registrable Securities and shall
promptly file any registration statement or amendment thereto required to be
filed by it pursuant to this Agreement, furnish any prospectus
supplement required to be furnished pursuant to Section 3.4(a)(i) or
3.4(a)(ii) hereof, make any other filing with the Commission required of it or
terminate any suspension of sales it has put into effect and shall take such
other actions to permit registered sales of Registrable Securities as
contemplated by this Agreement. It is understood and agreed that the foregoing
provisions of this Section 3.8(b) shall not prevent a sale pursuant to Rule
144 by a holder of Registrable Securities. As used in this Agreement, the
term " _Deferral Period_ " shall mean any period of time that sales of
Registrable Securities are suspended pursuant to this Section 3.8(b). Any
suspension pursuant to this Section 3.8(b) shall not be effective unless each
director and executive officer subject to Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act is
prohibited from making purchases and sales by reason of the existence of
material non-public information in clause (ii) of the first sentence of this
Section 3.8(b). 



3.9 _Gateway Make-Whole_.



(a) If (i) for any reason (A) the Registration Statement ceases to be
effective at any time during the Effectiveness Period for a period of 120
consecutive days, (B) if sales of Registrable Securities shall have been
suspended as provided in Section 3.8(b) for a period of 120 consecutive days
or (C) if Gateway fails to have the Registration Statement declared effective
within 120 days following receipt of notice from any Stockholder pursuant to
Section 3.1 or Section 3.2 and (ii) Mr. Hui delivers written notice (the "
_Notice_ ") to Gateway, which notice shall set forth (A) confirmation that
Mr. Hui intends to transfer, sell or otherwise dispose of the Registrable
Securities in a bona fide private transaction with a third party (an " _Hui
Private Offering_ "), (B) the name and address of each proposed transferee or
purchaser, (C) the number of the Registrable Securities proposed to be
transferred, sold or otherwise disposed of (the " _Offered Registrable
Securities_ "), and (D) the proposed amount and form of consideration to be
paid for the Offered Registrable Securities (the " _Private Offer Price_ "),
then within 3 Business Days following receipt of the Notice, Gateway may, at
its election, by delivery of a written notice to Mr. Hui (the " _Election
Notice_ "), either (x) buy all but not less than all of the Offered
Registrable Securities at a price in cash equal to their Fair Market Value (as
defined below), or (y) pay to Mr. Hui in cash the amount, if any, that the
Fair Market Value of the Offered Registrable Securities exceeds the Private
Offer Price (the " _Make-Whole Amount_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Gateway must elect clause (y) in the preceding sentence (" _Alternative Y_ ")
if the election provided in clause (x) in the preceding sentence ("
_Alternative X_ ") would, as provided by a reasonable written opinion of Mr.
Huis tax advisor, cause a risk that the Merger and the Subsequent Merger,
taken together, would no longer qualify as a reorganization under Section 368
of the Internal Revenue Code unless Gateway agrees to indemnify Mr. Hui for
the incremental tax liability to Mr. Hui resulting from Alternative X causing
the Merger and



 

17 the Subsequent Merger, taken together, to not qualify as a reorganization. For
the purposes hereof, the " _Fair Market Value_ " per share of the Registrable
Securities shall be deemed to be the average of the closing prices of a share
of Gateway Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange for the ten (10)
trading days immediately preceding the date of the Notice.



(b) In the event of a purchase by Gateway pursuant to 3.9(a)(x) above, within
three (3) Business Days following the delivery of the Election Notice, Gateway
shall deliver a certified check payable to Mr. Hui, or to such other person as
Mr. Hui may request, in the amount of the Fair Market Value of the Offered
Registrable Securities and upon receipt of payment for the Offered Registrable
Securities, Mr. Hui shall deliver certificates properly endorsed in blank for
transfer representing all such Offered Registrable Securities to Gateway. In
the event of a Hui Private Offering pursuant to 3.9(a)(y) above, within three
(3) Business Days following the consummation of the Hui Private Offering,
Gateway shall deliver a certified check payable to Mr. Hui, or to such other
person as Mr. Hui may request, in the amount of the Make-Whole Amount.

STANDSTILL AGREEMENT





Dated as of  _ ,_ 2004



by and between





MR. LAP SHUN (JOHN) HUI



and



GATEWAY, INC.





 

(i) STANDSTILL AGREEMENT



This STANDSTILL AGREEMENT, dated as of  _ _, 2004 (this "
_Agreement_ "), by and between Mr. Lap Shun (John) Hui (" _Mr. Hui_ ")
and Gateway, Inc., a Delaware corporation (" _Gateway_ "). Capitalized terms
used and not otherwise defined herein shall have the respective meanings
ascribed to them in the Merger Agreement (as described below) and the
Stockholders and Registration Rights Agreement (as described below).



WHEREAS, Gateway, Gateway Sub, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and a
wholly owned subsidiary of Gateway, Gateway Sub II, LLC, a Delaware limited
liability company and a wholly owned subsidiary of Gateway, Mr. Hui and EM
Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation, have entered into an Agreement and
Plan of Merger, dated as of January 30, 2004 (the " _Merger Agreement_ ");



WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, Gateway, Mr. Hui
and certain Gateway Share Recipients entered into the Stockholders
and Registration Rights Agreement (the " _Stockholders  and Registration
Rights Agreement_"); and



WHEREAS, the execution and delivery of this Agreement is a condition precedent
to the obligations of the parties to the Merger Agreement.



NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and of the
respective representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth in
this Agreement, the parties intending to be legally bound, agree as follows:



ARTICLE I



RIGHT OF FIRST REFUSAL

AND STANDSTILL



1.1 _Restrictions on Transfers_. Mr. Hui shall not transfer, sell, assign,
encumber or otherwise dispose of any of the Shares except in accordance with
this Article I and Article II of the Stockholders and Registration Rights
Agreement. Any transfer, sale, assignment encumbrance or other disposition of
any of the Shares by Mr. Hui, other than in accordance with this Article I
and Article II of the Stockholders and Registration Rights Agreement, is void
_ab initio_ and transfers no right, title or interest in or to such Shares, or
any of them to the purported transferee, buyer, assignee, or encumbrance
holder.



1.2 _Gateway s Right of First Refusal_.



(a) After the Shares are no longer subject to the restrictions set forth in
Section 2.2 of the Stockholders and Registration Rights Agreement, Mr. Hui
may transfer, sell or otherwise dispose of his Shares only in accordance with
the



 

1 provisions of this Section 1.2. Prior to making any transfer, sale or other
disposition of his Shares in excess of 1% of the outstanding shares of common
stock of Gateway (other than in open market sales, including in block trades
to or through a broker that are intended to be widely distributed), Mr. Hui
shall provide written notice (the " _Notice_ ") to Gateway, which notice
shall set forth (i) confirmation that Mr. Hui intends to transfer, sell or
otherwise dispose of such Shares in a bona fide transaction with a third
party, (ii) the name and address of each proposed transferee or purchaser,
(iii) the number of the Shares proposed to be transferred, sold or otherwise
disposed of (the " _Offered Shares_ "), (iv) the proposed amount and form of
consideration to be paid for the Offered Shares, and (v) all other material
terms of the proposed transfer, sale or disposition. Within five (5) Business
Days of delivery of the Notice, Gateway may elect to buy all but not less than
all of the Offered Shares at the price and on the terms and conditions set
forth in the Notice by delivery of a written notice to Mr. Hui (the "
_Election Notice_ "), which notice shall constitute the binding agreement of
Gateway to purchase all of the Offered Shares at the price and on the terms
and conditions set forth in the Notice. Within three (3) Business Days of
delivery of the Election Notice, Gateway shall deliver a certified check
payable to Mr. Hui, or to such other person as Mr. Hui may request, in the
amount of the purchase price (as calculated pursuant to Section 1.2(c)) of
such Offered Shares to be purchased by Gateway. Upon receipt of payment for
the Offered Shares, Mr. Hui shall deliver certificates properly endorsed in
blank for transfer representing all such Offered Shares to Gateway. If the
provisions of Section 3.9 of the Stockholders and Registration Rights
Agreement apply in connection with any proposed sale of Mr. Huis Shares, then
the provisions of Section 1.2 shall not apply.



(b) If an Election Notice is not received by Mr. Hui from Gateway within the
period specified in Section 1.2(a), or if Gateway properly elects to purchase
the Offered Shares but fails to deliver the purchase price of the Offered
Shares in accordance with the terms hereof, Mr. Hui shall have the right
to transfer, sell or otherwise dispose of the Offered Shares specified in the
Notice to the proposed purchaser or transferee, but only at the price and upon
the terms and conditions stated in the Notice and only if such sale occurs on
a date within 60 days from the date of the Notice.



(c) For purposes of calculating the purchase price of any such transfer, sale
or disposition, if any portion of the consideration consists of other than
cash and/or readily marketable securities, the fair market value of any non-
cash consideration shall be determined by a nationally recognized independent
valuation consultant or appraiser (with experience evaluating such type of
property) selected by Mr. Hui and reasonably satisfactory to Gateway.



(d) The closing of the transactions contemplated by this Section 1.2 shall
occur at the principal offices of Gateway unless otherwise agreed to in
writing by the parties to such transaction.



(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section 1.2 shall not apply to any
transfer, sale or other disposition of the Shares to a Permitted Transferee.



1.3 _Standstill_. (a) Subject to Section 1.3(b), Mr. Hui agrees that, for a period commencing on
the date hereof and ending one year from the Closing Date (the " _Standstill
Period_ "), Mr. Hui and his affiliates will not, unless consented to in
writing by the Board of Directors of Gateway:



(i) acquire, offer or propose to acquire, or agree or seek to acquire,
directly or indirectly, by purchase or otherwise, any securities (or direct or
indirect rights or options to acquire any securities) of Gateway or any
subsidiary thereof, or, except in the ordinary course of business, any assets
of Gateway or any subsidiary or division thereof, provided that,
notwithstanding the foregoing, Mr. Hui may acquire beneficial ownership (as
defined in the Exchange Act) of securities of Gateway in any amount not to
exceed, in the aggregate, 1% of either the issued and outstanding voting
securities or the issued and outstanding nonvoting securities of Gateway, so
long as such acquisition is made consistent with applicable securities laws
and regulations;



(ii) enter into or agree, offer, propose or seek to enter into, or otherwise
be involved in or part of, directly or indirectly, any acquisition transaction
or other business combination relating to all or part of Gateway or any of its
subsidiaries or any acquisition transaction for all or part of the assets of
Gateway or any of its subsidiaries or any of their respective businesses;



(iii) make, or in any way participate in, directly or indirectly, any
"solicitation" of "proxies" (as such terms are used in the rules of the
Commission) to vote, or seek to advise or influence any Person or entity with
respect to the voting of, any voting securities of Gateway; become a
"participant" in any "election contest" (as such terms are defined or used in
the rules under the Exchange Act) with respect to Gateway; seek to advise,
encourage or influence any Person or entity with respect to any voting
securities of the other party; demand a copy of Gateways stock ledger, list
of stockholders or other books and records; or call or attempt to call any
meeting of the stockholders of Gateway;



(iv) form, join or in any way participate in a "group" (within the meaning of
Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act), together with his affiliates and
associates, with respect to any voting securities of Gateway or any of its
subsidiaries in connection with any of the actions in this Section 1.3(a);



(v) directly or indirectly enter into any discussions, negotiations,
arrangements or understandings with any other Person with respect to any of
the foregoing activities or propose any of such activities to any other
Person;



(vi) knowingly advise, assist, encourage, act as a financing source for or
otherwise invest in any other Person in connection with any of the foregoing
activities; or



(vii) publicly disclose any intention, plan or arrangement inconsistent with
any of the foregoing. (b) Notwithstanding Section 1.3(a), immediately upon occurrence of either of
the following, the Standstill Period shall terminate, and this Section 1.3
shall be of no further force and effect:



(i) if Gateway breaches any material provision of any of the Stockholders and
Registration Rights Agreement, the Non-Competition Agreement, the Employment
Agreement, or this Agreement, and fails to substantially cure such breach
within 45 days of written notice; or



(ii) if Mr. Huis beneficial ownership of the total issued and outstanding
Gateway Common Stock is less than 5% and remains below 5% for at least 120
consecutive days,



(c) Nothwithstanding Section 1.3(a), the Standstill Period shall be suspended
upon the occurrence, and during the pendency of, a Standstill Suspension
Period pursuant to section (ii)(y) of the definition thereof in that certain
Investment Agreement, dated as of October 20, 1999 by and between Gateway and
America Online, Inc., a Delaware corporation, as in effect on the date of the
Merger Agreement.

specifically excluding any retailer or division of any retailer.



1.3 _Non-Interference_. During the Restricted Period, the Individual shall
not, directly or indirectly, solicit, induce, encourage or attempt to solicit,
encourage or induce any Person known to the Executive to be an employee (or to
have been an employee within the then immediately preceding twelve (12) month
period) of Gateway or eMachines or any of their respective Subsidiaries to
terminate his or her employment or other relationship with Gateway or
eMachines or any of their respective Subsidiaries for any purposes
whatsoever,  _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing provision will not
prevent the Individual from hiring any such person (i) who contacts the
Individual on his or her own initiative without any direct or indirect
solicitation by or encouragement from the Individual, (ii) as a result of
placing general advertisements in trade journals, newspapers or similar
publications which are not directed at Gateway, eMachines or their respective
affiliates or employees, or (iii) as a result of the efforts of executive
recruiters who contact such person on their own initiative without any
encouragement from or on behalf of the Individual relating to Gateway,
eMachines or their respective affiliates or employees.



 

3 1.4 _Non-Solicitation_. During the Restricted Period, the Individual shall
not, directly or indirectly, solicit, induce, encourage or attempt to
solicit, induce or encourage any Person who is (or has been within the then
immediately preceding twelve (12) month period) a customer, client, vendor,
supplier or consultant of Gateway or eMachines or any of their Subsidiaries
to decrease the amount of business he, she or it conducts, or terminate his,
her or its relationship, with Gateway or eMachines or any of their
Subsidiaries for any purpose whatsoever.



1.5 _Restrictive Covenants_. Individual, by and through eMachines (taken as a

principal business is the Business. The Individual acknowledges that (i)
pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Gateway will acquire eMachines, including
eMachines assets and goodwill, and will carry on the Business that
previously had been conducted by eMachines and the Individual and (ii) the
restrictive covenants and the other agreements contained in this Agreement are
an essential part of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.
The Individual represents, warrants, acknowledges and agrees that he or she
has been fully advised by counsel in connection with the negotiation,
preparation, execution and delivery of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Accordingly, the Individual agrees to be bound
by the restrictive covenants and the other agreements contained in this
Agreement to the maximum extent permitted by law, it being the intent and
spirit of the parties that the restrictive covenants and the other agreements
contained herein shall be valid and enforceable in all respects, and, subject
to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, mutually dependent upon the
obligations of Gateway to pay the Merger Consideration due under the Merger
Agreement. The Individual further agrees that Gateway, in entering into the
Merger Agreement, has relied on the covenants of the Individual as set forth
in this Agreement and that Gateway would not have entered into the Merger
Agreement if the Individual had not agreed to be fully bound by the provisions
of this Agreement. However, Gateway and the Individual agree that if any
provision of this Agreement is found to be unenforceable due to restrictions
unreasonable in scope, duration or geographical area, then the appropriate
court may reform any such provision so that the restrictions in it are
reasonable and enforceable.



1.6 _No Additional Obligations of the Individual Excused_. All of the
provisions of Article I of this Agreement are in addition to any other
written agreements on the subjects covered herein that the Individual may have
with Gateway, eMachines and/or any of their respective Affiliates, and are not
meant to and do not excuse any additional obligations that the Individual may
have under such agreements.1

companies of similar size. During his employment with the Company, Employee

other stock arrangement established by the Company, Employee shall be granted,
effective upon his date of employment with the Company pursuant to this
Agreement, an initial option to purchase a total of ten million (10,000,000)

affiliates (as an employee, independent contractor, or otherwise) (such
conduct is collectively referred to as "solicitation") any person who is then
employed by the Company and/or any of its affiliates or who left the employ of
the Company and/or any of its affiliates less than one (1) year prior to the
solicitation. Nothing in this Subsection (b) shall prevent Employee from
hiring any such person (i) who contacts Employee on his or her own initiative
without any direct or indirect solicitation by or encouragement from Employee,
(ii) as a result of placing general advertisements in trade journals,
newspapers or similar publications which are not directed at the Company,

percent (1%) of any class of securities of any Competing Business (but
without otherwise participating in the activities of such Person) if such
securities are listed on a national securities exchange or have been
registered under Section



 

Page 8 of 19 12(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. As used herein, "Business Area"
shall mean all of the United States, Canada and all other parts of the world
in which the Company is conducting its Business as of the date hereof and has
conducted its Business within the twelve (12) months preceding the date
hereof. As used herein, "Competing Business" means a Person or division of
such Person whose principal business is the Business, but specifically
excluding any retailer or division of any retailer.



(d) Employee acknowledges that, in his employment hereunder, he will occupy a
position of trust and confidence with the Company and/or its affiliates.
Employee agrees that Employee shall not, except as may be required to perform
his duties hereunder or as required by applicable law, without limitation in
time or until such information shall have become public other than by
Employees unauthorized disclosure, use, disclose or disseminate any trade
secrets, confidential information or any other information of a secret,
proprietary, confidential or generally undisclosed nature relating to the
Company and/or any of its affiliates, or their respective businesses,
contracts, projects, proposed projects, revenues, costs, operations, methods
or procedures. Employee acknowledges that said information is specialized,
unique in nature and of great value to the Company and/or its affiliates, and
that such information gives the Company and/or its affiliates a competitive
advantage in their businesses.



(e) For the duration of his employment and after any termination of
employment, Employee shall not, without the prior written consent of the
Company, communicate to anyone other than the Company and those designated by
the Company or on behalf of the Company in the furtherance of its business or
to perform Employees duties hereunder, any trade secrets, confidential
information or any other information of a secret, proprietary, confidential
or generally undisclosed nature relating to the Company and/or its affiliates
and/or their businesses, or any other information referred to in subsection
(d) of this Section 10, obtained by Employee during Employees employment by
the Company that is not generally available public knowledge (other than by
acts or omissions by Employee in violation of this Agreement).



(f) Employee acknowledges and agrees that (a) the trade secrets and
confidential and related information referred to in this Agreement and (b)
the relationships with the Business Contacts referenced in this Agreement each
are of substantial value to the Company and/or its affiliates and that a
breach of any of the terms and conditions of this Agreement relating to
those subjects would cause irreparable harm to the Company and/or its
affiliates, for which the Company and/or its affiliates would have no adequate
remedy at law. Therefore, in addition to any other remedies that may be
available to the Company and/or any of its affiliates under this Agreement or
otherwise, the Company and/or its affiliates shall be entitled to obtain
temporary restraining orders, preliminary and permanent injunctions and/or
other equitable relief to specifically enforce Employees duties and
obligations under this Agreement, or to enjoin any breach of this Agreement,
without the need to post a bond or other security and without the need to
demonstrate special damages. Furthermore, Employee agrees that any damages
suffered by the Company and/or its affiliates as a result of Employees breach
of Employees duties and obligations under this Agreement shall entitle the
Company and/or its affiliates to offset such damages against any payments
to be made pursuant to this Agreement, to the extent permitted by applicable
law.



 

Page 9 of 19 (g) Employee and the Company intend that: (i) this Section 10 concerning
(among other things) the exclusive services of Employee to the Company and/or
its affiliates shall be construed as a series of separate covenants; (ii) if
any portion of the restrictions set forth in this Section 10 should, for any
reason whatsoever, be declared invalid by an arbitrator or a court of
competent jurisdiction, the validity or enforceability of the remainder of
such restrictions shall not thereby be adversely affected; and (iii) Employee
declares that the territorial and time limitations set forth in this Section
10 are reasonable and properly required for the adequate protection of the
business of the Company and/or its affiliates. In the event that any such
territorial or time limitation is deemed to be unreasonable by an arbitrator
or a court of competent jurisdiction, Employee agrees to the reduction of the
subject territorial or time limitation to the area or period which such
arbitrator or court shall have deemed reasonable.



(h) All of the provisions of this Section 10 are in addition to any other
written agreements on the subjects covered herein that Employee may have with
the Company and/or any of its affiliates, and are not meant to and do not
excuse any additional obligations that Employee may have under such
agreements.

   15. | Non-Disparagement of the Company

During Employees employment with the Company and at all times thereafter,
Employee agrees not to make, directly or indirectly, any public or
private statements, gestures, signs, signals or other verbal or nonverbal,

its affiliates and/or their businesses, or any of their past, present or
future officers, directors, employees, advisors, agents, policies, procedures,
practices, decision-making, conduct, professionalism or compliance with
standards. The provisions of this Section are in addition to any other written

Agreement, but shall be confined in its operation to the provision of this
Agreement directly involved in the controversy in which such judgment shall
have been rendered.



   19. | Arbitration of Disputes 
---|--- 



Except as is necessary for Employee and the Company to preserve their
respective rights under this Agreement by seeking necessary equitable
relief (including, but not limited to, the Companys rights under Section 10
of this Agreement) from a court of competent jurisdiction, the Company and
Employee agree that any and all disputes based upon, relating to or arising
out of this Agreement, Employees employment relationship with the Company
and/or the termination of that relationship, and/or any other dispute by and
between the Company and Employee, including any and all claims Employee may at
any time attempt to assert against the Company, shall be submitted to binding
arbitration in California, pursuant to the American Arbitration Associations
("AAA") National Rules for the Resolution of Employment Disputes (the
"Rules"), provided that the arbitrator shall allow for discovery sufficient
to adequately arbitrate any statutory claims, including access to essential
documents and witnesses, and otherwise in accordance with California Code of
Civil Procedure § 1283.05, and provided further that the Rules shall be
modified by the arbitrator to the extent necessary to be consistent with
applicable law. The arbitrator shall be a retired judge of the California
Superior Court, California Court of Appeal, or United States District Court,
to be mutually agreed upon by the parties. If, however, the parties are unable
to agree upon an arbitrator, then an arbitrator who is a retired judge of the
California Superior Court, California Court of Appeal, or United States
District Court, shall be selected by AAA in accordance with the Rules. The
Company and Employee further agree that each party shall pay its own costs and
attorneys fees, if any; provided, however, that if either party prevails on a
statutory claim which affords the prevailing party an award of attorneys
fees, then the arbitrator may award reasonable attorneys fees to the
prevailing party, consistent with applicable law. In any event, the Company
shall pay any expenses that Employee would not otherwise have incurred if the
dispute had been adjudicated in a court of law, rather than through
arbitration, including the arbitrators fee, any administrative fee and any
filing fee in excess of the maximum court filing fee in the jurisdiction in
which the arbitration is commenced. The Company and Employee further agree
that any hearing must be transcribed by a certified shorthand reporter, and
that the arbitrator shall issue a written decision and award supported by
essential findings of fact and conclusions of law in order to facilitate
judicial review. Said award and decision shall be issued within thirty (30)
days of the completion of the arbitration. Judgment in a court of competent
jurisdiction may be had on said decision and award of the arbitrator. For
these purposes, the parties agree to submit to the jurisdiction of the state
and federal courts located in Los Angeles, California.



   20. | Governing Laws

This Agreement shall be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance
with the laws of the State of California, without regard to its conflict
of laws rules.

 Appendix "A"



   1. | Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, if it
shall be determined that upon or following a Change of Control pursuant to
this Appendix, that any payment or distribution by the Company to or for the
benefit of the Employee (whether paid or payable or distributed or
distributable pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or otherwise, but
determined without regard to any additional payments required under this
Appendix) (a "Payment") would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section
4999 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") or any
interest or penalties are incurred by the Employee with respect to
such excise tax (such excise tax, together with any such interest and
penalties, are hereinafter collectively referred to as the "Excise Tax"), then
the Employee shall be entitled to receive: (i) an additional payment (a
"Gross-Up Payment") in an amount such that after payment by the Employee of
all taxes (including any interest or penalties imposed with respect to such
taxes), including, without limitation, any income taxes (and any interest and
penalties imposed with respect thereto) and Excise Tax imposed upon the
Gross-Up Payment, the Employee retains an amount of the Gross-Up Payment equal
to the Excise Tax imposed upon the Payments, and (ii) an amount equal to the
product of any deductions disallowed for federal, state or local income tax
purposes because of the inclusion of the Gross-Up Payment in the Employees
adjusted gross income multiplied by the highest applicable marginal rate of
federal, state, or local income taxation, respectively, for the calendar year
in which the Gross-Up Payment is to be made. 
---|--- 



   2. | All determinations required to be made under this Appendix,
including whether and when a Gross-Up Payment is required and the amount of
such Gross-Up Payment and the assumptions to be utilized in arriving at such
determination, shall be made by a nationally recognized accounting firm as may
be designated by the Employee (the "Accounting Firm") which shall provide
detailed supporting calculations both to the Company and the Employee within
15 business days of the receipt of notice from the Employee that there has
been a Payment, or such earlier time as is requested by the Company. In the
event that the Accounting Firm is serving as accountant or auditor for
the individual, entity or group effecting the Change of Control, the Employee
shall appoint another nationally recognized accounting firm to make the
determinations required hereunder (which accounting firm shall then be
referred to as the Accounting Firm hereunder). All fees and expenses of the
Accounting Firm shall be borne solely by the Company. Any Gross-Up Payment, as
determined pursuant to this Appendix, shall be paid by the Company to the
Employee within ten (10) days of the receipt of the Accounting Firms
determination. Any determination by the Accounting Firm shall be binding upon
the Company and the Employee. As a result of the uncertainty in the
application of Section 4999 of the Code at the time of the
initial determination by the Accounting Firm hereunder, it is possible that
Gross-Up Payments which will not have been made by the Company should have
been made ("Underpayment"), consistent with the calculations required to be
made hereunder. In the event that the Company exhausts its remedies pursuant
to This Appendix and the Employee thereafter is required to make a payment of
any Excise Tax, the Accounting Firm shall determine the amount of the
Underpayment that has occurred and any such Underpayment shall be promptly
paid by the Company to or for the benefit of the Employee. by the Internal Revenue Service that, if successful, would require the payment
by the Company of the Gross-Up Payment. Such notification shall be given as
soon as practicable but no later than ten (10) business days after the
Employee is informed in writing of such claim and shall apprise the Company of
the nature of such claim and the date on which such claim is requested to be
paid. The Employee shall not pay such claim prior to the expiration of the
thirty (30)-day period following the date on which it gives such notice to the
Company (or such shorter period ending on the date that any payment of
taxes with respect to such claim is due). If the Company notifies the
Employee in writing prior to the expiration of such period that it desires to
contest such claim, the Employee shall: 
---|--- 


a) give the Company any information reasonably requested by the Company
relating to such claim,



b) take such action in connection with contesting such claim as the Company
shall reasonably request in writing from time to time, including, without
limitation, accepting legal representation with respect to such claim by an
attorney reasonably selected by the Company,



c) cooperate with the Company in good faith in order to effectively contest
such claim, and



d) permit the Company to participate in any proceedings relating to such
claim; provided, however, that the Company shall bear and pay directly all
costs and expenses (including additional interest and penalties) incurred in
connection with such contest and shall indemnify and hold the Employee
harmless, on an after-tax basis, for any Excise Tax or income tax (including
interest and penalties with respect thereto) imposed as a result of such
representation and payment of costs and expenses. Without limitation on the
foregoing provisions of this Appendix, the Company shall control all
proceedings taken in connection with such contest and, at its sole option, may
pursue or forgo any and all administrative appeals, proceedings, hearings and
conferences with the taxing authority in respect of such claim and may, at its
sole option, either direct the Employee to pay the tax claimed and sue for a
refund or contest the claim in any permissible manner, and the Employee
agrees to prosecute such contest to a determination before any administrative
tribunal, in a court of initial jurisdiction and in one or more appellate
courts, as the Company shall determine; provided, however, that if the
Company directs the Employee to pay such claim and sue for a refund, the
Company shall advance the amount of such payment to the Employee, on an
interest-free basis and shall indemnify and hold the Employee harmless, on an
after-tax basis, from any Excise Tax or income tax (including interest or
penalties with respect thereto) imposed with respect to such advance or with
respect to any imputed income with respect to such advance; and further
provided that any extension of the statute of limitations relating to payment
of taxes for the taxable year of the Employee with respect to which such
contested amount is claimed to be due is limited solely to such contested
amount. Furthermore, the Companys control of the contest shall be limited to
issues with respect to which a Gross-Up Payment would be payable hereunder and
the Employee shall be entitled to settle or contest, as the case may be, any
other issue raised by the Internal Revenue Service or any other taxing    authority. To the extent the foregoing would be in violation of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 or any successor law thereto, the Employee shall
have no obligation to repay any amount advanced to him under this Appendix.



   4. | If, after the receipt by the Employee of an amount advanced by the
Company pursuant to this Appendix, the Employee becomes entitled to receive
any refund with respect to such claim, the Employee shall (subject to the
Companys complying with the requirements of this Appendix) promptly pay to
the Company the amount of such refund (together with any interest paid or
credited thereon after taxes applicable thereto). If, after the receipt by
the Employee of an amount advanced by the Company pursuant to this Appendix, a
determination is made that the Employee shall not be entitled to any refund
with respect to such claim and the Company does not notify the Employee
in writing of its intent to contest such denial of refund prior to the
expiration of 30 days after such determination, then such advance shall be
forgiven and shall not be required to be repaid and the amount of such advance
shall offset, to the extent thereof, the amount of Gross-Up Payment required
to be paid. _EXHIBIT F_

as follows:



ARTICLE 1

1.1 _Consent to Escrow_. Each of Gateway and Mr. Hui has hereby agreed that:
(i) all the Initial Escrow Shares shall be withheld from Mr. Hui and held in
escrow from the date hereof through the Termination Date (as defined below),
and (ii) any Reallocation Shares (together with the Initial Escrow Shares, the
" _Escrow Shares_ ") shall be withheld from Mr. Hui and held in escrow from
the date they are issued through the Termination Date. The Escrow Shares shall
be held in escrow through [ ], 2005 or, if Escrow Shares are
still required to be held in accordance with the provisions of Section 10 of
the Indemnification Agreement, the date that Mr. Hui is entitled to receive
all Escrow Shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 10 of the
Indemnification Agreement (the " _Termination Date_ "). __



1.2  _Delivery_. Gateway is hereby authorized by Mr. Hui to, and shall,
deposit, on behalf of Mr. Hui, with the Escrow Agent, to be held by the Escrow
Agent pursuant to the terms of this Agreement (i) certificates, on the Closing
Date, representing the Initial Escrow Shares, and (ii) certificates
representing the Reallocation Shares at such times as the Reallocation Shares
are issued.



1.3 _Receipt; Escrow Account_. The Escrow Agent hereby agrees (i) to accept
delivery of the Escrow Shares and process such delivery based on instructions
given to the Escrow Agent and (ii) to hold the Escrow Shares in an escrow
account (the " _Escrow Account_ ") in accordance with the terms and conditions
of this Agreement and for the uses and purposes stated herein. The Escrow
Account, unless it holds cash, shall not be an interest bearing account. Cash,
if any, held in the Escrow Account shall be invested in a money market account
mutually acceptable to Mr. Hui and Gateway, as specified in written
instructions from Mr. Hui and Gateway to the Escrow Agent (the " _Money
Market Account_ ").



 

2 In no event shall any part of the Escrow Shares be commingled with any other
securities held by the Escrow Agent or any of its parents, subsidiaries or
affiliates. The Escrow Agent shall, promptly following the end of each
calendar month, send to Mr. Hui and Gateway with respect to the Escrow Shares
a statement of holdings and transactions in form and substance customarily
provided to clients. The Escrow Account shall not be subject to any lien or
attachment by any creditor of either party hereto and shall be used solely for
the purposes set forth in this Agreement and the Indemnification Agreement.
The Escrow Shares and any amounts in the Escrow Account shall not be used by
the Escrow Agent to offset any obligations that either Gateway or Mr. Hui
might have to the Escrow Agent or any of its Affiliates, whether under this
Agreement or under any other agreement or arrangement in any other capacity,
nor shall the Escrow Agent have any lien or claim upon the assets in any form
whatsoever.



1.4 _Distribution and Dividends_. All cash dividends on Escrow Shares, when
and if received by the Escrow Agent, shall be remitted and paid by the Escrow
Agent directly to Mr. Hui and shall not be subject to this Agreement.
Additional shares of capital stock issued on or with respect to the Escrow
Shares as a result of stock splits, stock dividends or other similar capital
adjustments to, or recapitalizations on, the Escrow Shares or all other
distributions (other than cash dividends) thereof (the " _Additional
Distributions_ ") shall be delivered by Gateway (through its stock transfer
agent) to the Escrow Agent and retained in the Escrow Account subject to the
terms hereof and shall constitute Escrow Property (as defined below). The
Escrow Agent hereby agrees to accept delivery of the Additional Distributions
and to hold the Additional Distributions in accordance with the terms and
conditions of this Agreement. Mr. Hui shall be treated as the beneficial owner
of the Escrow Property for tax purposes.



1.5 _Voting of Shares_. All voting rights with respect to the Escrow Shares
may be exercised by Mr. Hui, by delivering written voting instructions to the
Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent will then vote the Escrow Shares in accordance
with such written instructions. In the absence of such written instructions,
the Escrow Agent need not vote or cause the voting of such shares. If the
Escrow Agent shall have received proxies, consents or other documents as may
be necessary to enable Mr. Hui to exercise such voting rights (collectively,
the "Stockholder Documents"), the Escrow Agent shall deliver such Stockholder
Documents to Mr. Hui in the time frame prescribed in the following sentence.
The Escrow Agent hereby covenants to use its reasonable best efforts to
deliver each Stockholder Document to Mr. Hui no later than two (2) Business
Days after the Escrow Agent receives such Stockholder Document. "Business
Day" shall mean a day of the year



 

3 other than a Saturday, Sunday or other day on which banks are required or
authorized to close in New York City. 



1.6 _Transferability; Sale_. The interest of Mr. Hui in the Escrow Shares and
any other property comprising the Escrow Account (the " _Escrow Property_ ")
shall not be offered for sale, sold, pledged, assigned, transferred (including
by operation of law) or otherwise disposed of, directly or indirectly, or be
subject to a transaction which would have the same effect, or be subject to
any swap, hedge or other arrangement that transfers, in whole or in part, any
of the economic consequences of ownership of the Escrow Property, whether
any such aforementioned transaction is to be settled by delivery of the
Escrow Property, in cash or otherwise, so long as such Escrow Property is held
by the Escrow Agent hereunder; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Escrow Agent
may sell, transfer, or otherwise dispose of the Escrow Property pursuant to
Sections 2.1 and 2.2 hereof, and as otherwise provided in this Agreement.



ARTICLE 2

2.1 _Disbursement Request_



(a) At any time prior to the Termination Date, upon written certification by
Gateway to the Escrow Agent that an amount is due and payable by Mr. Hui to
Gateway pursuant to the Indemnification Agreement (a " _Claim Amount_ ") and
such amount has not been paid, Gateway (on its own behalf or on behalf of any
other Person to whom such amount is to be paid) may request a disbursement,
subject to Section 3.1, from the Escrow Account in payment of such amount, or
the undisputed portion thereof, if any, by delivering to the Escrow Agent and
Mr. Hui a written notice (a " _Gateway Payment Request_ ") which specifies

subject to Section 3.1, from the Escrow Account of such shares, or the
undisputed amount thereof, if any, by delivering to the Escrow Agent and
Gateway a written notice (a " _Mr. Hui Release Request_ ") which specifies the
Mr. Hui Claim Amount. Each Mr. Hui Release Request shall be accompanied by
a  



 

4  representation to the Escrow Agent that a copy of such Mr. Hui Release
Request has been provided to Gateway. The Escrow Agent promptly shall mail a
copy of such Mr. Hui Release Request to Gateway at the address set forth in
Section 5.2.



2.2 _Escrow Agent s Disbursements from the Escrow Account_



(a) _Disbursements upon Joint Instructions_. The Escrow Agent will distribute
the Escrow Property, or any portion thereof, having a Fair Market Value equal
to the Claim Amount (or such lesser amount of Escrow Property as is then held
in the Escrow Account), in accordance with, and upon receipt of, the joint
written instructions of Gateway and Mr. Hui.



(b) _Disbursements upon Receipt of Final Determination_. If either Gateway or
Mr. Hui delivers to Escrow Agent a final notice of the claim for
indemnification and the amount of Losses related thereto (the " _Final
Determination Notice_ "), together with a copy of a Final Arbitration Award
(as defined below) or an order of a court of competent jurisdiction providing
for the disbursement of Escrow Property (each an " _Order_ ") and a
certificate, signed by Mr. Hui or an officer of Gateway, as
applicable, stating that such order is not subject to appeal, or that the
appeal period with respect to such order has elapsed and no appeal has been
taken, together with evidence reasonably satisfactory to the Escrow Agent that
a copy of the Order has been delivered to the other of them, then the Escrow
Agent shall disburse the Escrow Property, or any portion thereof, in
accordance with the Order on the tenth (10th) Business Day following the
Escrow Agents receipt of the Order, such certificate and evidence of
delivery. The Escrow Agent shall mail a copy of the Order to the non-
delivering party at the address set forth in Section 5.2.



(c) _Disbursements upon Gateway Payment Request_. Subject to the provisions of
Article 3, on the tenth (10th) Business Day after receipt from Gateway of a

Escrow Agent will distribute to Gateway (for the account of Gateway or another
Person, as the case may be) the Escrow Property, or any portion thereof,
having a Fair Market Value equal to the Claim Amount (or such lesser amount of
Escrow Property as is then held in the Escrow Account).



(d) _Disbursement upon Lapse of Termination Date_. On the Termination Date,
the Escrow Agent will distribute the remaining portion of the Escrow Account,
or the undisputed portion thereof (if any) in the event that any portion of
the Escrow Account is subject to a Payment Dispute (as defined below) at such
time, to Mr. Hui.



 

5 (e) _Disbursements upon Mr. Hui Release Request_. Subject to the provisions
of Article 3, on the tenth (10th) Business Day after receipt from Mr. Hui of

2.1(b) above not less than ten (10) Business Days prior to such date), the
Escrow Agent will distribute to Mr. Hui the Escrow Shares to which he is
entitled in accordance with the provisions of Section 10 of the
Indemnification Agreement.



ARTICLE 3

DISPUTE RESOLUTION



3.1 _Payment Disputes_. If, after delivery of a Gateway Payment Request, Mr.
Hui desires to challenge the propriety and/or the amount of the disbursement
requested therein or, after delivery of a Mr. Hui Release Request, Gateway
desires to challenge the propriety and/or the amount of the disbursement
requested therein (a " _Payment Dispute_ "), then Mr. Hui or Gateway,
respectively, may do so prior to the tenth (10th) Business Day after
a Gateway Payment Request or a Mr. Hui Release Request, as the case may be,
is given by delivering to the Escrow Agent and Gateway or Mr. Hui, as the case
may be, written notice (a " _Dispute Notice_ ") describing in reasonable
detail the amount of the requested distribution to be challenged and the
basis for such challenge (or, in the alternative, stating that Mr. Hui or
Gateway, as the case may be, does not possess information sufficient to
determine the propriety and/or amount of the requested disbursement). After
delivery of a Dispute Notice, until it receives written instruction from
Gateway and Mr. Hui pursuant to Section 3.2 or the Arbitration Panel pursuant
to Section 3.3, the Escrow Agent will not make the requested distribution
(other than any portion thereof not challenged in the Dispute Notice).



3.2 _Amicable Resolution_. Within twenty (20) Business Days after timely
delivery of a Dispute Notice, the chief executive officer (or other authorized
representative) of Gateway and Mr. Hui will meet to attempt amicably to
resolve the matters which are the basis for such Dispute Notice (a " _Dispute_
"). If such Dispute has not been amicably resolved within 30 Business Days,
then either party may give notice to the other of the inability to resolve
the Dispute (a "Non-Resolution Notice"). If the Dispute is amicably resolved,
upon such resolution, if appropriate to effect such resolution, the parties
will deliver to the Escrow Agent written directions executed by Gateway
and Mr. Hui with respect to such requested actions with respect to
disbursement of the Escrow Property or, if appropriate, Gateway will withdraw
such request for action with respect to disbursement from the Escrow Account.



 

6 Any such resolution agreed upon in writing by Gateway and Mr. Hui will be
final and binding upon Gateway and Mr. Hui. 



3.3 _Arbitration_.



(a) _Generally_. The arbitration procedures described in this Section 3.3
will be the sole and exclusive method of resolving and remedying Disputes that
have not been resolved pursuant to Section 3.2 hereof. The arbitration shall
be conducted in accordance with the rules for complex cases of the
American Arbitration Association (" _AAA_ ") then in effect (the " _Rules_
").



(b) _Procedures_. If Gateway and Mr. Hui do not amicably resolve their Dispute
and either party properly gives a Non-Resolution Notice, then such
disagreements will be submitted to binding arbitration. The arbitral
proceeding will take place in San Diego, California or another place agreeable
to Gateway and Mr. Hui, before an arbitration panel consisting of three
individuals experienced in matters of the type involved in the challenge (the
"Arbitration Panel"). Within twenty (20) Business Days after delivery of the
Dispute Notice, Gateway will choose one such individual and Mr. Hui will
choose one such individual to serve as its representative on the Arbitration
Panel, and those two individuals jointly will choose a third such individual
within ten (10) Business Days thereafter; provided, that if those two
individuals cannot agree upon an acceptable third member of the Arbitration
Panel within such period, the third member will be chosen under the Rules.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if either Gateway or Mr. Hui fails to choose an
individual to serve as its representative on the Arbitration Panel within
such twenty-day period, the representative selected by the other party shall
resolve the dispute individually; _provided_ , _however_ , that the party who
selected a representative must first give notice to the party failing to
select a representative of such partys failure and such non-selecting party
shall have 10 Business Days from the date of such notice to cure its failure
to select a representative. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Mr. Hui and
Gateway may agree to choose a single arbitrator who is agreeable to them to
resolve the dispute individually.



(c) _Conduct of Arbitration_. The arbitration (including discovery) will be
conducted under the Rules, as the same may be modified by any written
agreement between Gateway and Mr. Hui. The Arbitration Panel will conduct the
arbitration in a manner so that the final result, determination, finding,
judgment or award determined by the Arbitration Panel (the " _Final
Arbitration Award_ ") is made or rendered as soon as practicable, and Gateway
and Mr. Hui will use reasonable efforts to cause a Final Arbitration Award to
occur within ninety (90) days after the Arbitration Panel is selected. Any
Final Arbitration 



 

7 Award will be final and binding upon Gateway and Mr. Hui and there will be no
appeal from or reexamination of any Final Arbitration Award, except in the
case of fraud or perjury or misconduct by the Arbitration Panel prejudicing
the rights of Gateway or Mr. Hui or to correct manifest clerical errors. The
Arbitration Panels written decision will include instructions to the Escrow
Agent for any disbursement from the Escrow Account which the Arbitration Panel
deems appropriate.



(d) _Enforcement_. A Final Arbitration Award may be enforced in any state or
federal court having jurisdiction over the subject matter of the related
Payment Dispute.



(e)  _Expenses_. As part of the Final Arbitration Award, the prevailing party
in any arbitration proceeding described in this Section 3.3 will be entitled
to recover from the non-prevailing party its reasonable attorneys fees and
disbursements and other out-of-pocket costs, and the non-prevailing party
also will be required to pay all other reasonable costs and expenses
associated with the arbitration if the Arbitration Panel determines that the
non-prevailing partys claim or defense, as the case may be, was without
merit. As part of any Final Arbitration Award, the Arbitration Panel may
designate the prevailing party for purposes of this Section 3.3(e).



3.4 _Valuation of Escrow Property_.



(a) _Fair Market Value_. For purpose of this Agreement, the Fair Market Value
of each of the Escrow Shares shall be the average closing price per share of
Gateway Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") for the five-day
trading period ending on the day prior to the date on which the
indemnification claim was "finally determined" (as defined below), with
appropriate adjustment to take into account any stock split, reverse stock
split, stock dividend, recapitalization or other similar capital adjustments
with respect to the Gateway Common Stock. For purposes of this Section 3.4,
the date on which an indemnification claim was "finally determined" shall mean
(i) in the case of Section 2.2(a), the payment date stated in the joint
written instructions; (ii) in the case of Section 2.2(b), the payment date
stated in the Final Determination Notice; (iii) in the case of Section 2.2(c),
the payment date stated in the Gateway Payment Request; (iv) in the case of
Section 2.2(d), the Termination Date and (v) in the case of Section 2.2(e),
the payment date specified in the Mr. Hui Release Request; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that nothing in this Section 3.4(a) shall prejudice the right of
any Indemnified Party to seek full indemnification for any Claimed Amount for
which the Escrow Property is not the sole recourse pursuant to the
Indemnification Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein,
Escrow Property to be released shall be rounded to the nearest share.



 

8 (b) _Calculation_. The Fair Market Value shall be calculated jointly by
Gateway and Mr. Hui within five (5) Business Days after the date on which an
indemnification claim has been "finally determined" (as defined in Section
3.4(a) above), and the results of such calculation shall be provided to the
Escrow Agent in writing signed by both Gateway and Mr. Hui (the " _Joint
Notice_ ") within such 5-day period. In no event shall the Escrow Agent be
required to determine the Fair Market Value of the Escrow Property. The Joint
Notice shall specify (i) the Claim Amount, (ii) the Fair Market Value of
Escrow Property on a per share basis, (iii) and the exact number of shares of
Escrow Shares and the amount of other Escrow Property (if any) to be released
from the escrow. The Escrow Agent shall have no duty whatsoever to
independently verify the accuracy of such calculation and shall be entitled to
rely on the calculation provided to the Escrow Agent by Gateway and Mr. Hui.



3.5 _Power to Transfer Escrow Property_. The Escrow Agent is hereby granted
the power to effect any transfer of Escrow Property contemplated by this
Agreement. Each of Gateway and Mr. Hui will do, execute and deliver, or will
cause to be done, executed and delivered, all such further acts and
instruments which the Escrow Agent may reasonably request from time to time
in order to effect any transfer of Escrow Property contemplated by this
Agreement. The Escrow Agent is not the stock transfer agent of the Escrow
Shares and so may not be able to distribute shares in the appropriate numbers
directly to the persons entitled to them pursuant to this Agreement.
Accordingly, the Escrow Agent shall have satisfied its duty to deliver Escrow
Shares when it shall deliver certificates representing the appropriate number
of shares to such transfer agent with instructions as to how such shares
should be distributed to the persons entitled to them.

Agreement, Gateway hereby agrees to pay to the Escrow Agent its reasonable
fees and expenses, including attorneys fees, postal and delivery charges, and
all other out-of-pocket expenses in accepting and performing its appointment
as the Escrow Agent hereunder (collectively, the " _Escrow Agent Expenses_ ")
in accordance with the fee schedule set forth in



 

9 _Exhibit C_ hereto. The reasonable fees and expenses of the Escrow Agent
arising out of a dispute between Gateway and Mr. Hui hereunder shall be paid
by the non-prevailing party. In the event of any material change in the fees

in writing of such change as soon as practicable after the Escrow Agent is
made aware of the change.



4.3  _Limitation of Escrow Agent s Duties and Liabilities_.



(a) The duties and responsibilities of the Escrow Agent hereunder shall be
determined solely by the express provisions of this Agreement, and no other or
further duties or responsibilities shall be implied. The Escrow Agent shall
not have any liability under, nor duty to inquire into, the terms and
provisions of any agreement or instructions, other than as outlined in this
Agreement, including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
Merger Agreement. It is understood and agreed that should any dispute arise
with respect to the payment and/or ownership or right of possession of the
Escrow Property, the Escrow Agent is authorized and directed to retain in its
possession, without liability to anyone, all or any part of the Escrow
Property until such dispute shall have been settled either by mutual agreement
by the parties concerned or by the final decision of the arbitrators pursuant
to Section 3.3(c) hereof, but the Escrow Agent shall not be authorized, nor
shall it be under any duty whatsoever to, institute or defend any such
arbitration proceedings.



(b) The Escrow Agent may rely and shall be protected in acting or refraining
from acting upon any written notice, instruction or request furnished to it
hereunder and believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or
presented by the proper party or parties. The Escrow Agent shall be under no
duty to inquire into or investigate the validity, accuracy or content of
such document. The Escrow Agent shall have no duty to solicit any items which
may be due it hereunder.



(c) The Escrow Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted by it
in good faith unless a court of competent jurisdiction determines that the
Escrow Agents willful misconduct or gross negligence was the primary cause of
any loss to Gateway or Mr. Hui. In no event shall the Escrow Agent be liable
for punitive, special, incidental or consequential damages. The Escrow Agent
may consult with counsel of its own choice and shall have full and complete
authorization and protection for any action taken or omitted by it hereunder
in good faith and in accordance with the opinion of such counsel.



(d) The Escrow Agent shall not incur any liability for following the
instructions herein contained or expressly provided for, or written
instructions given jointly by Gateway and Mr. Hui or by either of them
individually.



 

10 (e) In the event that the Escrow Agent shall be uncertain as to its duties or
rights hereunder or shall receive instructions, claims or demands from any
party hereto which, in its opinion, conflict with any of the provisions of
this Agreement, it shall be entitled to refrain from taking any action and its
sole obligation shall be to keep safely all property held in escrow until it
shall be directed otherwise in writing by all of the other parties hereto or
by a final order or judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction.



4.4 _No Security Interest_. Mr. Hui warrants to and agrees with Gateway and
the Escrow Agent that, unless otherwise expressly set forth in this Agreement,
there is no security interest in the Escrow Shares or any part thereof created
by it or in respect of any of its obligations or liabilities; they know of no
financing statement under the Uniform Commercial Code which is on file in any
jurisdiction claiming a security interest in or describing (whether
specifically or generally) the Escrow Shares or any part thereof; and the
Escrow Agent shall have no responsibility at any time to ascertain whether or
not any security interest exists in the Escrow Shares or any part thereof or
to file any financing statement under the Uniform Commercial Code with respect
to the Escrow Shares or any part thereof. 



4.5 _Indemnification_. Gateway and Mr. Hui hereby agree to jointly and
severally indemnify the Escrow Agent for, and to hold it harmless against any
loss, liability or expense arising out of or in connection with this Agreement
and carrying out its duties hereunder, including the costs and expenses
of investigating or defending itself against any claim of liability, except
in those cases where the Escrow Agent has been guilty of gross negligence or
willful misconduct. The costs of enforcing this indemnity shall be paid by
Gateway and Mr. Hui if the Escrow Agent is determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be the prevailing party, _provided_ , that Gateway, on the one
hand, and Mr. Hui, on the other hand, shall each pay one-half of such costs.
This right of indemnification shall survive the termination of this Agreement
and the resignation of the Escrow Agent.



4.6 _Authority to Sign_. Each of Gateway and Mr. Hui have satisfied themselves
as to the authority of any persons signing this Agreement in a representative
capacity. Should it be necessary for the Escrow Agent to accept or act upon
any instructions, directions, documents or instruments signed or issued by or
on behalf of any corporation, partnership, trade-name, fiduciary or
individual, it shall not be necessary for the Escrow



 

11 Agent to inquire into the authority of the signer(s) unless and to the extent
expressly provided in this Agreement. 



ARTICLE 5

unavailable or unwilling to continue in its capacity herewith, the
Escrow Agent may resign and be discharged from its duties or obligations
hereunder by giving its resignation to the parties to this Agreement,

notice date of when such resignation will take effect. Gateway will designate
a successor escrow agent prior to the expiration of such period by giving
written notice to the Escrow Agent and Mr. Hui. Gateway may appoint a
successor escrow agent with the consent of Mr. Hui, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld. The Escrow Agent will promptly transfer the Escrow
Property to such designated successor. If an instrument of acceptance by a
successor escrow agent shall not have been delivered to the Escrow Agent
within thirty (30) calendar days after giving of notice of such resignation,
the Escrow Agent may, at the expense of Gateway and Mr. Hui, petition any
court of competent jurisdiction to appoint a successor escrow agent. Upon

shall become effective when two or more counterparts have been signed by each
of the parties and delivered to the other parties.



5.7 _Entire Agreement; Assignment_. This Agreement, together with the Merger
Agreement and the Indemnification Agreement, constitutes the
entire understanding and agreement of the parties with respect to the subject

any other condition or breach of any other provision contained herein.



5.10 _Remedies Cumulative_. The rights and remedies conferred upon the parties
hereto shall be cumulative, and the exercise or waiver of any such right or
remedy shall not preclude or inhibit the exercise of any additional rights or
remedies. The waiver of any right or remedy hereunder shall not preclude the
subsequent exercise of such right or remedy.



5.11 _Severability_. The invalidity, illegality or unenforceability of any
provision of this Agreement shall in no way affect the validity, legality or
enforceability of any other provision; and if any provision is held to be
unenforceable as a matter of law, the other provisions shall not be affected
thereby and shall remain in full force and effect.



 

15 5.12 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended, modified and supplemented in
any and all respects, but only by a written instrument signed by all of the
parties hereto expressly stating that such instrument is intended to amend,
modify or supplement this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the

Hui, the Escrow Agent will resign and Gateway will appoint a successor escrow

to this Agreement.
