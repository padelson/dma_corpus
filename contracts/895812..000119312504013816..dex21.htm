Employee would not otherwise have incurred if the dispute had been adjudicated in a court of law, rather than through arbitration, including the arbitrator&#146;s fee, any administrative fee and any filing fee in excess of the maximum court filing
fee in the jurisdiction in which the arbitration is commenced. The Company and Employee further agree that any hearing must be transcribed by a certified shorthand reporter, and that the arbitrator shall issue a written decision and award supported
by essential findings of fact and conclusions of law in order to facilitate judicial review. Said award and decision shall be issued within thirty (30) days of the completion of the arbitration. Judgment in a court of competent jurisdiction may be
had on said decision and award of the arbitrator. For these purposes, the parties agree to submit to the jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in Los Angeles, California. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT
