(a)

    |  

Seller  shall deliver on the date hereof a disclosure letter substantially in
the  form attached as Exhibit B (the "Signing Date Seller Disclosure

to the facts or circumstances as at the date of this  Agreement.

    
---|---|--- 
 

 



 

      

 

    |  

(b)

    |

---|---|---

Seller Disclosure Letter; and

    
---|---|--- 
 

 



 

      

 

    |  

(ii)

    |  

in  respect of any other Warranties of Part C of Schedule 1 have occurred 
since the date of this Agreement and were not known by Seller or the  Company
as of such date,

    
---|---|--- 
 

 



 

and which, in the case of each of (i) and (ii) would, without such
disclosure, result in the failure of the condition set forth in Clause

entitled to accept or reject the draft Updated Seller Disclosure Letter and
that the draft Updated Seller Disclosure Letter may raise issues that Buyer
believes should be addressed by way of amendment of this Agreement or the
other Transaction Documents. For the avoidance of doubt but without limiting
any rights in respect of prior breach or Warranty or covenant, if a draft
Updated Seller Disclosure Letter is proposed, the Parties shall not be
required to consummate the transactions to be consummated at Closing unless
such draft Updated Seller Disclosure Letter is agreed.

Buyer Indemnitees, each, an "Indemnitee") from and against, and pay or
reimburse the Seller Indemnitees for, any Losses (for these purposes a bona
fide claim means a claim by any Person that is not an Affiliate of any of the
Seller Parties) whatsoever resulting from (a) any material inaccuracy in or
material breach of any representation or warranty when made or deemed made by
Buyer or Kolomoisky in or pursuant to this Agreement or (b) any
material breach or default in performance by Buyer or Kolomoisky of any of
their covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement.

 



 

6.3 Indemnification Procedure.

 



 

      

 

    |  

(a)

    |  

A  claim (which shall include any claim in respect of a breach of any 
Warranty) hereunder (an "Indemnity Claim") shall  be asserted by written
notice from the Party asserting such Indemnity  Claim (the "Indemnified 
Party") to the Party from whom indemnification is sought (the 
"Indemnifying  Party"). Such notice shall include information regarding  the
nature and basis for the Indemnity Claim and an estimate of the amount  of
Losses demanded (including, to the extent practicable, a calculation of  the
alleged Losses).

    
---|---|--- 
 

 



 

      

 

    |  

(b)

    |  

If  the Indemnity Claim relates to any claim by a third party (a "Third Party
Claim"), the  Indemnified Party shall state in the notice to the Indemnifying
Party the  nature and basis of the Third Party Claim and the amount thereof,
to the  extent known or estimable. The Indemnifying Party shall be  entitled
at its own expense to assume the defense of the Third Party  Claim, using
legal advisers reasonably approved by the Indemnified  Party. The Indemnified
Party shall provide the Indemnifying  Party and its advisers with such
information and assistance as the  Indemnifying Party shall reasonably
request at the cost of the  Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnifying Party
does not promptly  assume the defense of such Third Party Claim following
notice thereof, the  Indemnified Party shall be entitled to assume and
control such  defense. The Indemnifying Party shall not, without the prior 
written consent of the Indemnified Party (which shall not be unreasonably 
withheld), consent to a settlement, compromise or discharge of, or the  entry
of any judgment arising from, any Third Party Claim, unless such  settlement,
compromise or discharge does not involve any finding or  admission of any
violation of Law or admission of any wrongdoing by the  Indemnified Party and
the Indemnifying Party shall (i) pay or cause  to be paid all amounts arising
out of such settlement or judgment  concurrently with the effectiveness of
such settlement, (ii) not  encumber any of the assets of any Indemnified
Party or agree to any  restriction or condition that would apply to or
adversely affect any  Indemnified Party and (iii) obtain, as  a condition of
any settlement or other resolution, a complete and  unconditional release of
each Indemnified Party from any and all liability  in respect of such Third
Party Claim.

    
---|---|--- 
 

 



 

      

 

    |  

(c)

    |  

The  obligation of an Indemnifying Party shall not extend to any liability 
arising from the settlement or compromise of any action or claims brought 
against the Indemnified Party, or the admission by the Indemnified Party  of
any claim or the taking by the Indemnified Party of any action (unless 
required by Law or applicable process), which might reasonably be expected 
to prejudice the successful defense of the action or claim without, in any 
such case, the prior written consent of the Indemnifying  Party.

    
---|---|--- 
 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

23  

 

 

 

 

 


 

6.4 Obligation to Mitigate.

 



 

Each of the Parties agrees that each Indemnified Party shall take all
commercially reasonable steps to mitigate any Losses upon and after becoming
aware of any event or condition that would reasonably be expected to give
rise to any indemnification rights hereunder in order for any other
Indemnifying Party to have a corresponding obligation to indemnify for such
Losses pursuant to Clause 6.1 or 6.2.

 



 

6.5 Time Limits.

 



 

      

 

    |  

(a)

    |  

The  Studio 1+1 and Kino Group Warranties (other than the Fundamental
Studio  1+1 and Kino Group Warranties) shall survive the Closing until the
second  anniversary of the Closing Date. The Studio 1+1 and Kino Group  Tax
Warranties shall survive until sixty (60) days following the  expiration of
the relevant statute of  limitations.

    
---|---|--- 
 

 



 

      

 

    |  

(b)

    |  

Any  Indemnity Claim notified under this Clause 6 is principal and
continuing  and accordingly shall remain in full force and effect regardless
of the  legality, validity or enforceability of any other provisions of
this  Agreement and notwithstanding the winding-up, liquidation or
dissolution  of any Party or any of its Affiliates or other incapacity or
limitation of  any Party or any of its Affiliates or any change in the
status, control or  ownership thereof.

    
---|---|--- 
 

 



 

6.6 Financial Limits.

 



 

      

 

    |  

(a)

    |  

Except  in the case of fraud or any Termination Amount payable under Clause
5.2,  the maximum aggregate liability of the Seller Parties, on the one
hand,  and the Buyer Parties, on the other hand, for any and all Indemnity
Claims  or other claims arising in respect of this Agreement and made prior
to  Closing shall not exceed US$500,000. For the avoidance of  doubt, this
limitation shall be inapplicable for all such claims if the  Closing occurs.

for such Indemnity Claim in Clause 6.6(b)(i) and 6.6(c)(i), and  all
Indemnity Claims also exceed in aggregate US$4,000,000, in which case  the
Party shall be liable for the whole amount of all such Indemnity  Claims and
not only for the excess,

    
---|---|--- 
 

 



 

provided that the foregoing limitations shall not apply (1) in respect of
any Indemnity Claim related to any Fundamental Warranty or (2) in respect of
any Indemnity Claim made prior to Closing.

    |  

(i)

    |  

exceeds  US$100,000; and

24

(ii)

    |  

when  taken with every other Indemnity Claim in respect of any Fundamental 
Warranty for which the liability of the relevant Party or its Affiliates 
individually exceeds US$100,000, also exceeds in aggregate US$2,000,000,  in
which case the Party shall be liable for the whole amount of all such 
Indemnity Claims and not only for the excess,

    
---|---|--- 
 

 



 

provided that any amount(s) payable in respect of any Indemnity Claim made
pursuant to this Clause 6.6(c) shall be included in the aggregate total for
the purposes of Clause 6.6(b)(ii), and provided further that none of the
foregoing limitations shall apply in respect of any Indemnity Claim made
prior to Closing.

 



 

      

 

    |  

(d)

    |  

For  the purpose of Clauses 6.6(b) and 6.6(c) above two or more Indemnity 
Claims arising from the same set of facts, matters or circumstances or a 
series of related facts, matters or circumstances shall be treated as a 
single Indemnity Claim.

    
---|---|--- 
 

 



 

      

 

    |

    |  

Except  for Indemnity Claims in respect of Fundamental Warranties and except

referred to in the relevant Warranty which is the subject of an Indemnity 
Claim shall be ignored.

    
---|---|--- 
 

 



 

 

7. CONTROLLING PARTIES; GUARANTEE

 

 



 

7.1 Controlling Parties.

 



 

The Parties hereby acknowledge and agree that Kolomoisky shall cause each of
Buyer and any of Kolomoisky\'s Affiliates, as applicable, to perform under
this Agreement and any other Transaction Documents, and Seller shall or shall
cause the Company and any of Seller\'s Affiliates, as applicable, to perform
under this Agreement and any other Transaction Documents.

 



 

7.2 Guarantee.

 



 

      

 

    |  

(a)

    |  

Kolomoisky  hereby absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably undertakes to
Seller as  follows:

    
---|---|--- 
 

 



 

      

 

    |  

(i)

    |  

on  the Pre-Closing Payment Date and on the Closing Date, as applicable,
Buyer  will have sufficient funds to pay the Pre-Closing Payment and the
Closing  Date Payment, as applicable;

    
---|---|--- 
 

 



 

      

 

    |  

(ii)

    |  

Buyer  will pay the Adjusted Aggregate Consideration in accordance with
Clause  2.4(a)

    
---|---|--- 
 

 



 

(Clauses 7.2(a)(i) and 7.2(a)(ii), collectively, the "Obligations")


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

25  

 

 

 

 

 


 

provided that in no event shall Kolomoisky's liability under this Clause
7.2(a) exceed US$30,000,000 (the "Cap"). In furtherance of the foregoing,
Kolomoisky acknowledges that his liability hereunder shall extend to the full
amount of the Obligations, and that Seller may, in its sole discretion, bring
and prosecute a separate action or actions against Kolomoisky for the full
amount of any Obligations, subject in each case to the Cap, regardless of
whether action is brought against Buyer or any other Person liable with
respect to the Obligations or whether Buyer or any other such Person is
joined in any such action or actions. Seller shall not be obligated to seek
any payment of the Obligations from Buyer or file any claim relating to any
Obligation in the event that Buyer becomes subject to a bankruptcy,
reorganization or similar proceeding, and the failure of Seller to seek such
payment or to file shall not affect Kolomoisky\'s obligations hereunder. If
any discharge, release or arrangement (whether in respect of the obligations
of Buyer or any other person or any security for those obligations or
otherwise) is made by the Seller in whole or in part on the faith of any
payment, security or other disposition which is avoided or must be restored
in insolvency, liquidation, administration, bankruptcy or otherwise, without
limitation, then the liability of Kolomoisky under this Clause 7.2(a) will
continue or be reinstated as if the discharge, release or arrangement had not
occurred. This is an unconditional guarantee of payment and not of
collectibility. Kolomoisky agrees that the obligations of Kolomoisky
hereunder shall not be released or discharged, in whole or in part, or
otherwise affected by (i) the failure of Seller to assert any claim or demand
or to enforce any right or remedy against Buyer or any other Person liable
with respect to any Obligation or interested in the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement; (ii) any change in the time, place or manner of payment of
any Obligation or any rescission, waiver, compromise, consolidation or other
amendment or modification of any of the terms or provisions of this Clause
7.2(a) or any other agreement evidencing, securing or otherwise executed in
connection with any Obligation; (iii) the addition, substitution or release
of any Person for the Obligation; (iv) any change in the corporate existence,
structure or ownership of Buyer or any other Person liable with respect to
any Obligation; (v) any insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization or other
similar proceeding affecting Buyer or any other Person liable with respect to
any Obligation; (vi) any lack of validity or enforceability of this Agreement
or any agreement or instrument relating thereto; (vii) the existence of any
claim, set-off or other right that the Kolomoisky may have at any
time against Buyer or Seller or any of its Affiliates, whether in connection
with any Obligation or otherwise; (viii) the adequacy of any other means
Seller may have of obtaining payment of any Obligation; (ix) any other act
or omission that might in any manner or to any extent vary the risk of
Kolomoisky or otherwise operate as a release or discharge of Kolmoisky; or
(x) any other event or circumstance, whether similar or dissimilar to the
foregoing (other than final payment in full of an Obligation). To the fullest
extent permitted by law, Kolomoisky hereby expressly waives any and all
rights or defenses arising by reason of any law which would otherwise require
any election of remedies by Seller. Kolomoisky acknowledges that he will
receive substantial direct and indirect benefits from the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and that the waivers set forth in this Clause
7.2(a) are knowingly made in contemplation of such benefits. Kolomoisky
hereby unconditionally and irrevocably agrees not to exercise any rights that
it may now have or hereafter acquire against Buyer or any other Person liable
with respect to any Obligations that arise from the existence, payment,
performance or enforcement of Kolomoisky's obligation under or in respect of
this Clause 7.2(a) or any other agreement in connection therewith, including
without limitation, any right of subrogation, reimbursement, exoneration,
contribution or indemnification and any right to participate in any claim or
remedy of Seller against Buyer or such other Person, whether or not such
claim, remedy or right arises in equity or under contract, statute or common
law, including without limitation, the right to take or receive from Buyer or
such other Person, directly or indirectly, in cash or other property or by
set-off or in any other manner, payment or security on account of such claim,
remedy or right, unless all amounts payable under this Clause 7.2(a) shall
have been paid in full in cash (or the Obligations have been discharged). If
any amount shall be paid to Kolomoisky in violation of the immediately
preceding sentence at any time prior to the payment in full in cash of all
amounts payable under this Clause 7.2(a), such amount shall be received and
held in trust for the benefit of Seller, shall be segregated from other
property and funds of Kolomoisky and shall forthwith be paid or delivered to
Seller in the same form as so received (with any necessary endorsement or
assignment) to be credited and applied to the amounts payable under this
Clause 7.2(a), in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, whether
matured or unmatured, or to be held as collateral for amounts payable under
this Clause 7.2(a) thereafter arising. Neither Kolomoisky nor Seller may
assign its rights, interests or obligations under this Clause 7.2(a) to any
other person (except by operation of law) without the prior written consent
of Seller (in the case of an assignment by Kolomoisky) or Kolomoisky (in the
case of an assignment by Seller); provided that Seller may assign its rights,
interests or obligations under this Clause 7.2(a) to any Affiliate of Seller.


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

26  

 

 

 

 

 


 

      

 

    |  

(b)

    |  

For  the avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding any other provision of this 
Agreement, the maximum aggregate liability of Kolomoisky for any and all 
liabilities, costs, obligations, damages and expenses arising under or in 
respect of this Agreement and any other Transaction Document shall not 
exceed US$30,000,000.

    |  

REPRESENTATIONS  AND WARRANTIES RELATING TO BUYER OR THE SHARES

    
---|--- 
 

 



 

1.1 As of the date of this Agreement and as of the Closing Date, 100% of the
share capital of Buyer is Beneficially Owned by Kolomoisky, and Buyer is
under the exclusive Control of Kolomoisky. As of the date of this Agreement
and the Closing Date, Kolomoisky holds beneficial title to all shares in the
capital of Buyer, free and clear of any Liens, other than Liens arising under
applicable Law.

 



 

1.2 On the Pre-Closing Payment Date and on the Closing Date, as applicable,
Buyer will have sufficient funds to pay the Pre-Closing Payment and the
Closing Date Payment, as applicable, and to effect all other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Transaction Documents. The Buyer
Parties have no knowledge of any facts or circumstances that are reasonably
likely to result in the funding contemplated in Clause 7.2 not being made
available to Buyer on a timely basis in order to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

1.3 Buyer has reviewed all material information in relation to its investment
under this Agreement, and it understands the risks of, and other
considerations relating to, the acquisition of the Shares and the Existing
Inter-Company Debt.

 



 

1.4 It is: (i) able, by reason of business and financial experience, to
protect its own interests in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement; (ii) able to afford the entire loss of its investment in the
Shares and the Existing Inter-Company Debt; (iii) an "accredited investor"
as that term is defined in Rule 501(a) of Regulation D under the Securities
Act; (iv) not a broker-dealer or an affiliate of a broker-dealer registered
pursuant to Section 15 of the Exchange Act and (v) acquiring the Shares and
the Existing Inter-Company Debt for its own account or for the account of
another institutional accredited investor with respect to which it exercises
sole investment discretion.

 



 

1.5 Buyer is acquiring the Shares and the Existing Inter-Company Debt for
investment purposes only and is not acquiring any Shares or the Existing
Inter-Company Debt with a view to or for sale in connection with any
distribution of all or any part of such Shares or the Existing Inter-Company
Debt, and it will not, directly or indirectly, Transfer all or any part of
its Shares or the Existing Inter-Company Debt (or solicit any offers to buy,
purchase or otherwise acquire or take a pledge of all or any part of such
Shares or the Existing Inter-Company Debt) except in accordance with (and to
the extent applicable) (i) the registration provisions of the Securities Act
or an exemption from such registration provisions, (ii) any applicable state
or non-U.S. securities Laws, (iii) the terms of this Agreement, (iv) any
other applicable securities or financial services Laws and regulations of
any jurisdiction and (v) the FSMA and subordinated legislation, rules and
guidance promulgated or issued thereunder and any other applicable Laws and
regulations of the United Kingdom (all the foregoing being collectively
referred to as "Applicable Laws").

 



 

1.6 Buyer understands that it must bear the economic risk of its investment
in the Shares and the Existing Inter-Company Debt for an indefinite period of
time because, among other reasons, the offering and sale of the Shares and
the Existing Inter-Company Debt have not been registered under the Securities
Act, and the Company has not been registered with or approved by any
regulatory authority and, therefore, the Shares and the Existing Inter-
Company Debt cannot be sold other than through a privately negotiated
transaction unless they are subsequently registered under the Securities Act
or an exemption from such registration is available or the Issuer is
subsequently registered with or approved by a regulatory authority such that
the Shares and the Existing Inter-Company Debt may be sold other than
pursuant to an applicable private placement exemption. It further understands
that Transfers of the Shares and the Existing Inter-Company Debt may be
restricted by applicable state and non-U.S. securities Laws, and that no
market exists or is expected to develop for the Shares and the Existing
Inter-Company Debt.


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

35  

 

 

 

 

 


 

1.7 None of the cash or property that Buyer has paid or contributed, or will
pay or will contribute prior to the Closing Date, to the Company has been, or
shall be, derived from, or related to, any activity that is deemed criminal
under U.K. Law, U.S. Law, Bermuda Law, Cypriot Law or the Law of the
jurisdiction in which such activity takes place. No contribution or payment
by it to the Company to the extent that such contribution or payment is
within its control, shall cause the Company to be in violation of any of the
Anti-Money Laundering Laws (as defined below) or the anti-money laundering
Laws, rules or regulations of any other applicable jurisdiction.

 



 

1.8 Buyer also acknowledges that (i) Seller and its Affiliates, including
the Company, may be required to comply with all applicable anti-money
laundering Laws, including the U.K. Proceeds of Crime Act 2003, Terrorism Act
2000 and Money Laundering Regulations 2003 and (ii) Seller may be required to
comply with the anti-money laundering rules of the SEC, the NASDAQ and/or the
Prague Stock Exchange (the legislation and rules referred to in (i) and (ii)
being collectively referred to as the "Anti-Money Laundering Laws"). In
addition, neither it nor any Person under its Control is a Person identified
as a terrorist organization on any relevant lists maintained by a
Governmental Authority.
