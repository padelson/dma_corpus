liabilities of Parent and Purchaser arising under, or in connection with,
this Agreement and the Transactions;

WHEREAS, Parent has required, as a condition to its willingness to enter into
this Agreement, that certain stockholders and their Affiliates, collectively
(the " _Specified Stockholders_ ") enter into Tender and Support Agreements,
dated as of the date hereof (each, a " _Support Agreement_ "), simultaneously
herewith, pursuant to which, among other things, the Specified Stockholders
have agreed to tender their shares of Company Common Stock and take certain
other actions in furtherance of the Transactions, in each case on the terms
and subject to the conditions provided for in the Support Agreement; and

WHEREAS, the Company, Parent and Purchaser desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the
Offer and the Merger and also to prescribe various conditions to the Offer and
the Merger.

Surviving Corporation.

Section __ 2.07. _Treatment of Company Equity Awards_.

(a) _Company Options_. Unless otherwise agreed to by the Parties, at the
Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger, each Company Option that is
unexpired, unexercised, and outstanding as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be treated as follows:

 



8

    

(i) _Vested Company Options_. Each Company Option that is vested as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time (after giving effect to any
acceleration of vesting that occurs at or prior to the Effective Time, or
otherwise in connection with, or as a result of, the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby) (each, a " _Vested Company Option_ ") shall
be canceled and automatically converted into the right to receive an amount in
cash, without interest, equal to the product of (i) the excess, if any, of (A)
the Merger Consideration over (B) the applicable per share exercise price of
such Vested Company Option _multiplied by_ (ii) the total number of Shares
subject to such Vested Company Option (the " _Vested Option Consideration_ ").
The Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, pay the Vested Option Consideration to each holder of a Vested
Company Option, without interest and less any Taxes withheld pursuant to 
_Section_ __ _ 2.08(f)_, if such holder is a current or former employee of
the Company or any Company Subsidiary, on the first regularly scheduled
payroll date of the Surviving Corporation that is at least three (3)
Business Days after the Effective Time, and if such holder is not, and was
not, at any time, an employee of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, then
Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to make such payment within five (5)
Business Days following the Effective Time.

(ii) _Unvested Company Options_. Each Company Option that is not a Vested
Company Option (each, an " _Unvested Company Option_ ") shall be canceled and
automatically converted into the right to receive an amount (subject to any
Taxes withheld pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.08(f)_ _)_ in cash,
without interest, equal to the product of (i) the excess, if any, of (A) the
Merger Consideration over (B) the applicable per share exercise price of such
Unvested Company Option _multiplied by_ (ii) the total number of
Shares subject to such Unvested Company Option (the " _Unvested Option
Consideration_ "); _provided_ , that, except as is set forth on _Section_ __ _
2.07(a)(ii)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, such per share Unvested Option
Consideration shall not be paid at the Effective Time but shall instead be
subject to the satisfaction of the original vesting conditions applicable to
the underlying Unvested Company Option in accordance with its terms.
Upon satisfaction of such vesting conditions underlying any Unvested Option
Consideration, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay the per
share Unvested Option Consideration, without interest and less any Taxes
withheld pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 2.08(f)_, to such holders who have
satisfied the applicable vesting conditions as of the applicable vesting date,
without interest, on the first regularly scheduled payroll date of the
Surviving Corporation that is on or next following the first day of the
fiscal quarter immediately following the applicable vesting date of each
Unvested Company Option for which such Unvested Option Consideration was
exchanged. Except as is set forth in this  _Section_ __ _ 2.07(a)(ii)_ and
on _Section_ __ _ 2.07(a)(ii)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, all Unvested
Option Consideration will have the same terms (including, with respect to
vesting and forfeiture) and conditions as applied to the Unvested Company
Options for which they were exchanged, except for terms rendered inoperative
by reason of the Transactions.

 

(iii) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if the per-share
exercise price of any Company Option (whether vested or unvested) is equal to
or greater than the Merger Consideration, at the Effective Time each such
Company Option shall be canceled by virtue of the Merger without any action on
the part of the holder thereof and without any cash payment or other
consideration being made in respect thereof and shall have no further force or
effect.

 



9

    

(b) _Company RSUs_. Unless otherwise agreed to by the Parties, at the
Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger, each Company RSU that is unexpired
and outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be treated
as follows:

 

(i) _Vested Company RSUs_ _._ Each such Company RSU that is vested as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time (after giving effect to any
acceleration of vesting that occurs at or prior to the Effective Time, or
otherwise in connection with, or as a result of, the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby) (" _Vested Company RSU_ ") shall
be canceled and automatically converted into the right to receive an amount
in cash, without interest, equal to the product of (i) the Merger
Consideration, _multiplied by_ (ii) the total number of Shares subject to the
Vested Company RSU (the " _Vested RSU Consideration_ "). The Surviving
Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, pay
the Vested RSU Consideration to each holder of a Vested Company RSU, without
interest and less any Taxes withheld pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.08(f)_, if
such holder is a current or former employee of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary, on the first payroll date of the Surviving Corporation that is at
least three (3) Business days after the Effective Time, and if such holder is
not, and was not, at any time, an employee of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary, then Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to make such payment
within five (5) Business Days following the Effective Time; provided that,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this _Section_ __ _
2.07(b)(i)_, if required to comply with Section 409A of the Code, such amount
shall be paid on the settlement date for such Vested Company RSU specified
under the terms of the applicable award agreement.

(ii) _Unvested Company RSUs_. Each such Company RSU that is not a Vested
Company RSU (" _Unvested Company RSU_ ") shall be canceled and automatically
converted into the right to receive an amount (subject to any Taxes withheld
pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 2.08(f)_) in cash, without interest, equal to
the product of (i) the Merger Consideration _multiplied by_ (ii) the total
number of Shares subject to the Unvested Company RSU (the " _Unvested RSU
Consideration_ "); provided, that except as is set forth on _Section_ __ _
2.07(b)(ii)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, such per share Unvested RSU
Consideration shall not be paid at the Effective Time but shall instead be
subject to satisfaction of the original vesting conditions applicable to the
underlying Unvested Company RSU in accordance with its terms. Upon
satisfaction of such vesting conditions underlying any Unvested RSU
Consideration, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay the per
share Unvested RSU Consideration, without interest and less any Taxes withheld
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.08(f)_, to such holders who have satisfied the
applicable vesting conditions as of the applicable vesting date on the first
regularly scheduled payroll date of the Surviving Corporation that is on or
next following the first day of the fiscal quarter immediately following the
applicable vesting date of each such Unvested Company RSU for which such
Unvested RSU Consideration was exchanged; provided that, notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this _Section_ __ _ 2.07(b)(ii)_, if
required to comply with Section 409A of the Code, such amount shall be paid
on the settlement date for the Unvested Company RSU for which the Unvested
Company Consideration was exchanged, as specified under the terms of the
applicable award agreement. Except as is set forth in this  _Section_ __ _
2.07(b)(ii)_ and _Section_ __ _ 2.07(b)(ii)_ of the Company Disclosure
Letter, all Unvested RSU Consideration will have the same terms (including,
with respect to vesting and forfeiture) and conditions as applied to the
Unvested Company RSUs for which they were exchanged, except for terms rendered
inoperative by reason of the Transactions.

 



10

    

(c) _Treatment of_ _Company PSUs_. At the Effective Time, the level at which
the performance goals have been satisfied with respect to each unvested
Company PSU that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be determined by the Board of Directors or any appropriate committee thereof
in accordance with its terms, which number shall be determined based on the
Companys achievement of the applicable performance goals as of the Closing
Date; _provided_ , that the total number of Company PSUs that may be deemed
vested in accordance with the foregoing shall not exceed 50,000 (determined
in accordance with the applicable Company PSU award agreement on a pro-rated
basis, the " _Company PSU Achieved Number_ "). Unless otherwise mutually
agreed by the Parties or the Parent and the applicable Company PSU holders, at
the Effective Time, each Company PSU that is outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be canceled, and the holder thereof shall then
become entitled to receive, in full satisfaction of the rights of such holder
with respect thereto, an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the
product of (i) the Merger Consideration, multiplied by (ii) (A) with respect
to each unvested Company PSU that is deemed vested in accordance with the
first sentence of this _Section_ __ _ 2.07(c)_, the Company PSU Achieved
Number underlying such Company PSU, and (B) with respect to each vested
Company PSU that has not been settled as of the Effective Time, the total
number of Shares underlying the vested Company PSU (the " _Company PSU
Consideration_ "). The Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, pay the Company PSU Consideration to each holder of
a Company PSU, without interest and less any Taxes withheld pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 2.08(f)_, on the first payroll date of the Surviving
Corporation that is at least three (3) Business Days after the Effective
Time; provided that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
_Section_ __ _ 2.07(a)(i)_, if required to comply with Section 409A of the
Code, such amount shall be paid on the settlement date for such Company PSU
specified under the terms of the applicable award agreement.

(d) _Corporate Actions_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Board of Directors
or any appropriate committee thereof shall adopt resolutions providing for,
and shall take all other actions that are necessary to effect, the treatment
of the Company Equity Awards as contemplated by this  _Section_ __ _ 2.07_.

(e) _Funding_. At the Effective Time, Parent shall make a cash contribution to
the Surviving Corporation in immediately available funds to permit the
Surviving Corporation to make the cash payments required under _Section_ __ _
2.07_ to the extent, if any, the Surviving Corporation does not otherwise have
sufficient funds to make such payments.

Section __ 2.08. _Surrender of Stock Certificates; Stock Transfer Books_.

 

(a) Prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, Parent shall designate the Companys
current transfer agent or select a bank or trust company mutually agreeable
to Parent and the Company to act as agent (the " _Depository Agent_ ") for the
holders of Shares to receive the aggregate Offer Price to which holders of
such Shares shall become entitled pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 1.02_ and to
act as agent (the " _Paying Agent_ ") for the holders of Shares to receive the
aggregate Merger Consideration to which holders of such Shares shall become
entitled pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 2.06_. Promptly after (and in any event
no later than the third Business Day after) the Offer Acceptance Time, Parent
shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with the Depository Agent cash
sufficient to make the payment of the aggregate Offer Price payable pursuant
to _Section_ __ _ 1.07(c)_.

 



11

    

(b) On or prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to
be deposited, with the Paying Agent cash sufficient to pay the aggregate
Merger Consideration payable pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.06_ (together with
the amount deposited pursuant the immediately preceding sentence, the "
_Payment Fund_ "). The Payment Fund shall not be used for any purpose other
than to pay the aggregate Offer Price in the Offer and the Merger. The Payment
Fund shall be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by the Surviving
Corporation;  _provided_ that such investments shall be (i) in obligations of
or guaranteed by the United States of America, (ii) in commercial paper
obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or
Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively, (iii) in certificates of deposit,
bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial banks with
capital exceeding $1 billion, or (iv) in money market funds having a rating in
the highest investment category granted by a recognized credit rating agency
at the time of acquisition or a combination of the foregoing and, in any such
case, no such instrument shall have a maturity exceeding three (3) months.

(c) Promptly after the Effective Time (but in no event later than five (5)
Business Days thereafter), the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be
delivered to each Person who was, at the Effective Time, a holder of record of
(i) Shares represented by Stock Certificates or (ii) Book-Entry Shares, who,
in each case was entitled to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 2.06_, (A) a form of letter of transmittal, which shall be in
reasonable and customary form and shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Stock Certificates shall pass,
only upon proper delivery of the Stock Certificates (or affidavits of loss in
lieu thereof in accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 2.08(g)_, if applicable) to
the Paying Agent, or a customary agents message in respect to Book-Entry
Shares, and (B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Stock
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration
issuable and payable in respect of such Shares pursuant to _Section_ __ _
2.06_. Upon surrender to the Paying Agent of Stock Certificates (or affidavits
of loss in lieu thereof in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.08(g)_, if
applicable) or Book-Entry Shares, together with such letter of transmittal in
the case of Stock Certificates, duly completed and validly executed in
accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be
required pursuant to the instructions or as may be reasonably required by
Parent or the Paying Agent, the holder of such Stock Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger
Consideration for each Share formerly evidenced by such Stock Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares, and such Stock Certificates and Book-Entry Shares shall
then be cancelled. No interest shall accrue or be paid on the
Merger Consideration payable upon the surrender of any Stock Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares for the benefit of the holder thereof. If the payment of any
Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose
name the surrendered Stock Certificates formerly evidencing the Shares is
registered on the stock transfer books of the Company, it shall be a condition
of payment that the Stock Certificate so surrendered shall be endorsed
properly or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the Person
requesting such payment shall have paid all transfer and other similar Taxes
required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person
other than the registered holder of the Stock Certificate surrendered, or
shall have established to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that
such Taxes either have been paid or are not applicable. None of Parent,
Purchaser and the Surviving Corporation shall have any liability for the
transfer and other similar Taxes described in this _Section_ __ _ 2.08(c)_
under any circumstance. Payment of the applicable Merger Consideration with
respect to Book-Entry Shares shall only be made to the Person in whose name
such Book-Entry Shares are registered. Until surrendered as contemplated by
this _Section_ __ _ 2.08_, each Stock Certificate and Book-Entry Share shall
be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right
to receive the applicable Merger Consideration as contemplated by _Section_
__ _ 2.06_.

 



12

    

(d) At any time following twelve (12) months after the Effective Time, Parent
shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to Parent any funds
(with respect to the aggregate Offer Price to which holders of Shares shall
become entitled pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.06_) which had been made
available to the Paying Agent and not disbursed to holders of Stock
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares (including all interest and other income
received by the Paying Agent in respect of all funds made available to it)
and, thereafter, such holders shall be entitled to look to the Surviving
Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat and other similar Legal
Requirements) only as general creditors thereof with respect to payment of the
Merger Consideration that may be payable upon due surrender of the Stock
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares held by them, without any interest thereon.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, Purchaser, the Surviving
Corporation the Paying Agent or any of their respective Affiliates shall be
liable to any holder of Stock Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for the
Merger Consideration delivered in respect of such share to a public official
pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or other similar Legal
Requirements. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by such holders at such time at
which such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any
Governmental Body shall become, to the extent permitted by applicable Legal
Requirements, the property of the Surviving Corporation or its designee, free
and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

(e) At the close of business on the day of the Effective Time, the stock
transfer books of the Company with respect to the Shares shall be closed and
thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of Shares on
the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of
the Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to
have any rights with respect to such Shares except as otherwise expressly
provided herein or by applicable Legal Requirements. If, after the Effective
Time, Stock Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving
Corporation for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided
in _Section_ __ _ 2.08(c)_.

 

(f) Each of the Company, the Surviving Corporation, Parent and Purchaser, and
their Affiliates, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold (or cause the
Paying Agent or the Depository Agent to deduct and withhold) from the Offer
Price, the Merger Consideration payable to any holder of the Shares or any
holder of Company Equity Awards, or any other consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as it is required by any Legal
Requirement to deduct and withhold with respect to Taxes. Each such payor
shall take all action that may be necessary to ensure that any such amounts so
withheld are promptly and properly remitted to the appropriate Governmental
Body. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and properly remitted to the
appropriate Governmental Body, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Shares,
holder of Company Equity Awards or other recipient of consideration hereunder
in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

 



13

    

(g) If any Stock Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact reasonably satisfactory to Parent by
the holder of the Shares formerly represented by that Stock Certificate, or by
a representative of that holder, claiming that Stock Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the
posting by that holder of a bond, in such reasonable amount as Parent may
direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with
respect to such Stock Certificate, the Paying Agent will pay (less any
amounts entitled to be deducted or withheld pursuant to _Section_ __ _
2.08(f)_), in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Stock Certificate,
the applicable Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the
Shares formerly represented by such Stock Certificate, as contemplated by
this _Article II_.

Section __ 2.09.  _Dissenters_ __ _Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, Shares issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than Excluded Shares) and held by a holder
who has properly exercised appraisal rights of such shares in accordance with
Section 262 of the DGCL (such shares being referred to collectively as the "
_Dissenting Shares_ " until such time as such holder fails to perfect,
withdraws or otherwise loses such holders appraisal rights under the DGCL
with respect to such shares) shall not be converted into a right to receive
the Merger Consideration but instead shall be cancelled and converted into a
right to receive payment of the appraised value of such shares in accordance
with Section 262 of the DGCL; _provided_ that if, after the Effective Time,
such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or loses such holders right to
appraisal, pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL or if a court of competent
jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not entitled to the relief
provided by Section 262 of the DGCL, such Shares shall be treated as if they
had been converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.06(a)_, without
interest thereon, upon surrender of Stock Certificates (or affidavits of loss
in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement. The Company shall provide Parent prompt written
notice of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of any Shares, any
withdrawal of any such demand and any other demand, notice or instrument
delivered to the Company prior to the Effective Time pursuant to the DGCL.
Parent shall have the opportunity and right, at its sole cost and expense, to
direct all negotiations and Proceedings with respect to such demands, so long
as Parent does not create obligations for the Company prior to the Effective
Time. Except with the prior written consent of Parent, the Company shall not
make any payment with respect to, or offer to settle or settle, any
such demands.

Section __ 2.10. _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. In the event that the
number of Shares or securities convertible or exchangeable into or
exercisable for Shares issued and outstanding after the date hereof and prior
to the Effective Time shall have been changed into a different number of
Shares or securities or a different class as a result of a reclassification,
stock split (including a reverse stock split), stock dividend or distribution,
recapitalization, merger, issuer tender or exchange offer, or other similar
transaction, the Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted,
without duplication, to provide the holders thereof the same economic effect
contemplated by this Agreement prior to such change; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 2.10_ shall be construed to permit
the Company or any Company Subsidiary or any other Person to take any action
that is otherwise prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

 

Section __ 2.11. _Further Action_. The Parties agree to take all necessary
action to cause the Merger to become effective in accordance with _Article
II_ as soon as practicable following the consummation of the Offer without a
meeting of the Companys stockholders, as provided in Section 251(h) of the
DGCL. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further action is
reasonably

 



14

    

 determined by Parent to be necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes
of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title
and possession of and to all rights and property of Purchaser and the
Company, the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation and Parent
shall be fully authorized (in the name of Purchaser, in the name of the
Company and otherwise) to take such action.

concept is recognized by such jurisdiction) where the nature of its business
requires such qualification or licensing, except where the failure to have
such power or authority or to be so qualified and in good standing,

assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by Parent and Purchaser,
this Agreement constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of the
Company and is enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms,

Liabilities_.

(a) The Company has timely filed or furnished, as applicable, all SEC Reports
required to be filed or furnished by it with the SEC since January 1, 2016
(such SEC Reports, the " _Company SEC Reports_ "). As of their respective
dates of filing, or, if amended or superseded by a subsequent filing made
prior to the date of this Agreement, as of the date of the last such amendment
or superseding filing prior to the date of this Agreement, the Company SEC
Reports complied in all material respects with the applicable requirements of
the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as the case
may be, and the applicable rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, each
as in effect on the date of any such filing. As of the time of filing with
the SEC (or, if amended prior to the date of this Agreement, as of the date
of such amendment), none of the Company SEC Reports so filed contained any
untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading, except to the extent that the information in any such Company SEC
Report has been amended or superseded (prior to the date of this Agreement)
by a later Company SEC Report.

(b) As of their respective dates, the audited and unaudited consolidated
financial statements of the Company (including any related notes thereto)
included in the Company SEC Reports have been prepared (except, as applicable,
as permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC or other applicable rules
and regulations of the SEC) in accordance with United States generally
accepted accounting principles (" _GAAP_ ") applied on a consistent basis
during the periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto
or, with respect to any unaudited interim financial statements, as permitted
by the SECs rules and forms) and fairly present in all material respects the
consolidated financial position of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries as
of the respective dates thereof (taking into account the notes thereto) and
the consolidated results of their operations and cash flows for the periods
indicated (taking into account the notes thereto) and subject, in the case of
unaudited financial statements, to normal year-end adjustments that are not,
individually or in the aggregate, material. Except as have been described in
the SEC Reports, there are no unconsolidated subsidiaries of the Company or
any off-balance sheet arrangements of the type required to be disclosed
pursuant to Item 303(a)(4) of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC.

 

(c) The Company maintains a system of internal control over financial
reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange
Act) which is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP, and includes those
policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that
in reasonable detail

 



19

    

 accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the
assets of the Company, (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
conformity with GAAP and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in
accordance with authorizations of management and the Board of Directors, and

of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the assets of the Company
that could have a material effect on the financial statements. The Companys
management has completed an assessment of the effectiveness of the Companys
system of internal control over financial reporting in compliance with the
requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the fiscal year
ended December 31, 2018, and, except as set forth in the Company SEC Reports
filed prior to the date of this Agreement, that assessment concluded that
those controls were effective. Since December 31, 2016, neither the Company
nor, to the Knowledge of the Company, the Companys independent
registered accountant has identified or been made aware of: (1) any
significant deficiency or material weakness in the design or operation of the
internal control over financial reporting utilized by the Company, which is
reasonably likely to adversely affect the Companys ability to record,
process, summarize and report financial information or (2) any illegal act or
fraud, whether or not material, that involves the management or other
employees of the Company who have a significant role in the Companys
internal control over financial reporting. Since January 1, 2016, no executive
officer, employee with responsibility for bookkeeping or accounting functions,
or auditor or accountant of the Company has received notice of any material
complaint, allegation, assertion or claim, whether written or oral, regarding
the accounting or auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or methods of
the Company or its internal accounting controls, including any
material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim relating to an individual
with responsibility for those matters or that the Company has engaged in
improper accounting and auditing practices.

 

(d) The Company has established and maintains disclosure controls and
procedures as defined in and required by Rule 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the
Exchange Act that are reasonably designed to ensure that all information
required to be disclosed in the Companys reports that it files or submits
under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within
the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and that all such
information is accumulated and communicated to the Companys management
as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to
enable the principal executive officer of the Company and the principal
financial officer of the Company to make the certifications required under the
Exchange Act with respect to such reports. The Company is in compliance in
all material respects with all current listing and corporate governance
requirements of the NYSE and is in compliance in all material respects with
all applicable rules, regulations and requirements of the SEC and with the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

(e) There are no outstanding or unresolved comments in comment letters
received from the SEC with respect to the Company SEC Reports. To the
Knowledge of the Company, none of the Company SEC Reports is the subject of
ongoing SEC review and there are no inquiries or investigations by the SEC or
any internal investigations pending or threatened, in each case regarding any
accounting practices of the Company. The Company has, prior to the date
hereof, provided Parent or its Representatives with accurate and complete
copies of all SEC comment letters received and response letters submitted and
other correspondence with the SEC with respect to the Company SEC Reports,
within the year prior to the date of this Agreement to the extent such comment
letters, response letters and correspondence are not publicly available.

filed, distributed or otherwise disseminated to the Companys stockholders,
as applicable, will comply as to form in all material respects with the

Disclosure Documents or any supplements or amendments thereto are first
distributed or otherwise disseminated to the Companys stockholders, will not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the

Parent or Purchaser specifically for use in the Schedule TO and the Offer
Documents, at the time of the filing of the Schedule TO and at the time of any
distribution or dissemination of the Offer Documents, will not contain any

with respect to statements made or incorporated by reference therein based on
information supplied by or on behalf of Parent or Purchaser for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in the Company Disclosure Documents.

Section __ 4.01. _Due Organization_. Each of Parent and Purchaser is a
corporation or other entity duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization and has all
necessary corporate power and authority: (a) to conduct its business in the
manner in which its business is currently being conducted and (b) to own and
use its assets in the manner in which its assets are currently owned and used,
except where the failure does not have, and would not reasonably be expected
to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 

Section __ 4.02. _Purchaser_. Purchaser was formed solely for the purpose of
engaging in the Transactions and activities incidental thereto and has not
engaged, and prior to the Effective Time will not engage, in any business
activities or conducted any operations other than in connection with the
Transactions and those incident to Purchasers formation. Either Parent or a
wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent owns beneficially and of record all of the
outstanding capital stock of Purchaser, free and clear of all Liens and
transfer restrictions, except for Liens or transfer restrictions of
general applicability as may be provided under the Securities Act or
applicable securities laws.

Section __ 4.03. _Authority; Binding Nature of Agreement_. Parent and
Purchaser have all requisite corporate power and authority, and have taken all
corporate action necessary, to execute and deliver and perform their
obligations under this Agreement, and to consummate the Transactions. Prior
to the date of this Agreement, the board of directors of each of Parent and
Purchaser have approved the execution, delivery and performance by Parent and
Purchaser of this Agreement and the consummation of the
Transactions, including the Offer and the Merger. Assuming due authorization,
execution and delivery by the Company, this Agreement constitutes the legal,
valid and binding obligation of Parent and Purchaser and this Agreement is
enforceable against Parent and Purchaser in accordance with its terms, except
as such enforcement may be subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent

applicable provisions of the DGCL, the HSR Act, and the rules and regulations
of the SEC and the NYSE, the execution and delivery of this Agreement by

cause a violation of, contravene or conflict with any of the provisions of
the certificate of incorporation or bylaws (or other organizational documents)
of Parent or Purchaser, (ii) cause a violation by Parent or Purchaser of any
Legal Requirement or Order applicable to Parent or Purchaser, or to

acceleration or other change of any right or obligation or the loss of any
benefit to which the Parent or Purchaser is entitled under any provision of
any Contract, except, in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii), as would not have

obtain any Consent from any Governmental Body at any time prior to the Closing
in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent or
Purchaser or the consummation by Parent or Purchaser of the Offer, the Merger
or the other Transactions, except those that the failure to make or obtain as
would not have or reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect. No vote of Parents or
Purchasers members or stockholders is necessary to approve this Agreement or
any of the Transactions (except in the case of Parent or Purchaser as has
previously been obtained).

 

Section __ 4.05. _Disclosure_.

 

(a) Each of the Offer Documents and any amendments or supplements thereto,
when filed, distributed or otherwise disseminated to the Companys
stockholders, as applicable, will comply as to form in all material respects

Documents, at the time of the filing of such Offer Document or any supplement
or amendment thereto with the SEC and at the time such Offer Document or any
supplements or amendments thereto are first distributed or otherwise
disseminated to the Companys stockholders, will not contain any untrue

the aggregate amounts payable to holders of Company Equity Awards following
the Effective Time pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.07_ and all amounts required
to pay all related fees and expenses of Parent, Purchaser and their
respective Representatives pursuant to this Agreement. In no event shall the
receipt or availability of any funds or financing (including the Financing) by
or to Parent, Purchaser or any of their Affiliates or any other financing
transaction be a condition to any of the obligations of Purchaser.

(b) Parent has received and accepted, and delivered to the Company a true,
complete and correct copy of (i) the fully executed commitment letter and
redacted fee letters (of which only the fee amounts, price caps and economic
"flex" terms have been redacted; provided that such redacted terms do not
relate to any terms that could adversely affect the conditionality of or the
amount of cash proceeds available to Parent and Purchaser), each dated as of
May 12, 2019 (including all exhibits, schedules, annexes and amendments
thereto, the " _Debt Commitment Letter_ "), from Golub Capital Markets LLC
(collectively with any other agents, arrangers, managers, lenders and other
entities from time to time party thereto and such Persons Affiliates,
successors and assigns, the " _Debt Financing Sources_ ") confirming their
respective commitments to provide Parent with debt financing in connection
with the Transactions (the " _Debt Financing_ ") and (ii) the Equity
Commitment Letters (together with the Debt Commitment Letter, the "
_Financing Commitment Letters_ ") from the Sponsors (the " _Equity Financing
Sources_ " and together with the Debt Financing Sources, the " _Financing
Sources_ ") confirming the respective counterparties commitments to provide
Parent with equity financing in an amount up to the aggregate amount set forth
therein in connection with the Transactions (the " _Equity Financing_ ," and

(c) The Equity Commitment Letters are in full force and effect and are valid
and binding obligations of Parent and Purchaser and the other parties
thereto. The Company is a third-party beneficiary of the Equity Commitment
Letters on the terms set forth therein. The Debt Commitment Letter is in full
force and effect and is a valid and binding obligation of Parent and
Purchaser and, to the Knowledge of Parent, the Debt Financing Sources. Parent
or Purchaser has fully paid, or caused to be paid, any and all commitment or
other fees and amounts required by the Financing Commitment Letters to be
paid prior to the date of this Agreement. As of the date of this Agreement,
(i) none of the Financing Commitment Letters have been amended or modified in
any respect, (ii) to the Knowledge of Parent, the respective commitments
contained therein have not been terminated, withdrawn or rescinded, and, to
the Knowledge of Parent, no such termination, withdrawal or rescission is
contemplated, (iii) assuming the accuracy of the representations and
warranties of the Company contained in this Agreement, as of the date of this
Agreement, no event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time
or both, would or would reasonably be expected to constitute a material
default or material breach or a material failure to satisfy a condition on
the part of Parent or Purchaser or, to the Knowledge of Parent, any other
party thereto under any Financing Commitment Letter, and (iv) as of the date
of this Agreement, assuming the satisfaction or waiver of the Offer
Conditions and the conditions set forth in _Section_ __ _ 7.01_, at Closing,
Parent has no reason to believe that any condition to the funding of the
Financing contemplated by the Financing Commitment Letters that is required
to be satisfied will not be satisfied, or that the Financing will not be made
available to Parent prior to the Offer Acceptance Time. There are no
conditions precedent to the funding of the full amount of the Financing other
than the conditions precedent expressly set forth in the Financing Commitment
Letters. There are no side letters, understandings or other agreements,
arrangements or other Contracts related to the funding or investing, as
applicable, of the full amount of the Financing other than as expressly set
forth in the Financing Commitment Letters furnished to the Company pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 4.07(b)_ or as would not reasonably be expected to impact the

__ _ 9.17_) and the provision of the Guaranty have been duly authorized by
all necessary limited liability company action on the part of the Guarantor,
and no other corporate proceedings on the part of the Guarantor are necessary
to authorize the Guaranty. This Agreement (solely for purposes of _Section_ __
_ 9.17_) has been duly executed and delivered by the Guarantor and
constitutes the valid and binding obligation of the Guarantor, and such 
_Section_ __ _ 9.17_ is enforceable against the Guarantor in accordance with
its terms, except as such enforcement may be subject to bankruptcy,
insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and other similar
laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors rights, and
by general equitable principles.

Section __ 4.09.  _Ownership of Share_ _s_. None of Parent, Purchaser or any
of their Subsidiaries beneficially owns (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the
Exchange Act) any Shares or any securities that are convertible into or
exchangeable or exercisable for Shares, or holds any rights to acquire or vote
any Shares, or any option, warrant, convertible security, stock appreciation
right, swap agreement or other security, right or derivative position, whether
or not currently exercisable, that provides Parent, Purchaser, or any of
their respective Subsidiaries with an exercise or conversion privilege or a
settlement payment or mechanism at a price related to the value of the Shares
or a 

 



41

    

 value determined in whole or part with reference to, or derived in whole or
part from, the value of the Shares, in any case without regard to whether (a)
such derivative conveys any voting rights in such securities to such Person,
(b) such derivative is required to be, or capable of being, settled through
delivery of securities or (c) such Person may have entered into other
transactions that hedge the economic effect of such derivative. None of
Parent, Purchaser or any of their Subsidiaries has beneficially owned during
the three (3) years immediately preceding the date of this Agreement a number
of Shares that would make it an "interested stockholder" (as such term is
defined in Section 203 of the DGCL) of the Company.

Section __ 4.10. _Brokers and Other Advisors_. No broker, finder, investment
banker, financial advisor or other Person is entitled to any brokerage,
finders, financial advisors or other similar fee or commission, or the

Purchaser, or any of their respective Subsidiaries except for Persons, if any,
whose fees and expenses shall be paid by Parent or Purchaser.

warranties of the Company contained in _Article III_ , after giving effect to
the Transactions and payment of all fees and expenses of, and any other
amounts payable by, Parent, Purchaser and the Surviving Corporation in
connection with the Offer and the Merger and the Transactions, each
of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and each Company Subsidiary will be
Solvent as of and immediately after the Effective Time.

 

Section __ 4.12. _Litigation_. As of the date hereof, there is no Proceeding
or material governmental or regulatory investigation pending or, to the
knowledge of Parent, threatened against Parent or Purchaser or any of their
respective properties that would, individually or in the aggregate, prevent or
materially delay the consummation by Parent or Purchaser of the Transactions
or the performance by Parent or Purchaser of their respective covenants and
obligations hereunder. Neither Parent nor Purchaser is subject to any
outstanding Order that would, individually or in the aggregate, prevent or
materially delay the consummation by Parent or Purchaser of the Transactions
or the performance by Parent or Purchaser of their respective covenants and
obligations hereunder.

 

Section __ 4.13. _Acknowledgement by Parent and Purchaser_.

 

(a) Neither Parent nor Purchaser is relying and neither Parent nor Purchaser
has relied on any representations or warranties whatsoever regarding the

Affiliates, stockholders, directors, officers, employees, consultants,
agents, representatives or advisors, or any other Person with respect thereto
unless any such information is expressly included in a representation or
warranty contained in this Agreement. Accordingly, Parent and Purchaser
hereby acknowledge and agree that neither the Company nor any of its

proposal that did not result from a breach of this _Section_ __ _ 5.02(a)_ if

to lead to a Superior Proposal and (ii) if the Board of Directors determines
in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside

counterparty in the aggregate than those contained in the Confidentiality
Agreement (other than the omission of any standstill provisions) and (y) does
not prohibit the Company from providing any information to Parent in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 5.02(c)_.

 



47

Representatives and provide to Parent the identity of the Person making any
such Acquisition Proposal and the material terms and conditions of such
Acquisition Proposal, if any, and any amendments thereto. The Company shall

Proposal (other than a tender offer or exchange offer), fail to publicly
affirm the Company Board Recommendation within five (5) Business Days after a
written request by Parent to do so (or, if earlier, by the close of business
on the Business Day immediately preceding the scheduled date of the Offer
Acceptance Time), (v) following the commencement of a tender offer or exchange
offer relating to the Shares by a Person unaffiliated with Parent, fail to
affirm the Company Board Recommendation and recommend that the Companys
stockholders reject such tender offer or exchange offer within five (5)

of business on the Business Day immediately preceding the scheduled date of
the Offer Acceptance Time) or (vi) fail to include the Company
Board Recommendation in the Schedule 14D-9 when disseminated to the Companys
stockholders (any action described in clause (i) to (v) above being referred
to as a " _Company Adverse Change Recommendation_ ").

 



48

    

(e) _Company Adverse Change Recommendation_.

 

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, at
any time prior to the Offer Acceptance Time if the Company has received an
Acquisition Proposal from any Person that has not been withdrawn and, after
consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, the Board
of Directors shall have determined that such Acquisition Proposal is a
Superior Proposal, (x) the Board of Directors may make a Company Adverse
Change Recommendation, or (y) provided that the Company has complied in all
material respects with the requirements of _Section_ __ _ 5.02_ with respect
to such Superior Proposal, the Company may terminate this Agreement pursuant
to _Section_ __ _ 8.01(c)(ii)_ to enter into a Specified Agreement with
respect to such Superior Proposal, in each case, if and only if: (A) the
Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with the

expected to be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Board of
Directors to the Companys stockholders under applicable Legal Requirements,
(B) the Company shall have given Parent prior written notice of its intention
to consider making a Company Adverse Change Recommendation or terminating this
Agreement pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 8.01(c)(ii)_ at least five (5)

desired by Parent, during such three (3)-Business Day period shall have
negotiated, and caused its Representatives to negotiate, in good faith with
respect to any revisions to the terms of this Agreement or another proposal
to the extent proposed by Parent so that such Acquisition Proposal would cease

(3) after giving effect to the proposals made by Parent during such period, if
any, after consultation with financial advisors and outside legal counsel,
the Board of Directors shall have determined, in good faith, that such
Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal and that the failure to make the
Company Adverse Change Recommendation or terminate this Agreement pursuant
to  _Section_ __ _ 8.01(c)(ii)_ would reasonably be expected to be
inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors to the
Companys stockholders under applicable Legal Requirements. Issuance of any
"stop, look and listen" communication by or on behalf of the Company pursuant
to Rule 14d-9(f) shall not be considered a Company Adverse Change
Recommendation and shall not require the giving of a Determination Notice or
compliance with the procedures set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 5.02(e)(i)_.
The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 5.02(e)(i)_ shall also apply to any
change to any of the financial terms (including the form, amount and timing

Proposal and require a new Determination Notice, except that the references to
three (3) Business Days shall be deemed to be two (2) Business Days.

any time prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, other than in connection with a
Superior Proposal (which shall be subject to _Section_ __ _ 5.02(e)(i)_), the
Board of Directors may make a Company Adverse Change Recommendation in
response to an Intervening Event if: (x) the Board of Directors determines in
good faith, after consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel, that
the failure to do so would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the
fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors to the Companys stockholders
under applicable Legal Requirements, (y) the Company shall have given Parent a
Determination Notice at least three (3) Business Days prior to making any such
Company Adverse Change Recommendation and, if

 



49

negotiated, and caused its Representatives to negotiate, with respect to any
revisions to the terms of this Agreement or another proposal to the extent
proposed by Parent so that a Company Adverse Change Recommendation would no
longer be necessary and (z) (A) the Company shall have specified in reasonable
detail the facts and circumstances that render a Company Adverse Change
Recommendation necessary, (B) the Company shall have given Parent the three
(3)-Business Day period after the Determination Notice to propose revisions to
the terms of this Agreement or make another proposal so that a
Company Adverse Change Recommendation would no longer be necessary, and (C)
after giving effect to the proposals made by Parent during such period, if
any, after consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel, the Board of
Directors shall have determined, in good faith, that the failure to make the
Company Adverse Change Recommendation would reasonably be expected to be
inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors to the
Companys stockholders under applicable Legal Requirements. The provisions of
this _Section_ __ _ 5.02(e)(ii)_ shall also apply to any material change to
the facts and circumstances specified by the Company pursuant to clause (z)(A)
above and require a new Determination Notice, except that the references to

, _however_ , that, except as provided in _Section_ __ _ 5.02(e)_, any such
disclosure that relates to an Acquisition Proposal (other than any "stop,
look and listen" communication pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f)) shall be deemed to
be a Company Adverse Change Recommendation unless the Board of Directors
publicly reaffirms the Company Board Recommendation with such disclosure;
_provided_ , _further_ , that the foregoing shall not permit the Board of
Directors to make a Company Adverse Change Recommendation, except as permitted
by _Section_ __ _ 5.02(e)_.

Letter and the definitive agreements with respect to the Debt Financing

terms that could adversely affect the conditionality of or the amount of Debt
Financing to be funded)). In the event that any New Debt Commitment Letter are
obtained, any reference in this Agreement to (A) the "Financing Commitment

written communication from any Financing Source or with respect to any breach,
default, termination or repudiation by any party to a Financing Commitment
Letter of the provisions of the Financing Commitment Letter that could impact
the timing of the Closing. Parent shall provide any information reasonably

the previous sentence as soon as reasonably practicable (but in any event

of the Company Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives
pursuant to any certificate, agreement, arrangement, document or instrument

neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries will be required to

or instrument (including being an issuer or other obligor with respect to the
Debt Financing) relating to the Debt Financing that is not contingent on the
occurrence of the Closing or that must be effective prior to the Effective
Time, and (B) any bank information memoranda and high-yield offering
prospectuses or memoranda required in relation to the Debt Financing will
contain disclosure and financial statements reflecting the Surviving

the Company Subsidiaries to deliver any certificate or opinion or take any
other action pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 6.03(f)(i)_ or any other provision of
this Agreement that would be expected to result in personal liability to such
officer or Representative, or (2) the members of the Board of Directors as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time to approve any financing or Contracts
related thereto, which approval would be effective prior to the Effective
Time. 

(iv) _Confidentiality_. All non-public or other confidential information

agents in connection with the Debt Financing (and, in each case, to their
respective counsel and auditors) so long as such Persons (i) agree to be bound

after the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, assume, honor and continue during the Continuation Period or,
if later, until all obligations thereunder have been satisfied, all of the

Letter, in each case, as in effect at the Effective Time, including with
respect to any payments, benefits or rights arising as a result of the
Transactions (either alone or in combination with any other event), without
any amendment or modification, other than any amendment or modification
required to comply with applicable Legal Requirements; provided, that nothing
herein shall be deemed to prohibit Parent or the Surviving Corporation from
amending or terminating any such plan, policy, program, agreement or
arrangement in accordance with its terms unless such amendment or termination

Company or any Company Subsidiary (as well as service with any predecessor
employer of the Company or any such Subsidiary, to the extent service with the

respective Subsidiaries, in each case, to the extent such service would have
been recognized by the Company or any Company Subsidiary under
analogous Company Benefit Plans prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that such service need not be recognized (x) to the extent that
such recognition would result in any duplication of benefits for the same
period of service, (y) with respect to a newly established plan for which
prior service is not taken into account or with respect to any equity-based
compensation plan, program, agreement or arrangement or (z) for purposes of
benefits that accrue under any defined benefit pension or retiree health or

actively-at-work requirements and waiting periods would not have been
satisfied or waived under the comparable Company Benefit Plan immediately
prior to the Effective Time. Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, use commercially reasonable efforts to recognize the dollar

beneficiary or dependent thereof) shall be regarded for any purpose as a
third-party beneficiary of this _Section_ __ _ 6.04_, and no provision of
this _Section_ __ _ 6.04_ shall create such rights in any such Persons. No
provision of this Agreement shall be construed (i) as a guarantee
of continued employment of any Company Employee, (ii) to prohibit Parent or
the Surviving Corporation from having the right to terminate the employment of
any Company Employee, (iii) to prevent the amendment, modification or
termination of any Company Benefit Plan after the Closing (in each case in

or former directors and officers as of the date of this Agreement and any
person who becomes a director or officer of the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement (the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") and (ii) indemnification, expense
advancement and exculpation provisions in any certificate of incorporation or
bylaws or comparable organizational document of the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries in effect on the date of this Agreement. In addition,
during the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending six (6) years
from and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation and the Company
Subsidiaries shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and the
Company Subsidiaries to) cause the certificates of incorporation and bylaws
(and other similar organizational documents) of the Surviving Corporation and
the Company Subsidiaries to contain provisions with respect to
indemnification, exculpation and the advancement of expenses that are at least
as favorable as

 



58

    

 the indemnification, exculpation and advancement of expenses provisions
contained in the certificates of incorporation and bylaws (or other similar
organizational documents) of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries as of
the date hereof, and during such six-year period, such provisions shall not be
repealed, amended or otherwise modified in any manner adverse to the
Indemnified Parties except as required by applicable Legal Requirements.

(b) Without limiting the generality of _Section_ __ _ 6.05(a)_, for six (6)
years from and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted
under applicable Legal Requirements, each of the Indemnified Parties from and
against any claims, losses, liabilities, damages, judgments, inquiries, fines
and reasonable fees, costs and expenses, including attorneys fees and
disbursements (collectively, " _Costs_ ") incurred in connection with any
Proceeding or other claim or investigation, whether civil, criminal,

Indemnified Parties service with, at the request of or for the benefit of
the Company or any of its Affiliates, including the Transactions. Without
limiting the generality of _Section_ __ _ 6.05(a)_, from and after the
Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, (i) advance
expenses to any Indemnified Party claiming indemnification pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 6.05_ as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable Legal Requirements;  _pr_ _ovided_ that any Indemnified Party to
whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking, if and only to the extent
required by the DGCL or the Surviving Corporations certificate of
incorporation or bylaws (or comparable organizational documents), to repay
such advances if it is ultimately determined by final adjudication that such
Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification and (ii) reasonably
cooperate in the defense of any such matter;  _provided_ , that the Surviving
Corporation may elect at any time and by written notice to the Indemnified
Party to defend against any third party claim, in each case at its sole cost
and expense and with its own counsel.

 

(c) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to maintain for a period of at least six (6) years following the

liability insurance policies (collectively, " _D andO Insurance_") from an
insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Companys
current insurance carrier with benefits, levels of coverage and terms and
conditions that are at least as favorable as the Companys DandO Insurance
existing immediately prior to the Effective Time with respect to matters
existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, including for acts or
omissions in connection with this Agreement and the consummation of the
Transactions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall Parent or the
Surviving Corporation be required to expend for each year of such DandO
Insurance coverage an annual premium amount greater than 300% of the annual
premiums paid by the Company for DandO Insurance in its last full fiscal year
(such amount, the " _Maximum Annual Premium_ "). If the annual premiums of
such DandO Insurance coverage exceed the Maximum Annual Premium, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall obtain a policy with the greatest coverage
available for a cost not exceeding the Maximum Annual Premium.

(d) Notwithstanding _Section_ __ _ 6.05(c)_ the Company may in its
sole discretion obtain, prior to the Effective Time, a six (6) year pre-paid
"tail" insurance coverage, at an aggregate cost no greater than the Maximum
Annual Premium, providing for DandO Insurance not less favorable than that
described in _Section_ __ _ 6.05(c)_. If the Company has obtained such policy
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.05(d)_, Parent will cause such policy to be
maintained in full force and effect for its full term and cause all
obligations thereunder to be honored by the Surviving Corporation, and Parent
will have no further obligation to purchase or pay for insurance pursuant to

consolidates or merges with or into any other Person and is not the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger

Person, then, and in each such case, Parent shall cause proper provisions to
be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation shall
assume and comply with all of the obligations set forth in this _Section_ __ _
6.05_.

 

(f) The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 6.05_ are intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties. The
obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation in this _Section_ __ _
6.05_ will not be terminated or modified in any manner which could adversely
affect any Indemnified Party without the consent of such Indemnified Party.
Parent will honor, guaranty and stand as surety for, and will cause the
Surviving Corporation and the Company Subsidiaries and successors to honor and
comply with, the covenants contained in this  _Section_ __ _ 6.05_. Parent
will pay all reasonable expenses that may be incurred by an Indemnified Party

judgment of the Company would result in the disclosure of any Trade Secrets of
third parties, (ii) disclose any information if such disclosure would result
in a waiver of attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or any
similar privilege (provided the Company shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to furnish Parent and its Representatives such information in a manner
so as to preserve such privilege), (iii) permit any invasive environmental
testing or sampling at any property or (iv) take or allow any action that
would unreasonably interfere with the Companys or any Company Subsidiarys
business or operations. All requests for information made pursuant to this

failure to satisfy any agreements or covenants under this Agreement has
primarily caused or resulted in the failure of the Acceptance Time to occur on
or before the Termination Date;

 

(ii) if the Offer (as it may be required to be extended pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 1.04_) expires or is terminated or withdrawn in accordance with its
terms without the Minimum Condition having been satisfied and the other Offer
Conditions having been satisfied or waived by Parent, in each case without the
acceptance for payment of any Shares thereunder (for avoidance of doubt,
Parent shall not be entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 8.01(b)(ii)_ if Parent is obligated to extend the Offer
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.04_);  _provided_ , _further_ , that the right
to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 8.01(b)(i)_ shall
not be available to any party whose failure to satisfy any agreements or
covenants under this Agreement has primarily caused or resulted in the non-
satisfaction of the Minimum Condition or the other Offer Conditions; or

 

(iii) if any Order permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting
the Offer or the consummation of the Merger as contemplated by this Agreement
shall have become final and non-appealable; _provided_ , _however_ , that
termination of this Agreement pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 8.01(b)(iii)_
will not relieve a party of liability under this Agreement if such party (or,
in the case of Parent, Purchaser) has not complied in all material respects
with its obligations under _Section_ __ _ 6.02_ (including the obligation of
Parent and Purchaser to take any and all steps set forth in _Section_ __ _
6.02(d)(ii)_).

(c) This Agreement may be terminated and the Offer and the Merger may be
abandoned at any time prior to the Acceptance Time by the Company:

(i) if Purchaser shall not have commenced (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2
under the Exchange Act) the Offer within five (5) Business Days of the date on
which Purchaser is required to commence the Offer pursuant to  _Section_ __ _
1.01_;

(ii) at any time prior to the Offer Acceptance Time in order to accept a
Superior Proposal and enter into the Specified Agreement providing for the
consummation of the transaction that the Board of Directors shall have
determined constitutes a Superior Proposal in accordance with _Section_ __ _
5.02(e)(i)_ (a " _Specified Agreement_ "), provided that (A) the Company has
complied in all material respects with the requirements of _Section_ __ _
5.02_ with respect to such Superior Proposal, (B) concurrently with the
termination of this Agreement, the Company and the counterparty thereto enter
into the Specified Agreement and (C) prior to or concurrently with the
termination of this Agreement, the Company pays the Termination Fee to Parent
in accordance with the applicable provisions of _Section_ __ _ 8.03_; or

(iii) in the event (A) of a material breach of any covenant or agreement on
the part of Parent or Purchaser set forth in this Agreement that would
reasonably be expected to result in a Parent Material Adverse Effect or (B)
that any of the representations and warranties of Parent and Purchaser set
forth in this Agreement shall have been inaccurate in any material respect and
such inaccuracy would reasonably be expected to result in a Parent Material
Adverse Effect; _provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing,
in the event that such breach by

 



63

    

 Parent or Purchaser or such inaccuracy in the representations and warranties
of Parent or Purchaser are curable by Parent or Purchaser prior to the
Termination Date and within twenty (20) calendar days, then the Company shall
not be permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
8.01(c)(ii)_ until the earlier to occur of (1) the expiration of a twenty-five
(25) calendar day period after delivery of written notice from the Company to
Parent of such breach or inaccuracy, as applicable, or (2) Parent or Purchaser
ceasing to exercise commercially reasonable efforts to cure such breach or
inaccuracy; provided that Parent or Purchaser continues to exercise
commercially reasonable efforts to cure such breach or inaccuracy (it being
understood that the Company may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 8.01(c)(ii)_ if (x) such breach or inaccuracy by Parent or
Purchaser is cured within such twenty-five (25) calendar day period, or (y)
the Company is then in material breach of its representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement).

(d) This Agreement may be terminated and the Offer and the Merger may be
abandoned at any time prior to the Acceptance Time by Parent:

(i) at any time prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, if: (i) the Board of
Directors shall have failed to include the Company Board Recommendation in
the Schedule 14D-9 when mailed or the Board of Directors shall have effected a
Company Adverse Change Recommendation, (ii) in the case of a tender offer or
exchange offer subject to Regulation 14D under the Exchange Act, other than
the Offer, the Board of Directors fails to recommend, in a
Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9, rejection of such
tender offer or exchange offer within five (5) Business Days of the
commencement of such tender offer or exchange offer or (iii) the Board of
Directors fails to publicly reaffirm the Company Board Recommendation within
five (5) Business Days after Parent so requests in writing; or

(ii) in the event (A) of a material breach of any covenant or agreement on the
part of the Company set forth in this Agreement such that the condition set
forth in clause (e) of _ANNEX II_ would not be satisfied as of the time of
such breach or (B) that any representation or warranty of the Company set
forth in this Agreement shall have been inaccurate when made or shall have
become inaccurate, such that the condition set forth in clause (d) of _ANNEX
II_ would not be satisfied as of the time of such breach or as of the time
such representation and warranty became inaccurate; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that, notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that such breach by the
Company or such inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the
Company are curable by the Company through the exercise of commercially
reasonable efforts prior to the Termination Date and within twenty (20)
calendar days, then Parent shall not be permitted to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 8.01(d)(ii)_ until the earlier to occur of
(1) the expiration of a twenty-five (25) calendar day period after delivery of
written notice from Parent to the Company of such breach or inaccuracy, as
applicable, or (2) the ceasing by the Company to exercise commercially
reasonable efforts to cure such breach or inaccuracy, provided that the
Company continues to exercise commercially reasonable efforts to cure such
breach or inaccuracy (it being understood that Parent may not terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 8.01(d)(ii)_ if (x) such breach or
inaccuracy by the Company is cured within such twenty-five (25) calendar day
period, or (y) Parent is then in material breach of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement), except to the extent such material breach would not reasonably be
likely to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 



64

    

Section 8.02. _Effect of Termination and Abandonment_.

 

(a) In the event of a valid and proper termination of this Agreement pursuant
to this _Article VIII_ , written notice thereof shall be given to the other
Party or Parties, as the case may be, specifying the provision hereof pursuant
to which such termination is made and this Agreement shall forthwith be of no
further force or effect and there shall be no liability or obligation on the
part of any Party (or of any of its Representatives or Affiliates); _provided_
, _however_ , that (i) the second sentence of _Section_ __ _ 1.05_, the final
sentence of _Section_ __ _ 1.09_,  _Section_ __ _ 6.06(b)_, this _Section_
__ _ 8.02_, _Section_ __ _ 8.03_ and _Article IX_ shall survive the
termination of this Agreement and shall remain in full force and effect, (ii)
the Confidentiality Agreement shall survive the termination of this Agreement
and shall remain in full force and effect in accordance with its terms and
(iii) no such termination shall relieve any Party of any liability for
damages (which the Parties acknowledge and agree may not be limited to
reimbursement of out-of-pocket fees, costs or expenses incurred in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby) to any other Party resulting from
any willful breach by such party prior to such termination, and the aggrieved
party will be entitled to all rights and remedies available at law or in
equity. The Parties acknowledge and agree that nothing in this _Section_ __ _
8.02_ shall be deemed to affect their right to specific performance under
_Section_ __ _ 9.09_. For purposes of this Agreement, "willful breach" shall
mean a material breach that is a consequence of an act, or failure to act,
undertaken by the breaching party with the knowledge that the taking of such
act, or failure to act, would, or would be reasonably expected to, result in a
breach of this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, the failure of a Party
to consummate the Closing when required pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.02_
shall be a willful breach of this Agreement.

 

Section 8.03. _Fees and Expenses; Termination Fees_.

 

(a) Except as set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 8.03_, all fees and expenses
incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions shall be paid
by the party incurring such fees and expenses, whether or not the Offer or the
Merger is consummated. Parent shall bear and timely pay all filing fees
associated with the HSR Act. In the event that this Agreement is terminated
by Parent pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.01(d)(ii)_ (other than a circumstance
when a Termination Fee is paid pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.03(b)_), then the
Company shall pay to Parent all of the reasonable and documented Expenses of
Parent and Purchaser up to, but not exceeding, three million dollars
($3,000,000) in the aggregate. As used herein, " _Expenses_ " means all out-
of-pocket fees and expenses (including all reasonable fees and expenses of
counsel, accountants, financial advisors and investment bankers to a party
hereto and its Affiliates), incurred by a party or on its behalf in
connection with or related to the authorization, preparation, negotiation,
execution and performance of this Agreement, the filing of any required
notices under applicable Antitrust Laws or other regulations and all other
matters related to the Transactions.

(b) The Company shall pay Parent the Termination Fee in the event that this
Agreement is terminated:

 

(i) by Parent pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.01(d)(i)_ or _Section_ __ _
8.01(d)(ii)_ in connection with or subsequent to a material breach of
_Section_ __ _ 5.02_ (No Solicitation or Negotiation) by the Company or any
Representative acting at the direction or on behalf of the Company;

 



65

    

(ii) by the Company pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.01(c)(ii)_; or

 

(iii) by either Parent or the Company pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.01(b)(i)_
or by Parent pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 8.01(d)(ii)_, so long as, (A) after
the date of this Agreement and prior to the termination of this Agreement, a
_bona fide_ Acquisition Proposal shall have been publicly announced or
publicly disclosed which has not been publicly and unconditionally withdrawn
prior to such termination and (B) within twelve (12) months after the date of
termination, (x) the Company shall have entered into a Contract with respect
to such Acquisition Proposal and such Acquisition Proposal is subsequently
consummated or (y) such Acquisition Proposal is consummated; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, for purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 8.03(b)(ii)_, all
references to "20%" in the definition of "Acquisition Proposal" shall be
deemed to be references to "50%."

(c) Any Termination Fee required to be paid to Parent pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 8.03(b)(i)_, less any Expenses paid by the Company pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 8.03(a)_, shall be paid to Parent by wire transfer of same-day funds
within two (2) Business Days after the date of termination of this Agreement.
Any fee under _Section_ __ _ 8.03(b)(ii)_ shall be paid to Parent by wire
transfer of same-day funds concurrently with the termination. Any fee due
under _Section_ __ _ 8.03(b)(iii)_ shall be paid to Parent by wire transfer
of same-day funds concurrently with the consummation of the applicable
Acquisition Proposal.

(d) In the event that Parent receives payment of the Termination Fee pursuant
to this _Section_ __ _ 8.03_, except with respect to any act of fraud or
actions for breach of the Confidentiality Agreement, the receipt of the
Termination Fee shall be deemed to be liquidated damages for any and all
losses or damages suffered or incurred by Parent, Purchaser, any of their
respective Affiliates or any other Person in connection with this Agreement
(and the termination hereof), the Transactions (and the abandonment thereof)
or any matter forming the basis for such termination, and none of Parent,
Purchaser, any of their respective Affiliates or any other Person shall be
entitled to bring or maintain any Proceeding against the Company or any of its
Affiliates arising out of this Agreement, any of the Transactions or any
matters forming the basis for such termination. Without the foregoing
agreement, neither the Company nor Parent would have entered into this
Agreement, and if the Company fails to timely pay any amount due pursuant to
this _Section_ __ _ 8.03_ and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent
commences a suit that results in a judgment against the non-paying party for
the payment of any amount set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 8.03_, the
Company shall pay Parent its costs and expenses in connection with such suit,
together with interest on such amount at the annual rate of five percent (5%)
plus the prime rate as published in _The Wall Street Journal_ in effect on
the date such payment was required to be made through the date such payment
was actually received, or such lesser rate as is the maximum permitted by
applicable Legal Requirements. The Company shall not be required to pay the
Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

counterparts (including by facsimile or by attachment to electronic mail in
portable document format (PDF) each of which shall be deemed an original to
the other Parties) and by the different Parties in separate counterparts, each

Parties and delivered to the other Parties.

 

Section 9.06. _Parties in Interest_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure solely to the benefit of the Parties, and nothing in this Agreement,
express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other Person any
rights, benefits or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of

 of _Section_ __ _ 6.03_, _Section_ __ _ 9.02_, this _Section_ __ _ 9.06_
and _Section_ __ _ 9.16_. The representations and warranties in this
Agreement are the product of negotiations among the Parties and are for the
sole benefit of such Parties. Any inaccuracies in such representations and
warranties are subject to waiver by the Parties in accordance with  _Section_
__ _ 9.03_ without notice or liability to any other Person. In some
instances, the representations and warranties in this Agreement may represent
an allocation among the Parties of risks associated with particular
matters regardless of the knowledge of any of the Parties. Consequently,
Persons other than the Parties may not rely upon the representations and
warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of actual facts or
circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any other date.

Section 9.07. _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the internal laws of the State of Delaware and
judicial decisions of the State of Delaware applicable to agreements executed

Section 9.08. _Entire Agreement; Assignment_. This Agreement, (including
the Exhibits, the Company Disclosure Letter and the Parent Disclosure
Letter), Support Agreement, the Equity Commitment Letters and the
Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement among the Parties
with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior and
contemporaneous agreements and undertakings, both written and oral, among the
Parties, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof and
thereof. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests
or obligations hereunder may be assigned, in whole or in part, by operation
of law or otherwise by any of the Parties without the prior written consent of
the other Parties; _provided_ that each of Parent and Purchaser may assign, in
Parents sole discretion, any or all of Parents and/or Purchasers right,
interests or obligations under this agreement to any wholly owned Subsidiary
of Parent or Purchaser and may collaterally assign its rights hereunder to any
lender of Parent or its Affiliates, but no such assignment shall relieve
Parent or Purchaser of any of their obligations hereunder. No assignment by
any party shall relieve such party of any of its obligations hereunder. Any
purported assignment in contravention of this Agreement is void. Subject to
the immediately preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure
to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Parties and their respective
successors and permitted assigns.

(a) Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all remedies herein expressly
conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of
any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such party, and
the exercise by a party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of
any other remedy. The Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the
event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were breached. It is
accordingly agreed that each of the Parties shall be entitled, in addition to
any other remedy to which they are or may be entitled at law or in equity, to
an injunction or injunctions, specific performance or other equitable relief
to prevent breaches (or threatened breaches) of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement without posting a bond
or undertaking, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are
or may be entitled at law or in equity; _provided_ the Company shall be
entitled to specific performance compelling the Equity Financing to be funded
solely to the extent that all Offer Conditions have been satisfied or, to the
extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements,

 



69

    

 waived by Parent and the Company has irrevocably confirmed that the Closing
will occur immediately after such Equity Financing is funded. The Parties
agree not to raise any objections to the granting of an injunction, specific
performance or other equitable relief to prevent or restrain breaches or
threatened breaches of this Agreement by the Company, on the one hand, or
Parent and Purchaser, on the other hand.

 

(b) All Proceedings arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be
heard and determined in the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware and any
state appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, if the
Chancery Court of the State of Delaware declines to accept jurisdiction over a
particular matter, any state or federal court within the State of Delaware)
and the Parties hereby irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction and
venue of such courts in any such Proceeding and irrevocably waive the defense
of an inconvenient forum or lack of jurisdiction to the maintenance of any
such Proceeding. The consents to jurisdiction and venue set forth in this
_Section_ __ _ 9.09(b)_ shall not constitute general consents to service of
process in the State of Delaware and shall have no effect for any purpose
except as provided in this paragraph and shall not be deemed to confer rights
on any Person other than the Parties. Each Party agrees that service of
process upon such party in any Proceeding arising out of or relating to this
Agreement shall be effective if notice is given by overnight courier at the
address set forth in _Section_ __ _ 9.04_ of this Agreement; _provided_ ,
that nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 9.09(b)_ shall affect the right of any
party to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by applicable
Legal Requirement. The Parties agree that a final judgment in any such
Proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by
suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by applicable Legal
Requirements; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in the foregoing shall
restrict any partys rights to seek any post-judgment relief regarding, or any
appeal from, such final trial court judgment.

 

Section 9.10. _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT
ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE
COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN
RESPECT OF ANY PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT
OR OTHERWISE) DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE
TRANSACTIONS OR THEREBY OR THE ACTIONS OF PARENT, PURCHASER OR THE COMPANY IN
THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT HEREOF OR
THEREOF. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO REPRESENTATIVE,
AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE,
THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE
THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (B) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS
OF SUCH WAIVER, (C) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND (D) IT HAS BEEN
INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL

Section 9.11. _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced by any applicable Legal Requirement or public
policy, all other terms and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless
remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of
the Transactions is not affected in any manner adverse to any Party. Upon such
determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as
closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the Transactions
are fulfilled to the fullest extent possible.

 

Section 9.12. _Transfer Taxes_. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,
registration and other similar Taxes and fees imposed on the Company with
respect to the transfer of Shares pursuant to the Offer or the Merger shall be
borne by the Company and expressly shall not be a liability of holders of
Shares, expressly excluding any such Taxes imposed on the holders of Shares. 

Section 9.13. _Disclosure Letters_. Certain items and matters are listed in
the Company Disclosure Letter and the Parent Disclosure Letter for
informational purposes only and may not be required to be listed therein by
the terms of this Agreement. In no event shall the listing of items or matters
in the Company Disclosure Letter or the Parent Disclosure Letter be deemed or
interpreted to broaden, or otherwise expand the scope of, the representations
and warranties or covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement. No
reference to, or disclosure of, any item or matter in any Section of this
Agreement or any section or subsection of the Company Disclosure Letter or
the Parent Disclosure Letter shall be construed as an admission or indication
that such item or matter is material or that such item or matter is required
to be referred to or disclosed in this Agreement or in the Company Disclosure
Letter or the Parent Disclosure Letter, as applicable. Without limiting the
foregoing, no reference to, or disclosure of, a possible breach or violation
of any Contract or Legal Requirement in the Company Disclosure Letter or the
Parent Disclosure Letter shall be construed as an admission or indication that
a breach or violation exists or has actually occurred.
