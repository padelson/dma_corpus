 (iv) the shareholders of Burress identified as such on the signature page to this Agreement (" _Burress Shareholders_ "); and

As a result of the Merger, Burress will become a wholly-owned direct subsidiary of HandE and 100% of the Burress Equity Equivalents will be owned by HandE; the foregoing, together with the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents, being herein together referred to individually and collectively as the " _Transaction_ ".

Article I 
  _Definitions_  

   

 Section 1.1. _Certain Definitions_. Capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings set forth in _Schedule_ A. 

  

 Section 1.2. _Interpretation_. Unless otherwise indicated to the contrary herein by the context or use thereof: (i) the words, "herein," "hereto," "hereof" and words of similar import refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular Section or paragraph hereof; (ii) the word "including" means "including, but not limited to" and "including without limitation"; (iii) masculine gender shall also include the feminine and neutral genders, and vice versa; (iv) words importing the singular shall also include the plural, and vice versa; and (v) unless otherwise expressly indicated in the context, all references herein to any "Section", "Article", "clause", "Schedule", "Disclosure Schedule" or "Exhibit" refer to Sections, Articles, clauses, Schedules, Disclosure Schedules and Exhibits contained in, or attached to, this Agreement. 

  

Article II 
  _Purchase Price and Other Calculations, Payments and Adjustments_  

   

 Section 2.1. _Certain Definitions_. For purposes of this Agreement, the following terms shall have the meanings hereinafter specified: 

  

 " _Closing Estimates_ " means an estimate as of the Closing Date, to be made in good faith by Burress Shareholders Representative and HandE prior to the Closing based on the most recently available Interim Financial Statements and such additional financial and other information as may be available to Burress Shareholders Representative and HandE at the time such estimate is made, and with the assistance of the Accountants, of the Non-Hitachi Adjusted EBITDA and the Hitachi Adjusted EBITDA, the Burress Tax Liabilities, the Closing Merger Consideration per Burress Share, the Closing Net Proceeds to Burress Shareholders, the Third Party Payments, the Hitachi Indebtedness and Payables, the Hitachi Fleet Value, the Merger Consideration per Burress Share, the Included Burress Indebtedness, the Initial Proceeds to Burress Shareholders, the Purchase Price and the Supplemental Proceeds to Burress Shareholders, subject (in the case of all of the foregoing) to adjustment pursuant to _Section_ 2.3. 

   

 " _Closing Merger Consideration per Burress Share_ " means an amount equal to (i) the Closing Net Proceeds to Burress Shareholders _divided by_ (ii) the number of Burress Equity Equivalents outstanding as of the Effective Time. 

   

 " _Closing Net Proceeds to Burress Shareholders_ " means (i) the Initial Proceeds to Burress Shareholders _less_ (ii) the Closing Escrow Amount _less_ (iii) the Third Party Payments _less_ (iv) the Burress Tax Liabilities. 

   

 " _Hitachi Adjusted EBITDA_ " means the earnings derived solely from operations related to the sale and leasing of the inventory of vehicles and equipment of Burress manufactured by Hitachi owned by Burress for the 12-month period ending as of February 28, 2007, before any expense or charge in respect of interest, Taxes based on income (but Taxes not  ##### 

 

 

3 

  

based on income of Burress shall be included in the calculation of the Hitachi
Adjusted EBITDA), depreciation and amortization, determined in a manner
consistent with the 2006 Audited Financial Statements. In determining Hitachi
Adjusted EBITDA and non-Hitachi Adjusted EBITDA, all costs, expenses and
deductions of Burress which are not clearly related to or identified with
earnings derived from the sale and leasing of vehicles and equipment
manufactured by Hitachi or non-Hitachi vendors shall be allocated with
respect to earnings derived from Hitachi and non-Hitachi vendors  _pro rata_
based on the sales and revenue derived from such sales and leasing. 

   

 " _Hitachi Fleet_ " means the inventory of parts, accessories, vehicles and equipment of Burress manufactured by Hitachi owned by Burress. 

   

 " _Hitachi Fleet Premium_ " means $4.0 million, which represents the agreed net present value of the revenues of Burress projected to be derived by Burress from the sale and rental of the Hitachi Fleet (excluding any New Hitachi Fleet) during the three-year period ending February 28, 2010. 

   

 " _Hitachi Fleet Value_ " means the net book value (including after depreciation and obsolescence reserves) as of the Closing Date of the Hitachi Fleet (excluding any New Hitachi Fleet, except as provided in _Section_ 2.3(e)) determined in a manner consistent with the 2006 Audited Financial Statements. Solely for purposes of example, the Hitachi Fleet Value (excluding the New Hitachi Fleet) is currently assumed (subject to confirmation by the Parties in accordance with this Agreement) to be $21,927,440, subject to adjustment in accordance with  _Section_ 2.3. 

   

 " _Hitachi Indebtedness and Payables_ " means (i) the Indebtedness, payables and other obligations of Burress owed to the Hitachi Group as of the Closing Date (whether pursuant to floor plan financings, on open account or otherwise), including under or pursuant to the Hitachi Agreements, and (ii) the amount of any other Indebtedness outstanding as of the Closing Date which was incurred by Burress on or after February 28, 2007 and prior to the Closing where the proceeds of such Indebtedness was used to purchase parts, accessories, vehicles and equipment from the Hitachi Group. Solely for purposes of example, if the Closing had occurred on February 28, 2007, the Hitachi Indebtedness and Payables is assumed to be $30,174,614. 

   

 " _Included Burress Indebtedness_ " means: 

    

 (i) Burress Indebtedness (excluding Hitachi Indebtedness and Payables) outstanding as of February 28, 2007, net of cash as of such date and net of the account receivable balance outstanding on February 28, 2007 owed by Reedrill and Ritchie Accounts Receivables,  _plus_  

   

 (ii) the Hitachi Indebtedness and Payables outstanding as of the Closing Date. 

 

The Parties have no reason currently to believe that _Schedule_ E-1 does not
set forth all of the Included Burress Indebtedness as of February 28, 2007
(as if the Closing had occurred on such  ##### 

 

 

4  

date); and the inclusion or exclusion of any items on _Schedule_ E-1 shall not
be determinative of whether such items are classifiable as Included Burress
Indebtedness.  _Disclosure Schedule_ 5.16 lists all Contracts of Burress
pursuant to which Indebtedness of Burress may be incurred by Burress
subsequent to February 28, 2007 in the Ordinary Course of Business ("
_Additional Burress Indebtedness_ " and " _Additional Burress
Indebtedness Contracts_ "). 

   

 " _Initial Escrow Amount_ " means:

 (i) _clause_ (iii) of _Section_ 9.1; or

 Section 8.10. _Section 338(h)(10) Elections_. If the Elections are requested to be made by HandE, in its sole discretion: 

  

 (a) Burress Shareholders shall make elections provided for by Section 338(g) and Section 338(h)(10) of the Code (and any corresponding elections under any Tax Law) (the " _Elections_ ") with respect to Burress and shall provide to one another with such information as is reasonably necessary to permit the Elections to be made. Original, executed forms for such Elections shall be delivered by Burress Shareholders to HandE on the Closing Date. Burress Shareholders and HandE shall, as promptly as practicable following the Closing Date, take all actions reasonably necessary and appropriate (including filing such forms, returns, elections, schedules and other documents as may be required) to effect and preserve timely Elections, and Burress Shareholders and HandE shall not take any position inconsistent with such Elections. 

   

 (b) In connection with the Elections, no later than 90 days after the Closing Date, Burress Shareholders and HandE shall act together in good faith to (i) determine and agree upon the amount of the "adjusted grossed-up basis" and "aggregate deemed sales price" of the assets of Burress (within the meaning of Treas. Reg. § 1.338(h)(10)-1(d)(2),(3)), which "adjusted grossed-up basis" and "aggregate deemed sales price" shall be determined in a manner consistent with the Closing Estimate of the Purchase Price. Not later that 120 days following the Closing Date, HandE shall provided to Burress Shareholders Representative allocations (the " _Tax Election Allocations_ ") of the "adjusted grossed-up basis" and "aggregate deemed sales price" of Burress assets among the assets of Burress in accordance with Section 338(a) and Section 338(b)(5) of the Code and the Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder. The Accountants shall prepare the Tax Return of Burress for the Pre-Closing Partial Period and the consolidated Tax Return of HandE for the Post-Closing Partial Period on such basis (the " _First Post-Closing Tax Return_ "). Burress will calculate gain or loss, if any, resulting from the Elections in a manner consistent with the Tax Election Allocations applicable under this _Section_ 8.10(b) and will not take any  ##### 

 

 

45 

position inconsistent with the Tax Election Allocations in any Tax Return or
otherwise; provided, however, that Burress will be entitled to take into
account its respective expenses when calculating such gain or loss. HandE will
allocate the "adjusted grossed-up basis" of Burress assets among the assets
of Burress in a manner consistent with the Tax Election Allocations and will
not take any position inconsistent with the Tax Election Allocations in any
Tax Return or otherwise; provided, however, that HandE will be entitled to add
its expenses to such "adjusted grossed-up basis" for purposes of Tax Election
Allocations among the assets of Burress made pursuant to this  _Section_
8.10(b). HandE, Burress and Burress Shareholders shall file all Tax
Returns (including Forms 8883 and any comparable state and local forms)
consistently with such Tax Election Allocations. 

   

 (c) (i) If, as a result of the Elections, Burress Shareholders are required to pay more cash income Taxes than they would have been required to pay if the Elections were not made (the " _Tax Shortfall Amount_ "), then Burress Shareholders shall provide a detailed calculation of the Tax Shortfall Amount, together with a detailed calculation of the Taxes included in the Tax Shortfall Amount that are payable with respect to the year including the Closing Date (the " _Initial Tax Shortfall Amount_ "), and a computation of the " _Tentative Gross-Up Amount_ ," which shall equal an amount such that, after Burress Shareholders pay Taxes on the amounts paid to them pursuant to this _Section_ 8.10(c), the net amount received equals the Tax Shortfall Amount. The computations of the Tax Shortfall Amount, the Initial Tax Shortfall Amount and the Tentative Gross-Up Amount shall be based upon the Tax Election Allocations, shall assume that Burress Shareholders are subject to at least the same rate of tax on their net income as they would be if they remained resident at the same address they occupied on the date hereof, and shall take into account all deductions and credits available to Burress Shareholders. The Tax Shortfall Amount, the Initial Tax Shortfall Amount and the Tentative Gross-Up Amount shall be computed using a tax basis balance sheet as of the Closing Date, computed using the same principles used to determine the Tax Basis Balance Sheet (the " _Closing Date Tax Basis Balance Sheet_ "). To the extent the Closing Date Tax Basis Balance Sheet differs from the Tax Basis Balance Sheet other than by reason of adjustments arising from the ordinary course of the Burress business, and such difference would increase the Tentative Gross-Up Amount by more than $500,000, the Tentative Gross-Up Amount shall not include any such excess, and the Initial Tax Shortfall Amount shall be limited to ensure that the Tentative Gross-Up Amount does not include such excess. Burress Shareholders shall provide their draft computation of the Tax Shortfall Amount, the Initial Tax Shortfall Amount and the Tentative Gross-Up Amount to HandE and Burress not later than February 15th of the year following the Closing Date. HandE and Burress shall review and comment on the calculation of such amounts not later than February 28th of the year following the Closing Date, and HandE, Burress and Burress Shareholders shall work diligently to resolve any dispute as to such amounts. In the event that HandE, Burress and Burress Shareholders cannot reach agreement, they shall refer the matter to the Arbitrator Accountants for resolution. Burress shall pay the Initial Tax Shortfall Amount to Burress Shareholders Representative (for the account of Burress Shareholders) not later than April 8th of the year following the Closing Date or five business days after the Arbitrator Accountant resolves any dispute as to such amount. 

   

 (ii) Not later than February 15th of the second year following the Closing Date (such year, the " _Final Tax Payment Year_ "), Burress Shareholders shall compute a revised Tax Shortfall Amount based on the amounts actually paid or required to be paid pursuant  ##### 

 

 

46 

to this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, together with a revised Tentative
Gross-Up Amount, and a computation of the Final Gross-Up Amount, as defined
below, all prepared using the assumptions and conventions discussed above. To
the extent that any Taxes reflected in the revised computation of the
Tentative Gross-Up Amount are payable after April 15th of the Final Tax
Payment Year, such payments shall be discounted from April 15th of the year
following the year with respect to which they are required to be paid to
April 15th of the Final Tax Payment Year, using a discount rate equal to the
short-term applicable federal rate in effect on April 15th of the Final Tax
Payment Year. The sum of(A) all Taxes paid or payable not later than April
15th of the Final Tax Payment year plus (B) all Taxes payable after April
15th of the Final Tax Payment year, discounted as noted above, minus (C)
the Initial Tax Shortfall Amount, shall equal the " _Final Gross-Up
Amount_.". HandE and Burress shall review and comment on the calculation of
such amounts not later than February 28th of the Final Tax Payment Year, and
HandE, Burress and Burress Shareholders shall work diligently to resolve any
dispute as to such amounts. In the event that HandE, Burress and Burress
Shareholders cannot reach agreement, they shall refer the matter to the
Arbitrator Accountants for resolution. Burress shall pay the Final Gross-Up
Amount to Burress Shareholders Representative (for the account of Burress
Shareholders) (or, if the Final Gross-Up Amount is a negative number,
Burress Shareholders shall pay such amount to Burress) not later than April
8th of the Final Tax Payment Year or five business days after the Arbitrator
Accountant resolves any dispute as to such amount. 

   

 (iii) In the event that the Hitachi Consent is obtained on or before the 120th day following the Closing Date, but at any time on or before the third anniversary of the Closing Date the Hitachi Agreements are terminated by the Hitachi Group or the Hitachi Group fails to provide parts, accessories, vehicles and equipment and service substantially in accordance with such Hitachi Agreements, such that HandE will have no obligation to not make any of the payments under  _Section_ 2.2(d)(ii), then not later than 30 days after the date on which it is determined that such payments shall not be made, Burress Shareholders Representative shall provide a revised computation of the Final Gross-Up Amount, taking into account such non-payment (such recomputed amount, the " _Recomputed Gross-Up Amount_ ", and the difference between (x) the Recomputed Gross-Up Amount minus (y) the Final Gross-Up Amount as originally computed, the " _Tax Adjustment Amount_ "). HandE and Burress shall review and comment on the calculation of such amounts not later than 30 days after receiving such computations of the Recomputed Gross-Up Amount, and HandE, Burress and Burress Shareholders Representative shall work diligently to resolve any dispute as to such amounts. In the event that HandE, Burress and Burress Shareholders Representative cannot reach agreement, they shall refer the matter to the Arbitrator Accountants for resolution. Burress shall pay the Tax Adjustment Amount to Burress Shareholders (or, if the Tax Adjustment Amount is a negative number, Burress Shareholders shall pay such amount to Burress) not later than five business days after the date on which HandE, Burress and Burress Shareholders Representative reach agreement or, if applicable, the Arbitrator Accountant resolves any dispute as to such amount. Similarly, if there was a balance in the Escrow Account at the time that the Final Gross-Up Amount was determined, and amounts are paid from the Escrow Account that differ from the amounts that, in computing the Final Gross-Up Amount, were assumed would be paid, then there shall be a further recomputation of the Gross-Up Amount and payment of adjustments using the procedures set forth earlier in this _Section_ 8.10(c)(iii).  #####

If any Burress Shareholder receives a refund of Taxes attributable to any portion of the Tax Shortfall Amount or the Final Gross-Up Amount, then that Burress Shareholder shall pay such refund to HandE promptly after receipt thereof. 

   

 (v) In the event that as a result of any audit of any Tax Return of Burress for the taxable year including the Closing Date, the allocation of the aggregate deemed sale price (ADSP) and the adjusted grossed up basis (AGUB) is required to be adjusted from the amounts reflected in the Tax Election Allocations, then the Tax Shortfall Amount and Final Gross-Up Amount or, if applicable, the Recomputed Gross-Up Amount shall be recomputed as a result of such adjustments, and Burress and HandE shall pay Burress Shareholders, or Burress Shareholders shall pay to Burress and HandE (as the case may be) the amount of such adjustment; _provided_ that Burress and HandE shall be entitled to participate in and jointly control such proceeding with Burress Shareholders Representative.

53 

this _Section_ 10.2 (an " _Indemnitee_ ") in respect of Losses suffered by
an Indemnitee solely as a result of any facts or circumstances which
constitute a breach of any representation or warranty listed in _Articles_ V,
VII or VIII shall be an amount equal to the following: (A) prior to the
Minimum Survival Date, 25% of the aggregate of the Initial Net Proceeds to
Burress Shareholders and any Supplemental Proceeds to Burress Shareholders;
and (B) subsequent to the Minimum Survival Date, the Escrow Amount. 

   

 (ii) Subject to _Section_ 10.2(c)(iii), the Indemnitor shall not be required to indemnify an Indemnitee in respect of any Losses suffered by such Indemnitee solely as a result of any facts or circumstances which constitute a breach of any representation or warranty contained in  _Articles_ V, VI or VII until the aggregate of all Losses suffered by the Indemnitee exceeds $500,000 (the " _Basket Amount_ "); and then only for the amount by which the Losses exceed the Basket Amount. In measuring the amount of Losses suffered by the Indemnitee in respect of a matter which is the subject of any representation or warranty for purposes of determining whether the Basket Amount has been exceeded, any qualification of a representation and warranty by reference to materiality or the absence of any Material Adverse Effect or Material Adverse Change shall be disregarded. 

  

 (iii) The limitations of _Sections_ 10.2(c)(i) and 10.2(c)(ii) shall not apply to Losses described in or based upon _clauses_ (ii) and (iii) of _Section_ 10.1, _clause_  (i), (iv) and (v) of _Section_ 10.1 to the extent that such claims are based on claims of any Governmental Authority or violations of Laws (except claims based on violations of Laws required to be disclosed under _Section_ 5.12, other than (and for the avoidance of doubt the following are not subject to the limitations of _Sections_ 10.2(c)(i) and 10.2(c)(ii)) in respect of claims under _subclause_ (H) of _clause_ (iii) of _Section_ 10.2(a) and claims based on any fraud or intentional misrepresentation by Burress Shareholders) or would have affected the calculation of the Closing Net Worth, _clauses_ (ii) and (iii) of _Section_  10.2(a), or _clause_ (ii) of _Section_ 10.2(b), or arising out of or based upon  _Sections_ 5.2, 5.5, 5.11, 5.23, 6.1, 6.4, 6.5, 7.2, 7.5, 10.3 or 12.4, or _Section_  5.24 to the extent that _Section_ 5.24 relates to the foregoing Sections, or to claims based on any fraud or intentional misrepresentation by Burress Shareholders. 

  

 (iv) In the event that any condition to the obligations of any Party contained in  _Section_ 4.2 shall be expressly waived (a " _Waived Closing Condition_ ") by such Party (a " _Waiving Party_ "), such waiver shall be effective only if contained in a writing executed by the Waiving Party and the provision of _Section_ 4.2 that is waived is expressly stated in such writing (a " _Waiver of Closing Condition_ "). Any Waiver of Closing Condition shall constitute a waiver of any claim for indemnification under this _Article_ X (other than claims for indemnification under _clauses_ (ii) and (iii) of _Section_ 10.2(a), or  _clause_ (ii) of _Section_ 10.2(b), or arising out of or based upon _Sections_  10.3 or 12.4) provided that all material facts and circumstances which relate to the Waived Closing Condition, or which are material to a decision by the Waiving Party to execute the Waiver of Closing Condition, have been disclosed to the Waiving Party and described in the Waiver of Closing Condition. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing contained in this _Section_ 10.2(c)(iv) shall be construed to establish any claim for indemnification of any Party based on any condition to the obligations of any Party contained in _Section_ 4.2 not being satisfied independent of any claim for indemnification otherwise arising or permitted under this _Article_ X.  ##### 

 

 

54  

 (v) Subject to the provisions of _Section_ 2.2(b)(i)(B) and the application of the Reserve Account as provided in _Section_ 2.2(b)(i)(B), any indemnification of Losses of HandE Indemnified Parties (including under _Section_ 10.3) shall be satisfied first with the Escrow Amount. For the avoidance of doubt, HandE Indemnified Parties may obtain payment of indemnification claims also directly from Burress Shareholders (x) for any amounts intended to be paid from the Reserve Account to the extent of any deficiency in the Reserve Account, and (y) any indemnification of Losses to the extent of any deficiency in the Escrow Account or if Burress Shareholders Representative shall unreasonably withhold consent to any disbursement from the Escrow Account or refuse to make a payment from the Reserve Account. 

  

 (d) _Manner of Payment_. Any indemnification pursuant to this _Section_ 10.2 or  _Section_ 10.3 shall be effected by wire transfer of immediately available funds from the Indemnitor (or where applicable, from the Escrow Amount ) to an account designated in writing by the Indemnitee within ten (10) calendar days after the final determination thereof; provided that an Indemnitee, at its option, may setoff any such indemnification claim finally determined, pursuant to a final, non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction, to be due and payable from the Indemnitor against any payment obligation owing from the Indemnitee or its Affiliates to such Indemnitor or its Affiliates. Any indemnification payments shall be made together with interest accruing thereon from the date on which such claim is finally determined to be due and payable to the date of payment at a fluctuating per annum rate of interest equal to the Interest Rate. 

   

 (e) _Insurance_. Notwithstanding any term or provision of this _Section_ 10.2 to the contrary, any indemnification payments owed by one Party to another Party pursuant to this  _Section_ 10.2 shall be reduced by the aggregate of any amounts actually received by the Indemnitee under insurance policies and similar arrangements and from third parties by the Party claiming indemnity hereunder. In the event that an Indemnitor has paid any indemnification claim hereunder and the Indemnitee subsequently receives the proceeds of insurance which may cover the indemnification claim, then such proceeds shall be paid over to the Indemnitor to the extent of such prior indemnification payment. However, neither the foregoing nor any other provision of this Agreement shall (i) release or relieve any Party from any indemnification obligation hereunder (unless and until such obligation is satisfied by the payment of insurance proceeds or other indemnity as aforesaid), (ii) impose upon any Party any obligation to seek or obtain insurance coverage or other indemnity for any indemnification claim that might be asserted under this  _Article_ X, or (iii) impose upon any Party seeking indemnification the obligation to pursue or recover any insurance proceeds or other indemnity to pay any indemnification claim, except that HandE and Burress will use their commercially reasonable efforts to make appropriate claims under any then available insurance coverage (however, HandE and Burress shall have no obligation to commence litigation against any insurance carrier or undertake any extraordinary efforts to recover under any insurance claim, and Burress Shareholders shall not delay in satisfying any indemnification obligation pending, and notwithstanding the processing of, any insurance claim). In the event that HandE or Burress shall elect to obtain insurance coverage or other indemnity as aforesaid, HandE or Burress shall use reasonable efforts to provide, under the terms of such insurance coverage or other indemnity, that any insurer thereunder shall not have the right to assert claims (whether by subrogation or  ##### 

 

 

55 

otherwise) against any Indemnitor; provided that such provision does not
materially increase the cost of obtaining such insurance coverage or other
indemnity. 

   

 (f) _Third Party Claims_. Any Indemnitee shall notify the Indemnitor of the claim in writing promptly after receiving written notice of any Proceeding against it by a third party (a " _Third Party Claim_ "), describing the claim, the amount thereof (if known and quantifiable) and the basis thereof; provided that the failure to so notify an Indemnitor shall not relieve the Indemnitor of its obligations hereunder except to the extent that the Indemnitor shall be actually prejudiced by such failure to so notify. Any Indemnitor shall be entitled to participate in the defense of such Third Party Claim giving rise to an Indemnitees claim for indemnification at such Indemnitors expense, and at its option (subject to the limitations set forth below) shall be entitled to assume the defense thereof by appointing a reputable counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnitee to be the lead counsel in connection with such defense; provided that: 

    

 (i) the Indemnitee shall be entitled to participate in the defense of such Third Party Claim and to employ counsel of its choice for such purpose; provided that the fees and expenses of such separate counsel shall be borne by the Indemnitee (other than any fees and expenses of such separate counsel that are incurred prior to the date the Indemnitor effectively assumes control of such defense which, notwithstanding the foregoing, shall be borne by the Indemnitor); 

   

 (ii) the Indemnitor shall not be entitled to assume control of such defense and shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel retained by the Indemnitee if: (A) the claim for indemnification relates to or arises in connection with any criminal Proceeding, action, indictment, allegation or investigation; (B) the Third Party Claim seeks an injunction or equitable relief against the Indemnitee; (C) a conflict of interest exists between the Indemnitor and the Indemnitee; (D) the Indemnitor failed or is failing to vigorously prosecute or defend such Third Party Claim; or (E) the Third Party Claim, if adversely determined against the Indemnitee, would have a Material Adverse Effect; and 

   

 (iii) if the Indemnitor shall control the defense of any such claim, the Indemnitor shall obtain the prior written consent of the Indemnitee before entering into any settlement of a Proceeding or ceasing to defend such Proceeding if, pursuant to or as a result of such settlement or cessation, injunctive or other equitable relief will be imposed against the Indemnitee or if such settlement does not expressly and unconditionally release the Indemnitee from all Liabilities and obligations with respect to such claim, without prejudice. 

  

 (g) _Sole Remedy_. The sole and exclusive remedy of each of HandE and Burress Shareholders for any and all claims or Losses relating to or arising out of or in connection with this Agreement shall be an action for indemnity pursuant to this _Article_ X; except that the foregoing restriction shall be inapplicable to claims based on any fraud or intentional misrepresentation by Burress Shareholders. 

     ##### 

 

   

56 

   

 (h) _Tax Effect_. Notwithstanding any term or provision of this _Section_  10.2 to the contrary, for the purpose of determining the amount of any Loss related to a breach of a representation or warranty, any indemnification payment owed by one Party to another Party pursuant to this _Section_ 10.2 shall be reduced by the amount of any Tax benefits actually received, and increased by any Tax Liability incurred in respect of such indemnification payment, by the indemnified Party or its Affiliate. 

   

 Section 10.3. _Certain Tax Matters_. 

  

 (a) Notwithstanding and without regard to the limitations set forth elsewhere in this  _Article_ X, Burress Shareholders shall, jointly and severally, indemnify, defend and hold harmless HandE and Burress from and against any and all claims for Losses in connection with, relating to or arising out of (all of the following being herein referred to as " _Burress Tax Liabilities_ "): 

    

 (i) (A) any breach of any representation or warranty given or made by Burress Shareholders in _Section_ 5.11;

 (C) all Taxes with respect to any Tax period beginning before the Closing Date and ending after the Closing Date, but only with respect to the portion of such Tax period up to and including the Closing Date (such portion shall be referred to herein as the " _Pre-Closing Partial Period_ "; and the portion of such period after the Closing Date shall be referred to herein as the " _Post-Closing Partial Period_ "); 

   

 (D) any Tax Liability arising as a result of any failure by Burress to have been an "S Corporation within the meaning of Section 1361(a)(1) of the Code for federal income Tax purposes and under the Laws of each state in which Burress has conducted business since the time of its incorporation; and 

   

 (v) any Tax Liability of Burress Shareholders required to be withheld and remitted by Burress to any Governmental Authority. 

 

Burress Shareholders shall not be required to indemnify HandE for (i) Taxes with
respect to any Post-Closing Partial Period or (ii) Taxes to the extent
included in the calculation of the Closing Net Proceeds to Burress
Shareholders. 

   

 (b) Any Taxes for a period including a Pre-Closing Partial Period and a Post-Closing Partial Period shall be apportioned between such Pre-Closing Partial Period and such Post-Closing Partial Period based, in the case of real and personal property Taxes, on a per diem basis and, in the case of other Taxes, on the actual activities, taxable income or taxable loss of Burress during such Pre-Closing Partial Period and Post-Closing Partial Period. 

    ##### 

  

   

57 

   

 (c) Burress Shareholders shall be responsible for the preparation and filing of all returns in respect of Taxes of Burress for Tax periods ending prior to or on December 31, 2006. Burress Shareholders Representative, HandE and Burress shall jointly prepare and file returns of Burress for Tax periods ending prior to or on the Closing Date (including the federal return for the Tax period commencing January 1, 2007 and ending on the Closing Date) if such returns are not filed before the Closing Date. Such Tax Returns shall be prepared in a manner consistent with the manner in which Tax Returns have been prepared for prior periods, except as otherwise required by applicable Laws. Burress Shareholders shall be responsible for the payment of all amounts due on such returns which have not included in the calculation of the Closing Net Proceeds to Burress Shareholders. Unless required pursuant to the resolution of any Tax audit or dispute, no Party shall file any amended Tax Return with respect to any Tax period or portion of any Tax period ending on or prior to the Closing Date if such amended Tax Return would increase the Tax Liabilities of any other Party without the affected Partys written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if HandE so elects in its sole and absolute discretion, Burress shall make an election under Section 754 of the Code with respect to its Tax period including the Closing Date. 

   

 (d) HandE shall cause Burress to prepare and file all returns in respect of Taxes for periods ending after the Closing Date. Except for Taxes attributable to a Pre-Closing Partial Period as determined under _Section_ 10.3(b), HandE and Burress shall be responsible for the payment of all amounts due on such returns. 

   

 (e) Burress Shareholders Representative shall have control over the conduct of any Proceeding involving Taxes for which Burress Shareholders may be obligated to indemnify HandE or Burress pursuant to this _Section_ 10.3 with respect to any Tax period ending on or prior to the Closing Date including any federal audit for the Tax period beginning January 1, 2007 and ending on the Closing Date, provided that Burress Shareholders have provided reasonably adequate assurances to HandE that they will pay any Liability resulting therefrom. In the event that Burress Shareholders receive notice of a claim against Burress with regard to such Tax period from any Governmental Authority, Burress Shareholders shall promptly notify HandE and Burress of such claim. Burress Shareholders shall keep HandE reasonably informed of the progress of any audit, and HandE may participate in such audit if it so wishes. Burress will provide, as promptly as practicable, such information and assistance that is necessary in defense of the claim. 

   

 (f) HandE or Burress shall have control over the conduct of any audit or other Proceeding with respect to Taxes of Burress other than the Taxes over which Burress Shareholders shall have control under _Section_ 10.3(e); provided that if Burress Shareholders, on the one hand, and HandE or Burress, on the other hand, are both responsible for Taxes, all such Parties (or Burress Shareholders Representative in the case of Burress Shareholders) shall jointly control the conduct of any audit or other Proceeding with respect to such Taxes, provided that Burress Shareholders Representative shall only be entitled to participate in such audit to the extent that they may be required to indemnify HandE and shall not take any position that might cause HandE to incur additional Taxes for which it will not be indemnified without HandEs prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. HandE or Burress shall promptly notify Burress Shareholders in writing of any claim or dispute with respect to any Taxes as to which

Burress Shareholders may be obligated to indemnify HandE or Burress pursuant to
this  _Section_ 10.3 and with respect to any issue raised in an audit of any
Tax period ending after the Closing Date if the disposition of such issue
could affect the treatment of any Taxes for which Burress Shareholders may be
obligated to indemnify Burress or HandE pursuant to this  _Section_ 10.3. HandE
and Burress, on the one hand, and Burress Shareholders, on the other hand,
agree not to enter into any agreement or settlement with a Tax jurisdiction
with respect to any audit or dispute with respect to any Tax as to which
Burress Shareholders are required to indemnify HandE or any of Burress pursuant
to this _Section_ 10.3 without consent from the other Party, which shall not
be unreasonably withheld. For the avoidance of doubt, it shall not
be unreasonable for HandE or Burress to withhold its consent if it may be
required to pay additional Taxes as a result of such settlement, unless
Burress Shareholders fully indemnify HandE and Burress for any such additional
Taxes (including any Taxes attributable to the receipt of such payment by HandE
or Burress). 

   

 (g) Burress shall pay to Burress Shareholders the amount of all refunds of Taxes received by Burress after the Closing Date attributable to Taxes paid by Burress Shareholders or Burress with respect to Tax periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date (but excluding any Tax refunds or credits for estimated Taxes paid by Burress which have been included in the calculation of the Closing Net Proceeds to Burress Shareholders, within 45 days after receiving such refunds. 

  

 (h) Burress Shareholders, Burress and HandE agree to furnish or cause to be furnished to each other, upon request, as promptly as practicable, such information and assistance (including, without limitation, access to books and records) relating to Burress as is necessary for the preparation of any Tax Return, claim for refund or audit, and the prosecution or defense of any claim relating to any proposed adjustment with respect to Taxes, so long as there is no material expense incurred in satisfying such request. The Parties shall retain all Tax Returns, schedules, and work papers, and all material records and other documents relating thereto, until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations (including, to the extent noticed by any Party, any extensions thereof) of the Tax period to which such Tax Returns and other documents and information relate. Each of the Parties shall also make available to the other Parties, as reasonably requested and available, personnel (including officers, directors, employees, and agents) responsible for preparing, maintaining, and interpreting information and documents relevant to Taxes, and personnel reasonably required as witnessed or for purposes of providing information or documents in connection with any Proceeding relating to Taxes. Any information or documents provided under this Agreement shall be kept confidential by the Party receiving such information or documents, except as may otherwise be necessary in connection with the filing of Tax Returns, Proceedings relating to Taxes or claims for indemnification under this Agreement.

After the Closing, Burress shall afford to Burress Shareholders Representative and its counsel and accountants reasonable access to the books, records, files, personnel and documents related to the business conducted by Burress prior to the Closing Date in the possession of Burress or under the control of Burress as may be reasonably requested by Burress Shareholders Representative in order to permit Burress Shareholders (at their cost and expense) to prepare and file federal, state and local Tax returns 

   #####

and to prepare for and participate in any Proceeding with respect thereto, to
prepare for, participate in, assert or defend any other Proceeding relating
to or involving Burress Shareholders, and to discharge the obligations of
Burress Shareholders or to contest and defend any claims made under this
Agreement and any other agreements contemplated hereby. After the
Closing, Burress Shareholders Representative shall have the right, at its
cost and expense, to copy such books, records, files and documents related to
Burress as may be reasonably useful to Burress Shareholders in connection
with any of the matters described in the preceding provisions of this 
_Section_ 10.4; however, Burress Shareholders shall maintain the
confidentiality of such books, records, files and documents and shall use
such books, records, files and documents solely for the purposes contemplated
in this _Section_ 10.4. If the originals of any such books, records, files
and documents related to Burress are required in connection with any
Proceeding or similar matter, Burress Shareholders shall have the right to
use such originals; provided that Burress Shareholders shall use their
respective commercially reasonable efforts to have such originals released
from any such Proceeding or other matter and returned to Burress as soon
as reasonably possible under the circumstances. Burress shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the material books, records,
files and documents related to Burress in original form with respect to legal
documents and photographic, micrographic or other storage form with
respect to other books, records, files and documents (to the extent
consistent with requirements of Laws applicable to Burress Shareholders and
Burress) for not less than six years from the Closing Date and in any case
Burress shall not intentionally destroy the same without providing to
Burress Shareholders Representative a reasonable opportunity to take
possession thereof.

Dudley or his successor in his representative capacity only and not in any individual or personal capacity and, other than as set forth in _Section_ 11.1(d)(ii), shall not impose any Liability upon him which is greater than his Liability as a Burress Shareholder if he were not Burress Shareholders Representative, the Exchange Agent or Agent; however, Burress Shareholders Representative shall have Liability in his personal capacity for any distribution made by Burress Shareholders Representative from the Reserve Account in violation of _Section_ 2.2(b)(i)(B) with gross   #####

 (iv) All fees and expenses incurred by Agent in connection with this Agreement and any Transaction Document shall be paid by Burress Shareholders. However, HandE, HE-JWB and Burress shall have no Liability to Agent in respect of the foregoing and Agent shall not have any Lien on any Closing Net Proceeds to Burress Shareholders, any Supplemental Proceeds to Burress Shareholders or the Escrow Amount, and all claims of Agent against Burress Shareholders for the reimbursement of such expenses shall be junior and subordinate to all claims of HandE, HE-JWB and Burress against Burress Shareholders under this Agreement.

Representative and Burress Shareholders hereby waive any conflict of interest
that may exist as a result of such multiple representation by Woods Rogers,

Shareholders under this Agreement. Burress Shareholders Representative and
each Burress Shareholder has had the opportunity to consult independent legal
counsel in the foregoing regard and has either done so or chosen not to do

Each Director and Officer who is or was a party to any proceeding (including a proceeding by or in the right of the Corporation) shall be indemnified by the Corporation against any liability imposed upon or asserted against him (including amounts paid in settlement) arising out of conduct in his official capacity with the Corporation or otherwise by reason of the fact that he is or was such a Director or Officer or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise, except there shall be no indemnification in relation to matters as to which he shall have been finally adjudged to be liable by reason of having been guilty of (i) willful misconduct or (ii) a knowing violation of criminal law in the performance of his duty as such Director or Officer.

   ##### 

  

  

 H. Except to the extent inconsistent with this Article, terms used herein shall have the same meanings assigned them in the Indemnification Article of the Virginia Stock Corporation Act, as now in effect or hereafter amended.

the period commencing on the Closing Date and ending five (5) years3 after
the Closing Date. 

   

 2. The covenants contained herein shall be construed as if each covenant is divided into separate and distinct covenants with respect to the Restricted Business, each capacity in which Burress Shareholder is prohibited from competing and each part of the Restricted Territory. Each such covenant shall constitute separate and several covenants distinct from all other such covenants. 

  

 3. The Parties recognize that the territorial restrictions contained in this Agreement are properly required for the adequate protection of the Restricted Business and that in the event any covenant or other provision contained herein shall be deemed to be illegal, unenforceable or unreasonable by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction with respect to any part of the Restricted Territory, such covenant or provision shall not be affected with respect to any other part of the Restricted Territory, and each of the Parties agrees and submits to the reduction of said territorial restriction to such an area as said court shall deem reasonable. 

  

 4. All notices, requests, demands and other communications which are required or may be given under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given if delivered to: 

   

 (i) the Company, with a copy to HandE, in the fashion and at the addresses as specified in Section 12.1 of the Agreement and Plan of Merger; and 

   

 (ii) Burress Shareholder at the following address: _ _ _ _; 

 

or to such other address as any Party may specify as to such Party by notice
in writing to the other Party. 

   

 5. This Agreement constitutes a "Transaction Document" under the Agreement and Plan of Merger. Without limiting the generality of the forgoing, any dispute arising under or related to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated herein shall be subject to the provisions of Section 12.5 of the Agreement and Plan of Merger. 

  

 6. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of the Parties and their respective successors and assigns.

 7. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts and any Party may execute any such counterpart, each of which when executed and delivered shall be deemed to be an original and all of which counterparts taken together shall constitute but one and the same instrument. This Agreement shall become binding when one or more counterparts taken together shall have been executed and delivered by the Parties by facsimile transmission or otherwise. 

  

 8. Except for the Agreement and Plan of Merger, this Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the Parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and supersedes all prior written and oral agreements and understandings between the Parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement. This Agreement may not be amended except by a written agreement executed by all Parties. 

  

 9. Whenever possible each provision and term of this Agreement will be interpreted in a manner to be effective and valid, but if any provision or term of this Agreement is held to be prohibited by law or invalid then such provision or term will be ineffective only to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity without invalidating or affecting in any manner whatsoever the remainder of such provision or term or the remaining provisions or terms of this Agreement. If any of the covenants set forth in this Agreement are held to be unreasonable, arbitrary or against public policy, such covenants will be considered divisible with respect to scope, time and geographic area, and in such lesser scope, time and geographic area, will be effective, binding and enforceable against Burress Shareholder. 

  

 10. The rights and remedies of the Parties are cumulative and not alternative. Neither the failure nor any delay by any Party in exercising any right, power or privilege under this Agreement will operate as a waiver of such right, power or privilege, and no single or partial exercise of any such right, power or privilege will preclude any other or further exercise of such right, power or privilege or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law: (i) no claim or right arising out of this Agreement can be discharged by one Party, in whole or in part, by a waiver or renunciation of the claim or right unless in writing signed by the other Party; (ii) no waiver that may be given by a Party will be applicable except in the specific instance for which it is given; and (iii) no notice to or demand on one Party will be deemed to be a waiver of any obligation of such Party or of the right of the Party giving such notice or demand to take further action without notice or demand as provided in this Agreement. 

  

 11. In the event of any litigation between the Parties, relating to this Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover attorneys fees and costs. 

  

 12. Burress Shareholder specifically acknowledges and agrees that the remedy at law for any breach of the foregoing provisions of this Agreement will be inadequate and that HandE and the Group, in addition to any other relief available to it, shall be entitled to temporary and permanent injunctive relief without the necessity of posting a bond or proving actual damages resulting from any breach of the provisions of this Agreement. In the event that the provisions of this Agreement should ever be deemed to exceed the limitations provided by applicable law, the 

   ##### 

  

    

Parties agree that such provisions shall be reformed to the maximum extent
permitted under applicable law.
