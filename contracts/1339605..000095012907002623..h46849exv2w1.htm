such counterpart, each of which when executed and delivered shall be deemed to be an original and

Agreement shall become binding when one or more counterparts taken together shall have been
executed and delivered by the Parties by facsimile transmission or otherwise.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.&nbsp;Except for the Agreement and Plan of Merger, this Agreement constitutes the entire
agreement between the Parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and supersedes
all prior written and oral agreements and understandings between the Parties with respect to the
subject matter of this Agreement. This Agreement may not be amended except by a written agreement
executed by all Parties.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9.&nbsp;Whenever possible each provision and term of this Agreement will be interpreted in a manner
to be effective and valid, but if any provision or term of this Agreement is held to be prohibited
by law or invalid then such provision or term will be ineffective only to the extent of such
prohibition or invalidity without invalidating or affecting in any manner whatsoever the remainder
of such provision or term or the remaining provisions or terms of this Agreement. If any of the
covenants set forth in this Agreement are held to be unreasonable, arbitrary or against public
policy, such covenants will be considered divisible with respect to scope, time and geographic
area, and in such lesser scope, time and geographic area, will be effective, binding and
enforceable against Burress Shareholder.

failure nor any delay by any Party in exercising any right, power or privilege under this Agreement
will operate as a waiver of such right, power or privilege, and no single or partial exercise of
any such right, power or privilege will preclude any other or further exercise of such right, power
or privilege or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. To the maximum extent
permitted by applicable law: (i)&nbsp;no claim or right arising out of this Agreement can be discharged
by one Party, in whole or in part, by a waiver or renunciation of the claim or right unless in
writing signed by the other Party; (ii)&nbsp;no waiver that may be given by a Party will be applicable
except in the specific instance for which it is given; and (iii)&nbsp;no notice to or demand on one
Party will be deemed to be a waiver of any obligation of such Party or of the right of the Party
giving such notice or demand to take further action without notice or demand as provided in this
Agreement.
