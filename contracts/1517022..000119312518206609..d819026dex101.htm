based on contract, tort or any other theory, whether brought by a third party
or by any party hereto, and regardless of whether any Investor Party is a
party thereto, with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Conversion Agreement, the Existing Notes or the Indenture (except to the
extent such action is based upon a breach of such Investor Partys
representations, warranties or covenants under this Conversion Agreement or
any agreements or understandings such Investor Party may have with any such
shareholder or any violations by such Investor Party of state or federal
securities laws or any conduct by such Investor Party which constitutes fraud,

brought against any Investor Party in respect of which indemnity may be sought
pursuant to this Conversion Agreement, such Investor Party shall promptly
notify the Company in writing, and the Company shall have the right to assume
the defense thereof with counsel of its own choosing reasonably acceptable to
the Investor Party. Any Investor Party shall have the right to employ separate

after a reasonable period of time to assume such defense and to employ
counsel (not to exceed 90 days) or (iii) in such action there is a conflict or

incurred. The Company will not be liable to any Investor Party under this
Conversion Agreement (y) for any settlement by an Investor Party

 



10  effected without the Companys prior written consent, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed; _provided_ , _however_ , that if at any time
an Investor Party shall have requested the Company to reimburse such Investor
Party for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by this Section 4.2,
the Company agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of any
proceeding effected without their written consent if (i) such settlement is
entered into more than 30 days after receipt by such Investor Party of the
aforesaid request, (ii) the Company shall have received notice of the terms of
such settlement at least ten (10) days prior to such settlement being entered
into, and (iii) the Company shall not have reimbursed the Investor Party in
accordance with such request; or (z) to the extent, but only to the extent,
that a loss, claim, damage or liability is attributable to any Investor
Partys breach of any of the representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements made by such Investor Party in this Conversion Agreement or any
violations by such Investor Party of state or federal securities laws or any
conduct by such Investor Party which constitutes fraud, gross negligence,
willful misconduct or malfeasance. The Company shall not, without the prior
written consent of the Investor, not to be unreasonably withheld, effect any
settlement, compromise or consent to the entry of judgment in any pending or
threatened action, suit or proceeding in respect of which any Investor Party
is or could have been a party and indemnity was or could have been sought
hereunder by such Investor Party, unless such settlement, compromise or
consent (i) includes an unconditional release of such Investor Party from all
liability on claims that are the subject matter of such action, suit or
proceeding and (ii) does not include any statements as to or any findings of
fault, culpability or failure to act by or on behalf of any Investor Party.
The indemnification required by this Section 4.1 shall be made by periodic
payments of the amount thereof during the course of the investigation
or defense, as and when bills are received or are incurred. The indemnity
agreements contained herein shall be in addition to any cause of action or
similar right of any Investor Party against the Company or others and any
liabilities the Company may be subject to pursuant to law. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Conversion Agreement, in no event shall the
Company have any liability to any Investor Party under this Section 4.1 or
otherwise for any liability of any Investor Party arising under Section 16 of
the Exchange Act.

4.2 _[Reserved]_.

 

4.3 _[Reserved]_.

or reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the intention or expectation

exempt from the application of Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act pursuant to
Rule 16b-3(d) under the Exchange Act and (b) the disposition by the Investor
of the Common Stock in the Merger will be exempt from the application of
Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act pursuant to Rule 16b-3(e) under the Exchange
Act.

4.5 _Confidentiality_. The parties shall not disclose the existence of
this Conversion Agreement or the Conversion Transactions prior to public
disclosure in an SEC report (other than to its directors and to its employees,
agents and attorneys who have a need to know such information, to the other
parties to the Merger Agreement and their directors and to their employees,
agents and attorneys who have a need to know such information, and except in
an approved press release as contemplated by the last sentence of this
paragraph) without the prior written consent of the other party, except as
may be required by applicable law or pursuant to the

 



11  order of any court or administrative agency in any pending legal, judicial
or administrative proceeding, or otherwise as required by compulsory legal
process or to the extent requested or required by governmental and/or
regulatory authorities, including pursuant to Investors reporting obligations
under Sections 13 and 16 of the Exchange Act. Any proposed press release or
disclosure in an SEC report relating to the initial disclosure of entering
into this Conversion Agreement and the Conversion Transactions shall be
subject to the prior written approval (including by email) of the parties
hereto (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed)
(and nothing in this provision shall require either party to breach any
applicable securities laws).

4.6 _Termination of the Prior Registration Rights Agreement_. As provided
in Section 5.6 of that certain Registration Rights Agreement, dated as of May
9, 2018, by and between the Company and the Investor, the parties hereto agree
that such Registration Rights Agreement shall be terminated and be of no
further force and effect as of and conditioned upon the consummation of the
Merger in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement without any
further actions or writings of the parties hereto. 

4.7 _Conduct Prior to Closing_. From the date of this Conversion Agreement
until the Closing, except as consented to by the Investor in writing, the
Company shall not enter into or otherwise approve (or agree to enter into or
approve) any amendments, waivers, side letters or similar agreements, or other
modifications by the Company or Akebia that, in any material respect, amend,
waive or alter the terms of the Merger Agreement in a manner adverse to the
Investor without the consent of the Investor).

 

4.8 _Conversion Null and Void; Cooperation_. If, for any reason, the
Closing hereunder occurs and the Merger is not consummated on such date (or
such later date as may be required due to an inability to satisfy Section
6.02(d) of the Merger Agreement despite efforts by the parties hereto to
prevent any such delay), the Existing Notes Conversion and the issuance of
the Equity Interests shall be null and void and this Conversion Agreement
shall be of no further force or effect (other than as provided in Section
5.10), and the parties hereto agree to undertake any necessary actions to
ensure that the Existing Notes Conversion and the issuance of the Equity
Interests be null and void. In furtherance of the foregoing, the Company and
the Investor agree to, promptly after the date hereof, and in any event prior
to the Closing, amend the Indenture to provide that (i) the Conversion Notice
to be delivered hereunder shall be revocable but only in the event that the
Merger is not consummated on the same day as the Closing hereunder (or such
later date as may be required due to an inability to satisfy Section 6.02(d)
of the Merger Agreement despite efforts by the parties hereto to prevent any
such delay); and (ii) the Company or the Conversion Agent shall provide
evidence of delivery of the Conversion Shares to the Investor immediately
prior to the Effective Time (the " _Indenture Amendment_ "). The Investor
agrees to execute and deliver such other documents and agreements not
specifically set forth in this Conversion Agreement as reasonably requested
by the Company, the Conversion Agent, the Trustee or the Companys transfer
agent to effectuate the conversion of the Existing Notes, the issuance and
delivery of the Equity Interests in accordance with the terms of this
Conversion Agreement and the discharge of the Indenture in connection
herewith. As promptly as practicable after the date hereof, the Investor and
the Company shall cooperate with each other and with the Trustee to agree upon
what documentation or evidence will be satisfactory to the Investor to
confirm delivery of the Equity Interests immediately prior to the Effective
Time.

 



12 4.9 _Regulatory Efforts_.

 

(a) The Company and the Investor shall each use its reasonable best efforts
to take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate actions and to do, or cause to
be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law or
otherwise to consummate and make effective the Conversion Transactions. As
promptly as practicable (and no later than five (5) Business Days) after the
date of this Agreement, each of the Company and the Investor (i) will file
with the U.S. Department of Justice and the U.S. Federal Trade Commission
premerger notification and report forms under and in compliance with the HSR
Act with respect to the Conversion Transactions in the manner determined by
counsel to the Investor in consultation with counsel to the Company (the "
_HSR Act Filings_ "). The parties shall cooperate in the timely preparation
and submission of the HSR Act Filings, including furnishing to the other party
or its counsel information required for any necessary filing or other
application in connection with the Conversion Transactions.

 

(b) Each of the Company and the Investor hereby covenants and agrees to use
its reasonable best efforts to secure, and not to take any action that will
have the effect of delaying, impairing or impeding, the early termination or
expiration of any waiting periods under the HSR Act for the Conversion
Transactions. The parties shall each cooperate reasonably with one another in
connection with resolving any inquiry or investigation by any governmental
authority relating to their respective HSR Act Filings or the Conversion
Transactions. Without limiting the foregoing, each party shall, subject to
applicable law, rule or regulation (including that of a national securities
exchange or self-regulatory organization), (i) promptly inform the other party
of any written or oral communication received from any governmental
authority relating to its HSR Act Filing or the transactions contemplated
hereby (and if in writing, furnish counsel to the other party with a copy of
such communication); (ii) use its reasonable best efforts to respond as
promptly as practicable to any request from any governmental authority for
information, documents or other materials in connection with the review of the
HSR Filings or the Conversion Transactions; (iii) provide to counsel for the
other party, and permit counsel for the other party to review and comment in
advance of submission, all proposed correspondence, filings and written
communications to any governmental authority with respect to the Conversion
Transactions; and (iv) not participate in any substantive meeting or
discussion with any governmental authority in respect of investigation or
inquiry concerning the Conversion Transactions unless it consults with the
other party in advance and, except as prohibited by applicable Law or
governmental authority, gives the other party and/or its counsel the
opportunity to attend and participate thereat.

any right hereunder in any manner impair the exercise of any such right. In
addition, Baupost may not amend or waive, in any material respect, any of the

for the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and
permitted assigns and is not for the benefit of, nor may any provision hereof

Investor in this Conversion Agreement.

5.9 _Governing Law_. All questions concerning the construction, validity,
enforcement and interpretation of this Conversion Agreement shall be governed
by and construed and enforced in accordance with the internal laws of the

governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware
without giving effect to the principles of conflicts of law thereof. Each
party agrees that all legal proceedings concerning the interpretations,
enforcement and defense of the transactions contemplated by this Conversion
Agreement (whether brought against a party hereto or its respective
affiliates, directors, officers, stockholders, partners, members, employees or
agents) shall be commenced exclusively in the state and federal courts sitting
in the City of New York. Each party hereby irrevocably submits to the
exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts sitting in the City of
New York, Borough of Manhattan for the adjudication of any dispute hereunder
or in connection herewith or with any transaction contemplated hereby or
discussed herein, and hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert in
any suit, action or proceeding, any claim that it is not personally subject to
the jurisdiction of any such court, that such suit, action or proceeding is
improper or that any such court is an inconvenient venue for such proceeding.
Each party hereby irrevocably waives personal service of process and consents
to process being served in any such suit, action or proceeding by mailing a
copy thereof via registered or certified mail or overnight delivery (with
evidence of delivery) to such party at the address in effect for notices to it
under this Conversion Agreement and agrees that such service shall constitute
good and sufficient service of process and notice thereof. Nothing contained
herein shall be deemed to limit in any way any right to serve process in any
other manner permitted by law. If either party shall commence an action, suit
or proceeding to enforce any provisions of this Conversion Agreement, then,
in addition to the obligations of the Company under Section 4.2, the
prevailing party in such action, suit or proceeding shall be reimbursed by the
other party for its reasonable attorneys fees and other costs and expenses
incurred in the investigation, preparation and prosecution of such action or
proceeding.

 



15 5.10 _Survival_. Article I and Sections 3.1, 4.1, 4.5, 5.1, 5.3, 5.4 and
5.9 shall survive the Closing and the delivery of the Conversion Shares and
the Additional Shares.

 

5.11 _Execution_. This Conversion Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, all of which when taken together shall be considered one and
the same agreement and shall become effective when counterparts have been
signed by each party and delivered to each other party, it being understood
that the parties need not sign the same counterpart. In the event that any
signature is delivered by facsimile transmission or by e-mail delivery of a
".pdf" format data file, such signature shall create a valid and binding
obligation of the party executing (or on whose behalf such signature is
executed) with the same force and effect as if such facsimile or ".pdf"
signature page were an original thereof.

 

5.12 _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction of
this Conversion Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be
invalid, illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms,
provisions, covenants and restrictions set forth herein shall remain in full
force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated,
and the parties hereto shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to find
and employ an alternative means to achieve the same or substantially the same
result as that contemplated by such term, provision, covenant or
restriction. It is hereby stipulated and declared to be the intention of the
parties that they would have executed the remaining terms, provisions,
covenants and restrictions without including any of such that may be hereafter
declared invalid, illegal, void or unenforceable.

5.13 _Remedies_. In addition to being entitled to exercise all rights
provided herein or granted by law, including recovery of damages, the parties
hereto will be entitled to specific performance under this Conversion
Agreement. The parties agree that monetary damages may not be adequate
compensation for any loss incurred by the Investor or the Company by reason
of any breach (or threatened breach) of any obligations contained in this
Conversion Agreement and hereby agree to waive and not to assert in any action
for specific performance of any such obligation the defense that a remedy at
law would be adequate.

5.14 _Saturdays, Sundays, Holidays, etc_. If the last or appointed day
for the taking of any action or the expiration of any right required or
granted herein shall not be a Business Day, then such action may be taken or
such right may be exercised on the next succeeding Business Day.

effect that any ambiguities are to be resolved against the drafting party

any amendments thereto. In addition, each and every reference to shares of
Common Stock in this Conversion Agreement shall be subject to adjustment for
reverse and forward stock splits, stock dividends, stock combinations and
other similar transactions of the shares of Common Stock that occur after the

Keryx, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub ceased and Keryx
continues as the surviving corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of the
Company (the " _Merger_ ").

 

WHEREAS, pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth in the Notes
Conversion Agreement, dated as of June 28, 2018, among the Company, Keryx and
the Investor (the " _Conversion Agreement_ "), the Investor has agreed to
surrender the Existing Notes (as defined in the Conversion Agreement) for
conversion in accordance with the terms of the governing indenture
(as amended), in a manner that creates a Conversion Date (as defined in such
indenture) in respect of the Existing Notes (the " _Existing Notes Conversion_
"), prior to the Effective Time (as defined in the Merger Agreement) of the
Merger, and conditioned upon the issuance to the Investor immediately prior
to the Effective Time of 4,000,000 shares of common stock of Keryx (the "

5 Section 3.1. _Demand Registration_.

 

Section 3.1.1. _Request for Demand Registration_.

 



     | (a) | At any time after the date hereof, the Investors shall have
the right to make a written request from time to time (a " _Demand
Registration Request_ ") to the Company for Registration of all or part of
the Registrable Securities held by such Investors. Any such Registration
pursuant to a Demand Registration Request shall hereinafter be referred to as
a " _Demand Registration_." 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (b) | Each Demand Registration Request shall specify (x) the kind
and aggregate amount of Registrable Securities to be registered, and (y) the
intended method or methods of disposition thereof. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (c) | Upon receipt of a Demand Registration Request, the Company
shall as promptly as practicable file a Registration Statement (a " _Demand
Registration Statement_ ") relating to such Demand Registration, and use its
reasonable best efforts to cause such Demand Registration Statement to be
promptly declared effective under the Securities Act. 
---|---|--- 
 

Section 3.1.2. _Limitation on Demand Registrations_. The Company shall not
be obligated to take any action to effect any Demand Registration if a Demand
Registration pursuant to Section 3.1 was declared effective or an Underwritten
Shelf Takedown pursuant to Section 3.2 was consummated within the preceding
one hundred eighty (180) days (unless otherwise consented to by the Company).

Section 3.1.3. _Demand Withdrawal_. The Investors may withdraw all or any
portion of its Registrable Securities included in a Demand Registration from
such Demand Registration at any time prior to the effectiveness of the
applicable Demand Registration Statement. Upon receipt of a notice to such
effect from with respect to all of the Registrable Securities included in such
Demand Registration, the Company shall cease all efforts to secure
effectiveness of the applicable Demand Registration Statement and such Demand
Registration shall not count as such pursuant to Section 3.1.2 above.

 

Section 3.1.4. _Effective_ _Registration_. The Company shall use
reasonable best efforts to cause the Demand Registration Statement to become
effective and remain effective for not less than one hundred eighty (180) days
(or such shorter period as will terminate when all Registrable Securities
covered by such Demand Registration Statement have been sold or withdrawn),
or, if such Demand Registration Statement relates to an Underwritten Public
Offering, such longer period as in the opinion of counsel for the underwriter
or underwriters a Prospectus is required by law to be delivered in connection
with sales of Registrable Securities by an underwriter or dealer.

 

Section 3.1.5. _Delay in Filing; Suspension of_ _Registration_. If the
filing, initial effectiveness or continued use of a Demand Registration
Statement at any time would require the Company to make an Adverse Disclosure,
the Company may, upon giving prompt written notice of such action to the
Holders, delay the filing or initial effectiveness of, or suspend use of, the
Demand Registration Statement (a " _Demand Suspension_ ");

 



6   _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not be permitted to
exercise a Demand Suspension more than once during any twelve (12)-month
period or for a period exceeding sixty (60) days. In the case of a Demand
Suspension, the Holders agree to suspend use of the applicable Prospectus in
connection with any sale or purchase, or offer to sell or purchase,
Registrable Securities, upon receipt of the notice referred to above. The
Company shall immediately notify the Holders in writing upon the termination
of any Demand Suspension, amend or supplement the Prospectus, if necessary, so
it does not contain any untrue statement or omission and furnish to the
Holders such numbers of copies of the Prospectus as so amended or
supplemented as the Holders may reasonably request. The Company shall, if
necessary, supplement or amend the Demand Registration Statement, if required
by the registration form used by the Company for the Demand Registration or
by the instructions applicable to such registration form or by the Securities
Act or the rules or regulations promulgated thereunder or as may reasonably be
requested by the Investors.

 

Section 3.1.6. _Priority of Securities Registered Pursuant to_ _Demand
Registrations_. If the managing underwriter or underwriters of a proposed
Underwritten Public Offering of the Registrable Securities included in a
Demand Registration advise the Company in writing that, in its or their
opinion, the number of securities requested to be included in such Demand
Registration exceeds the number that can be sold in such offering without
being likely to have an adverse effect on the price, timing or distribution of
the securities offered or the market for the securities offered, then the
securities to be included in such Registration shall be, in the case of any
Demand Registration, (x) first, allocated to each Holder that has requested to
participate in such Demand Registration an amount equal to the lesser of (i)
the number of such Registrable Securities requested to be registered or sold
by such Holders, and (ii) a number of such shares equal to such Holders Pro
Rata Portion, and (y) second, and only if all the securities referred to in
clause (x) have been included, the number of other securities that, in the
opinion of such managing underwriter or underwriters can be sold without
having such adverse effect.

 

Section 3.1.7. _Resale Rights_. In the event that the Investor requests to
participate in a Registration pursuant to this Section 3.1 in connection with
a distribution of Registrable Securities to its partners or members, the
Registration shall provide for resale by such partners or members, if
requested by such Investor.

 

Section 3.2. _Shelf Registration_.

 

Section 3.2.1. _Request for Shelf Registration_.

 



     | (a) | Upon the written request of the Investors from time to time
(a " _Shelf Registration Request_ "), the Company shall promptly file with the
SEC a shelf Registration Statement pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities
Act (" _Shelf Registration Statement_ ") relating to the offer and sale of
Registrable Securities by any Holders thereof from time to time in accordance
with the methods of distribution elected by such Holders, and the Company
shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause such Shelf Registration
Statement to promptly become effective under the Securities Act. Any such
Registration pursuant to a Shelf Registration Request shall hereinafter be
referred to as a " _Shelf Registration_." 
---|---|--- 
 



7 Company is a WKSI, then the Shelf Registration Request may request
Registration of an unspecified amount of Registrable Securities to be sold by
unspecified Holders. If on the date of the Shelf Registration Request the
Company is not a WKSI, then the Shelf Registration Request shall specify the
aggregate amount of Registrable Securities to be registered. The Company shall
provide to the Investors the information necessary to determine the Companys
status as a WKSI upon request. 
---|---|--- 
 

Section 3.2.2. _Continued Effectiveness_. The Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to keep such Shelf Registration Statement
continuously effective under the Securities Act in order to permit the
Prospectus forming part of the Shelf Registration Statement to be usable by
the Holders until the earlier of: (i) the date as of which all Registrable
Securities have been sold pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement or
another Registration Statement filed under the Securities Act (but in no event
prior to the applicable period referred to in Section 4(a)(3) of
the Securities Act and Rule 174 thereunder); and (ii) the date as of which no
Holder holds Registrable Securities (such period of effectiveness, the "
_Shelf Period_ "). Subject to Section 3.2.3, the Company shall be deemed not
to have used its reasonable best efforts to keep the Shelf Registration
Statement effective during the Shelf Period if the Company voluntarily takes
any action or omits to take any action that would result in the Holders of the
Registrable Securities covered thereby not being able to offer and sell any
Registrable Securities pursuant to such Shelf Registration Statement during
the Shelf Period, unless such action or omission is required by applicable
law.

 

Section 3.2.3. _Suspension of_ _Registration_. If the continued use of
such Shelf Registration Statement at any time would require the Company to
make an Adverse Disclosure, the Company may, upon giving prompt written notice
of such action to the Holders, suspend use of the Shelf Registration Statement
(a " _Shelf Suspension_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall
not be permitted to exercise a Shelf Suspension more than one time during any
twelve (12)-month period or for a period exceeding sixty (60) days. In the
case of a Shelf Suspension, the Holders agree to suspend use of the
applicable Prospectus in connection with any sale or purchase of, or offer to
sell or purchase, Registrable Securities, upon receipt of the notice referred
to above. The Company shall immediately notify the Holders in writing upon
the termination of any Shelf Suspension, amend or supplement the Prospectus,
if necessary, so it does not contain any untrue statement or omission and
furnish to the Holders such numbers of copies of the Prospectus as so amended
or supplemented as the Holders may reasonably request. The Company shall, if
necessary, supplement or amend the Shelf Registration Statement, if required
by the registration form used by the Company for the Shelf Registration
Statement or by the instructions applicable to such registration form or by
the Securities Act or the rules or regulations promulgated thereunder or as
may reasonably be requested by the Holders of a majority of Registrable
Securities that are included in such Shelf Registration Statement.

 



8 Section 3.2.4. _Shelf Takedown_.

 



     | (a) | At any time the Company has an effective Shelf Registration
Statement with respect to a Holders Registrable Securities, by notice to the
Company specifying the intended method or methods of disposition thereof, the
Investors may make a written request (a " _Shelf Takedown Request_ ") to the
Company to effect a Public Offering, including an Underwritten Shelf Takedown,
of all or a portion of the such Holders Registrable Securities that may be
registered under such Shelf Registration Statement, and as soon as practicable
the Company shall amend or supplement the Shelf Registration Statement as
necessary for such purpose. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (b) | All determinations as to whether to complete any
Underwritten Shelf Takedown and as to the timing, manner, price and other
terms of any Underwritten Shelf Takedown contemplated by this Section 3.2.4
shall be determined by the participating Investors. 
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | The Company shall not be obligated to take any action to
effect any Underwritten Shelf Takedown if a Demand Registration pursuant to
Section 3.1 was declared effective or an Underwritten Shelf Takedown pursuant
to Section 3.2 was consummated within the preceding one hundred eighty (180)
days (unless otherwise consented to by the Company). 
---|---|--- 
 

Section 3.2.5. _Priority of Securities Sold Pursuant to Shelf Takedowns_.
If the managing underwriter or underwriters of a proposed Underwritten Shelf
Takedown pursuant to Section 3.2.4 advise the Company in writing that, in its
or their opinion, the number of securities requested to be included in the
proposed Underwritten Shelf Takedown exceeds the number that can be sold in
such Underwritten Shelf Takedown without being likely to have an adverse
effect on the price, timing or distribution of the securities offered or the
market for the securities offered, the number of Registrable Securities to be
included in such offering shall be (x) first, allocated to each Holder that
has requested to participate in such Underwritten Shelf Takedown an amount
equal to the lesser of (i) the number of such Registrable Securities
requested to be registered or sold by such Holder, and (ii) a number of such
shares equal to such Holders Pro Rata Portion, and (y) second, and only if
all the securities referred to in clause (x) have been included, the number
of other securities that, in the opinion of such managing underwriter or
underwriters can be sold without having such adverse effect.

 

Section 3.2.6. _Resale Rights_. In the event that an Investor elects to
request a Registration pursuant to this Section 3.2 in connection with a
distribution of Registrable Securities to its partners or members, the
Registration shall provide for resale by such partners or members, if
requested by such Investor.

 

Section 3.3. _Piggyback Registration_.

 

Section 3.3.1. _Participation_. If the Company at any time proposes to
file a Registration Statement under the Securities Act or to conduct a Public
Offering with

 



9  respect to any offering of its equity securities for its own account or for
the account of any other Persons (other than (i) a Registration under Sections
3.1 or 3.2, (ii) a Registration on Form S-4 or Form S-8 or any successor form
to such forms or (iii) a Registration of securities solely relating to an
offering and sale to employees or directors of the Company or its
subsidiaries pursuant to any employee stock plan or other employee benefit
plan arrangement), then, as soon as practicable (but in no event less than ten
(10) Business Days prior to the proposed date of filing of such Registration
Statement or, in the case of a Public Offering under a Shelf Registration
Statement, the anticipated pricing or trade date), the Company shall give
written notice (a " _Piggyback Notice_ ") of such proposed filing or Public
Offering to all Holders, and such Piggyback Notice shall offer the Holder the
opportunity to register under such Registration Statement, or to sell in such
Public Offering, such number of Registrable Securities as each such Holder
may request in writing (a " _Piggyback Registration_ "). Subject to Section
3.3.2, the Company shall include in such Registration Statement or in such
Public Offering as applicable, all such Registrable Securities that are
requested to be included therein within five (5) Business Days after the
receipt by such Holder of any such notice; _provided_ , _however_ , that if at
any time after giving written notice of its intention to register or sell any
securities and prior to the effective date of the Registration Statement
filed in connection with such Registration, or the pricing or trade date of a
Public Offering under a Shelf Registration Statement, the Company determines
for any reason not to register or sell or to delay the Registration or sale
of such securities, the Company shall give written notice of such
determination to each Holder and, thereupon, (i) in the case of a
determination not to register or sell, shall be relieved of its obligation to
register or sell any Registrable Securities in connection with such
Registration or Public Offering (but not from its obligation to pay the
Registration Expenses in connection therewith), without prejudice, however, to
the rights of any Holder entitled to request that such Registration or sale
be effected as a Demand Registration under Section 3.1 or an Underwritten
Shelf Takedown under Section 3.2, as the case may be, and (ii) in the case of
a determination to delay Registration or sale, in the absence of a request
for a Demand Registration or an Underwritten Shelf Takedown, as the case may
be, shall be permitted to delay registering or selling any Registrable
Securities, for the same period as the delay in registering or selling such
other securities. Any Holder shall have the right to withdraw all or part of
its request for inclusion of its Registrable Securities in a Piggyback
Registration by giving written notice to the Company of its request
to withdraw.

Section 3.3.2. _Priority of_ _Piggyback Registration_. If the
managing underwriter or underwriters of any proposed offering of Registrable
Securities included in a Piggyback Registration informs the Company and the
participating Holders in writing that, in its or their opinion, the number of
securities that such Holders and any other Persons intend to include in such
offering exceeds the number that can be sold in such offering without being
likely to have a significant adverse effect on the price, timing or
distribution of the securities offered or the market for the securities
offered, then the securities to be included in such Registration shall be (i)
first, one hundred percent (100%) of the securities that the Company proposes
to sell, and (ii) second, and only if all the securities referred to in
clause (i) have been included, the number of Registrable Securities requested
to be sold by such Holder that, in the opinion of such managing underwriter or
underwriters, can be sold without having such adverse effect, with
such number to be allocated among the Holders that have requested to
participate in such Registration based on an amount equal to the

 



10  lesser of (x) the number of such Registrable Securities requested to be sold
by such Holder, and (y) a number of such shares equal to such Holders Pro
Rata Portion, and (iii) third, and only if all of the Registrable Securities
referred to in clause (ii) have been included in such Registration, any other
securities eligible for inclusion in such Registration.

 

Section 3.3.3. _No Effect on Other Registrations_. No Registration of
Registrable Securities effected pursuant to a request under this Section 3.3
shall be deemed to have been effected pursuant to Sections 3.1 and 3.2 or
shall relieve the Company of its obligations under Sections 3.1 and 3.2.

 

Section 3.4. _Lock-Up Agreements_. In connection with each Registration
or sale of Registrable Securities pursuant to Section 3.1, 3.2 or 3.3
conducted as an Underwritten Public Offering, the Company agrees, if
requested, to cause its directors and officers to become bound by and to
execute and deliver a lock-up agreement with the underwriter(s) of such
Underwritten Public Offering restricting such directors and officers right
to (a) Transfer, directly or indirectly, any equity securities of the Company
held by such directors and officers or (b) enter into any swap or other
arrangement that transfers to another any of the economic consequences of
ownership of such securities during the period commencing on the date of the
final Prospectus relating to the Underwritten Public Offering and ending on
the date specified by the underwriters (such period not to exceed ninety (90)
days in the case of any registration or sale, plus such additional period as
may be requested by the Company or an underwriter to accommodate regulatory
restrictions on the publication or other distribution of research reports and
analyst recommendations and opinions, if applicable). The terms of such lock-
up agreements shall be negotiated among the Investors, the Company and the
underwriters and shall include customary carve-outs from the restrictions on
Transfer set forth therein.

representations and warranties of the Company in any applicable underwriting
agreement cease to be true and correct in all material respects and (e) of the
receipt by the Company of any notification with respect to the suspension of

each seller of Registrable Securities as to which any Registration or sale is
being effected to furnish to the Company such information regarding the
distribution of such securities and such other information relating to such
Holder and its ownership of Registrable Securities as the Company may from
time to time reasonably request in writing and the Company may exclude from
such Registration or sale the Registrable Securities of any such Holder who
unreasonably fails to furnish such information within a reasonable time after
receiving such request. Each Holder agrees to furnish such information to the
Company and to cooperate with the Company as reasonably necessary to enable
the Company to comply with the provisions of this Agreement. 

Section 3.5.3. _Discontinuing Registration_. Each Holder agrees that, upon
receipt of any notice from the Company of the happening of any event of the
kind described in Section 3.5.1(d), such Holder will discontinue disposition
of Registrable Securities pursuant to such Registration Statement until such
Holders receipt of the copies of the supplemented or amended Prospectus
contemplated by Section 3.5.1(d), or until such

 



16  Holder is advised in writing by the Company that the use of the Prospectus
may be resumed, and has received copies of any additional or supplemental
filings that are incorporated by reference in the Prospectus, or any
amendments or supplements thereto, and if so directed by the Company, such
Holder shall deliver to the Company (at the Companys expense) all copies,
other than permanent file copies then in such Holders possession, of the
Prospectus covering such Registrable Securities current at the time of receipt
of such notice. In the event the Company shall give any such notice, the
period during which the applicable Registration Statement is required to be

period from and including the date of the giving of such notice to and
including the date when each seller of Registrable Securities covered by such
Registration Statement either receives the copies of the supplemented or
amended Prospectus contemplated by Section 3.5.1(d) or is advised in writing

Section 3.6. _Underwritten Offerings_.

 

Section 3.6.1. _Shelf and_ _Demand Registrations_. If requested by the
underwriters for any Underwritten Public Offering, pursuant to a Registration
or sale under Sections 3.1 or 3.2, the Company shall enter into an
underwriting agreement with such underwriters, such agreement to be reasonably
satisfactory in substance and form to each of the Company, the Investors and
the underwriters, and to contain such representations and warranties by the
Company and such other terms as are generally prevailing in agreements of that
type, including indemnities no less favorable to the recipient thereof than
those provided in Section 3.9 of this Agreement. The Holders of the
Registrable Securities proposed to be distributed by such underwriters shall
cooperate with the Company in the negotiation of the underwriting
agreement and shall give consideration to the reasonable suggestions of the
Company regarding the form thereof, and such Holders shall complete and
execute all questionnaires, powers of attorney and other documents reasonably
requested by the underwriters and required under the terms of such
underwriting arrangements. Any such Holder shall not be required to make any
representations or warranties to or agreements with the Company or the
underwriters other than representations, warranties or agreements regarding
such Holder, such Holders title to the Registrable Securities, such Holders
intended method of distribution and any other representations to be made by
the Holder as are generally prevailing in agreements of that type, and
the aggregate amount of the liability of such Holder under such agreement
shall not exceed such Holders proceeds from the sale of its Registrable
Securities in the offering, net of underwriting discounts and commissions but
before expenses.

 

Section 3.6.2. _Piggyback Registrations_. If the Company proposes to
register or sell any of its securities under the Securities Act as
contemplated by Section 3.3 and such securities are to be distributed through
one or more underwriters, the Company shall, if requested by any Holder
pursuant to Section 3.3 and, subject to the provisions of Section 3.3.2, use
its reasonable best efforts to arrange for such underwriters to include on the
same terms and conditions that apply to the other sellers in such Registration
or sale all the Registrable Securities to be offered and sold by such Holder
among the securities of the Company to be distributed by such underwriters in
such Registration or sale. The Holders of Registrable Securities to be
distributed by such underwriters shall be parties to the 

 



17  underwriting agreement between the Company and such underwriters and shall
complete and execute all questionnaires, powers of attorney and other
documents reasonably requested by the underwriters and required under the
terms of such underwriting arrangements. Any such Holder shall not be required
to make any representations or warranties to or agreements with the Company or
the underwriters other than representations, warranties or agreements
regarding such Holder, such Holders title to the Registrable Securities, such
Holders intended method of distribution and any other representations to be
made by the Holder as are generally prevailing in agreements of that type,
and the aggregate amount of the liability of such Holder shall not exceed such
Holders proceeds from the sale of its Registrable Securities in the offering,
net of underwriting discounts and commissions but before expenses.

 

Section 3.6.3. _Selection of Underwriters; Selection of Counsel_. In the
case of an Underwritten Public Offering under Sections 3.1 or 3.2, the
managing underwriter or underwriters to administer the offering shall be
determined by the Investors; _provided_ that such underwriter or underwriters
shall be reasonably acceptable to the Company. In the case of an Underwritten
Public Offering under Section 3.3, the managing underwriter or underwriters to
administer the offering shall be determined by the Company; _provided_ that
such underwriter or underwriters shall be reasonably acceptable to the
Investor. In the case of an Underwritten Public Offering under Sections 3.1,
3.2 or 3.3, counsel to the Holders shall be selected by the Investors.

 

Section 3.7. _No Inconsistent Agreements; Additional Rights_. Neither the
Company nor any of its subsidiaries shall hereafter enter into, and neither
the Company nor any of its subsidiaries is currently a party to, any agreement
with respect to its securities that is inconsistent with the rights granted to
the Holders by this Agreement. Neither the Company nor any of its
subsidiaries shall enter into any agreement granting registration or similar
rights to any Person, and the Company hereby represents and warrants that, as
of the date hereof, no registration or similar rights have been granted to
any other Person other than pursuant to this Agreement.

Section 3.8. _Registration Expenses_. All expenses incident to the
Companys performance of or compliance with this Agreement shall be paid by
the Company, including (i) all registration and filing fees, and any other
fees and expenses associated with filings required to be made with the SEC or
FINRA, (ii) all fees and expenses in connection with compliance with any
securities or "Blue Sky" laws (including reasonable fees and disbursements of
counsel for the underwriters in connection with blue sky qualifications

processing, messenger, telephone, facsimile and delivery expenses (including
expenses of printing certificates for the Registrable Securities in a form
eligible for deposit with The Depository Trust Company and of printing

of all independent certified public accountants or independent auditors of the
Company and any subsidiaries of the Company (including the expenses of any
special audit and comfort letters required by or incident to such
performance), (v) Securities Act liability insurance or similar insurance if
the Company so desires or the underwriters so require in accordance with
then-customary underwriting practice, (vi) all fees and expenses incurred in
connection with the listing of the Registrable Securities on any securities

legal counsel for the selling Holders, (ix) any reasonable fees and
disbursements

Underwritten Public Offering, including the reasonable out-of-pocket expenses
of the Holders and underwriters, if so requested. All such expenses are
referred to herein as " _Registration Expenses_ ". The Company shall not be
required to pay any fees and disbursements to underwriters not customarily
paid by the issuers of securities in an offering similar to the applicable
offering, including underwriting discounts and commissions and transfer
taxes, if any, attributable to the sale of Registrable Securities.

 

Section 3.9. _Indemnification_.

 

Section 3.9.1. _Indemnification by the_ _Company_. The Company shall
indemnify and hold harmless, to the full extent permitted by law, each
Holder, each shareholder, member, limited or general partner of such Holder,
each shareholder, member, limited or general partner of each such shareholder,
member, limited or general partner, each of their respective Affiliates,
officers, directors, shareholders, employees, advisors, and agents and each
Person who controls (within the meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange
Act) such Persons and each of their respective Representatives from and
against any and all losses, penalties, judgments, suits, costs, claims,
damages, liabilities and expenses, joint or several (including reasonable
costs of investigation and legal expenses and any indemnity and contribution
payments made to underwriters ) (each, a " _Loss_ " and collectively "
_Losses_ ") arising out of or based upon (i) any untrue or alleged untrue
statement of a material fact contained in any Registration Statement under
which such Registrable Securities are registered or sold under the Securities
Act (including any final, preliminary or summary Prospectus contained therein
or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto or any documents incorporated
by reference therein) or any other disclosure document produced by or on
behalf of the Company or any of its subsidiaries including, without limitation
any report and other document filed under the Exchange Act and any preliminary
or final offering memorandum prepared in connection with any Rule 144A or
Regulation S offering pursuant to Section 3.10 of this Agreement, (ii) any
omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein (in the case of a
Prospectus or preliminary Prospectus, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made) not misleading or (iii) any violation or alleged
violation by the Company or any of its subsidiaries of any federal, state,
foreign or common law rule or regulation applicable to the Company or any of
its subsidiaries and relating to action or inaction in connection with any
such registration, disclosure document or other document or report; _provided_
, that no selling Holder shall be entitled to indemnification pursuant to
this Section 3.9.1 in respect of any untrue statement or omission contained in
any information relating to such seller Holder furnished in writing by such
selling Holder to the Company specifically for inclusion in a Registration
Statement and used by the Company in conformity therewith (such information "
_Selling Stockholder Information_ "). This indemnity shall be in addition to
any liability the Company may otherwise have. Such indemnity shall remain in
full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or

 



19  on behalf of such Holder or any indemnified party and shall survive the
Transfer of such securities by such Holder and regardless of any indemnity
agreed to in the underwriting agreement that is less favorable to the
Holders. The Company shall also indemnify underwriters, initial purchasers,
selling brokers, dealer managers and similar securities industry professionals
participating in the distribution, their officers and directors and
each Person who controls such Persons (within the meaning of the Securities
Act and the Exchange Act) to the same extent as provided above (with
appropriate modification) with respect to the indemnification of the
indemnified parties.

 

Section 3.9.2. _Indemnification by the Selling Holders_. Each selling
Holder agrees (severally and not jointly) to indemnify and hold harmless, to
the fullest extent permitted by law, the Company, its directors and officers
and each Person who controls the Company (within the meaning of the Securities
Act or the Exchange Act) from and against any Losses resulting from (i) any
untrue statement of a material fact in any Registration Statement under which
such Registrable Securities were registered or sold under the Securities Act
(including any final, preliminary or summary Prospectus contained therein or
any amendment thereof or supplement thereto or any documents incorporated by
reference therein) or (ii) any omission to state therein a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein (in
the case of a Prospectus or preliminary Prospectus, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made) not misleading, in each case to the
extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or omission is
contained in such selling Holders Selling Stockholder Information. In no
event shall the liability of any selling Holder hereunder be greater in amount
than the dollar amount of the proceeds from the sale of its Registrable
Securities in the offering giving rise to such indemnification obligation,
net of underwriting discounts and commissions but before expenses, less any
amounts paid by such Holder pursuant to Section 3.9.4 and any amounts paid by
such Holder as a result of liabilities incurred under the underwriting
agreement, if any, related to such sale.

Section 3.9.3. _Conduct of Indemnification Proceedings_. Any Person
entitled to indemnification hereunder shall (i) give prompt written notice to
the indemnifying party of any claim with respect to which it seeks
indemnification ( _provided_ that any delay or failure to so notify the
indemnifying party shall relieve the indemnifying party of its obligations
hereunder only to the extent, if at all, that it forfeits substantive legal
rights by reason of such delay or failure) and (ii) permit such indemnifying
party to assume the defense of such claim with counsel reasonably satisfactory
to the indemnified party; _provided_ , _however_ , that any Person entitled to
indemnification hereunder shall have the right to select and employ separate
counsel and to participate in the defense of such claim, but the fees and
expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Person unless (i) the
indemnifying party has agreed in writing to pay such fees or expenses, (ii)
the indemnifying party shall have failed to assume the defense of such claim
within a reasonable time after receipt of notice of such claim from the Person
entitled to indemnification hereunder and employ counsel reasonably
satisfactory to such Person, (iii) the indemnified party has reasonably
concluded (based upon advice of its counsel) that there may be legal defenses
available to it or other indemnified parties that are different from or in
addition to those available to the indemnifying party, or (iv) in the
reasonable judgment of any such Person (based upon advice of its counsel) a
conflict of interest may exist between such Person and

 



20  the indemnifying party with respect to such claims (in which case, if the
Person notifies the indemnifying party in writing that such Person elects to
employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party, the
indemnifying party shall not have the right to assume the defense of such
claim on behalf of such Person). If the indemnifying party assumes the
defense, the indemnifying party shall not have the right to settle
such action without the consent of the indemnified party. No indemnifying
party shall consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement
which does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the
claimant or plaintiff to such indemnified party of an unconditional release
from all liability in respect to such claim or litigation without the prior
written consent of such indemnified party. If such defense is not assumed by
the indemnifying party, the indemnifying party will not be subject to any
liability for any settlement made without its prior written consent, but such
consent may not be unreasonably withheld. It is understood that the
indemnifying party or parties shall not, except as specifically set forth
in this Section 3.9.3, in connection with any proceeding or related
proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the reasonable fees,
disbursements or other charges of more than one separate firm admitted to
practice in such jurisdiction at any one time unless (x) the employment of
more than one counsel has been authorized in writing by the indemnifying party
or parties, (y) an indemnified party has reasonably concluded (based on the
advice of counsel) that there may be legal defenses available to it that are
different from or in addition to those available to the other indemnified
parties or (z) a conflict or potential conflict exists or may exist (based
upon advice of counsel to an indemnified party) between such indemnified
party and the other indemnified parties, in each of which cases the
indemnifying party shall be obligated to pay the reasonable fees and expenses
of such additional counsel or counsels.

 

Section 3.9.4. _Contribution_. If for any reason the indemnification
provided for in Section 3.9.1 and Section 3.9.2 is unavailable to an
indemnified party or insufficient in respect of any Losses referred to therein
(other than as a result of exceptions or limitations on indemnification
contained in Section 3.9.1 and Section 3.9.2), then the indemnifying party
shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by the indemnified party as a
result of such Loss in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the
relative fault of the indemnifying party on the one hand and the indemnified
party or parties on the other hand in connection with the acts, statements or
omissions that resulted in such Losses, as well as any other relevant
equitable considerations. In connection with any Registration Statement filed
with the SEC by the Company, the relative fault of the indemnifying party on
the one hand and the indemnified party on the other hand shall be determined
by reference to, among other things, whether any untrue or alleged untrue
statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a
material fact relates to information supplied by the indemnifying party or by
the indemnified party and the parties relative intent, knowledge, access to
information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
The parties hereto agree that it would not be just or equitable if
contribution pursuant to this Section 3.9.4 were determined by _pro_ _rata_
allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of
the equitable considerations referred to in this Section 3.9.4. No Person
guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of
the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any Person who was
not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The amount paid or payable by
an indemnified party as a result of the Losses referred to in Sections 3.9.1
and 

 



21  3.9.2 shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth
above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified
party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim.
Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 3.9.4, in connection with any
Registration Statement filed by the Company, a selling Holder shall not be
required to contribute any amount in excess of the dollar amount of the
proceeds from the sale of its Registrable Securities in the offering giving
rise to such indemnification obligation, net of underwriting discounts and
commissions but before expenses, less any amounts paid by such
Holder pursuant to Section 3.9.2 and any amounts paid by such Holder as a
result of liabilities incurred under the underwriting agreement, if any,
related to such sale. If indemnification is available under this Section 3.9,
the indemnifying parties shall indemnify each indemnified party to the full
extent provided in Sections 3.9.1 and 3.9.2 hereof without regard to the
provisions of this Section 3.9.4. The remedies provided for in this Section
3.9 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may
otherwise be available to any indemnified party at law or in equity.

 

Section 3.10. _Rules 144 and 144A and Regulation_ __ _ S_. The Company
shall file the reports required to be filed by it under the Securities Act
and the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations adopted by the SEC
thereunder (or, if the Company is not required to file such reports, it will,
upon the request of the Holders, make publicly available such necessary
information for so long as necessary to permit sales that would otherwise be
permitted by this Agreement pursuant to Rule 144, Rule 144A or Regulation S
under the Securities Act, as such rules may be amended from time to time or
any similar rule or regulation hereafter adopted by the SEC), and it will take
such further action as any Holder may reasonably request, all to the extent
required from time to time to enable such Holder to sell Registrable
Securities without Registration under the Securities Act in transactions that
would otherwise be permitted by this Agreement and within the limitation of
the exemptions provided by (i) Rule 144, Rule 144A or Regulation S under the
Securities Act, as such rules may be amended from time to time, or (ii) any
similar rule or regulation hereafter adopted by the SEC. Upon the request of
any Holder, the Company will deliver to such Holder a written statement as to
whether it has complied with such requirements and, if not, the specifics
thereof.

Section 3.11. _Existing_ _Registration Statements_. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary and subject to applicable law and regulation,
the Company may satisfy any obligation hereunder to file a Registration
Statement or to have a Registration Statement become effective by a specified
date by designating, by notice to the Holders, a Registration Statement that
previously has been filed with the SEC or become effective, as the case may
be, as the relevant Registration Statement for purposes of satisfying such
obligation, and all references to any such obligation shall be construed
accordingly; _provided_ that such previously filed Registration Statement may
be, and is, amended or, subject to applicable securities laws, supplemented to
add the number of Registrable Securities, and, to the extent necessary, to
identify as a selling stockholders those Holders demanding the filing of a
Registration Statement pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. To the extent
this Agreement refers to the filing or effectiveness of other Registration
Statements, by or at a specified time and the Company has, in lieu of then
filing such Registration Statements or having such Registration Statements
become effective, designated a previously filed or effective Registration
Statement as the relevant Registration Statement for such purposes, in
accordance with the preceding sentence, such references shall be construed to
refer to such designated Registration Statement, as amended or supplemented in
the manner contemplated by the immediately preceding sentence.

or if not delivered on a Business Day, on the first Business Day thereafter
and (iii) two (2) Business Days after being sent by overnight courier. Each

Section 4.3. _Termination and Effect of Termination_. This Agreement shall
terminate upon the date on which no Holder holds any Registrable Securities,
except for the provisions of Sections 3.9 and 3.10, which shall survive any
such termination. No termination under this Agreement shall relieve any Person
of liability for breach or Registration Expenses incurred prior to
termination. In the event this Agreement is terminated, each Person entitled
to indemnification rights pursuant to Section 3.9 hereof shall retain such
indemnification rights with respect to any matter that (i) may be an
indemnified liability thereunder and (ii) occurred prior to such termination.

 

Section 4.4. _Permitted Transferees_. The rights of a Holder hereunder may
be assigned (but only with all related obligations as set forth below) in
connection with a Transfer of Registrable Securities to a Permitted Transferee
of that Holder. Without prejudice to any other or similar conditions imposed
hereunder with respect to any such Transfer, no assignment permitted under
the terms of this Section 4.4 will be effective unless the Permitted
Transferee to which the assignment is being made, if not a Holder, has
delivered to the Company a written acknowledgment and agreement in form
and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Company that the Permitted
Transferee will be bound by, and will be a party to, this Agreement. A
Permitted Transferee to whom rights are transferred pursuant to this Section
4.4 may not again transfer those rights to any other Permitted Transferee,
other than as provided in this Section 4.4.

 

Section 4.5. _Remedies_. The parties to this Agreement shall have all
remedies available at law, in equity or otherwise in the event of any breach
or violation of this Agreement or any default hereunder. The parties
acknowledge and agree that in the event of any breach of this Agreement, in
addition to any other remedies that may be available, each of the parties
hereto shall

 



24  be entitled to specific performance of the obligations of the other parties
hereto and, in addition, to such other equitable remedies (including
preliminary or temporary relief) as may be appropriate in the circumstances.
No delay of or omission in the exercise of any right, power or remedy accruing
to any party as a result of any breach or default by any other party under
this Agreement shall impair any such right, power or remedy, nor shall it be
construed as a waiver of or acquiescence in any such breach or default, or of
any similar breach or default occurring later; nor shall any such delay,
omission nor waiver of any single breach or default be deemed a waiver of
any other breach or default occurring before or after that waiver.

Section 4.6. _Amendments_. This Agreement may not be orally amended,
modified, extended or terminated, nor shall any oral waiver of any of its
terms be effective. This Agreement may be amended, modified, extended or
terminated, and the provisions hereof may be waived, only by an agreement in
writing signed by the Company and the Investors. Each such amendment,
modification, extension or termination shall be binding upon each party
hereto. In addition, each party hereto may waive any right hereunder by an
instrument in writing signed by such party.

Section 4.7. _Governing Law_. This Agreement and all claims arising out of
or based upon this Agreement or relating to the subject matter hereof shall
be governed by and construed in accordance with the domestic substantive laws

such court and (iii) hereby agrees not to commence or maintain any action,
claim, cause of action or suit (in contract, tort or otherwise), inquiry,

relating to the subject matter hereof or thereof other than before one of the
above-named courts nor to make any motion or take any other action seeking or
intending to cause the transfer or removal of any such action, claim, cause of
action or suit (in contract, tort or otherwise), inquiry, proceeding or
investigation to any court other than one of the above-named courts whether on
the grounds of inconvenient forum or otherwise. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
to the extent that any party hereto is or becomes a party in any litigation
in connection with which it may assert indemnification rights set forth in
this Agreement, the court in which such litigation is being heard shall be
deemed to be included in clause (i) above. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any

taken together shall constitute one instrument.

 

Section 4.12. _Severability_. In the event that any provision hereof

provision shall be construed by modifying or limiting it so as to be valid and
enforceable to the maximum extent compatible with, and possible under,

provision hereof should be held invalid or unenforceable in any respect, it
shall not invalidate, render unenforceable or otherwise affect any other
provision hereof.

 

Section 4.13. _No Recourse_. Notwithstanding anything that may be
expressed or implied in this Agreement, the Company and each Holder covenant,

or instruments delivered in connection with this Agreement shall be had
against any current or future director, officer, employee, general or limited
partner or member of any Holder or of any Affiliate or assignee thereof, as
such, whether by the enforcement of any assessment or by any legal or

applicable law, it being expressly agreed and acknowledged that no personal
liability whatsoever shall attach to, be imposed on or otherwise be incurred
by any current or future officer, agent or employee of any Holder or any
current or future member of any Holder or any

 



26  current or future director, officer, employee, partner or member of any
Holder or of any Affiliate or assignee thereof, as such, for any obligation of
any Holder under this Agreement or any documents or instruments delivered in
connection with this Agreement for any claim based on, in respect of or by
reason of such obligations or their creation.
