for which adequate reserves have been established; and (c) have not waived any statute of limitations with respect to Taxes or
agreed to any extension of time with respect to a Tax assessment or deficiency where such waiver or extension is currently in effect.
There are no audits, examinations, investigations, deficiencies, claims or other Proceedings in respect of Taxes or Tax matters
