Section 3.13 _Taxes_. The LLC Member and each of its Subsidiaries (a) have
duly and timely filed, or have caused to be duly and timely filed, all
Tax Returns required to be filed by them (taking into account any extension
of time within which to file) and all such Tax Returns are complete and
accurate in all material respects and were prepared in material compliance
with all applicable Laws; (b) have, in all material respects, paid all Taxes
that are required to be paid (whether or not shown on any Tax Return)
including those that the LLC Member or any of its Subsidiaries are obligated
to deduct or withhold from amounts owing to any employee, creditor or other
third party, except, in either case, with respect to matters contested in good
faith through appropriate proceedings or for which adequate reserves have
been established; and (c) have not waived any statute of limitations with
respect to Taxes or agreed to any extension of time with respect to a Tax
assessment or deficiency where such waiver or extension is currently in
effect. There are no audits, examinations, investigations, deficiencies,
claims or other Proceedings in respect of Taxes or Tax matters pending or, to
the LLC Member's Knowledge, threatened in writing. Neither the LLC Member nor
any of its Subsidiaries has received notice in writing of any claim made by
any Governmental Authority in a jurisdiction where it does not file Tax
Returns that the LLC Member or any of its Subsidiaries is or may be subject
to taxation by that jurisdiction. Neither the LLC Member nor any of its
Subsidiaries has constituted either a "distributing corporation" or a
"controlled corporation" in a distribution of stock intended to qualify for

the date of this Agreement. Neither the LLC Member nor the LLC has
participated or is currently participating, in a "listed transaction" as
defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.6011-4(b)(2). Neither the LLC Member
nor any of its Subsidiaries (i) have any liability for Taxes of any Person
(other than the LLC Member or any of its Subsidiaries) under Treasury
Regulation Section 1.1502-6 (or any comparable provision of local, state or
non-U.S. Law), as a transferee or successor, by Contract, or otherwise or (ii)
is a party to, bound by, or has any liability under any Tax sharing,
allocation or indemnification agreement or similar arrangement, in each case,
other than any Contract entered into in the ordinary course of business, the
principal purpose of which does not relate to Tax matters. Each of the LLC
Member, the LLC, and each of its Subsidiaries is, and has been since its
formation, treated as disregarded as separate from its owner or as a
partnership for all U.S. federal income Tax purposes, other than Mirabile
Investment Corporation, which is treated as a corporation for U.S. federal
income tax purposes.

Section 3.14 _Tax Qualification_. Neither CFP nor any of its Subsidiaries

(a) _Section 3.15(a)_ of the CFP Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true,
correct and complete list of each LLC Member Benefit Plan. The LLC Member has
made available to Carrols true, correct and complete copies (or, if a plan or
arrangement is not written, a written description of the material terms) of
(to the extent applicable): (i) the current plan document for each LLC Member
Benefit Plan and amendments thereto; (ii) any related trust agreement,
service provider agreements or underlying insurance contract,
funding arrangement, or administrative and service provider agreements now in
effect; (iii) the most recent determination, opinion or advisory letter
received regarding the tax-qualified status of each LLC Member Benefit Plan
that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code; (iv) the
most recent financial statement for each LLC Member Benefit Plan; (v) the Form
5500 Annual Returns/Reports and Schedules for the most recent plan year for
each LLC Member Benefit Plan; (vi) the current summary plan description for

(b) Neither the LLC Member nor any of its Subsidiaries sponsors, maintains,
contributes to or has any obligation to contribute to, or has any liability
with respect to (including on account of any ERISA Affiliate): a
"multiemployer plan" (as defined in Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA); a "multiple
employer plan" described in Section 413(c) of the Code; a "multiple
employer welfare arrangement" described in Section 3(40) of ERISA; or an
"employee pension benefit plan" within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA
that is or was subject to Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code, and,
neither the LLC Member nor any of its Subsidiaries has, within the last five
(5) years, contributed to, been required to contribute to, or otherwise had
any obligation or liability in connection with any such foregoing plans
(including on account of any ERISA Affiliate). Neither the LLC Member nor any
of its Subsidiaries has incurred any withdrawal liability within the meaning
of Section 4201 of ERISA to any multiemployer plan (as defined in Section
4001(a)(3) of ERISA), and no event has occurred that presents a material risk
of the occurrence of any withdrawal from any multiemployer plan (as defined
in Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA) that could result in any liability to the LLC
Member or any of its Subsidiaries to any such multiemployer plan.

  



  

(c) Each LLC Member Benefit Plan has been maintained and administered in all
material respects in accordance with its terms and in all material respects
in compliance with applicable Laws, including ERISA and the Code. Each LLC
Member Benefit Plan intended to be "qualified" within the meaning of Section
401(a) of the Code and the trusts maintained thereunder that are intended to
be exempt from taxation under Section 501(a) of the Code has received a
favorable determination letter from the IRS (or, with respect to any LLC
Member Benefit Plan that is a qualified "pre-approved" plan, the sponsor of
such pre-approved plan has received an opinion letter or advisory letter from
the IRS), and nothing has occurred since the issuance of such letters for any
LLC Member Benefit Plan to cause the revocation of qualification under the
Code of any such plans.

  



  

   

17

 



    



  

(d) To the LLC Member's Knowledge, there has been no prohibited transaction
(within the meaning of Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code and
other than a transaction that is exempt under a statutory or administrative
exemption) with respect to any LLC Member Benefit Plan that could result in a
material liability to the LLC Member or any of its Subsidiaries. No LLC Member
Benefit Plan provides post-termination or retiree health benefits to any LLC
Member Employee or any dependent thereof, except as may be required by COBRA
or other applicable Law, and neither the LLC Member nor any of its
Subsidiaries has any liability to provide post-termination or retiree health
benefits to any LLC Member Employee or any dependent thereof, except to the
extent required by COBRA or other applicable Law. Each LLC Member Benefit
Plan that is subject to Section 409A of the Code has been operated
in compliance with such section and all applicable regulatory guidance
(including, without limitation, proposed regulations, notices, rulings, and
final regulations).

  



  

(e) There is no pending or, to the LLC Member's Knowledge, threatened,
Proceeding (other than a routine claim for benefits) with respect to any LLC
Member Benefit Plan that would reasonably be expected to result in a material
liability to the LLC Member or any of its Subsidiaries. To the LLC Member's
Knowledge, neither the LLC Member, nor any of its Subsidiaries has any
material liability under Section 502 of ERISA. No material excise tax has
been, or to the LLC Member's Knowledge, could reasonably be expected to be,
imposed upon the LLC Member or its Subsidiaries under Chapter 43 of the Code.

  



  

(f) The execution, delivery and performance of, and consummation of the
transactions contemplated by, this Agreement and the other
Transaction Agreements will not (i) entitle any LLC Member Employee to any
additional compensation, including severance pay, unemployment
compensation or any other payment; (ii) result in any payment becoming due,
or increase the amount of any compensation due, to any LLC Member Employee;
(iii) accelerate the time of payment or vesting of any benefits to any LLC
Member Employee; (iv) result in payment of any amount that could,
individually or in combination with any other such payment, constitute an
"excess parachute payment" under Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code; or (v)
trigger or impose any restriction or imposition on the rights of the LLC
Member or any of its Subsidiaries to amend or terminate any LLC Member
Benefit Plan. Except as set forth on _Section 3.15(f)_ of the CFP Disclosure
Schedule, neither the LLC Member nor any of its Subsidiaries has any
obligation to provide or make available post-employment health benefits or
health coverage for any LLC Member Employee, except as may be required under
COBRA.

  



  

(g) Except as would not reasonably be expected to, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect, the LLC Member and each of its
Subsidiaries has complied, in all material respects, with the applicable
requirements under the Affordable Care Act, the Code, ERISA, COBRA, HIPAA,
and other federal requirements for employer-sponsored health plans, and any
corresponding requirements under state statutes, with respect to each LLC
Member Benefit Plan that is a group health plan within the meaning of Section
733(a) of ERISA, Section 5000(b)(1) of the Code, or such state statute.

individually or in the aggregate, all employees of the LLC Member and its
Subsidiaries who are classified as exempt from the minimum wage and overtime
requirements of the Fair Labor Standards Act and applicable state labor Laws

Employees are represented by a labor organization, work council, or
trade union with respect to their employment by the LLC Member or any of its
Subsidiaries and, to the LLC Member's Knowledge, there is no organizing
activity, Proceedings, election petition, union card signing or other union

years of the intent of any Governmental Authority responsible for the
enforcement of labor, employment, occupational health and safety or workplace
safety and insurance/workers compensation Laws to conduct an investigation of
the LLC Member or any of its Subsidiaries and, to the LLC Member's
Knowledge, no such investigation is in progress. There are no material

other amounts due or owing by the LLC Member or any of its Subsidiaries
pursuant to any child labor, meal and rest break, wage and hour, workplace

aggregate, to have a Carrols Material Adverse Effect.

reasonably be expected to result in, a Carrols Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

(b) Except as set forth on _Section 5.09(b)_ of the Carrols Disclosure
Schedule, there is no investment banker, broker, finder or other intermediary
that has been retained by or is authorized to act on behalf of Carrols or any
Carrols Subsidiary who might be entitled to any fee or commission in

concurrent or similar transaction process.

  



  

Section 5.10 _Tax Qualification_. Neither Carrols nor any of its

Section 5.11 _Financing_.

  



  

(a) NewCRG and Carrols have delivered to the LLC Member and the LLC a true
and complete copy, as of the date of this Agreement, of an
executed commitment letter dated as of the date hereof from Wells Fargo Bank,
National Association, and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC (collectively, the "
_Lenders_ ") to Carrols (together with any executed Alternate Financing
Commitment for Alternate Financing, in each case, to the extent permitted by
_Section 7.13(f)_ , the " _Financing Commitment_ "), pursuant to which the
Lenders have committed, subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein,
to provide or cause to be provided the debt financing in the amounts set
forth therein (the " _Financing_ "), together with each fee letter (each, a "
_Fee Letter_ ") related thereto (with customary redactions for fee amounts,
pricing, other economic terms, thresholds, caps, pricing caps and "market
flex"). NewCRG or Carrols has paid any and all commitment fees or other fees
that are required to be paid on or prior to the date of this Agreement
pursuant to the terms of the Financing Commitment, and, as of the date
of this Agreement, the Financing Commitment is in full force and effect and
is the legal, valid, binding and enforceable obligations of Carrols and, to
the Knowledge of NewCRG and Carrols, each of the other parties thereto, except
to the extent that enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy,
reorganization, insolvency, moratorium or other Laws affecting the enforcement
of creditors' rights generally and by general principles of equity,
regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a Proceeding
at Law or in equity. As of the date of this Agreement, neither NewCRG nor
Carrols is and, to the Knowledge of NewCRG and Carrols, no other party to the
Financing Commitment is, in breach of, or default under, the Financing
Commitment, which breach or default would result in any portion of the
Financing being unavailable or delayed, and no event has occurred or
circumstances exist as of the date of this Agreement which, with the delivery
of notice, the passage of time or both, would constitute such a breach
or default. There are no side letters or other agreements, contracts or
arrangements (except for each Fee Letter, none of the redacted provisions of
which will impact the availability of the Financing) relating to the funding
of the full amount of the Financing other than as expressly set forth in or
contemplated by the Financing Commitment. NewCRG and Carrols have no Knowledge
of any facts or circumstances that, assuming satisfaction of the conditions
set forth in _Section 8.01_ and _Section 8.02_ , are reasonably likely to
result in (A) any of the conditions set forth in the Financing Commitment not
being satisfied or (B) Financing in an amount sufficient together with
available cash on hand to pay the Required Amount not being made available at
or prior to the Effective Time.

  



  

   

34

 



    



  

(b) Assuming (i) the funding of the full amount of the Financing in
accordance with and subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set
forth in the Financing Commitment and (ii) the accuracy in all material
respects of the representations and warranties of each of the CFP Entities
set forth in _ARTICLE III_ and _ARTICLE IV_ , the proceeds of the Financing,
together with cash on hand, will be sufficient to enable NewCRG and Carrols
to (a) repay all outstanding amounts under the LLC Existing Debt and the
Carrols Existing Debt, including all principal amounts plus accrued and
unpaid interest thereon, premiums and fees and expenses relating thereto, and
(b) pay any other amounts required to be paid in cash by NewCRG or Carrols
pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement and the
other Transaction Agreements (the " _Required Amount_ ").

  



  

Section 5.12 _No Additional Representations_.

  



  

(a) Carrols acknowledges and agrees that, (i) except for the representations
and warranties expressly made by the LLC Member and the LLC in  _ARTICLE III_
, by CFP in _ARTICLE IV_ and in any certificate delivered by or on behalf of
any CFP Entity hereunder, none of the CFP Entities or any other Person makes

respective representatives in connection with Carrols' review of the business
of the CFP Entities and their Subsidiaries and the negotiation and execution
of this Agreement and (iv) none of the CFP Entities or any other Person will
have, or be subject to, any liability or other obligation to Carrols or any
of its Affiliates or any of their respective representatives or to any other
Person resulting from such Person's use, or the use by any of its Affiliates
or representatives, of any information, including information, documents,
projections, forecasts or other materials made available to such Person in any
virtual data room, confidential information memorandum, management
presentation or offering materials, or in connection with any site tours or
visits, diligence calls or meetings or any documents prepared by, or on
behalf of, the CFP Entities, or any of Carrols' potential financing sources in
connection with Carrols' financing activities with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, unless any such information is
expressly included in a representation or warranty contained in _ARTICLE III_
or in _ARTICLE IV_ , in any certificate delivered by or on behalf of any CFP
Entity hereunder, or as and to the extent required by this Agreement to be set
forth in the CFP Disclosure Schedule. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this _Section 5.12(a)_ , the provisions of this _Section 5.12(a)_
shall not prevent or limit in any way any liability or cause of action on the
account of Fraud committed by any CFP Entity.

(b) Except for the representations and warranties made by Carrols in this
_ARTICLE V_ or in any certificate delivered by or on behalf of Carrols
hereunder, neither Carrols nor any other Person makes, and each other Party
hereby agrees that it is not relying on and has not relied upon, any express
or implied representation or warranty (including as to the accuracy or
completeness of any such representation or warranty) with respect to Carrols,
its Subsidiaries, NewCRG or either Merger Sub or their respective
businesses, operations, assets, liabilities, conditions (financial or
otherwise) or prospects, and Carrols hereby disclaims any such
other representations or warranties. In particular, without limiting the
foregoing disclaimer, neither Carrols nor any other Person makes or has made
any representation or warranty to the LLC Member, the LLC or any of its
respective Affiliates or representatives with respect to (a) any financial
projection, forecast, estimate, budget or prospect information relating to
Carrols, any of its Subsidiaries or their respective businesses or (b) except
for the representations and warranties made by Carrols in this _ARTICLE V_ ,
any oral or written information presented to the LLC Member, the LLC or any
of its respective Affiliates or representatives in the course of their due
diligence investigation of Carrols, the negotiation of this Agreement, the
other Transaction Agreements or in the course of the transactions
contemplated hereby.

Member, of the LLC) to materially comply with or satisfy any covenant,

take any action that limits the freedom of action with respect to, or its
ability to retain any of its businesses, product lines, or assets or those of

other Transaction Agreements; or (ii) propose or accept the impositions of
conditions or require Carrols to (A) expend material amounts of money to a

any communications from or with any Governmental Authority with respect to the
Mergers and (B) not participate in any meeting with any such Governmental
Authority with respect to the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements without giving, in the
case of the LLC Member or the LLC, Carrols, and in the case of Carrols, the
LLC Member, prior notice of the meeting and, to the extent reasonably
practicable and permitted by such Governmental Authority, gives the other the
opportunity to attend and participate thereat. The LLC Member, the LLC, and
Carrols will consult and cooperate with each other in connection with any
information or proposals submitted in connection with any Proceeding under or
relating to the HSR Act in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements.

Carrols shall provide the LLC Member and its counsel a reasonable opportunity

issuable in connection with the Carrols Merger for offering or sale in any
jurisdiction. As promptly as practicable following the date hereof, each of
NewCRG and Carrols shall make all other filings required to be made by it

with the audited carve-out combined balance sheet of the CFP Business as of
December 31, 2018 and the related audited carve-out combined statements of
income, net investment and cash flows of the CFP Business for the fiscal year
ended December 31, 2018 (the " _CFP 2018 Audited Financial Statements_ ")
and, if necessary (prior to the Registration Statement being
declared effective under the Securities Act by the SEC), the unaudited carve-
out balance sheet of the CFP Business as of the last day of any interim
fiscal quarter (other than the fourth fiscal quarter of any fiscal year) ended
at least forty-five (45) days prior to the date on which the Registration
Statement is declared effective under the Securities Act by the SEC (the "
_CFP 2019 Interim Balance Sheet Date_ ") and the related unaudited carve-out
combined statements of income, net investment and cash flows of the CFP
Business for the period beginning on January 1, 2019 and ended as of the CFP
2019 Interim Balance Sheet Date (such unaudited financial statements, the "
_CFP 2019 Interim Financial Statements_ "). The LLC Member and the LLC
shall further furnish any other information as may be reasonably requested by
NewCRG or Carrols in connection with the Registration Statement and any such
filings, including providing any such information as may be required to be
included in the Registration Statement or any such filings under applicable
Law. The Registration Statement and such filings shall comply in all material
respects with all applicable requirements of Law and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder. NewCRG and Carrols shall, as promptly as
practicable after receipt thereof, provide the LLC Member and its counsel with
copies of any written comments and all other correspondence with the SEC or
any other governmental officials, and advise the LLC Member and its counsel of
any oral comments, with respect to the Registration Statement (or any
amendment or supplement thereto) received from the SEC. Each of NewCRG,
Carrols, the LLC Member and the LLC shall ensure that information supplied by
it for inclusion or incorporation in such Registration Statement does not at
the time the Registration Statement is filed with the SEC or at the time such
Registration Statement is first published, sent or given to the Carrols
stockholders contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state
any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make
the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading. If, at any time prior to the Effective Time, any
information relating to NewCRG, Carrols, the LLC Member or the LLC, or any of
their respective Affiliates, officers, directors, members or managers, is
discovered by NewCRG, Carrols, the LLC Member or the LLC that should be set
forth in an amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement so that the
Registration Statement would not include any misstatement of a material fact
or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein,
in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the
party hereto discovering such information shall promptly notify the other
parties and, to the extent required by Law, NewCRG and Carrols shall cause an
appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information to be
promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by Law disseminated
to the Carrols stockholders.

  



  

   

44

 



    



  

Section 7.05 _Public Announcements_.

  



  

(a) Carrols shall consult with the LLC Member before issuing any press
release or other public statement with respect to the Mergers, this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby and shall not issue any such press
release or make any such public statement prior to such consultation, except
as may be required by applicable Law, court process or by obligations pursuant
to any listing agreement with any national securities exchange.

  



  

(b) Each CFP Entity shall obtain the approval of Carrols (such approval not
to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) before issuing any press release or
other public statement with respect to the Mergers, this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby and shall not issue any such press release
or make any such public statement prior to such approval, except as may be
required by applicable Law, court process or by obligations pursuant to any
listing agreement with any national securities exchange.

  



  

Section 7.06 _Tax Matters_.

  



  

(a) Each of Carrols, NewCRG, CFP, the LLC Member, the LLC, each of the
Subsidiaries thereto and each of the Affiliates thereof shall report the
exchanges of Carrols Common Stock and the LLC Membership Interest for NewCRG
Stock pursuant to the Mergers as exchanges described in Section 351 of the
Code for all U.S. federal (and applicable state, local, and non-U.S.) income
Tax purposes and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause such Mergers
to qualify as exchanges described in Section 351 of the Code and shall not
take any action that would, or that would be reasonably likely to, cause the
exchanges not to so qualify; _provided_ that, subject to the obligations of
the Parties described in _Section 7.06(d)_ , no action taken by a Party that
is specifically contemplated by this Agreement shall be considered an action
that would, or that would be reasonably likely to, cause the exchanges not to
so qualify. Without limitation of the foregoing, NewCRG will not, and has no
plans to, cause the LLC to be a subsidiary of Carrols or cause Carrols not to
be recognized as an entity whose separate existence from NewCRG is regarded
for U.S. federal (and applicable state, local, and non-U.S.) income Tax
purposes.

  



  

(b) Carrols, CFP, the LLC Member, NewCRG, and each of their respective
Affiliates thereto will cooperate fully, as and to the extent
reasonably requested by the other, in connection with the filing of the LLC's
or its Subsidiaries' or any of the CFP Entities' or their direct or indirect
owners' Tax Returns and any audit, litigation or other Proceeding with respect
to Taxes of the LLC or its Subsidiaries or any of the CFP Entities or their
direct or indirect owners in respect thereof. Such cooperation shall include
the retention and (upon the other's request) the provision of records and
information reasonably relevant to any such audit, litigation or other
Proceeding with respect to Taxes and making employees available on a mutually
convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any
material provided hereunder.

  



  

(c) For the avoidance of doubt, the Mergers described in this Agreement shall
be consummated pursuant to a single plan of combination.

  



  

(d) If any Party discovers, after the date of this Agreement, any fact that
could reasonably be expected to prevent the Mergers from qualifying for the
Intended Tax Treatment, then (i) such Party shall, as soon as possible, notify
the other Parties and (ii) the Parties shall cooperate in good faith and
exercise their reasonable best efforts to effect the transactions contemplated
hereby in a manner that would result in the Intended Tax Treatment or that
would result in a Tax treatment no less favorable than the Intended Tax
Treatment to the direct or indirect owners of the CFP Entities and Carrols.

Section 7.07 _Benefit Plans and Employee Matters_.

No later than ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing, Carrols shall
provide the LLC Member with a list of the LLC Member Employees it desires to
employ after Closing (the " _LLC Employees_ "), and the LLC Member shall take
such steps as are required to transfer the employment of the LLC Employees to
a Subsidiary of the LLC Member effective on or before the Closing Date. Each
LLC Employee employed by a Subsidiary of the LLC Member as of the Closing
Date and each LLC Member Employee employed by a Subsidiary of the LLC Member
as of the Closing Date shall be a " _Transferred Employee_ ".

  



  

(b) NewCRG shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, as applicable, give
Transferred Employees full credit under any employee benefit plan or program
made available to the Transferred Employees by NewCRG or any of its Affiliates
following the Closing Date (each, a " _Buyer Benefit Plan_ ") for such
Transferred Employees' service with the LLC Member or any of its Subsidiaries
for purposes of eligibility to participate and vesting to the same extent and
for the same purpose that such service was recognized by the LLC Member or
any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Closing Date; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that such service shall not be recognized to the extent that such
recognition would result in a duplication of benefits or compensation with
respect to the same period of service.

  



  

(c) NewCRG shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, as applicable, take all
such actions as are necessary, to the extent commercially reasonable, to: (i)
credit any expenses incurred by the Transferred Employees and their eligible
dependents under the LLC Member Benefit Plans that are group health plans in
which the Transferred Employees participated immediately prior to the Closing
during the portion of the applicable plan year prior to the Closing toward
satisfying any deductibles, co-payments or out-of-pocket maximums under the
Buyer Benefit Plans that are group health plans for the plan year in which the
Closing occurs; and (ii) waive any waiting period, pre-existing condition
limitation, actively-at-work requirement, or evidence of insurability
requirement that would otherwise be applicable to a Transferred Employee and
his or her eligible dependents under any Buyer Benefit Plan.

  



  

(d) Nothing contained in this _Section 7.07_ shall be considered or deemed to
establish, amend, or modify any benefit or compensation plan, program,
policy, agreement, arrangement, or contract, or create or confer any rights or
benefits (including any third-party beneficiary rights) on any Person other
than the Parties to this Agreement.

  



  

(e) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall (i) impose an obligation on
NewCRG or any of its Affiliates to continue employment or offer employment to
any employee of the LLC Member, the CFP Surviving Entity or its Subsidiaries
after the Closing Date, (ii) limit the right of NewCRG or any of its
Affiliates to terminate the employment of, or to reassign or otherwise alter
the status of, any employee of the CFP Surviving Entity or its Subsidiaries
after the Closing Date, or to change in any manner the terms and conditions of
the employment of any employee of the CFP Surviving Entity or its
Subsidiaries after the Closing Date, (iii) require NewCRG or any of its
Affiliates to continue any Buyer Benefit Plan or be construed to prevent, and
no action by the LLC Member or the LLC prior to the Closing Date shall limit
the ability of, NewCRG or any of its Affiliates to terminate, amend, or modify
to any extent or in any respect any Buyer Benefit Plan that NewCRG or any of
its Affiliates may establish or maintain, or (iv) be construed as
amending any Buyer Benefit Plan.

Section 7.08 _Required Stockholder Approval_.

  



  

(a) NewCRG shall provide each stockholder entitled to vote at the annual
meeting of the stockholders of NewCRG to be held in 2019, which shall be held
no later than 120 days following the Closing Date (the " _NewCRG Stockholder
Meeting Deadline_ "), or at any special meeting of the stockholders of NewCRG
held prior to such date (as applicable, the " _NewCRG Stockholder Meeting_
"), a proxy statement meeting the requirements of Section 14 of the Exchange
Act and the related rules and regulations promulgated thereunder and the
applicable rules promulgated by NASDAQ (the " _NewCRG Proxy Statement_ ")
soliciting each such stockholder's affirmative vote at the NewCRG Stockholder
Meeting for the stockholder approval contemplated by section 6(b) of the
NewCRG Series C Certificate of Designation (the " _NewCRG Stockholder
Approval_ "), and NewCRG shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
solicit its stockholders to obtain the NewCRG Stockholder Approval (which
efforts shall include, without limitation, hiring a reputable proxy solicitor
selected by NewCRG in its sole discretion) and causing the board of directors
of NewCRG to recommend to the stockholders that they provide the NewCRG
Stockholder Approval, unless the board of directors of NewCRG determines in
good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that making such
recommendation would reasonably be expected to cause the board of directors
to be in breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law. If the
NewCRG Stockholder Approval is not obtained at the NewCRG Stockholder
Meeting, then NewCRG will repeat the actions and continue to use the efforts
contemplated by the immediately preceding sentence (subject to the
qualification contained therein) with respect to each of the following
meetings of the stockholders of NewCRG until such NewCRG Stockholder Approval
is obtained or such approval is no longer required.

  



  

(b) NewCRG shall provide the LLC Member's legal counsel with a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on the contents of the NewCRG Proxy
Statement relating to the matter scheduled for stockholder approval referenced
in _Section 7.08(a)_ and any comments received from the SEC with respect to
such matter. NewCRG shall keep the LLC Member and its counsel reasonably
apprised of the status of matters relating to the NewCRG Proxy Statement and
the NewCRG Stockholder Meeting, in each case to the extent relating to such
matter, including promptly furnishing the LLC Member and its counsel, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, with copies of notices or other
communications related to the NewCRG Proxy Statement, the NewCRG Stockholder
Meeting or the transactions contemplated hereby or by any other Transaction
Agreement received by NewCRG from the SEC or NASDAQ.

  



  

Section 7.09 _Carrols Board Composition_. Effective immediately before the
Initial Effective Time, (i) the Carrols Board of Directors shall increase its
size by two directorships and shall appoint two (2) persons nominated by the
LLC Member to the Carrols Board of Directors, which initial nominees shall be
Matthew Perelman and Alexander Sloane, and (ii) the Carrols Board of Directors
shall cause such nominees to be elected and appointed as directors of NewCRG.
The failure of the Carrols Board of Directors to effect the
foregoing provisions of this _Section 7.09_ shall be deemed a breach of this
Agreement by Carrols.

  



  

   

47

(a) The CFP Entities shall not, and shall cause the LLC Member's Subsidiaries
and direct the officers, directors, managers, members, employees,
stockholders, representatives, agents, investment bankers and any of their
respective Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly, (i) pursue, solicit,
initiate, knowingly facilitate or encourage or otherwise enter into any
discussions, negotiations, agreements or other arrangements regarding or
which could reasonably be expected to lead to, a sale or other disposition
(whether by merger, reorganization, recapitalization or otherwise) of all or
any part of the membership interests or any substantial portion of the assets
of the LLC Member or any of its Subsidiaries with any other Person other than
Carrols or its Affiliates (an " _Acquisition Proposal_ "), (ii) provide any
confidential information to any Person other than Carrols or its Affiliates,
other than information which is traditionally provided in the regular course
of CFP, the LLC Member and their Subsidiaries' business operations to third
parties where CFP, the LLC Member and each of their Subsidiaries and their
officers, directors and Affiliates have no reason to believe that such
information will be utilized to evaluate any Acquisition Proposal, or (iii)
enter into a Contract with respect to an Acquisition Proposal with any third
party that has submitted, or is seeking to submit, an Acquisition
Proposal. For purposes of the preceding sentence, an " _Acquisition Proposal_
" includes any request, solicitation or proposal to abandon, terminate or
fail to consummate any of the transactions contemplated hereby. The LLC Member
and the LLC shall, and shall cause the LLC's Subsidiaries and direct the
officers, directors, members, managers, employees, stockholders,
representatives, agents, investment bankers and any of their respective
Affiliates to, (A) immediately cease and cause to be terminated, all
existing discussions or negotiations with any Persons conducted heretofore
with respect to, or that could reasonably be expected to lead to, an
Acquisition Proposal, (B) promptly notify Carrols if any Acquisition Proposal,
or any inquiry or contact with any Person with respect thereto which has been
made as of the date of this Agreement or is subsequently made, and the details
of such contact (including the identity of the third party or third parties
and copies of any proposals and the specific terms and conditions
discussed or proposed); and (C) keep Carrols fully informed with respect to
the status of the foregoing. Carrols shall have the right and remedy to have
the provisions of this _Section 7.12_ specifically enforced by any court
having jurisdiction, it being acknowledged and agreed that any breach or
threatened breach thereof may cause irreparable injury to Carrols and that
money damages may not provide an adequate remedy to Carrols, which right and
remedy shall be independent of all others and severally enforceable, and each
of which is in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other rights and remedies
available to NewCRG under law or in equity.

(b) Carrols shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and direct its and
their respective officers, directors, managers, members,
employees, representatives, agents and investment bankers not to, directly or
indirectly, pursue, solicit, initiate, knowingly facilitate or encourage, or
otherwise enter into any discussions, negotiations, agreements or other
arrangements regarding or which would reasonably be expected to lead to, an
acquisition, sale, disposition or other transaction, other than any
transaction set forth in _Section 6.02_ of the Carrols Disclosure Schedule,
with any Person other than the LLC Member or its Affiliates that
would reasonably be expected to have a Carrols Material Adverse Effect (a "
_Conflicting Transaction_ ") or enter into a Contract with any other Person
in respect of a Conflicting Transaction, and shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries and direct its and their respective officers, directors,
managers, members, employees, representatives, agents and investment bankers
to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated, all existing discussions or
negotiations with any Persons conducted heretofore with respect to, or that
would reasonably be expected to lead to, a Conflicting Transaction. For
purposes of the preceding sentence, a Conflicting Transaction includes any
request, solicitation or proposal to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate
any of the transactions contemplated hereby or by the other Transaction
Agreements. The CFP Entities shall have the right and remedy to have the
provisions of this _Section 7.12_ specifically enforced by any court having
jurisdiction, it being acknowledged and agreed that any breach or threatened
breach thereof may cause irreparable injury to the CFP Entities and that money
damages may not provide an adequate remedy to the CFP Entities, which right
and remedy shall be independent of all others and severally enforceable,
and each of which is in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other rights and
remedies available under law or in equity. For the avoidance of doubt, this
_Section 7.12(b)_ does not, and is not intended to, restrain or prohibit
Carrols from pursuing, soliciting, initiating, knowingly facilitating or
encouraging or otherwise entering into any discussions, negotiations,
agreements or other arrangements regarding the exercise of any existing right
of first refusal with respect to franchise restaurant transfers or any other
acquisitions of restaurants by Carrols in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice, to the extent the same would not reasonably be
expected to have a Carrols Material Adverse Effect.

(a) From the date hereof until the Closing, each of the CFP Entities shall,
and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, and shall use its commercially

obligations hereunder. From the date hereof until the Closing, each of the
CFP Entities shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, use their
commercially reasonable efforts to provide, and to use commercially reasonable

collectively, the " _Financing Documents_ ");

  



  

(iv) preparing and furnishing to NewCRG, Carrols and their Financing Sources
as promptly as practicable the Required Information;

security documents, guarantee and collateral documents and other certificates

(vi) delivering notices of prepayment within the time periods required by the
relevant agreements governing Indebtedness and obtaining customary payoff

required with respect to the Financing under applicable "know your customer"
and anti-money laundering rules and regulations.

  



  

(b) Each of the CFP Entities hereby consents, on behalf of itself and its
Subsidiaries, to the use of all logos of the CFP Entities and their
respective Subsidiaries in connection with the Financing so long as such logos
(i) are used solely in a manner that is not intended to or likely to harm or
disparage the CFP Entities or any of their respective Subsidiaries or the
reputation or goodwill of the CFP Entities or any of their respective
Subsidiaries and (ii) are used solely in connection with a description of the
CFP Entities or any of their respective Subsidiaries, their respective
businesses and products or the transactions contemplated hereby.

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, (x) nothing contained in this _Section
7.13_ shall require cooperation with NewCRG or Carrols to the extent it would
interfere unreasonably with the business and operations of any CFP Entity,
encumber any of the assets of any CFP Entity prior to the Effective Time,
require any CFP Entity to pay any commitment or other fee or make any other
payment in connection with the Financing prior to the Effective Time (unless
contemporaneously reimbursed by NewCRG or Carrols pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement), result in a breach of any contract in effect as of the date
hereof, or impose any liability on any CFP Entity, prior to the Effective
Time, and (y) no CFP Entity, nor any of their respective directors or
officers, shall (A) be required to take any action in the capacity as a
member of the board of managers or member of the LLC Member or any of its
subsidiaries to authorize or approve the Financing prior to the Effective
Time, (B) have any liability or any obligation under any definitive
agreement or any other agreement or document related to the Financing or (C)
be required to incur any other liability in connection with the Financing.

  



  

(d) NewCRG and Carrols shall promptly, upon request by any CFP Entity,
reimburse such CFP Entity for any reasonable and documented out-of-
pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) incurred by
it or any of its Affiliates at NewCRG's request in connection with the
cooperation of each CFP Entity contemplated by this _Section 7.13_ and shall
indemnify and hold harmless each CFP Entity for and against any and all
losses suffered or incurred by them in connection with the arrangement of the
Financing, any action taken by them at the request of NewCRG or Carrols
pursuant to this _Section 7.13_ and any information utilized in connection
therewith.

  



  

(e) NewCRG and Carrols shall each use its commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain the Financing on the terms and conditions set forth in the Financing
Commitment, including by using commercially reasonable efforts to (i) maintain
in effect the Financing Commitment, (ii) negotiate definitive agreements with
respect to the Financing (the " _Financing Agreements_ ") on terms and
conditions consistent with those set forth in the Financing Commitment
(including, as necessary, agreeing to any requested changes to the
commitments thereunder in accordance with any "flex" provisions contained in
any Fee Letter), in each case which terms do not impose new or additional
conditions, or expand on the existing conditions, to the funding of the
proceeds of the Financing at or prior to the Effective Time or reduce the
aggregate amount of the proceeds from the Financing below the Required Amount
(taking into account cash on hand), (iii) satisfy (or obtain waivers of) on a
timely basis all conditions set forth in the Financing Commitment or
Financing Agreements applicable to NewCRG or Carrols and their Subsidiaries to
obtain the Financing and to the extent within its control, and (iv) upon
satisfaction of such conditions and the other conditions set forth in
_ARTICLE VIII_ (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the fulfillment or waiver of those
conditions at the Closing), consummate the Financing at or prior to the
Closing (and in any event prior to the End Date) and enforce its rights under
the Financing Commitments. NewCRG and Carrols shall furnish to the LLC Member
correct and complete copies of any Financing Agreement or any Alternate
Financing Commitment (as defined below) and, in each case, ancillary
documents thereto.

  



  

   

50

 



    



  

(f) Without LLC Member's prior written consent (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), NewCRG and Carrols shall not
agree to any replacement, amendment or modification to the Financing
Commitment if such replacement, amendment or modification would (x) reduce
the amount of aggregate cash proceeds available from the Financing below an
amount that, when combined with available cash of NewCRG and Carrols, is
sufficient to fund the Required Amount, (y) impose new or additional
conditions precedent that would reasonably be expected to materially delay or
prevent the Closing or make the funding of the Financing materially less
likely to occur or (z) materially impact the ability of NewCRG and Carrols to
enforce its rights against other parties to the Financing Commitment of the
definitive agreements with respect thereto; _provided_ that NewCRG or Carrols
may amend the Financing Commitment to add lenders, lead arrangers,
bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities that have not executed the
Financing Commitment as of the date of this Agreement. Upon any such
permitted amendment, supplement, modification, waiver or replacement of the
Financing Commitment in accordance with this _Section 7.13(f)_ , the terms
"Financing Commitment" and "Financing" shall refer to the Financing
Commitment as so amended, supplemented, modified, waived or replaced and the
debt financing contemplated thereby. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, NewCRG and Carrols shall give the LLC Member and its counsel
prompt written notice: (A) of any material breach or default by any party to
the Financing Commitment, in each case, of which NewCRG or Carrols becomes
aware; and (B) of the receipt of any written notice or other written
communication from any Person with respect to any breach or default or
threatened breach, termination or repudiation by any party to any Financing
Commitment. If any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable (after giving
effect to any other financing sources then available) on the terms and
conditions (including the flex provisions) contemplated in the Financing
Commitment in effect on the date of this Agreement (other than as a result of
the termination of the Financing Commitment on the End Date pursuant to the
terms thereof) so as to reduce the amount of aggregate cash proceeds from the
portion of the Financing that is still available below an amount that, when
combined with available cash of NewCRG and Carrols, is sufficient to fund the
Required Amount, NewCRG and Carrols shall use their commercially
reasonable efforts to arrange and obtain, as promptly as practicable
following the occurrence of such event, alternate financing from the same or
alternative sources in an amount sufficient, when added to the portion of the
Financing being replaced that is still available and available cash of NewCRG
and Carrols, to fund the Required Amount and on terms and conditions that are
not less favorable to NewCRG and Carrols, taken as a whole (taking into
account any flex provisions), than those set forth in the Financing
Commitment in effect on the date of this Agreement (" _Alternate Financing_ "
and the agreement that evidences such commitment, the " _Alternate Financing
Commitment_ "). NewCRG and Carrols shall from time to time, keep the LLC
Member and its counsel reasonably informed of the status of their efforts to
arrange the Financing in reasonable detail. Any reference in this Agreement
to the "Financing" and "Financing Commitment" (other than _Section 5.11_ )
shall include the financing contemplated by the Financing Commitment on the
date of this Agreement, as permitted to be amended, modified or replaced (in
whole or in part) by this _Section 7.13_ , including any Alternate Financing
Commitment.

  



  

   

51

 



    



  

(g) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no Financing
Source shall have any liability for any obligations or liabilities of the CFP
Entities or for any claim (whether in tort, contract or otherwise), based on,
in respect of, or by reason of, any Merger or the other transactions
contemplated hereby. In no event shall the CFP Entities or any of their
respective Affiliates (i) seek to enforce this Agreement against, make any
claims for breach of this Agreement against, or seek to recover monetary
damages from, any Financing Source in its capacity as such or (ii) seek to
enforce the commitments directly against, make any claims for breach of the
commitments contained in the Financing Commitment against, or seek to recover
monetary damages from, or otherwise sue, the Financing Sources for any
reason, including in connection with the Financing or the obligations of the
Financing Sources thereunder. Nothing in this _Section 7.13(g)_ shall in any
way limit or qualify the rights, obligations and liabilities of the
parties to the Financing Commitment under the Financing Commitment or the
rights of the CFP Entities to enforce this Agreement against, make any claims
for breach of this Agreement against, or seek to recover monetary damages
from, Carrols, NewCRG or the Merger Subs.

  



  

Section 7.14 _Director and Officer Liability_.

  



  

(a) From and after the Closing Date, to the extent permitted by applicable
Law, the CFP Surviving Entity and its Subsidiaries will (and NewCRG will
cause the CFP Surviving Entity and its Subsidiaries to) (i) indemnify, defend
and hold harmless, against any costs or expenses (including attorney's fees
and expenses and disbursements), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or
liabilities incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding
or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, and provide advancement of expenses to, all past and present
directors and officers of the LLC Member and its Subsidiaries (in their
respective capacities as such) (each, an " _Indemnified Party_ ") to the
extent such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation arises out of or
pertains to (A) any act or omission by the Indemnified Party in his or her
capacity as a director or officer of the LLC Member or any of its
Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time or (B) the LLC Merger, in
either case, to the same extent such persons are indemnified or have the
right to advancement of expenses as of the date hereof by the LLC Member or
any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to the charters, limited liability company
agreements or other organizational documents of the LLC Member and its
Subsidiaries and any indemnification agreements in existence on the date
hereof with any Indemnified Party and (ii) cause to be maintained in effect
in the charters, limited liability company agreements or other organizational
documents of the CFP Surviving Entity and its Subsidiaries (or any successors
thereto) for a period of six (6) years after the Closing Date, the current
provisions regarding indemnification, limitation of liability and advancement
of expenses of Indemnified Parties contained in the charters, limited
liability company agreements or other organizational documents of the LLC
Member and its Subsidiaries as of the date hereof.

  



  

   

52

 



    



  

(b) On or prior to the Effective Time, NewCRG shall pay for and cause to be
obtained, and to be effective at the Effective Time, one or more prepaid
"tail" insurance policies covering the Indemnified Parties (the " _D andO
Insurance_") with a claims period of at least six years from the Effective
Time containing terms and conditions that are, taken as a whole, at least as
favorable as the LLC Member's and its Subsidiaries' existing DandO Insurance for
claims arising from facts or events that occurred at or prior to the
Effective Time; _provided_ that the maximum aggregate premium for such
"tail" insurance policies that NewCRG shall be required to expend shall not
exceed three hundred percent (300%) of the amount paid by the LLC Member and
its Subsidiaries for coverage during the last full fiscal year (such three
hundred percent (300%) amount, the " _Maximum Annual Premium_ ") which annual
premiums are set forth in _Section 7.14(b)_  of the CFP Disclosure Schedule.
If such insurance can only be obtained at an annual premium in excess of the
Maximum Annual Premium, then NewCRG and the CFP Surviving Entity shall only
be obligated to obtain a policy or policies with the greatest coverage
available for a cost not exceeding the Maximum Annual Premium in the
aggregate.

  



  

(c) If the CFP Surviving Entity or any of its successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other entity and is not the continuing
or surviving entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any individual or entity,
then, to the extent necessary, proper provisions shall be made so that the
successors and assigns of the CFP Surviving Entity shall assume all of the
obligations set forth in this _Section 7.14(c)_.

ARTICLE IX 
  _TERMINATION_ 

  



  

Section 9.01 _Termination_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, this Agreement may be terminated and the Mergers and other
transactions contemplated herein may be abandoned at any time before the
Closing:

  



  

(a) _Mutual Consent_. By the mutual written agreement of Carrols and the LLC
Member;

  



  

(b) _Breach of Representations, Warranties, Covenants or Agreements_.

  



  

(i) By Carrols upon delivery of written notice to the LLC Member, if there
has been a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made
by any CFP Entity in this Agreement, which breach (A) would be sufficient to
cause the failure of a condition set forth in _Section 8.02_ to be satisfied
as of the Closing Date and (B) (x) cannot be cured by the End Date or (y) if
capable of being cured, shall not have been cured by the date that is thirty
(30) calendar days following receipt of written notice to the LLC Member from
Carrols of such breach; _provided_ that Carrols may not terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this _Section 9.01(b)(i)_ if Carrols is then in breach
of this Agreement in any material respect which breach has not been cured.

  



  

(ii) By the LLC Member upon delivery of written notice to Carrols, if there
has been a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made
by Carrols in this Agreement, which breach (A) would be sufficient to cause
the failure of a condition set forth in _Section 8.03_ to be satisfied as of
the Closing Date and (B) (x) cannot be cured prior to the End Date or (y) if
capable of being cured, shall not have been cured by the date that is thirty
(30) calendar days following receipt of written notice to Carrols from the
LLC Member of such breach; _provided_ that the LLC Member may not terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this  _Section 9.01(b)(ii)_ if the LLC Member is
then in breach of this Agreement in any material respect which breach has not
been cured.

  



  

(c) _Failure to Deliver Certain Financial Information_. Notwithstanding
_Section 9.01(b)(i)_ above, by Carrols upon delivery of written notice to the
LLC Member if the LLC Member and the LLC shall have failed to deliver, or
caused to be delivered, the financial information set forth in the first
sentence of _Section 7.04(b)_ to Carrols in the time period specified therein.

  



  

(d) _End Date_. By the LLC Member or Carrols upon delivery of written notice
to the other if the Closing has not occurred on before 5:00 p.m., New York
time, on June 15, 2019 (the " _End Date_ "); _provided_ that neither Carrols
nor the LLC Member will be entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
this _Section 9.01(d)_ if the material breach of, or material failure to
fulfill any obligation under, this Agreement by, in the case of Carrols, any
of Carrols, NewCRG or either Merger Sub or, in the case of the LLC Member,
any CFP Entity has been a significant cause of the failure of the Closing to
occur at or prior to such time on the End Date.

  



  

   

58

 



    



  

(e) _Orders; Laws_. By either Carrols or the LLC Member upon delivery of
written notice to the other if any Governmental Authority shall have issued
or entered any final and non-appealable Order or enacted any Law which, in any
such case, (i) permanently restrains, enjoins or otherwise prohibits the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (ii) would
prevent the Closing from occurring as contemplated by this Agreement on or
prior to the applicable time on the End Date; _provided_ that neither Carrols
nor the LLC Member will be entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
this _Section 9.01(e)_ if such Person's (or, in the case of the LLC Member,
any CFP Entity's) material breach of, or material failure to fulfill
any obligation under, this Agreement is a significant cause of the issuance
or entry of such Order or enactment of such Law.

  



  

Section 9.02 _Effect of Termination_. In the event this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to _Section 9.01_ , this Agreement shall become void and
of no effect without liability of any Party (or any Affiliate, stockholder,
member, director, officer, employee, agent, consultant or representative of
such Party or its Affiliates); provided, that, the termination of this
Agreement shall not relieve any Party from any liability for such Party's
willful and material breach of a covenant, representation or warranty
contained in this Agreement occurring prior to such termination, or for such
Party's actual Fraud. The provisions of _Section 7.13(d)_ , this _Section
9.02_ , _Section 9.04_ , _ARTICLE X_ , _ARTICLE XI_ and the Confidentiality
Agreement shall survive any termination hereof. For purposes of this
Agreement, " _willful and material breach_ " shall mean a breach that is a
consequence of an act undertaken, or failed to be undertaken, by the breaching
party with the knowledge that the taking of such act, or the failure to take
such act would, or would reasonably be expected to, result in a material
breach of this Agreement.

  



  

Section 9.03 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time,
the Parties may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the
obligations or other acts of the other Parties or (b) waive compliance with
any of the agreements or conditions contained in this Agreement. Any
agreement on the part of a Party to any such extension or waiver shall be
valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such
Party. The failure of any Party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights
under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such
rights.

  



  

Section 9.04 _Remedies_. Each of the Parties shall have and retain all
rights and remedies, at law or in equity, including rights to specific
performance and injunctive or other equitable relief, arising out of or
relating to a breach or threatened breach of this Agreement. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, each of the parties acknowledges that money
damages would not be a sufficient remedy for any breach or threatened breach
of this Agreement and that irreparable harm would result if this Agreement
were not specifically enforced. Therefore, the rights and obligations of the
parties shall be enforceable by a decree of specific performance issued by
any court of competent jurisdiction, and appropriate injunctive relief may be
applied for and shall be granted in connection therewith, without the
necessity of posting a bond or other security or proving irreparable harm and
without regard to the adequacy of any remedy at Law. A Party's right to
specific performance and injunctive relief shall be in addition to all other
legal or equitable remedies available to such Party.

Agreement, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement

Section 10.03 _Interpretation_.

  



  

(a) When a reference is made in this Agreement to an Article, a Section, an
Exhibit or a Schedule, such reference shall be to an Article, a Section, an
Exhibit or a Schedule of this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The table
of contents and headings contained in this Agreement are for reference
purposes only and shall not in any way affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or
"including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed
by the words "without limitation". The phrases "herein,"
"hereof," "hereunder" and words of similar import shall be deemed to refer to
this Agreement as a whole, including the Exhibits and Schedules hereto, and
not to any particular provision of this Agreement. The words "neither,"
"nor," any," "either" and "or" shall be inclusive and not exclusive. The word
"extent" in the phrase "to the extent" means the degree to which the subject
extends and does not simply mean "if." References to "dollars" or "$" are
references to U.S. dollars. The meaning assigned to each capitalized term
defined and used in this Agreement is equally applicable to both the singular
and the plural forms of such term, and words denoting any gender include all
genders. Where a word or phrase is defined in this Agreement, each of its
other grammatical forms has a corresponding meaning. All terms defined in
this Agreement will have the defined meanings when used in any certificate or
other document made or delivered pursuant to this Agreement unless otherwise
defined in such certificate or document. References to any Person include the
successors and permitted assigns of that Person. A reference to any specific
legislation or to any provision of any legislation includes any amendment to,
and any modification, re-enactment or successor thereof, any legislative
provision substituted therefor and all rules, regulations and statutory
instruments issued thereunder or pursuant thereto, except that, for purposes
of any representations and warranties in this Agreement that are made as a
specific date, references to any specific legislation will be deemed to
refer to such legislation or provision (and all rules, regulations and
statutory instruments issued thereunder or pursuant thereto) as of such date.
References to any Contract are to that Contract as amended, modified or
supplemented from time to time.

  



  

(b) The Parties acknowledge and agree that they have been represented by
legal counsel during, and have participated jointly in, the negotiation and
execution of this Agreement. Accordingly, they waive the application of any
Law, regulation, holding or rule of construction providing that ambiguities
in an agreement or other document will be construed against the Party drafting
such agreement or document.

Section 10.04 _Disclosure Schedules_.

  



  

(a) The CFP Entities have set forth certain information in the CFP Disclosure
Schedule in a section thereof that corresponds to the Section or portion of a
Section of this Agreement to which it relates. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, a matter set forth in one section of the CFP Disclosure
Schedule need not be set forth in any other section of the CFP Disclosure
Schedule so long as its relevance to such other section of the CFP Disclosure
Schedule or Section of this Agreement is reasonably apparent on the face of
the information disclosed in such CFP Disclosure Schedule. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, the mere listing (or inclusion of a copy) of
a document or other item shall not be deemed adequate to disclose an exception
to a representation or warranty made herein (unless the representation or
warranty has to do with the existence of the document or other item
itself) and the provision of monetary or other quantitative thresholds for
disclosure on the CFP Disclosure Schedule does not and shall not be deemed to
create or imply a standard of materiality hereunder.

  



  

(b) Carrols has set forth certain information in the Carrols Disclosure
Schedule in a section thereof that corresponds to the Section or portion of a
Section of this Agreement to which it relates. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, a matter set forth in one section of the Carrols Disclosure
Schedule need not be set forth in any other section of the Carrols Disclosure
Schedule so long as its relevance to such other section of the Carrols
Disclosure Schedule or Section of this Agreement is reasonably apparent
on the face of the information disclosed in such Carrols Disclosure Schedule.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the mere listing (or
inclusion of a copy) of a document or other item shall not be deemed adequate
to disclose an exception to a representation or warranty made herein (unless
the representation or warranty has to do with the existence of the document or
other item itself) and the provision of monetary or other quantitative
thresholds for disclosure on the Carrols Disclosure Schedule does not and
shall not be deemed to create or imply a standard of materiality hereunder.

  



  

(c) The information contained in this Agreement, in the CFP Disclosure
Schedule and in the Carrols Disclosure Schedule is disclosed solely for
purposes of this Agreement, and no information contained herein or therein
will be deemed to be an admission by any Party to any third Person of any
matter whatsoever, including (i) any violation of Law or breach of contractual
obligation or (ii) that such information is material or required to be
provided or disclosed under this Agreement.

  



  

Section 10.05 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this
Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal
or incapable of being enforced by any rule or Law, or public policy, all
other terms, conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any
manner materially adverse to any Party. Upon such determination that any term
or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect
the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in a mutually
acceptable manner to the end that transactions contemplated hereby be
consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible and in
a manner so as to as closely as possible provide the Parties with the
intended benefits, net of the intended burdens, set forth in any such invalid,
void or unenforceable provision.

  



  

   

62

 



    



  

Section 10.06 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and
shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each
of the Parties and delivered to the other Parties.

  



  

Section 10.07 _Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This
Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements (including the documents and
instruments referred to herein and therein, including the CFP Disclosure
Schedules) (a) constitute the entire agreement, and supersede all prior
agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the Parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof, other than the
Confidentiality Agreement which shall survive the execution and delivery of
this Agreement in accordance with its terms and (b) except as provided in
_Section 7.14_ (which is intended for the benefit of only the Persons
specifically named therein) are not intended to confer upon any Person other
than the Parties any rights or remedies; _provided_ that, notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Financing Sources shall be express third-party beneficiaries of
this _Section 10.07(b)_ , _Section 7.13(g)_ , the final sentence of _Section
10.08_ , _Section 10.11_ and _Section 10.12(c)_.

  



  

Section 10.08 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the Laws of the state of Delaware, regardless
of the Laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of
conflicts of Laws thereof.

  



  

Section 10.09 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned, in whole or
in part, by operation of Law or otherwise by any CFP Entity, without the
prior written consent of Carrols in its sole discretion, and by Carrols,
NewCRG or the Merger Subs, without the prior written consent of the LLC Member
in its sole discretion. Any purported assignment without such required
consent shall be void. Subject to the preceding sentences, this Agreement will
be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the Parties
and their respective successors and assigns.

  



  

Section 10.10 _Consent to Jurisdiction_. Each Party (a) consents to submit
itself to the personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware or any federal court within the District of Delaware in the event any
dispute arises out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (b) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal
jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such court, (c)
agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any court other than the Court
of Chancery of the State of Delaware or any federal court within the District
of Delaware and (d) waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the
defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or
Proceeding in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or such Federal
court. Each Party agrees that (i) this Agreement involves at least
$100,000.00 and (ii) this Agreement has been entered into by the Parties in
express reliance upon 6 Del. C. § 2708\. Each Party agrees that a final
judgment in any such action or Proceeding shall be conclusive and may
be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other
manner provided by law. Any judgment from any such court described above may,
however, be enforced by any Party in any other court in any other
jurisdiction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Party, including on behalf
of its Affiliates, (a) agrees that it will not bring, or support the bringing
of, any claim, whether at law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or
otherwise, against any Financing Source, in any way relating to this
Agreement or any of the Mergers or the other transactions contemplated hereby
or by the other Transaction Agreements, including any dispute arising out of
or relating in any way to the Financing or the performance thereof or the
transactions contemplated by the Financing Commitment, in any forum other
than exclusively in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New
York, or, if under applicable Law exclusive jurisdiction is vested in the
federal courts, the United States District Court for the Southern District of
New York (and appellate courts thereof), (b) submits for itself and its
property with respect to any such action to the exclusive jurisdiction of
such courts, (c) agrees that service of process, summons, notice or document
by registered mail addressed to it at its address provided in _Section 10.02_
shall be effective service of process against it for any such action brought
in any such court, (d) hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent
permitted by Law, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the
laying of venue of, and the defense of an inconvenient forum to the
maintenance of, any such action in any such court and (e) agrees that a final
judgment in any such action shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other
jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law.

  



  

   

63

 



    



  

Section 10.11 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH PARTY HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE
FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A
TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY SUIT, ACTION OR OTHER PROCEEDING ARISING OUT
OF THIS AGREEMENT, THE FINANCING OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR
BY THE FINANCING COMMITMENT (INCLUDING IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING, SUIT OR
COUNTERCLAIM AGAINST ANY FINANCING SOURCE). EACH PARTY (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF ANY
ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B)
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER
INTO THIS AGREEMENT, BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND
CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 10.11_.

  



  

Section 10.12 _Amendments and Waivers_.

  



  

(a) Any provision of this Agreement may be amended or waived prior to the
Effective Time if, but only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and is
signed, in the case of an amendment, by each Party to this Agreement or, in
the case of a waiver, by each Party against whom the waiver is to be
effective.

  



  

(b) No failure or delay by any Party in exercising any right, power or
privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or
partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The rights and remedies
herein provided shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or
remedies provided by applicable Laws.

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the
definitions of "Financing Sources" and "Lender," this _Section 10.12(c)_ ,
_Section 7.13(g)_ , _Section 10.07(b)_ , the final sentence of _Section 10.08_
and _Section 10.11_  (and any provision of this Agreement to the extent an
amendment, modification or waiver of such provision would modify the
substance of any such provision or Section) may not be amended, modified or
waived in a manner that is materially adverse in any respect to the Financing
Sources without the prior written consent of the Financing Sources adversely
affected thereby.

  



  

   

64

 



    



  

Section 10.13 _Survival_. The Parties, intending to modify any applicable
statute of limitations, agree that none of the representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements of the Parties in this Agreement or in any schedule,
instrument or other document delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall
survive the Effective Time and all such provisions shall terminate as of the
Effective Time, and thereafter there shall be no liability on the part of,
nor shall any claim be made by, any Person in respect thereof; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that this Section 10.13 shall not limit any claim or recovery
available to Carrols, NewCRG or any of their Affiliates under
any representations and warranties insurance policy that Carrols or NewCRG
may procure in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement in accordance with the terms thereof; _provided further,_ _however_
, that this _Section 10.13_  shall not limit any covenant or agreement of the
Parties that by its terms contemplates performance after the Effective
Time, and such covenants or agreements shall survive until fully performed in
accordance with their respective terms (including, for the avoidance of
doubt, the covenants and agreements set forth in _Section 7.06_ , which the
Parties expressly agree shall survive the Effective Time). Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the provisions of
Section 10.13 will not prevent or limit in any way a cause of action on
account of Fraud.

  



  

Section 10.14 _Non-Recourse_. This Agreement may only be enforced against,
and any claim or cause of action based upon, arising out of, or related to
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby may only be brought
against, the entities that are expressly named as Parties and then only with
respect to the specific obligations set forth herein with respect to such
Party. Except to the extent a named party to this Agreement, no past, present
or future director, officer, employee, incorporator, member, partner,
stockholder, Affiliate, agent, attorney, advisor or representative or
Affiliate of any of the foregoing shall have any liability (whether in
contract, tort, equity or otherwise) for any one or more of the
representations, warranties, covenants, agreements or other obligations
or liabilities of any one or more of the CFP Entities, Carrols or NewCRG
under this Agreement or of or for any claim based on, arising out of, or
related to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.
