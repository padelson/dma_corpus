make any adjustments necessary thereto consistent with the provisions of this
_Section 2.4(b)_, the determination of the Accounting Firm being conclusive
and binding on the Parties; _provided_ , _however_ , that Seller reserves any
and all other rights granted to it in this Agreement. Within three Business
Days of the delivery by Buyer of the Proposed Closing Date Calculations, the
Parties shall deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent
instructing the Escrow Agent to deliver to Seller the excess, if any, of the
Adjustment Escrow Funds over the difference between (x) the Estimated Purchase
Price and (y) the proposed calculation of the Purchase Price proposed by Buyer
in the Proposed Closing Date Calculations.

 



17 (ii) Seller shall have 30 days following receipt of the Proposed Closing Date
Calculations to review such calculations (the " _Review Period_ "). Seller
may, on or prior to the last day of the Review Period, give to Buyer written
notice of dispute, which sets forth its objections to Buyers calculation of
the Proposed Closing Date Calculations (a " _Purchase Price Dispute Notice_
"); _provided_ , _however_ , that in the event that Buyer does not make
available to Seller documents, information or personnel pursuant to  _Section
2.4(b)(iii)_ within five days of request therefor (or such shorter period as
may remain in such 30 day period), such 30 day period shall be extended by one
day for each additional day required for Buyer to fully respond to
such request. Unless Seller delivers a Purchase Price Dispute Notice to Buyer
on or before the last day of the Review Period, Seller and the other Parties
agree that the Proposed Closing Date Calculations shall be deemed to set forth
the final Net Working Capital (and the related Net Working Capital
Adjustment, if any), Cash and Cash Equivalents, Tax Benefit Amount, Closing
Date Indebtedness, Unpaid Seller Expenses and the Purchase Price, in each
case, for all purposes hereunder (including the determination of the Actual
Adjustment). Prior to the end of the Review Period, Seller may accept the
Proposed Closing Date Calculations by delivering written notice to that effect
to Buyer, in which case the Purchase Price will be finally determined when
such notice is given. If Seller gives a Purchase Price Dispute Notice to Buyer
on or prior to the last day of the Review Period, Buyer and Seller shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to resolve any disputes set forth in
the Purchase Price Dispute Notice in good faith during the 30-day period
commencing on the date Buyer receives the applicable Purchase Price Dispute
Notice from Seller. Any item not specifically disputed in the Purchase Price
Dispute Notice shall be deemed final and binding on the Parties (as set forth
in the Proposed Closing Date Calculations, the Purchase Price Dispute Notice
or as otherwise resolved in writing by Seller and Buyer). The Parties
acknowledge and agree that Rule 408 of the Federal Rules of Evidence shall
apply to Buyer and Seller during such 30-day period of negotiations and any
subsequent dispute arising therefrom. If Seller and Buyer do not agree upon a
final resolution with respect to any disputed items set forth in the Purchase
Price Dispute Notice within such 30-day period, then the remaining items in
dispute shall be submitted promptly by Buyer and Seller to KPMG LLP or another
independent accounting firm of national reputation mutually acceptable
to Buyer and Seller (the " _Accounting Firm_ "). Any item not specifically
submitted to the Accounting Firm for evaluation shall be deemed final and
binding on the Parties (as set forth in the Proposed Closing Date
Calculations, the Purchase Price Dispute Notice or as otherwise resolved in
writing by Seller and Buyer) and the Parties shall deliver, within three
Business Days of the delivery of the dispute notice submitted to the
Accounting Firm, joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent instructing
the Escrow Agent to deliver to Seller the excess, if any, of the Adjustment
Escrow Funds over the aggregate value of such items submitted to the
Accounting Firm; _provided_ , that Seller shall not be deemed to have agreed
with any items which are directly or indirectly impacted by the resolution of
the items disputed in the Purchase Price Dispute Notice. The Accounting Firm
shall be requested to render a written determination of the applicable dispute
(acting as an expert and not as an arbitrator) within 45 days after referral
of the matter to such Accounting Firm, which determination must be in writing
and must set forth, in reasonable detail, the basis therefor and must be based
solely on (i) the definitions and other applicable provisions of this
Agreement, (ii) a single presentation (which presentations shall be limited to
the remaining items in dispute set forth in the Proposed Closing Date
Calculations and Purchase Price Dispute Notice) submitted by each of Buyer
and Seller to the Accounting Firm within 15 days after the engagement thereof
(which the Accounting Firm shall forward to the other Party) and (iii) one
written response submitted to the Accounting Firm within five Business Days
after receipt of each such presentation (which the Accounting Firm shall
forward to the other Party),

 



18  and not on independent review, which such determination shall be conclusive
and binding on Buyer and Seller. The terms of appointment and engagement of
the Accounting Firm shall be as reasonably agreed upon between Seller and
Buyer, and any associated engagement fees shall initially be borne 50% by
Seller and 50% by Buyer; _provided_ that such fees shall ultimately be borne
by Seller and Buyer in the same proportion as the aggregate amount of the
disputed items that is unsuccessfully disputed by each such party (as
determined by the Accounting Firm) bears to the total amount of the disputed
items submitted to the Accounting Firm. Except as provided in the preceding
sentence, all other costs and expenses incurred by the Parties in connection
with resolving any dispute hereunder before the Accounting Firm shall be borne
by the Party incurring such cost and expense. The Accounting Firm shall
resolve each disputed item by choosing a value not in excess of, nor less
than, the greatest or lowest value, respectively, set forth in the
presentations (and, if applicable, the responses) delivered to the Accounting
Firm pursuant to this _Section 2.4(b)(ii)_. Such determination of the
Accounting Firm shall be conclusive and binding upon the Parties absent fraud
or manifest error. The Proposed Closing Date Calculations shall be revised as
appropriate to reflect the resolution of any objections thereto pursuant to
this _Section 2.4(b)(ii)_, and, as so revised, such Proposed Closing Date
Calculations shall be deemed to set forth the final Net Working Capital, Cash
and Cash Equivalents, Tax Benefit Amount, Closing Date Indebtedness, Unpaid
Seller Expenses and Purchase Price, in each case, for all purposes hereunder
(including the determination of the Actual Adjustment).

(iii) Buyer shall, and shall cause each Group Company to, promptly make such
Group Companys financial records, supporting documents and work papers and
personnel available to Seller and its accountants and other representatives
(including the Accounting Firm) at reasonable times during the review by
Seller of, and the resolution of any objections with respect to, the Proposed
Closing Date Calculations; _provided_ that Seller has signed a customary
confidentiality and hold harmless agreement relating to access to any such
working papers in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the accountants
of the Group Companies.

 

(iv) Buyer and Seller agree that the procedures set forth in this _Section
2.4_ for resolving disputes with respect to the Proposed Closing Date
Calculations shall be the sole and exclusive method for resolving any such
disputes; _provided_ , that this provision shall not prohibit either Party
from instituting litigation to enforce any final determination of the
Purchase Price by the Accounting Firm pursuant to _Section 2.4(b)(ii)_ or to
compel any Party to submit any dispute arising in connection with this
_Section 2.4(b)_ to the Accounting Firm pursuant to and in accordance with
the terms and conditions set forth in this _Section 2.4(b)_, in each case,
in any court of competent jurisdiction in accordance with _Section 9.14_. The
substance of the Accounting Firms determination shall not be subject to
review or appeal, absent a showing of fraud or manifest error. It is the
intent of the Parties to have any final determination of the Purchase Price by
the Accounting Firm proceed in an expeditious manner; _provided_ that any
deadline or time period contained herein may be extended or modified by the
written agreement of the Parties and the Parties agree that the failure of the
Accounting Firm to strictly conform to any deadline or time period contained
herein shall not be a basis for seeking to overturn any determination
rendered by the Accounting Firm which otherwise conforms to the terms of this
_Section 2.4_.

 



19 (c) _Adjustment to Estimated Purchase Price_.

 

(i) If the Actual Adjustment is a positive amount, then within three Business
Days after the date on which the Purchase Price is finally determined
pursuant to _Section 2.4(b)_, (A) the Parties shall deliver joint written
instructions to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to deliver to
Seller the Adjustment Escrow Funds and (B) Buyer shall pay, or shall cause
the Company to pay, to Seller the amount of the Actual Adjustment in wire
transfer of immediately available funds.

(ii) If the Actual Adjustment is a negative amount, then within three
Business Days after the date on which the Purchase Price is finally determined
pursuant to _Section 2.4(b)_, the Parties shall deliver joint written
instructions to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to deliver to
Buyer an amount equal to the absolute value of such negative amount from the
Adjustment Escrow Funds; _provided_ that if the absolute value of such
negative amount is less than the Adjustment Escrow Amount, then
simultaneously with the delivery of such joint written instructions, the
Parties shall deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent
instructing the Escrow Agent to release any excess funds remaining in the
Adjustment Escrow Account (after payment to Buyer of the absolute value of
such negative amount) to Seller. For the avoidance of doubt, the Adjustment
Escrow Amount shall serve as the sole and exclusive source of recovery for any
amounts owed to Buyer in connection with the final determination of the
Purchase Price and Actual Adjustment pursuant to this _Section 2.4_.

(iii) Any amounts which are paid pursuant to this _Section 2.4(c)_ will be
treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for all purposes hereunder,
except as otherwise required by applicable Law.

 

Section 2.5 _Withholding_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, any party (or its Affiliate or agent) is entitled to deduct and
withhold or cause to be deducted and withheld from any amounts payable
pursuant to this Agreement, such amounts as the party (or its Affiliate or
agent) is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of any
such payment under any applicable provision of Tax Law. To the extent that
amounts are so deducted and withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing
authority, such deducted and withheld amounts are to be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect
of which such deduction and withholding was made. To the extent any party (or
its Affiliate or agent) deducts and withholds or causes to be deducted and
withheld any such amounts, the party (or its Affiliate or agent) shall remit
(or cause to be remitted) to the appropriate taxing authority all such amounts
deducted and withheld or caused to be deducted and withheld.

 

Section 2.6 _Allocation of Purchase Price_. Buyer and Seller agree that a
portion of the Purchase Price (equal to the liquidation value of the
Preferred Units plus all accrued but unpaid dividends thereon as of the
Closing Date under the limited liability company agreement of Midco) shall be
allocated to the Preferred Units, and the remainder of the Purchase Price
shall be allocated to the Common Stock. Except as in good faith required to
settle or resolve any dispute with a taxing authority, neither Buyer nor
Seller shall take any position inconsistent therewith on any Tax Return,
before any Tax authority, or otherwise.

proceeding or similar action (each a " _Proceeding_ ") pending or, to the
Companys Knowledge, threatened in writing against any Group Company or any

officers of a Group Company) or affecting its business, assets, properties or
operations as currently conducted before any Governmental Entity. Except as
set forth on  _Schedule 3.9_, no Group Company is subject to any outstanding

the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

Section 3.10 _Compliance with Applicable Law_.

 

(a) Each Group Company is operating and has at all times during the last five
years operated its business in compliance with all applicable Laws (other
than Health Information Laws, which are addressed in _Section 3.10(c)_
below), except for de minimis instances of non-compliance that have been (or
can reasonably be) cured. During the last five 

 



27  years, no Group Company has received written notice from any Governmental
Entity alleging any failure by it to comply with any Laws (other than Health
Information Laws, which are addressed in  _Section 3.10(c)_ below). There is
no outstanding or, to the Companys Knowledge, threatened, order, writ,
injunction or decree of any Governmental Entity or arbitration tribunal
against or involving any Group Company, the operation of the business of the
Group Companies or the Shares. To the Companys Knowledge, no Group Company
has entered into any Contract with Persons or associations that is in
violation of applicable United States or Indian anti-trust
Law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this _Section 3.10_ does not relate to
Intellectual Property Rights (which are the subject of _Section 3.13_).

 

(b) Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.10(b)_ , the Group Companies hold all
permissions, registrations, accreditations, exemptions, permits, licenses,
approvals, certificates and other authorizations of and from all, and have
made all declarations and filings with, Governmental Entities required to
lawfully conduct its businesses as presently conducted and to own, operate,
or use, as applicable, its assets and properties (collectively, the "
_Permits_ " and, individually, a " _Permit_ "). All Permits are valid and
subsisting in accordance with their terms and are in full force and effect.
Each Group Company is in compliance with all Permits and has not committed
any act or omitted to take any action that is likely to cause it to lose the
benefit of or jeopardize the renewal of any Permit. There are no claims
pending or, to the Companys Knowledge, threatened that seek the revocation,
cancellation, suspension or any adverse modification of any Permits. Each
Group Company is, and at all times during the last five years has been, in
compliance with the terms and requirements of all Permits. To the Companys
Knowledge, no event has occurred or circumstance exists that may (i)
constitute or result directly or indirectly in a violation of or a failure to
comply with any term or requirement of any Permit or (ii) result directly or
indirectly in the revocation, withdrawal, suspension, cancellation,
termination or nonrenewal of, or any modification to, any Permit. During the
last five years, no Group Company has received any written notice from any
Governmental Entity, accrediting body or any other Person regarding (x) any
actual, alleged, possible or potential material violation of or material
failure by a Group Company to comply with any term or requirement of any
Permit or (y) any actual, proposed, possible or potential revocation,
withdrawal, suspension, cancellation or termination of, or modification to,
any Permit. All applications required to have been filed for the renewal of
the Permits have been duly filed on a timely basis with the appropriate
Governmental Entities or accrediting bodies, and all other filings required to
have been made with respect to such Permits have been duly made on a timely
basis with the appropriate Governmental Entities or accrediting bodies,
except, in each case, as would not reasonably be expected to affect the
operation of the Group Companies business, as presently conducted, in more
than a de minimis manner. To the Companys Knowledge, there is no reasonable
basis to expect that any Permits will not be reissued or transferred, in each
case on materially similar terms as currently existing, if required as a
result of the execution of this Agreement and/or the consummation of the
Transactions. 

(c) Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.10(c)_ : (i) the Group Companies are,
and at all times during the last five years have been, in material compliance
with all applicable Health Information Laws, in each case to the extent such
Health Information Laws require compliance by the applicable the Group
Company, and have (x) performed a risk assessment of the appropriate
administrative and technical safeguards with respect to the health information
it maintains or transmits as appropriate under the Health Information Laws,
(y) used their

 



28  commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate risks identified in such risk
assessment in all respects necessary to ensure that the applicable the Group
Company is in compliance with the safeguard requirements of the Health
Information Laws, and (z) during the last five years have maintained all
individually identifiable health information, including protected health
information (as defined under HIPAA at 45 C.F.R. § 160.103), governed by the
Health Information Laws and in accordance with the Health Information Laws;
(ii) the Group Companies are, and at all times have been during the last five
years, in material compliance with the terms of the Business
Associate Contracts (as defined under HIPAA at 45 C.F.R. §§ 164.308(b) and
164.314(a)) to which such Group Companies are a party or otherwise bound;
(iii) the Group Companies have not received any written complaints or notices
from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, U.S. Office for Civil
Rights, or any other Governmental Entity regarding the Group Companies
compliance with the Health Information Laws, and during the last five years no
security breach or other incident has occurred that could reasonably be
expected to result in any such complaints or notices; and (iv) none of the
Group Companies and, to the Companys Knowledge, no Business Associate (as
defined under HIPAA at 45 C.F.R. § 160.103) of any of the Group Companies, is
the subject of, or a party to, any civil, criminal or administrative
proceeding or investigation by a Governmental Entity in connection with any
actual or potential violation of the Health Information Laws (other than
routine surveys or reviews). For purposes of this Agreement, " _Health
Information Laws_ " means all federal and state Laws relating to the privacy
and security of patient, medical or individual health information,
including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as
amended and supplemented by the Health Information Technology for Clinical
Health Act of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, Pub. Law No.
111-5 and its implementing regulations, when each is effective and as each is
amended from time to time (collectively, (" _HIPAA_ ")).

(d) None of the Group Companies is a party to or has any ongoing reporting
obligations pursuant to any corporate integrity agreements, deferred
prosecution agreements, monitoring agreements, consent decrees, settlement
orders, plans of correction or similar agreements with or imposed by any
Governmental Entity. Additionally, none of the Group Companies or any of their
respective officers or directors or, as of August 1, 2014 (and, to the
Knowledge of the Company, thereafter) employees: (i) has been excluded,

care program or, to the Companys Knowledge, is subject to a Proceeding that
could reasonably be expected to result in debarment, suspension, or
exclusion, or (ii) has engaged in activities in connection with such Persons
duties as an officer, director or employee of any Group Company, which
activities are, as applicable, cause for false claims liability,
civil penalties or mandatory or permissive exclusion from any U.S. state or
federal healthcare program.

Section 3.11 _Employee Plans_.

(a) _Schedule 3.11(a)_ lists all material Employee Benefit Plans and, to the
Knowledge of the Company, all Employee Benefit Plans. Except for the Seller
Incentive Plans, to the Knowledge of the Company, no Key Employee or current
executive officer of the Group Companies participates in or receives (or is
eligible to receive) any material compensation or material benefits from any
plan, program, arrangement or agreement maintained, adopted, entered into or
contributed to by Seller or any Affiliate of Seller other than the Company or
its Subsidiaries.

 



29 (b) The Group Companies have made available to Buyer a true and complete copy,
as applicable, of (i) each Employee Benefit Plan (including any amendments
thereto) set forth on _Schedule 3.11(a)_ and descriptions of all material

application for a determination letter or opinion letter with respect to any
Employee Benefit Plan that is intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the
Code, (v) all material records, notices and filings concerning Internal
Revenue Service or U.S. Department of Labor audits or investigations relating
to any Employee Benefit Plan for the previous three plan years, and (vi) the
most recently prepared actuarial reports, financial statements and
trustee reports, if any, relating to the Employee Benefit Plan. Except as set
forth in the documents made available to Buyer in accordance with this
_Section 3.11(b)_ or on _Schedule 3.11(b)_ , no Group Company has any plan or
commitment to adopt or enter into any additional Employee Benefit Plan or to
amend or terminate any existing Employee Benefit Plan.

(c) No Employee Benefit Plan is, and no Group Company contributes to, has at
any time contributed to or has any liability or obligation, whether fixed or
contingent, with respect to (i) a Multiemployer Plan, (ii) a single employer
plan or other pension plan that is subject to Title IV of ERISA or Section
302 of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code, (iii) a "multiple employer plan"
(within the meaning of Section 413(c) of the Code), (iv) a multiple employer
welfare arrangement (within the meaning of Section 3(40) of ERISA) or (v) a
voluntary employee benefit association under Section 501(a)(9) of the Code.
Except as provided in any employment agreement or severance plan or agreement
set forth in  _Schedule 3.11(a)_ , no Group Company has any obligation to
provide (whether under an Employee Benefit Plan or otherwise) health, welfare
or life insurance benefits to any current or former employees or directors of
any Group Company (or any spouse, beneficiary or dependent of the foregoing)
beyond the termination of employment or other service of such employee or
director, other than health continuation coverage pursuant to COBRA. No Group
Company has incurred or may incur any liability or obligation, with respect
to any "employee benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA) that is
not sponsored by such Group Company by reason of being treated as a single
employer under Section 414 of the Code with any trade, business or entity
other than any Group Company, including without limitation, under Title IV of
ERISA or COBRA.

(d) Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.11(d)_ , each Employee Benefit Plan
has been maintained, operated and administered in compliance in all material
respects with its terms and the applicable requirements of ERISA, the Code and
any other applicable Laws. All material payments, benefits, contributions
(including all employer contributions and employee salary reduction
contributions) and premiums related to each Employee Benefit Plan, including
all bonuses, benefits and other compensation due to or on behalf of any
employees or other service providers, have been timely paid or made in
accordance with the requirements of applicable Law or, to the extent not yet
due, properly accrued on the Latest Balance Sheet in accordance with GAAP.
Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.11(d)_ , no material Proceeding is pending
or, to the Companys Knowledge, threatened against, by or on behalf of any
Employee

 



30  Benefit Plan or the assets, fiduciaries or administrators thereof (other
than claims for benefits in the ordinary course of business). With respect to
each Employee Benefit Plan, (i) to the Companys Knowledge, no breaches of
fiduciary duty or other failures to act or comply in connection with the
administration or investment of the assets of such Employee Benefit Plan have
occurred, and (ii) no Lien has been imposed under the Code, ERISA or any
other applicable Law. There has not been any prohibited transaction (within
the meaning of Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code) with respect
to any Employee Benefit Plan that could reasonably be expected to result in
material liability to any Group Company.

(e) Each Employee Benefit Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section
401(a) of the Code has received a favorable determination letter from the
Internal Revenue Service or is the subject of a favorable opinion letter from
the Internal Revenue Service on the form of such Employee Benefit Plan and, to
the Companys Knowledge, there are no facts or circumstances that would be
reasonably likely to result in the loss of the qualified status of any such
Employee Benefit Plan. Each trust established in connection with any Employee
Benefit Plan which is intended to be exempt from federal income taxation
under Section 501(a) of the Code is so exempt, and, to the Companys
Knowledge, no fact or event has occurred that would reasonably be expected to
adversely affect the exempt status of any such trust. To the Companys
Knowledge, (i) each of the Employee Benefit Plans that provides medical,
dental and/or prescription benefits is insured by bona fide third-party
insurers and (ii) no Employee Benefit Plan is maintained through a human
resources and benefits outsourcing entity or professional employer
organization.

(f) To the Companys Knowledge, no Group Company has engaged in any
transaction with respect to any Employee Benefit Plan that would be reasonably
likely to subject any Group Company to any material Tax or penalty (civil or
otherwise) imposed by ERISA, the Code or other applicable Law (including,
without limitation, any excise tax under Chapter 43 of the Code). Except as
set forth on _Schedule 3.11(f)_ , no Group Company has made any filing in
respect of any Employee Benefit Plan under the Employee Plans
Compliance Resolution System or the Department of Labor Delinquent Filer
Program.

(g) Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.11(g)_ , no Employee Benefit Plan, and
neither any Group Company nor any Employee Benefit Plan fiduciary with respect
to any Employee Benefit Plan, in any case, is the subject of an audit or
investigation by the Internal Revenue Service, the Department of Labor,
the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation or any other Governmental Entity,
nor is any such audit or investigation pending or, to the Companys Knowledge,
threatened.

 

(h) Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.11(h)_ , neither the execution and
delivery of this Agreement, nor the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby (where such event alone would not have such effect) will
(i) entitle any current or former employee, consultant or director of any
Group Company to any payment; (ii) increase the amount of compensation
or benefits due to any such employee, consultant or director; or (iii)
accelerate the vesting, funding or time of payment of any compensation, equity
award or other benefit.

 

(i) Each material Employee Benefit Plan that is governed by the Laws of any
jurisdiction other than the United States or provides compensation (other
than base compensation

 



31  or base wages) or benefits to any employee or former employee of any Group
Company (or any dependent thereof) who resides outside of the United States
(each a " _Foreign Benefit Plan_ ") is identified as such on _Section
3.11(i)_. With respect to each Foreign Benefit Plan, (i) such Foreign Benefit
Plan has been maintained, funded and administered in material compliance with
applicable Laws and the requirements of such Foreign Benefit Plans governing
documents and any applicable collective bargaining agreements, (ii) all
material contributions to such Foreign Benefit Plan have been timely paid or
made in accordance with the requirements of applicable Law or, to the extent
not yet due, properly accrued on the Latest Balance Sheet in accordance with
GAAP, (iii) such Foreign Benefit Plan has obtained from the Governmental
Entity having jurisdiction with respect to such Foreign Benefit Plan any
required determinations, if any, that such Foreign Benefit Plan is in
compliance in all material respects with the applicable Laws and regulations
of the relevant jurisdiction if such determinations are required in order to
give effect to such Foreign Benefit Plan, and (iv) there are no pending or, to
the Companys Knowledge, threatened investigations by any Governmental Entity,
Proceedings or claims (except for claims for benefits in the ordinary course
of business) against such Foreign Benefit Plan. No Foreign Benefit Plan has
any unfunded or underfunded liabilities not accurately accrued in accordance
with GAAP.

 

(j) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement, nor the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby, either alone or in combination with
another event (whether contingent or otherwise) will result in any "parachute
payment" under Section 280G of the Code (or any corresponding provision of
state, local, or foreign Tax Law).

 

(k) Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.11(k)_ , there is no Contract,
agreement, plan or arrangement to which any Group Company is a party which
requires any Group Company to pay a Tax gross-up or reimbursement payment to
any Person, including without limitation, with respect to any Tax-related
payments under Section 409A of the Code or Section 280G of the Code.

 

(l) The Companys Employee Benefit Plans are and have at all relevant times
been maintained in operational and documentary compliance with the
requirements of Section 409A of the Code and the regulations thereunder or an
applicable exception thereto, and the Company has not reported, nor to the
Companys Knowledge, will the Company be required to report, any
violations of Section 409A of the Code with respect to compensation paid to
its employees, directors or consultants.

case so as to give rise to any liability (other than de minimis liabilities)
for the Group Companies under any applicable Environmental Law.

 



32 (c) The Group Companies hold all permits, licenses and other authorizations
that are required pursuant to Environmental Laws for the lawful conduct of
their respective businesses as presently conducted.

under, any Environmental Laws.

 

(e) This _Section 3.12_ contains the sole and exclusive representations and
warranties of the Company with respect to environmental matters, including
any matters arising under Environmental Laws.

Section 3.13 _Intellectual Property_. 

(a) _Schedule 3.13(a)_ sets forth a true and complete list of all registered
trademarks, service marks or trade names, applications to register trademarks
and service marks, issued patents, patent applications, registered copyrights,
applications to register copyrights and domain name registrations, in each
case, owned or filed by or on behalf of the Group Companies on the
date hereof (collectively, " _Company Registered IP_ "), specifying as to
each such item, the owner, the jurisdiction, the application, and the
registration or issuance number. All right, title and interest in and to all
Company Registered IP, and all other Intellectual Property Rights necessary
for or used in the business or operations of the Group Companies as presently
conducted, (collectively, " _Company Intellectual Property_ ") is owned by the
Group Companies free and clear of all Liens, except for Liens listed in
_Schedule 3.13(a)_ , or, to the Companys Knowledge, is used or held for use

cancelled, has been maintained effective by all requisite filings, renewals
and payment and remains in full force and effect.

information, as well as all other information of the Group Companies that
derives economic value (actual or potential) from not being generally known to
third persons, including taking all commercially reasonable steps to
safeguard any such information that is accessible through computer systems or
networks; _provided_ that Buyer acknowledges that no member of the Group
Companies was under any obligation to file or apply for protection of, or
register, any Intellectual Property Rights. Except as set forth on _Schedule
3.13(b)_ , the Group Companies have been and are currently operating in
compliance, in all material respects, with all applicable Information Privacy
and Security Laws, and, to the Companys Knowledge, no equityholder, officer,
or director of the Group Companies, has engaged in any act on behalf of such
entity that violates any Information Privacy and Security Laws. None of the
Group Companies has received any written notice from any Governmental Entity
of any violation of any Information Privacy and Security Laws by any of the
Group Companies in the last three years. The Group Companies have established
and maintain commercially reasonable data and information security programs
and privacy policies. The

 



33  Group Companies have at all times during the last three years complied in
all material respects with any rules, policies and procedures established by

Software incorporates or is comprised of or is distributed with any Open
Source Software (or is otherwise subject to the provisions of any "open
source" license agreement) in a manner that: (i) causes the Group Companies to
have any duty or obligation to deliver, license or make available the source
code for the Company Product Software to any Person (and no event has
occurred, and no circumstance or condition exists under any such license
agreement or Contract granting rights to Open Source Software that (with or
without notice or lapse of time) will, or could reasonably be expected to,
result in the delivery, license or disclosure of the source code for any

operation of, or provide unauthorized access to, a computer system or network
or other device on which such code is stored or installed, or to damage or

modification or corruption. The Group Companies have implemented commercially
reasonable data backup, data storage, system redundancy and disaster avoidance
and recovery procedures with respect to their IT Assets designed to maintain,
to the extent practicable, uninterrupted operation of the business of the
Group Companies. All IT Assets are covered by reasonable maintenance
agreements, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
will not adversely affect any Group Companys entitlement to the benefit of
such arrangements or require additional payments or consents of other Persons.

Knowledge, there has not been any access, use, or modification by any
unauthorized Person of any Software that is an IT Asset (including any data),
or fraud committed by use or abuse of the IT Assets. Notwithstanding the

of cancellation or termination has been received by any Group Company with
respect to any such Policy. The Group Companies and their respective assets

except for Permitted Liens. The Assets are fit for the purposes for which
they are used or intended to be used in connection with the provision of the
services to be provided by Buyer and its Affiliates and are sufficient for the
operation of the business of the Group Companies as presently conducted. All
of the Assets, owned or leased, are in good operating condition and repair
(with the exception of normal wear and tear), and are free from defects other
than such defects as would not interfere with the intended use thereof
in connection with the provision of the services to be provided by Buyer and
its Affiliates. All of the Assets shall be owned by or available for use by
each Group Company immediately after the Closing on terms and conditions
identical to those under which such Group Company owned or used the Assets
immediately prior to the Closing.

Companies (other than any Group Company or any

 



41  employee of any Group Company), on the other hand, that will not be
terminated effective as of the Closing Date. Except as disclosed on _Schedule
3.20_, none of the Group Companies and their respective Affiliates, directors

of, any Person (other than any Group Company) which is a client, supplier,
customer, lessor, lessee, or competitor of any Group Company; _provided_ ,
that ownership of five percent or less of any class of securities of a company
whose securities are registered under the Securities and Exchange Act of

and has heretofore been conducted on bona fide arms-length terms and that
there exist no circumstances for any transfer pricing related adjustments. All
legal formalities have been fulfilled with respect to each of such Affiliate
Transaction, including any required filings with, or approvals by, any
Governmental Entity.

Section 3.21 _No Unlawful Payments_. None of any Group Company, any of their
respective directors, officers, employees or agents or any other Person
acting on behalf of any Group Company has (in the case of directors, officers,
employees, agents and other Persons acting on behalf of any Group Company, in
connection with acting on behalf of a Group Company) (i) used any corporate
funds for any unlawful contribution, gift, entertainment or other unlawful
expense relating to political activity; (ii) made any direct or indirect
unlawful payment to any foreign or domestic government official or employee
from corporate funds; (iii) taken any action (a) in furtherance of an offer,

acting in an official capacity for or on behalf of any of the foregoing, or
any political party or party official or candidate for political office) to

unlawful payment; or (v) given or agreed to give, directly or indirectly, any
gift or similar benefit to any governmental employee which (x) if not given in
the past, would have been reasonably expected to, individually or in the

cancellation or acceleration) under any of the terms, conditions or provisions

under _Section 2.4_ (including to pay the Purchase Price, any Funded
Indebtedness, the Unpaid Seller Expenses and the fees

 



46  and expenses of Buyer related to the transactions contemplated hereby) and
any other amounts incurred or otherwise payable by Buyer in connection with
the transactions contemplated hereby, and there is no restriction on the use
of such cash for such purposes. Buyer has the financial resources and
capabilities to fully perform its obligations under this Agreement, and there
is no circumstance or condition that, individually or in the aggregate with
all other circumstances or conditions, could reasonably be expected to prevent
or substantially delay the availability of such funds at the Closing. Buyer
acknowledges and agrees that its obligations hereunder are not subject to
any conditions regarding its or any other Persons ability to obtain
financing for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, this _Section 5.5_ takes into account
the Parent Guarantee.

Section 5.6 _Acquisition of Equity For Investment_. Buyer has such knowledge
and experience in financial and business matters that it is capable of
evaluating the merits and risks of its purchase of the Shares. Buyer confirms
that it can bear the economic risk of its investment in the Shares and can
afford to lose its entire investment in the Shares, has been furnished the
materials relating to the purchase of the Shares which Buyer has requested,
and the Company has provided Buyer and its representatives the opportunity to
ask questions of the officers and management employees of the business and to
acquire additional information about the business and financial condition of
the Group Companies. Buyer is acquiring the Shares for investment and not with
a view toward or for sale in connection with any distribution thereof, or with
any present intention of distributing or selling such Shares. Buyer agrees
that the Shares may not be sold, transferred, offered for sale, pledged,
hypothecated or otherwise disposed of without compliance with applicable
United States prospectus and registration requirements, except pursuant to an
exemption therefrom under applicable United States securities Laws.

Section 5.7  _Solvency_. Buyer is not entering into the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement with the actual intent to hinder, delay or
defraud either present or future creditors of the Group Companies. Buyer is
Solvent as of the date of this Agreement and, assuming (a) the accuracy of
the representations and warranties of the Company in _Article 3_ and (b) the
satisfaction of the conditions to Buyers obligation to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby, Buyer and each of the Group Companies (on
both a stand-alone and on a combined basis) will, immediately after giving
effect to all of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
the payment of the Purchase Price, Funded Indebtedness, Unpaid Seller
Expenses, all other amounts required to be paid, borrowed or refinanced in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and all related fees and expenses, be Solvent at and after the
Closing Date. 

Section 5.8 _Acknowledgment and Representations by Buyer_. Buyer acknowledges
and agrees that it (i) has conducted its own independent review and analysis
of, and, based thereon, has formed an independent judgment concerning, the
business, assets, condition, operations and prospects of the Group Companies,
and (ii) has been furnished with or given full access to all information
about the Group Companies and their respective businesses and operations as
Buyer and its representatives and advisors have requested. In entering into
this Agreement, Buyer has relied solely upon its own investigation
and analysis and the representations and warranties of the Company and Seller
set forth in this Agreement, and Buyer acknowledges that, other than as set
forth in this Agreement and in the certificates or other instruments delivered
pursuant hereto, none of the Group Companies or any of their respective

 



47  directors, officers, employees, Affiliates, equityholders, agents or
representatives makes or has made any representation or warranty, either
express or implied, (a) as to the accuracy or completeness of any of the
information provided or made available to Buyer or any of its respective
agents, representatives, lenders or Affiliates prior to the execution of this
Agreement and (b) with respect to any projections, forecasts, estimates,
plans or budgets of future revenues, expenses or expenditures, future results
of operations (or any component thereof), future cash flows (or any component
thereof) or future financial condition (or any component thereof) of any
Group Company heretofore or hereafter delivered to or made available to Buyer
or any of its respective agents, representatives, lenders or Affiliates.

Nothing in this _Section 6.1_ is intended to result in any Group Company
ceding control to Buyer of any Group Companys basic ordinary course of
business and commercial decisions prior to the Closing. Additionally, nothing
herein shall prohibit the Group Companies from using all available cash to
repay any Funded Indebtedness and Seller Expenses prior to the Closing.

 



50 Section 6.2 _Access to Information_. From and after the date hereof until the
earlier of the Closing Date and the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with its terms, upon reasonable notice, and subject to restrictions
contained in any confidentiality agreement to which any Group Company is
subject, each Group Company shall provide to Buyer and its authorized
representatives during normal business hours reasonable access to all books
and records and the management employees, officers and agents of the Group
Companies (in a manner so as to not interfere with the normal business
operations of any Group Company); _provided_ , that the Group Companies and
their respective representatives shall have no obligation to provide Buyer and
its representatives access to any books or records to the extent such books
and records do not pertain to the business of any Group Company and, to such
extent, any Group Company and its representatives are entitled to withhold
access to or redact any portion of such books and records. All of
such information shall be treated as confidential information pursuant to the
terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, the provisions of which are by this
reference hereby incorporated herein and Buyer agrees that it shall be bound
by the Confidentiality Agreement to the same extent as Cognizant Technology
Solutions US Corporation. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth
in this Agreement, during the period from the date hereof until the Closing,
neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates (including the Group Companies)
shall be required to disclose to Buyer or any of its representatives (a) any
information (i) to the extent related to the sale or divestiture process
conducted by Seller or its Affiliates for the Group Companies vis-a-vis any
Person other than Buyer and its Affiliates, or Sellers or its Affiliates (or
their representatives) evaluation of the business of the Group Companies in
connection therewith, including projections, financial and other information
relating thereto, (ii) if Seller or any of its Affiliates, on the one hand,
and Buyer or any of its Affiliates, on the other hand, are adverse parties in
a litigation and such information is reasonably pertinent thereto, or (iii)
if Seller reasonably determines upon the advice of counsel that such
information should not be so disclosed due to its competitively sensitive
nature, or (b) any information relating to Taxes or Tax Returns other
than information relating to the Group Companies.

Section 6.3 _Efforts to Consummate_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided, each of Seller and
Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things reasonably
necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws and regulations to
consummate and make effective as promptly as practicable the transactions
contemplated hereby (including (i) the satisfaction, but not waiver, of the
closing conditions set forth in _Article 7_ and obtaining consents of all
Governmental Entities necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby and (ii) using commercially reasonable efforts to provide assistance
in connection with any financing activities undertaken by Buyer or its
Affiliates related to the transactions contemplated hereby, including
providing Buyer and any of its lenders with customary diligence materials
with respect to the Group Companies and comfort letters from Sellers and the
Companys auditors with respect to the Financial Statements and any financial
statements to be delivered at the Closing). The filing fees under any
Antitrust Laws will be split equally between Buyer and Seller. Each Party
shall make an appropriate filing, if necessary, pursuant to all applicable
Antitrust Laws, including the HSR Act (which, in the case of the HSR Act,
filing shall specifically request early termination of the waiting period
prescribed by the HSR Act) with respect to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement promptly (and in any event, within five Business Days) after
the date of this Agreement and shall supply as promptly as practicable to the
appropriate Governmental Entities any additional information and documentary
material that may be requested pursuant to any Antitrust Laws.

 



51  Without limiting the foregoing, Buyer and Seller and their respective
Affiliates shall not take any action that has or may have the effect of
extending any waiting period or comparable period under any Antitrust Laws or
enter into any agreement with any Governmental Entity not to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby, except with the prior written consent of
Buyer and Seller.

 

(b) In the event any Proceeding by a Governmental Entity or other Person is
commenced which questions the validity or legality of the transactions
contemplated hereby or seeks damages in connection therewith, the Parties
agree to cooperate and use all reasonable efforts to defend against such
Proceeding and, if an injunction or other order is issued in any such action,
suit or other proceeding, to use all commercially reasonable efforts to have
such injunction or other order lifted, and to use commercially reasonable
efforts regarding any other impediment to the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby.

 

(c) Seller and Buyer shall permit counsel for the other Party reasonable
opportunity to review in advance, and consider in good faith the views of the
other Party in connection with, any proposed written communication to any
Governmental Entity relating to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Each of Seller and Buyer agrees not to participate in any
substantive meeting or discussion, either in person or by telephone with any
Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement unless it consults with the other Party in advance and, to the
extent not prohibited by such Governmental Entity, gives the other Party the
opportunity to attend and participate in such meeting or discussion.

(d) During the period from the date of this Agreement and continuing until
the earlier of the termination of this Agreement or the Closing, except as
required by this Agreement, Buyer and its Affiliates shall not engage in any
action or enter into any transaction or permit any action to be taken or
transaction to be entered into, that would reasonably be expected to
materially impair or delay Buyers ability to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or perform its obligations hereunder.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, none of Buyer, the
Subsidiaries of Buyer or their respective Affiliates shall acquire (whether by
merger, consolidation, stock or asset purchase or otherwise), or agree to so
acquire, any amounts of assets of or any equity in any other Person or any
business or division thereof, unless that acquisition or agreement would not
reasonably be expected to (i) increase the risk of not obtaining any
authorizations, consents, orders, declarations or approvals of any
Governmental Entity necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (including pursuant to any Antitrust Laws) or the expiration or
termination of any waiting period under the HSR Act, or (ii) increase the
risk of any Governmental Entity entering an order prohibiting the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or increase the risk of
not being able to remove any such order on appeal or otherwise.
Notwithstanding anything the contrary herein, the Companys, Buyers and
their respective Affiliates consummation of any transactions with customers
and prospective customers announced prior to the date of this Agreement shall
not constitute a violation of this _Section 6.3_.

(e) Each of the Parties shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
cooperate in all respects with each other in connection with any filing or
submission with a Governmental Entity required in connection with the
Transactions.

 



52 (f) For the purposes of this _Section 6.3_ and _Section 8.1_, (i) Buyers
and Sellers "commercially reasonable efforts" shall expressly include
contesting, defending, appealing any threatened or pending preliminary or
permanent injunction or other order, decree or ruling or statute, rule,
regulation or executive order, or denial of clearance, that would adversely
affect the ability of any Party to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and (ii) Buyers "commercially reasonable efforts" shall
expressly exclude (A) selling, licensing or otherwise disposing of, or holding
separate and agreeing to sell, license or otherwise dispose of (i) any
entities, assets or facilities of any Group Company after the Closing or (ii)
any entity, facility or asset of Buyer or its Affiliates before or after the
Closing, (B) terminating, amending or assigning existing relationships and
contractual rights and obligations (other than terminations that would result
in a breach of a contractual obligation to a third party), (C) restricting
any business operations or prospective business operations, and (D) amending,
assigning or terminating existing licenses or other agreements (other than
terminations that would result in a breach of a license or such other
agreement with a third party) and entering into such new licenses or other
agreements.

 

(g) Buyer shall promptly reimburse the Company for all reasonable and
documented out-of-pocket costs (including reasonable attorneys fees)
incurred by the Group Companies or their respective representatives in
connection with their respective obligations pursuant to, and in accordance
with, _Section 6.3(a)(ii)_, and shall indemnify and hold harmless the Group
Companies and their respective representatives from and against any and all
damages, losses, costs, liabilities or expenses suffered or incurred by any of
them as a result of the arrangement of Buyers financing and any information
used in connection therewith (other than information provided by the Group
Companies) and all other actions taken by any Group Company and its respective
representatives pursuant to _Section 6.3(a)(ii)_.

 

Section 6.4 _Public Announcements_. At all times prior to the Closing, Buyer
and Seller shall consult with one another and seek one anothers approval
(not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) before issuing any
press release, or otherwise making any public statements, with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and shall not issue any such
press release or make any such public statement prior to such consultation and
approval; _provided_ that (i) each Party may make any such announcement which
it in good faith believes, based on advice of counsel, is necessary or
advisable in connection with any requirement of Law or regulation, it being
understood and agreed that each Party shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to provide the other Parties with copies of any such announcement in
advance of such issuance and (ii) the foregoing shall not prohibit a Party
from answering questions presented on investor calls or similar forums to the
extent not inconsistent with any such press release or any other jointly
approved public statement made prior to such calls or forums.

Section 6.5 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_.

 

(a) Buyer agrees that all rights to indemnification, exculpation and
advancement of expenses existing as of the date of this Agreement in favor of
the directors, officers, employees, fiduciaries, trustees and agents of each
Group Company, as provided in the Group Companies Governing Documents or set
forth on _Schedule 6.5_ with respect to any matters occurring prior to
the Closing Date, shall survive the transactions contemplated by this

 



53  Agreement and shall continue in full force and effect and that Buyer shall
cause the Group Companies (on their own or on Sellers behalf) to perform and
discharge the Group Companies obligations to provide such indemnification,
exculpation and advancement of expenses. To the maximum extent permitted by
applicable Law, such indemnification shall be mandatory rather than
permissive, and Buyer shall cause the Group Companies to advance expenses in
connection with such indemnification as provided in the applicable Group
Companys Governing Documents or other applicable agreements. The
indemnification, liability limitation, exculpation or advancement of
expenses provisions of the Group Companies Governing Documents shall not be
amended, repealed or otherwise modified after the Closing Date in any manner
that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of individuals who, as of
the Closing Date or at any time prior to the Closing Date, were directors,
officers, employees, fiduciaries, trustees or agents of Seller or any Group
Company, unless such modification is required by applicable Law.

 

(b) The Group Companies may purchase, prior to the Closing, at Buyers cost
and expense, a "tail" policy providing employee practices, fiduciaries,
trustees, directors and officers liability insurance coverage for a period
of six years after the Closing Date for the benefit of those Persons who are
covered by any Group Companys employee practices, fiduciaries, trustees,
directors and officers liability insurance policies as of the date hereof or
at the Closing, with respect to matters occurring prior to the Closing;
_provided_ , that if the Group Companies do not purchase any such policy on
or prior to the Closing Date, Buyer shall cause the Group Companies to
purchase and maintain in effect, beginning on the Closing and for a period of
six years thereafter, without any lapses in coverage, a policy providing
employee practices, fiduciaries, trustees, directors and officers
liability insurance coverage for the benefit of those Persons who are covered
by any Group Companys employee practices, fiduciaries, trustees,
directors and officers liability insurance policies as of the date hereof or
at the Closing. Such a policy shall provide coverage that is at least equal to
the coverage provided under Sellers or the Group Companies current employee
practices, fiduciaries, trustees, directors and officers liability
insurance policies; _provided_ that the Group Companies may substitute
therefor policies of at least the same coverage containing terms and
conditions which are no less advantageous to the beneficiaries thereof so long
as such substitution does not result in gaps or lapses in coverage with
respect to matters occurring prior to the Closing Date.

 

(c) Buyer agrees, and will cause the Group Companies, not to take any action
that would have the effect of limiting the aggregate amount of insurance
coverage required to be maintained for the individuals referred to in this
_Section 6.5_. If Buyer, any Group Company or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) shall merge or consolidate with or merge into
any other corporation or entity and shall not be the surviving or continuing
corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) shall transfer
all or substantially all of their respective properties and assets as an
entity in one or a series of related transactions to any individual,
corporation or other entity, then in each such case, proper provision shall be
made so that to provide for the successors or assigns of Buyer or such Group
Company shall assume all of the obligations set forth in this _Section 6.5_;
_provided_ that neither Buyer nor such Group Company shall be relieved from
such obligation.

 

(d) The directors, officers, employees, fiduciaries, trustees and agents of
Seller and each Group Company entitled to the indemnification, liability
limitation, exculpation and insurance set forth in this _Section 6.5_ are
intended to be third party beneficiaries of this

 



54   _Section 6.5_. This _Section 6.5_ shall survive the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and shall be binding on all
successors and assigns of Buyer. This _Section 6.5_ shall not apply to any
liabilities incurred by Seller, Apax Europe VII GP Co. Ltd, Apax Partners,
L.P. or any of their Affiliates in connection with any claim brought by any
Parent Indemnitee pursuant to  _Section 9.12(b)_.

Section 6.6 _Exclusive Dealing_. During the period from the date of this
Agreement until the earlier of the Closing Date or the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with its terms, the Company shall not take, nor shall
it permit any of its direct and indirect equityholders and other Affiliates,
partners, officers, directors, employees, representatives, consultants,
financial advisors, attorneys, accountants or other agents to: (i) solicit,
initiate discussions or engage in negotiations with any Person (which shall
include for the purposes of this  _Section 6.6_ a group as defined in
Section 13(d)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) (whether
such negotiations are initiated by the Company, an Affiliate, a third party or
otherwise), other than Buyer or its Affiliates, relating to the possible
direct or indirect acquisition of any portion of the equity or material
portion of the assets of Seller or any Group Company (whether by way of
merger, purchase of equity, purchase of assets, loan or otherwise) or a
refinancing or recapitalization of the Company (an " _Acquisition Transaction_
"); (ii) provide information or documentation with respect to the Company to,
or otherwise cooperate with, any Person, other than Buyer or its Affiliates
or its or their representatives, relating to an Acquisition Transaction; or
(iii) enter into any definitive agreement with any Person, other than Buyer or
its Affiliates effecting an Acquisition Transaction; _provided_ ,  _however_
, that Buyer hereby acknowledges that prior to the date of this Agreement, the
Company has provided information relating to the Group Companies and has
afforded access to, and engaged in discussions with, other Persons in
connection with a proposed Acquisition Transaction and that such prior
provision of information, access and discussions shall not constitute a breach
by the Company of this _Section 6.6_ so long as none of the Company or its
Affiliates, partners, officers, directors, employees, representatives,
consultants, financial advisors, attorneys, accountants or agents provides any
further information or access to, or engages in further discussions with, such
Persons following the date of this Agreement in connection with a proposed
Acquisition Transaction; _provided_ that nothing in the foregoing sentence
shall limit or prohibit responding to any telephone calls or similar inquiries
from third parties regarding a possible Acquisition Transaction solely to
inform them of the applicable restrictions included in this Agreement.

Section 6.7 _Documents and Information_. After the Closing Date, Buyer and
the Company shall, and shall cause the Companys Subsidiaries to, until the
seventh anniversary of the Closing Date, retain all books, records and other
documents pertaining to the business of the Group Companies in existence on
the Closing Date and to make the same available for inspection and copying by
Seller (at Sellers expense) solely for bona fide reporting and compliance
purposes during normal business hours of the Group Companies, as applicable,
upon reasonable request and upon reasonable notice; _provided_ that the
foregoing right of inspection and copying shall not apply in connection with a
Proceeding in which Buyer and Seller are adverse to one another. No such
books, records or documents shall be destroyed after the seventh anniversary
of the Closing Date by Buyer or the Group Companies, without first advising
Seller in writing and giving Seller a reasonable opportunity to
obtain possession thereof.

 



55 Section 6.8 _Seller Confidentiality_. Until the seven year anniversary of
the Closing Date, Seller shall not, and Seller shall cause its partners and
Affiliates and its and their respective representatives who receive access to
Confidential Information (and, in the case of such Persons that are entities,
that have executed separate confidentiality agreements with Buyer in order to
receive such access) (" _Receiving Parties_ ") not to, use or disclose to any
third party, any Confidential Information; _provided_ , that nothing herein or
in the other Transaction Documents shall be construed as precluding,
prohibiting, restricting or otherwise limiting the ability of Seller (or its
partners or Affiliates or any of its and their respective representatives who,
in all cases, are Receiving Parties) to make any disclosures of Confidential
Information (a) to the extent required by applicable Law, (b) to provide
financial information relating to such Confidential Information that is
customarily disclosed to its current or prospective limited partners or
investors so long as such information is disclosed pursuant to customary
confidentiality agreements, (c) to use Confidential Information to the extent
required for regulatory or Tax compliance purposes or (d) in connection with
the defense of any claim under this Agreement; _provided_ , _further_ , that
Seller shall promptly provide Buyer, to the extent legally permissible, with
prior written notice of any such requirement, including so that Buyer may
seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy in advance of such
disclosure and participate in any proceeding related thereto; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that no such notice shall be required in the event Seller is
requested or required to disclose Confidential Information in the course of
routine supervisory examinations or regulatory oversight not targeting the
Company, Buyer or the Confidential Information. For purposes of this
Agreement, "Confidential Information" consists of all confidential or
proprietary information and data related to the business of the Group
Companies (including Owned Intellectual Property and any competitively
sensitive information relating to the business of the Group Companies
existing as of the Closing Date), the Company, Buyer or its Affiliates and all
information retrieved or retained pursuant to _Section 6.7_, in each case,
that is not generally available to the public (unless it becomes generally
available to the public due to a breach by Seller of this Agreement).

Section 6.9 _Contact with Customers, Suppliers and Other Business Relations_.
During the period from the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the
Closing Date or the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its
terms, Buyer hereby agrees that it is not authorized to and shall not (and
shall not permit any of its employees, agents, representatives or Affiliates
to) contact any employee, client or other material business relation of any
Group Company regarding any Group Company, its business or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement without the prior consent of the
Company. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing herein shall prohibit Buyer (or
its employees, agents, representatives or Affiliates) from contacting such
Persons in the ordinary course of business unrelated to any Group Company,
its business or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 6.10  _Employee Benefit Plans_.

(a) Effective no later than the day immediately prior to the Closing Date and
contingent upon the consummation of the transaction contemplated by this
Agreement, the Group Companies shall take or cause to be taken all actions
necessary to terminate any and all Employee Benefit Plans (including the
adoption of resolutions by the board of directors of the Group Company
sponsoring such Employee Benefit Plan(s) in a form reasonably acceptable to
Buyer) intended to qualify as qualified cash or deferred arrangements under

56  the Code (the " _Company 401(k) Plans_ "). Effective on or as soon as
administratively practicable following the Closing Date, each employee of any
Group Company who is a participant in a Company 401(k) Plan (each, a "
_401(k) Participant_ ") shall be allowed to participate in a tax-qualified
plan which includes a qualified cash or deferred arrangements under Section
401(k) of the Code that is sponsored and maintained by Buyer or one of its
Affiliates (the " _Buyer 401(k) Plan_ "). As soon as administratively
practicable following the Closing Date, Buyer shall or shall cause or permit,
as applicable, the account balances of each 401(k) Participant in the Company
401(k) Plan to be distributed in accordance with the terms of such plan, and
Buyer shall permit or cause an Affiliate of Buyer to permit the 401(k)
Participants who are participants in such plan to elect direct roll overs of
any such distributions (including a rollover of the 401(k) Participants
entire (but not less than entire) account balance from the Company 401(k)
Plan, including any outstanding participant loans) into the Buyer 401(k) Plan.

 

(b) Effective upon the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, Buyer or one of its Affiliates shall assume the Employee Benefit
Plans set forth on _Schedule 6.10(b)_ (the " _Assumed Employment Agreements_
") and shall perform all Group Company obligations that arise under the
Assumed Employment Agreements in accordance with the terms thereof.

(c) Seller hereby acknowledges and agrees that: (i) it shall be solely liable
for, and shall timely pay or perform, all payments and obligations under each
Seller Incentive Plans award; (ii) none of Buyer, the Group Companies and/or
their respective Affiliates shall have or assume any liability or obligation
with respect to any Seller Incentive Plans award; and (iii) the performance
of services to or for the benefit of any Group Company, Buyer and/or their
respective Affiliates shall not constitute a breach of any noncompetition,
nonsolicitation, confidentiality, intellectual property or other restrictive
covenant contained in any Seller Incentive Plans award, and Seller shall not
seek to enforce any of the foregoing against any holder or former holder of
any Seller Incentive Plans award in connection with such services.

 

Section 6.11 _Code Section 280G_. If any Person who is a "disqualified
individual" (within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code and the
Department of Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder) with respect to any
Group Company may receive any payment(s) or benefit(s) that could constitute
parachute payments under Section 280G of the Code in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, then: (a) the Company shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain a Parachute Payment Waiver from each
such "disqualified individual" and shall deliver such Parachute Payment
Waiver to Buyer; and (b) as soon as practicable following the delivery of the
Parachute Payment Waivers (if any) to Buyer, the Company shall prepare and
distribute to its shareholders a disclosure statement describing
all potential parachute payments and benefits that may be received by such
disqualified individual(s) and shall submit such payments to its shareholders
for approval, in each case, in accordance with the requirements of Section
280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and the Department of Treasury regulations
promulgated thereunder, such that, if approved by the requisite majority of
the shareholders, such payments and benefits shall not be deemed to be
"parachute payments" under Section 280G of the Code (the foregoing actions, a
" _280G Vote_ "). Prior to the Closing, if Parachute Payment Waivers are
obtained and a 280G Vote is required, the Company shall deliver to Buyer
evidence reasonably satisfactory to Buyer, (i) that a 280G Vote was solicited
in conformance with Section 280G of the Code, and the requisite shareholder
approval was

 



57  obtained with respect to any payments and/or benefits that were subject to
the Company shareholder vote (the " _Section 280G Approval_ ") or (ii) that
the Section 280G Approval was not obtained and as a consequence, pursuant to
the Parachute Payment Waiver, such "parachute payments" shall not be made or
provided. The form of the Parachute Payment Waiver, the disclosure statement,
any other materials to be submitted to the Companys shareholders in
connection with the 280G Vote and the calculations related to the foregoing
shall be subject to advance review and approval by Buyer, which approval shall
not be unreasonably withheld.

 

Section 6.12 _Tax Matters_.

 

(a) _Transfer Taxes._ All transfer Taxes, recording fees and other similar
Taxes that are imposed on any of the Parties by any Governmental Entity as a
result of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement

withholding Taxes imposed as a method of collecting such Taxes) (" _Transfer
Taxes_ ") shall be borne by Buyer. Buyer shall prepare and file all Tax
Returns or other applicable documents in connection with all Transfer Taxes,
to the extent permitted by applicable Law, provided, however, that Seller
shall cooperate with Buyer in the preparation and filing of all Tax Returns or
other applicable documents for or with respect to Transfer Taxes, including
timely signing and delivering such Tax Returns, documents, and certificates
as may be necessary or appropriate to file such Tax Returns or establish an
exemption from (or otherwise reduce) Transfer Taxes. With respect to any
Transfer Tax, if any refund or recovery is received by Seller, Seller shall
promptly pay the refund or recovery to Buyer and provide a reasonably detailed
description of the refund or recovery.

 

(b) _Tax Returns_. Seller shall prepare and timely file, or cause to be
prepared and timely filed, in accordance with past practice all Tax Returns
that are required to be filed by any Group Company on or prior to the Closing

on such Tax Returns. All such Tax Returns shall be prepared and filed in
a manner that is consistent with the prior practice of the Group Company,
except as otherwise required by Law. With respect to the U.S. federal income
Tax Return of the Group Companies for the taxable year ended December 31,
2013, Seller shall use reasonable efforts to deliver, or cause to be
delivered, a draft of such Tax Return to Buyer on the day following the date
of this Agreement (whether or not such draft is complete) for Buyers review
and comment. To the extent received prior to the due date thereof, Seller
shall consider in good faith, or cause to be considered in good faith, any
comments to such draft Tax Return made in writing by Buyer, provided that
Buyers review and comment rights hereunder shall not delay the timely filing
of such Tax Return. Seller shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, to Buyer a
copy of such Tax Return and each other material income Tax Return due
September 15, 2014 after the filing thereof. Seller shall use reasonable
efforts to deliver, or cause to be delivered, to Buyer a draft (whether or not
such draft is complete) of any other material income Tax Return due after
September 15, 2014 and on or before the twentieth day following the Closing
Date for Buyers review and comment prior to the due date of such Tax Return.
To the extent received prior to the due date thereof, Seller shall consider in
good faith, or cause to be considered in good faith, any comments to such
draft Tax Return made in writing by Buyer, provided that Buyers review and
comment rights hereunder shall not delay the timely filing of such Tax Return.

 



58 (c) _Tax Deductions_. Except as in good faith required to settle or resolve
any dispute with a taxing authority, neither Seller nor any of the Group
Companies shall take any position on any Tax Return that is inconsistent with
the treatment of the Transaction Deductions (at least to the extent of the
applicable percentages specified in the Example Statement) or any Advisory
Fees that are contingent on the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby (at least to the extent of the 70% safe harbor described in IRS Revenue
Procedure 2011-29) as deductions from the taxable income of the Group
Companies.

Section 6.13 _Affiliate Transactions_. Seller and the Company shall ensure
that all Affiliate Transactions, including the Advisory Agreements and the
Intercompany Note, other than those set forth on _Schedule 6.13_ and those
fully paid and discharged pursuant to _Section 6.14_, shall be fully paid and
be discharged at the Closing, such termination to be without further
liability whatsoever to the Group Companies.

Section 6.14 _Termination of Funded Indebtedness_. The Company shall, and
shall cause each other Group Company to (a) obtain from each holder of Closing
Date Indebtedness that is Funded Indebtedness an executed payoff letter in a
customary form (collectively, the " _Debt Payoff Letters_ "), (b) provide
Buyer with a copy of such Debt Payoff Letters at least one Business Day prior
to the Closing Date and (c) provide for, as of the Closing, the release of all
Liens and the release of all obligations and guarantees under any Funded
Indebtedness over the Group Companies properties and assets securing such
obligations, in each case subject to delivery of funds as arranged by Buyer.

 

Section 6.15 _Acknowledgments From Certain Service Providers_. The Company
shall, and, if applicable, shall cause each other Group Company to (a) obtain
from each of J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, Goldman, Sachs and Co., Kirkland and
Ellis LLP, Ernst and Young LLP, Apax Europe VII GP Co. Ltd. and Apax Partners,
L.P. an executed release and acknowledgment letter, which letter (i) in the
case of J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, will be substantially in the form set
forth on _Exhibit C_ or (ii) in all other cases, will be in a form to be
reasonably agreeable to such Person and Buyer and, assuming the receipt of
the fees and expenses of such Persons due and payable in respect of the
transactions contemplated hereby at Closing are paid in full at Closing, will
release the Group Companies from all payment obligations to such
person (other than indemnification obligations or rights to make breach of
contract claims that survive the Closing pursuant to an applicable Contract
with such Persons, which obligations or rights are unrelated to the payment of
the fees and expenses due and payable in respect of the transactions
contemplated hereby) (collectively, the " _Acknowledgement and Release
Letters_ ") and (b) provide Buyer with a copy of such Acknowledgement and
Release Letters at the Closing.

 

Section 6.16 _Consents_. The Company shall use (and Seller shall cause each
Group Company to use) its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, or
initiate the process to obtain, all consents and approvals set forth on
_Schedule 3.4_ as shall be requested by Buyer, provided, however, that no
party shall be required to pay any consideration to any third party from whom
consent or approval is requested. For the avoidance of doubt, the receipt of,
or the failure to obtain, any of the consents and approvals set forth on
_Schedule 3.4_ shall not be a condition to the obligation of any party hereto
to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



59 Section 6.17 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) With respect to the calendar year in which the Closing Date occurs, Buyer
shall pay to Group Company employees annual cash bonuses in an aggregate
amount that is no less than the aggregate amount of the cash-based bonuses
under any Group Companys cash-based bonus plan in the ordinary course of
business consistent with the terms of such plan; _provided_ that if any
such employee is terminated (i) without cause at or after the Closing as a
result of a redundancy or reduction in force arising in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (as opposed to ordinary course
terminations or terminations not connected with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement) and (ii) prior to the payment of any cash-based bonuses
with respect to the calendar year in which the Closing Date occurs, then such
employee shall be paid the bonus that such employee would have been entitled
to receive in accordance with the foregoing had such employee not been so
terminated (pro-rated for any portion of the applicable measurement period
with respect to such bonus during which such employee was not employed), and
any such bonus shall be paid at the same time that such bonuses are generally
paid in the ordinary course of business consistent with the terms of such
plan, but in no event later than March 15 of the calendar year immediately
following the calendar year in which the Closing Date occurs.

(b) Buyer agrees to maintain (or cause one of its Affiliates to maintain) the
TriZetto Severance Plan, dated April 26, 2011, in place for a period of one
year beginning on the Closing Date. Buyer further agrees that, from and after
the Closing Date, Buyer shall (or shall cause each Group Company to), to the
extent allowed under applicable Law and the terms of the applicable New Plan,
grant to each employee who of the Group Companies who continues in employment
with Buyer or one of its Affiliates following Closing (each, a " _Continuing
Employee_ "), under any benefit or compensation plan, program, agreement or
arrangement (other than any equity based plan, program or arrangement)
established or maintained by Buyer or a Group Company or any of
their respective Subsidiaries and in which such Continuing Employee
participates on or after the Closing Date (each, a " _New Plan_ "), credit for
any service with any Group Company earned prior to the Closing Date (i) for
eligibility and, with respect to any tax-qualified retirement plans, vesting
purposes and (ii) for purposes of vacation accruals following the Closing Date
and severance benefit determinations in each case, to the same extent such
service was recognized under a similar Employee Benefit Plan as of the
Closing Date. Nothing contained herein, express or implied, is intended to
confer upon any employee or other service provider of any Group Company any
right to continued employment or other service for any period or continued
receipt of any specific benefit, or any status as a third party beneficiary of
this Agreement with the ability to enforce rights as if it were a party to
this Agreement, or shall constitute an amendment to or any other modification
of any New Plan or Employee Benefit Plan. Buyer agrees that Buyer and the
Group Companies shall be solely responsible for satisfying the continuation
coverage requirements of Section 4980B of the Code for all individuals who
are "MandA qualified beneficiaries" (as such term is defined in Treasury
Regulation Section 54.4980B-9) with respect to the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. Nothing in this _Section 6.17(b)_ shall be deemed
to limit the right of Buyer, any Group Company or any of their respective
Affiliates to terminate the employment or other service of any employee or
other service provider at any time.

representations, warranties, obligations or covenants under this Agreement;

 



63 (e) by Seller, if the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall not
have been consummated by the Termination Date, unless the failure to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is primarily the
result of a breach by either Seller or the Company of their respective
representations, warranties, obligations or covenants under this Agreement;
or

(f) by either Buyer or Seller, if any Governmental Entity shall have issued an
order, decree or ruling or taken any other action permanently enjoining,
restraining or otherwise prohibiting the transactions contemplated by this

(b) any liability of any Party for any willful breach of this Agreement
(which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall be deemed to include any failure by
Seller or Buyer to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
if it is obligated to do so hereunder) prior to such termination. For
purposes of this Agreement, "willful breach" shall mean a breach or failure to
perform an obligation or agreement that is a consequence of an act undertaken
by the breaching party with the knowledge that the taking of such act would,
or would reasonably be expected to, cause a material breach of this Agreement
(and which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall be deemed to include any failure
by Buyer or Seller to consummate the transactions contemplated by this

Agreement. Any item disclosed in any Schedule referenced by a particular
Section in this Agreement shall be deemed to have been disclosed with respect
to every other Section in this Agreement if the relevance of such disclosure
to such other sections is reasonably apparent. The specification of any dollar
amount in the representations or warranties contained in this Agreement or
the inclusion of any specific item in any Schedule is not intended to imply
that such amounts, or higher or lower amounts or the items so included or
other items, are or are not material, and no Party shall use the fact of the
setting of such amounts or the inclusion of any such item in any dispute or
controversy as to whether any obligation, items or matter not described herein
or included in a Schedule is or is not material for purposes of
this Agreement. Any capitalized term used in any Exhibit or Schedule but not
otherwise defined therein shall have the meaning given to such term in this
Agreement.

 

Section 9.7 _Parties in Interest_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure solely to the benefit of each Party and its successors and permitted
assigns and, except as provided in _Section 6.5_ and _Section 9.16_, nothing
in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any
other Person any rights, benefits or remedies of any nature whatsoever under
or by reason of this Agreement.

Section 9.8 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Closing, Seller
may, on behalf of itself and the Company, (a) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of Buyer contained herein,
(b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of
Buyer contained herein or in any document, certificate or writing delivered
by Buyer pursuant hereto, or (c) waive compliance by Buyer with any of the
agreements or conditions contained herein. At any time prior to the Closing,
Buyer may (i) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations
or other acts of the Company or Seller contained herein, (ii) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the Company and Seller
contained herein or in any document, certificate or writing delivered by the
Company or Seller pursuant hereto, or (iii) waive compliance by the Company
and Seller with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein. Any
agreement on the part of any Party to any such extension or waiver shall be
valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such
Party. The failure of any Party to assert any of its rights hereunder shall
not constitute a waiver of such rights.

 

Section 9.9 _Severability_. Whenever possible, each provision of this
Agreement will be interpreted in such a manner as to be effective and valid
under applicable Law, but if any term or other provision of this Agreement is
held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable under applicable Law, all other
provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect so

  



67  long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated
hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any Party. Upon
such determination that any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or unenforceable under applicable Law, the Parties shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the Parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order
that the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated as originally
contemplated to the greatest extent possible.

 

Section 9.10 _Counterparts; Facsimile Signatures_. This Agreement may be
executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an
original, but all of which shall constitute one and the same agreement.
Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by
facsimile or scanned pages shall be effective as delivery of a
manually executed counterpart to this Agreement.

Section 9.11 _Limitation on Damages_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth herein, no Party shall be liable for any consequential
damages, including loss of revenue, income or profits, loss in value of assets
or securities, punitive (other than with respect to amounts paid with respect
to a third party claim), special or indirect damages, or damages based on a
multiple of EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization), or of any other financial metric (whether trailing, forward or
otherwise), relating to any breach of this Agreement.

Section 9.12 _Indemnity; Non-Survival of Representations, Warranties and
Covenants_.

 

(a) The representations and warranties of the Company, Seller and Buyer
contained in this Agreement and in any certificate delivered pursuant hereto,
other than the representations and warranties in _Section 4.4_ (which shall
survive indefinitely), shall terminate and be of no further force or effect at
Closing (and no Party shall have liability thereunder at or after
the Closing). The covenants and agreements of the Company, Seller and Buyer
contained in this Agreement that by their terms are to be performed prior to
or at the Closing shall terminate and be of no further force or effect
immediately following the Closing (and no Party shall have liability
thereunder at or after the Closing). The covenants and agreements of the
Company, Seller and Buyer contained in this Agreement that by their terms are
to be performed at or after the Closing shall survive the Closing in
accordance with their terms.

(b) From and after the Closing, Seller shall indemnify, defend and hold Buyer,
the Company and their respective Subsidiaries and/or Affiliates, and the
officers, directors, employees, Affiliates and/or agents of the foregoing
(each a " _Parent Indemnitee_ ") harmless from any damages, losses,
liabilities, obligations, claims of any kind, interest or expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees and expenses), in each case that are actually
incurred by any Group Company or Buyer as a result of:

 

(i) any breach or violation of the representations and warranties in _Section
4.4_ (other than any such breach or violation that results in a de minimis
liability); and

 



68 (ii) (x) any obligation of Seller to make a payment to any employee of any
Group Company in respect of arrangements covered by clauses (i) and (ii) of
the definition of Seller Incentive Plans or (y) any obligation of any Group
Company to make a payment to any employee of any Group Company pursuant to any
agreement listed under items 1, 2, 3, 5 or 6 on _Schedule 1.1(b)_ (but, in
the case of item 6 thereon, only to the extent that such obligations exceed
the amounts previously paid plus the amounts accrued on the Group Companies
financial statements as of the Closing in respect of the agreements listed
thereunder); _provided_ that, for the avoidance of doubt, the payment after
the Closing by Seller, the Company or its Affiliates of amounts due in
accordance with such agreements shall not result in any liability hereunder
to Seller if the amount of such payments was included in the final Unpaid
Seller Expenses. Seller shall maintain a cash reserve in an amount that is
equal to $5,000,000 for one year following the Closing in order to satisfy
its obligations under this _Section 9.12(b)(ii)_; _provided_ that, for the
avoidance of doubt, this sentence does not limit the indemnity obligations set
forth in this _Section 9.12(b)(ii)_.

 

Section 9.13 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH PARTY HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST
EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OF ANY CLAIM, DEMAND,
ACTION, OR CAUSE OF ACTION (I) ARISING UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR (II) IN ANY WAY
CONNECTED WITH OR RELATED OR INCIDENTAL TO THE DEALINGS OF THE PARTIES IN
RESPECT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS RELATED HERETO, IN EACH
CASE, WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER ARISING, AND WHETHER IN CONTRACT,
TORT, EQUITY, OR OTHERWISE. EACH PARTY HEREBY FURTHER AGREES AND CONSENTS THAT
ANY SUCH CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION, OR CAUSE OF ACTION SHALL BE DECIDED BY COURT
TRIAL WITHOUT A JURY AND THAT THE PARTIES MAY FILE AN ORIGINAL COUNTERPART OF
A COPY OF THIS AGREEMENT WITH ANY COURT AS WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE CONSENT OF
THE PARTIES TO THE WAIVER OF THEIR RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY.

 

Section 9.14 _Jurisdiction and Venue_. Each of the Parties (i) submits to the
exclusive jurisdiction of the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware (or, if
the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware declines to accept jurisdiction
over a particular matter, any state or federal court within the State of
Delaware) in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this
Agreement, (ii) agrees that all claims in respect of such action or proceeding
may be heard and determined in any such court and (iii) agrees not to bring
any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement in any
other court. Each of the Parties waives any defense of inconvenient forum to
the maintenance of any action or proceeding so brought and waives any bond,
surety or other security that might be required of any other Party with
respect thereto. Each Party agrees that service of summons and complaint or
any other process that might be served in any action or proceeding may be made
on such Party by sending or delivering a copy of the process to the Party to
be served at the address of the Party and in the manner provided for the
giving of notices in _Section 9.2_. Nothing in this _Section 9.14_, however,
shall affect the right of any Party to serve legal process in any other manner
permitted by applicable Law. Each Party agrees that a final, non-appealable
judgment in any action or proceeding so brought shall be conclusive and may be
enforced by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law.

 



69 Section 9.15 _Remedies_. Any and all remedies provided herein will be
deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred
hereby, or by Law or equity upon such Party, and the exercise by a Party of
any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy. Buyer, the
Company and Seller agree that irreparable harm for which monetary damages,
even if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event
that the Parties do not fully and timely perform their respective obligations
under or in connection with this Agreement in accordance with their specific
terms or otherwise breach such provisions. It is accordingly agreed that,
prior to the valid termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1_,
the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions, specific
performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement
and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, in
each case without proof of damages and without posting a bond or undertaking,
this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at Law
or in equity. The provisions set forth in _Section 8.2_ (A) are not intended
to and do not adequately compensate for the harm that would result from a
breach of this Agreement prior to its valid termination and (B) shall not be
construed to diminish or otherwise impair in any respect any Partys right to
an injunction, specific performance, or other equitable relief and the
right to obtain an injunction, specific performance, or other equitable
relief is an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and without that right, none of the Parties would have entered into this
Agreement. Each of Buyer, the Company and Seller agrees that it will not
oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and other equitable
relief when expressly available pursuant to the terms of this Agreement on the
basis that the other Parties have an adequate remedy at Law or an award of
specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at Law or
equity.

Section 9.16  _Non-Recourse_. All claims or causes of action (whether in
contract or in tort, in Law or in equity) that may be based upon, arise out of
or relate to this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents, or the
negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement or the other
Transaction Documents (including any representation or warranty made in or in
connection with this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents or as an
inducement to enter into this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents),
may be made only against the entities that are expressly identified as parties
hereto and thereto. No Person who is not a named party to this Agreement or
the other Transaction Documents, including any past, present or future
director, officer, employee, incorporator, member, partner, stockholder,
Affiliate, agent, attorney or representative of any named party to this
Agreement or the other Transaction Documents (" _Non-Party Affiliates_ "),
shall have any liability (whether in contract or in tort, in Law or in
equity, or based upon any theory that seeks to impose liability of an entity
party against its owners or Affiliates) for any obligations or liabilities
arising under, in connection with or related to this Agreement or such other
Transaction Documents (as the case may be) or for any claim based on, in
respect of, or by reason of this Agreement or such other Transaction Document
(as the case may be) or the negotiation or execution hereof or thereof; and
each Party waives and releases all such liabilities, claims and obligations
against any such Non-Party Affiliates. Non-Party Affiliates are expressly
intended as third party beneficiaries of this provision of this Agreement.

Section 9.17 _Waiver of Conflicts_. Recognizing that Kirkland and Ellis LLP has
acted as legal counsel to Seller and its Affiliates and the Group Companies
prior to the Closing, and that Kirkland and Ellis LLP intends to act as legal
counsel to Seller and its Affiliates (which will no longer include the Group
Companies) after the Closing, each of Buyer and the Company hereby waives, on
its own behalf and agrees to cause its Affiliates to waive, any conflicts that
may arise

 



70  in connection with Kirkland and Ellis LLP representing Seller and/or its
Affiliates after the Closing as such representation may relate to Buyer, any
Group Company or the transactions contemplated herein. In addition, all
communications involving attorney-client confidences between Seller, its
Affiliates or any Group Company and Kirkland and Ellis LLP in the course of the
negotiation, documentation and consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby shall be deemed to be attorney-client confidences that belong solely to
Seller and its Affiliates (and not the Group Companies). Accordingly, the
Group Companies shall not, without Sellers consent, have access to any such
communications, or to the files of Kirkland and Ellis LLP relating to its
engagement, whether or not the Closing shall have occurred. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, upon and after the Closing, (a) Seller and
its Affiliates (and not the Group Companies) shall be the sole holders of the
attorney-client privilege with respect to such engagement, and none of the
Group Companies shall be a holder thereof, (b) to the extent that files of
Kirkland and Ellis LLP in respect of such engagement constitute property of the
client, only Seller and its Affiliates (and not the Group Companies) shall
hold such property rights and (c) Kirkland and Ellis LLP shall have no duty
whatsoever to reveal or disclose any such attorney-client communications or
files to any of the Group Companies by reason of any attorney-client
relationship between Kirkland and Ellis LLP and any of the Group Companies or
otherwise.
