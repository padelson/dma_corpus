(d) Subject to _Section_ __ _ 3.6_, _Section_ __ _ 3.8_, _Section_ __ _
3.10_ and  _Section_ __ _ 3.11_, each Panavision Holder of Panavision Common
Stock (other than in respect of Excluded Shares) shall be entitled to receive

44

    

(e) At the Effective Time, subject to _Section_ __ _ 3.5_ and  _Section_ __
_ 3.10_, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of any
Panavision Optionholder or any other Person, each Panavision Holder of In The

Panavision Holder immediately prior to the Effective Time (for the avoidance

the Panavision Catch-up Plan Participants pursuant to this _Section_ __ _

Closing pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.5(c)(x)_ shall be apportioned between
cash and Acquiror Common Shares in the proportion that the Aggregate
Panavision Cash Consideration bears to the value of the Aggregate Panavision

For purposes of the foregoing, the " _Merger Consideration Per Fully Diluted
Panavision Share_ " shall mean (i) the sum of (A) the Merger Consideration,
_plus_ (B) the Aggregate Panavision Option Exercise Price, _less_ (C) the
Panavision Catch-up Plan Payments, _divided by_ (ii) the Aggregate Fully
Diluted Shares of Panavision Common Stock. For purposes of the foregoing, the
" _Aggregate Panavision Option Exercise Price_ " shall be the sum total of all
exercise prices of all Panavision Options outstanding, unexercised and In The
Money immediately prior to the Effective Time (excluding any Panavision
Options to be cancelled as of the Effective Time pursuant to _Section_ __ _

45

    

(b) Subject to _Section_ __ _ 3.8_, _Section_ __ _ 3.10_ and _Section_ __ _
3.11_, each SIM Seller shall be entitled to receive a portion of the SIM
Purchase Price equal to (i) the Purchase Price Per Fully Diluted SIM Share,
_multiplied by_ (ii) the number of shares of SIM Capital Stock held by such
SIM Seller immediately prior to the Effective Time. Such amount shall be
apportioned between cash and Acquiror Common Shares in the proportion that the
Aggregate SIM Cash Consideration bears to the value of the Aggregate SIM
Stock Consideration (at a deemed value of $10.00 per share). For purposes of
this _Section_ __ _ 3.2(b)_, " _Purchase Price Per Fully Diluted SIM Share_ "
means (x) the SIM Purchase Price, _divided by_  (y) the Aggregate Fully
Diluted Shares of SIM Capital Stock.

(c) Each holder of vested SIM Options (including those that would be vested
as a result of the Purchase) shall be offered the opportunity to surrender
such SIM In The Money Option (as provided in _Section_ __ _ 3.5(a)_) as to
its "in the money" value (based on the SIM Board of Directors or Granite
approved estimate of the consideration payable under this Agreement), less any
applicable withholding Taxes, and to receive the net value (after such
withholding Taxes) in the form of SIM Shares (valued on the same basis),
provided that such holder (i) surrenders such SIM Options in full,
conditional only upon the Closing occurring and (ii) irrevocably agrees that
any unexercised SIM Options will be terminated and expire as of the Closing.
SIM shall pay the applicable amount of withholding Taxes to the applicable
Governmental Authorities (and upon request may require such amount to be
loaned to it at Closing by SIM Acquisition Sub, in which case it shall be
treated as Indebtedness of SIM under this Agreement). For purposes of this
Agreement, with respect to the SIM Options, the term "exercise" and
"surrender" shall each mean exercise or surrender, as applicable.

 

(d) If SIM issues warrants to any SIM Seller in connection with the issuance
of debt securities to such SIM Seller permitted by this Agreement prior to
the Closing Date, the terms thereof shall ensure that the right to acquire SIM
Shares thereunder (and such warrants and any other rights of the holder
thereunder) shall, automatically without any further action of any Person and
without any consideration, terminate at the Closing and shall not be
exercisable (either at the option of the holder thereof or upon the occurrence
of any other event) unless this Agreement is terminated in accordance with its
terms. Any warrants to be issued by SIM following the date hereof and prior
to the Closing (i) will have an exercise price equal to the Purchase Price Per
Fully Diluted SIM Share and (ii) shall contain terms and conditions, and
otherwise be in a form satisfactory to each of Acquiror, Panavision and the
Panavision Holder Representative. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, SIM may not, prior to the Closing, issue any warrants for the
purposes described in this clause (d) except as otherwise expressly permitted
by this Agreement.

Section 3.3 _Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, no certificate or scrip representing fractional Acquiror
Common Shares shall be issued pursuant to this _Article_ __ _ III_, and such
fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to
any other rights of a holder of Acquiror Common Shares. In lieu of any
fractional shares, Acquiror shall pay each Panavision Holder, Panavision
Catch-up Plan Participant and SIM Seller entitled to any Acquiror Common
Shares, and such Panavision Holder, Panavision

 



46

    

 Catch-up Plan Participant or SIM Seller shall be entitled to receive, an
amount in cash (without interest), rounded up to the nearest cent, equal to
the product obtained by multiplying (a) the fractional share interest to
which such holder (after taking into account all Acquiror Common Shares held
at the Effective Time by such Panavision Holder, Panavision Catch-up Plan
Participant or SIM Seller) would otherwise be entitled _by_ (b) $10.00.

 

Section 3.4 _Adjustment to Aggregate Consideration_.

 

(a) The Aggregate Panavision Stock Consideration and the Aggregate SIM Stock
Consideration shall be adjusted appropriately to reflect the effect of any
stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or
other distribution of securities convertible into Acquiror Common Shares),
reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of
shares or other like change with respect to the Acquiror Securities after the
date of this Agreement (including any of the foregoing in connection with the
Domestication) and prior to the Effective Time so as to provide the Panavision
Holders (other than holders of Excluded Shares), the Panavision Catch-up Plan
Participants and the SIM Sellers with the same economic effect as contemplated
by this Agreement prior to such event and as so adjusted shall, from
and after the date of such event, be the Aggregate Panavision Stock
Consideration and the Aggregate SIM Stock Consideration.

(b) In the event that Acquiror Common Shares are redeemed pursuant to
Acquiror Share Redemptions for an aggregate redemption price in excess of
$25,000,000 (such excess, the " _Excess Redemption Amount_ "), the Aggregate
Panavision Cash Consideration shall be reduced by an amount equal to the
Excess Redemption Amount and shall be replaced by an increase in the number of
Acquiror Common Shares equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (i) the
Excess Redemption Amount _by_ (ii) $10.00 (such resulting amount, the "
_Additional Stock Consideration_ "). The Additional Stock Consideration shall
be part of the Aggregate Panavision Stock Consideration.

 

(c) In the event that, after giving effect to the payments of the Aggregate
Panavision Cash Consideration and the Aggregate SIM Cash Consideration as
calculated pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.1(c)_ and _Section_ __ _ 3.2(a)_,
respectively, and as adjusted pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.4(b)_, Acquiror
reasonably and in good faith determines that (based on the Estimated Closing
Statements, the proceeds of the Debt Financing, the PIPE Investment and any
Alternative Financing, the aggregate amount of Acquiror Share Redemptions and
the payments contemplated to be made by Acquiror at the Closing pursuant to
this Agreement (including, without duplication, (i) the outstanding balance of
any Acquiror Transaction Expenses, (ii) the portion of the Aggregate
Panavision Cash Consideration to be paid to the Escrow Agent in respect of
the Panavision Adjustment Escrow Amount and to the Panavision Holder
Representative in respect of the Panavision Holder Representative Expense
Amount and (iii) the portion of the Aggregate SIM Cash Consideration to be
paid to the Escrow Agent in respect of the SIM Adjustment Escrow Amount and
to the SIM Holder Representative in respect of the SIM Holder Representative
Expense Amount, as applicable)) the sum of, without duplication, (I) the Cash
and Cash Equivalents on Acquirors consolidated balance sheet (including, for
the avoidance of doubt, the Cash and Cash Equivalents of the Panavision Group
and the SIM Group (including $15 million related to restricted subrent cash),
and after reduction for any amounts included in the calculation of the Cash
and Cash Equivalents of the Panavision Group or the SIM

_Section_ __ _ 14.6_) and (II) the Available Acquiror Cash that is remaining

the Closing pursuant to this Agreement (including the outstanding balance of
any Acquiror Transaction Expenses and including any amounts required to be
delivered to Acquirors balance sheet at the Closing pursuant to _Section_ __
_ 11.4(e)(ii)_), in each case, on a pro forma basis immediately following the
Closing (the " _Acquiror Cash Amount_ ") is less than the Minimum Cash Target
Amount (the amount by which the Minimum Cash Target Amount exceeds the
Acquiror Cash Amount, the " _Minimum Cash Shortfall_ ") then, upon written
notice to the Holder Representatives at least three (3) Business Days prior to
the Closing, (i) the Aggregate Panavision Cash Consideration payable at the
Closing shall be reduced by an amount in cash equal to the Minimum Cash
Shortfall, and (ii) the Aggregate Panavision Stock Consideration payable at
the Closing shall be increased by a number of Acquiror Common Shares equal to
the quotient obtained by dividing (A) the Minimum Cash Shortfall _by_ (B)
$10.00. Acquiror shall, and shall cause its Affiliates (including Sponsor) to,
promptly provide the Panavision Holder Representative and its Representatives
reasonable access, during normal business hours and upon prior written notice,
in such manner as to not unreasonably interfere with the normal operation of
Acquiror and its Affiliates, to the Books and Records, supporting
documentation, properties, personnel, advisors and (subject to the execution
of customary work paper access letters if requested) work papers and auditors
of Acquiror and its Affiliates (including Sponsor) relating to the calculation
of the Minimum Cash Shortfall and shall cause the personnel of Acquiror and
its Affiliates (including Sponsor) to reasonably cooperate with the Panavision
Holder Representative and its Representatives in connection with their review
of such calculation. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein,
Acquiror shall not make any adjustment to the form of consideration payable in
respect of the Merger Consideration pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 3.4(c)_
without first (x) reasonably consulting with the Panavision Holder
Representative in connection with its determination of the Minimum Cash
Shortfall (if any), (y) considering in good faith the views and comments (if
any) of the Panavision Holder Representative, and (z) accepting any
reasonable comments proposed by or on behalf of the Panavision Holder
Representative.

(a) At least five (5) Business Days prior to the Effective Time, SIM shall
take all necessary action to fully accelerate the vesting of each SIM Option
and provide each SIM Optionholder the opportunity to surrender such SIM Option
at least one day prior to the Closing. If such SIM Options have an "in the
money" value as determined in accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 3.2(c)_ (any
such Option being referred to herein as a " _SIM In The Money Option_ "), SIM
shall issue, prior to the Closing, to each such SIM Optionholder who elects to

number of SIM Shares issuable upon exercise in full of such SIM In The Money
Options held by such SIM Optionholder; _less_ (ii) such number of SIM Shares
equal in value (as determined in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 3.2(c)_) to
the sum of the exercise prices payable upon exercise of all the SIM In The

Shares equal in value (as determined in accordance with _Section_ __ _
3.2(c)_) to the aggregate amount of any applicable withholding Taxes arising
in connection with the exercise of the SIM In The Money Options by such SIM
Optionholder. All unexercised SIM Options shall be terminated and expire as of
the Closing without payment or consideration therefor.

 



48

    

(b) At the Effective Time, all Panavision Options that are outstanding as of

exercisable, shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part
of any Panavision Optionholder or any other Person, if such Panavision Options
have a per share exercise price less than the value of the Merger
Consideration Per Fully Diluted Panavision Share (it being understood and
agreed that, for the avoidance of doubt, the portion of the Merger
Consideration Per Fully Diluted Panavision Share that consists of
Acquiror Common Shares shall be based on an implied value of $10.00 per share
of Acquiror Common Shares) (any such Option being referred to herein as " _In
The_ _Money_ "), cease to represent a right to acquire shares of Panavision
Common Stock and shall be converted into (i) the right to receive the
applicable portion of the Merger Consideration, as determined pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 3.1(e)_ (subject to any withholding Taxes); _provided_ , 
_however_ , that a portion of the Merger Consideration that is equal to (x)

such holders Fully Diluted Percentage shall be, in the case of the
Panavision Adjustment Escrow Amount, held in escrow in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 2.5(c)(iii)_ and the Escrow Agreement or, in the case of the

the Panavision Contingent Shares, the Company and the Panavision Holder
Representative shall cooperate in good faith to reach agreement as to the fair
market value of such Panavision Contingent Shares for purposes of such
withholding). Any Panavision Options that are not In the Money shall be
cancelled as of the Effective Time without payment therefor and shall have no
further force or effect. Panavision shall, upon receipt of (x) the portion of
the Aggregate Panavision Stock Consideration and the Aggregate Panavision
Cash Consideration payable to Panavision pursuant to _Section_ __ _
2.5(c)(vi)_, or (y) any portion of the Merger Consideration pursuant to 
_Section_ __ _ 3.10(f)(ii)_, _Section_ __ _ 3.10(f)(iii)_ or _Section_ __ _
3.10(g)(ii)_ or _Section_ __ _ 3.10(g)(iii)_, as promptly as practicable (and

subject to clause (iv) of this paragraph of _Section_ __ _ 3.10(a)_, on
a consolidated basis for the respective Company Group in accordance with GAAP
(in the case of the Panavision Group) or IFRS (in the case of the SIM Group),
in a manner consistent with the preparation of the most recent audited balance
sheet included in the Panavision Draft Audited Financial Statements or the
SIM Audited Financial Statements (as applicable, the " _Reference Balance
Sheet_ "), using the same accounting practices, policies, judgments and
methodologies used in the preparation of the applicable Reference Balance

manner as to not unreasonably interfere with the normal operation of Acquiror
and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates, to the Books and Records,
supporting documentation, properties, personnel, advisors and (subject to the

auditors of the applicable Company Group relating to the preparation of the

Closing Date Unpaid Transaction Expenses or Final Capex Shortfall, it shall
notify Acquiror of such disagreement in writing (an " _Objection Notice_
"), setting forth in reasonable detail the particulars of such disagreement,
within forty-five (45) days after its receipt of the applicable Closing
Statement. Either Holder Representative may only dispute the calculation of
the applicable 

 



53

    

 Closing Date NWC, Closing Date Indebtedness, Closing Date Cash, Closing Date
Unpaid Transaction Expenses or Final Capex Shortfall on the basis that any
such calculation was not presented in accordance with the requirements of
this Agreement or on the basis of computational errors or that the applicable
Holder Representative has not been provided with reasonable access to
information requested by the applicable Holder Representative pursuant to
this _Section_ __ _ 3.10_ as would enable it to evaluate the differences
between the applicable Closing Statement (or any of the components thereof),
on the one hand, and the applicable Estimated Closing Statement (or any of
the components thereof), on the other hand. In the event that either Holder
Representative does not provide such an Objection Notice within such forty-
five (45)-day period, such Holder Representative shall be deemed to have
accepted the calculation of the applicable Closing Date NWC, Closing Date
Indebtedness, Closing Date Cash, Closing Date Unpaid Transaction Expenses and
Final Capex Shortfall delivered by Acquiror, which shall be final, binding
and conclusive for all purposes hereunder, absent fraud or manifest error. In
the event an Objection Notice is timely provided, Acquiror and the applicable
Holder Representative shall in good faith for a period of thirty (30) days
(or such longer period as they may mutually agree) attempt to resolve any
such disagreements specified in such notice, and any such discussions with
respect thereto will (unless otherwise agreed by Acquiror and the applicable
Holder Representative) be governed by Rule 408 of the Federal Rules of
Evidence and any applicable similar rule of any Governmental Authority. If, at
the end of such period, Acquiror and the applicable Holder Representative are
unable to resolve such disagreements, then the dispute resolution group of
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (or, if PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP is unwilling or
unable to serve, such dispute resolution group of an independent accounting or
independent financial consulting firm of recognized national standing as may
be mutually selected by Acquiror and the applicable Holder Representative)
(each, as applicable, the " _Auditor_ ") shall resolve any remaining
disagreements. The Auditor shall act as an expert, not as an arbitrator,
in resolving any such disagreements and its determination must be in writing
and must set forth, in reasonable detail, the basis therefor and must be based
solely on (w) the extent (if any) to which the applicable Closing Date NWC,
Closing Date Indebtedness, Closing Date Cash, Closing Date Unpaid Transaction
Expenses or Final Capex Shortfall requires adjustment (only with respect to
the remaining disagreements submitted to the Auditor), (x) the definitions and
other applicable provisions of this Agreement relevant to the determination
in the immediately preceding clause (w) (including _Section_ __ _ 3.10(a)_,
and the definitions of the defined terms used in _Section_ __ _
3.10(a)_), (y) a single written presentation (which presentations shall be
limited to the remaining items in dispute set forth in the Objection Notice)
submitted by each of Acquiror and the applicable Holder Representative to the
Auditor within twenty (20) Business Days after the engagement thereof (which
the Auditor shall forward to Acquiror or the applicable Holder Representative,
as applicable) and (z) one (1) written response submitted to the Auditor
within twenty (20) Business Days after receipt of each such presentation
(which the Auditor shall forward to Acquiror or the applicable Holder
Representative, as applicable), and not on independent review or
investigation. The Auditor shall be instructed to render its determination
with respect to such disagreements as soon as reasonably possible (which the
parties hereto agree should not be later than sixty (60) days following the
day on which any such disagreements are referred to the Auditor, but
acknowledge will be subject to the Auditors ability to render such
determination within such requested time period). The Auditors determination
with respect to any such disagreement must be within the range of values
assigned to the applicable Closing Date NWC, Closing Date Indebtedness,
Closing Date Cash, Closing Date Unpaid Transaction

 



54

    

 Expenses or Final Capex Shortfall in the applicable Closing Statement and
the applicable Objection Notice, respectively. The determination of the
Auditor shall be final, conclusive and binding on the parties, absent fraud
or manifest error. The later of (A) the date on which Closing Date NWC,
Closing Date Indebtedness, Closing Date Cash, Closing Date Unpaid Transaction
Expenses and Final Capex Shortfall of Panavision and SIM, as applicable, are
finally determined in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 3.10(b)_ and (B)
the date that is 120 days after the Closing Date is hereinafter referred to as

to the work, if any, to be performed by the Auditor hereunder shall be borne
pro rata as between Acquiror, on the one hand, and the applicable Pre-Closing
Company Holders, on the other hand, in proportion to the allocation of the
dollar value of the amounts in dispute between Acquiror and the applicable
Pre-Closing Company Holders made by the Auditor such that the party
prevailing on the greater dollar value of such disputed amounts pays the
lesser proportion of such fees and expenses. For the avoidance of doubt,
neither Acquiror nor the applicable Holder Representative may, without the
prior written consent of the other, have any substantive _ex parte_
communications with the Auditor related to this _Section_ __ _ 3.10_.

(c) The " _Panavision Adjustment Amount_ " shall mean an amount, which may be

Exchange Agents duties shall terminate. Thereafter, each Panavision
Stockholder who has not delivered a Letter of Transmittal (in respect of
shares of Panavision Common Stock other than Excluded Shares) or SIM Seller
who has not delivered a SIM Certificate (or an affidavit of loss in lieu
thereof in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 3.12_) may surrender such Letter
of Transmittal or SIM Certificate (or an affidavit of loss in lieu thereof in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 3.12_), as applicable, to Acquiror
and (subject to applicable abandoned property, escheat and similar Laws)
receive in consideration therefor, and Acquiror shall promptly deliver, or
cause to be delivered, the portion of the Merger Consideration and the
Panavision Contingent Shares or the SIM Purchase Price, as applicable,
deliverable in respect thereof as determined in accordance with this _Article_
__ _ III_ without any interest thereon. None of Acquiror, Panavision
Acquisition Sub, Panavision, the Surviving Corporation, SIM, the SIM Sellers
or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any Merger
Consideration or SIM Purchase Price, as applicable, delivered to a public
official pursuant to and in accordance with any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Laws. If any Letter of Transmittal or SIM
Certificate (or an affidavit of loss in lieu thereof delivered in accordance
with this Agreement), as applicable, shall not have been surrendered
immediately prior to such date on which any amounts payable pursuant to this
_Article_ __ _ III_ would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
Governmental Authority, any such amounts shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, become the property of Acquiror, free and clear of all claims
or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

Section 3.12 _Lost Certificate_. In the event any SIM Certificate has been
lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such SIM Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and an
indemnity, in each case, in a form reasonably satisfactory to Acquiror and
the Exchange Agent, the Exchange Agent shall issue, in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed SIM Certificate, the SIM Purchase Price deliverable in
respect thereof as determined in accordance with this  _Article_ __ _ III_.

Section 3.13 _Dissenting Shares_. Any shares of Panavision Common Stock issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that are held by any
holder who has not voted in favor of the Merger or consented thereto in
writing and who shall have properly demanded and perfected appraisal of such
shares of Panavision Common Stock pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL ("
_Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the right to receive the
applicable portion of the Merger Consideration as determined pursuant to 
_Section_ __ _ 3.1(d)_ and

 



58

    

 the right to receive the applicable portion of the Panavision Contingent
Shares as determined pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.16(b)_, but instead shall
be entitled to receive such payment(s) from the Surviving Corporation with
respect to such Dissenting Shares as shall be determined pursuant to the DGCL;
_provided_ , _however_ , that if such holder shall have failed to perfect or
shall have effectively withdrawn or otherwise lost such holders right to
dissent and demand payment of fair value under the DGCL, each such share of
Panavision Common Stock held by such holder shall thereupon be deemed to have
been converted into, as of the Effective Time, the right to receive, without
any interest thereon, the applicable portion of the Merger Consideration as
determined pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.1(d)_ and the right to receive,
without any interest thereon, the applicable portion of the Panavision
Contingent Shares as determined pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.16(b)_, and each
such share of Panavision Common Stock shall no longer be a Dissenting Share.
Prior to the Closing, Panavision shall give prompt notice to Acquiror of any
written demands received by Panavision for payment of the fair value (as
determined in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL) in respect of any
shares of Panavision Common Stock and attempted withdrawals of such demands
and any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by
Panavision, and Acquiror shall have the right to participate in all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands to the extent
permitted by applicable Law. Prior to the Closing, Panavision shall not,
except with the prior written consent of Acquiror, voluntarily make or agree
to make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisals of shares of
Panavision Common Stock, offer to settle or settle any demands or approve any
withdrawal of any such demands.

Section 3.14 _Withholding_. Notwithstanding any other provision in this
Agreement, Acquiror, Panavision Acquisition Sub, SIM Acquisition Sub, the
Companies, the Exchange Agent and the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to deduct
and withhold from the cash otherwise deliverable under this Agreement, and
from any other consideration otherwise paid or delivered in connection with
the Transactions, to any Person such amounts that Acquiror, Panavision
Acquisition Sub, SIM Acquisition Sub, the Companies, the Exchange Agent or the
Escrow Agent, as applicable, are required to deduct and withhold with respect
to any such deliveries and payments under the Code or any provision of Law. To
the extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld and duly deposited with
the appropriate Governmental Authority by Acquiror, Panavision Acquisition
Sub, SIM Acquisition Sub, the Companies, the Exchange Agent or the Escrow
Agent, such deducted and withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made. Acquiror, Panavision Acquisition Sub, SIM
Acquisition Sub, the Companies, the Exchange Agent or the Escrow Agent, as
applicable, shall notify the Panavision Holder Representative or the SIM
Holder Representative, as applicable, in writing of its intent to deduct and
withhold at least five (5) Business Days before any such deduction or
withholding is made with respect to the consideration payable pursuant to this
Agreement, and the parties shall cooperate in good faith to eliminate or
reduce any such deduction or withholding (including through the request and
provision of any statements, forms or other documents to reduce or eliminate
any such deduction or withholding).

 

Section 3.15 _Closing of Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the stock
transfer books of Panavision shall be closed and there shall be no further
registration of transfers of Panavision Common Stock thereafter on the records
of Panavision.

60

    

 that such Panavision Catch-up Plan Participant is entitled to receive
pursuant to, and on the terms and subject to the conditions of, the Panavision
Catch-up Plan. Any vesting of the Founder Contingent Shares or Panavision
Contingent Shares pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 3.16_ shall be pro rata
based on the number of Founder Contingent Shares or Panavision Contingent
Shares, as applicable, held by and/or to which a Person has a right to receive
under this Agreement.

(c) [Intentionally omitted].

(d) Upon the occurrence of a Change in Control during the Contingent Shares
Period, a number of Founder Contingent Shares and Panavision Contingent
Shares equal to the following shall, no later than immediately prior to the
consummation of such Change in Control, vest and become free of the
restrictions set forth in this  _Section_ __ _ 3.16_:

(i) if the price per Acquiror Common Share paid or payable in connection with
such Change in Control is equal to or greater than the Minimum Target but
less than the Maximum Target and a portion of the Founder Contingent Shares
and Panavision Contingent Shares have not previously vested and become free of
the restrictions set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 3.16_ pursuant to

Panavision Contingent Shares that would vest and become free of restrictions
set forth in this  _Section_ __ _ 3.16_ pursuant to _Section_ __ _
3.16(a)(i)_ upon satisfaction of the Minimum Target; and

 

(ii) if the price per Acquiror Common Share paid or payable in connection with
such Change in Control is equal to or greater than the Maximum Target and the
Founder Contingent Shares and Panavision Contingent Shares have not previously
vested and become free of the restrictions set forth in this _Section_ __ _
3.16_ pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 3.16(a)(ii)_, the number of Founder
Contingent Shares and Panavision Contingent Shares that would vest and become
free of the restrictions set forth in _Section_ __ _ 3.16_ pursuant to 
_Section_ __ _ 3.16(a)(ii)_ upon satisfaction of the Maximum Target (taking
into account any prior vesting of Founder Contingent Shares and Panavision
Contingent Shares pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.16(a)(i)_). 

For the avoidance of doubt, if the price per Acquiror Common Share paid or
payable in connection with such Change in Control is less than the Minimum
Target, then no Founder Contingent Shares or Panavision Contingent Shares
shall vest and become free of the restrictions set forth in this _Section_ __
_ 3.16_ pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 3.16(d)_ or otherwise pursuant to
this _Section_ __ _ 3.16_ from and after the occurrence of or otherwise in

without any further action of any person, contributed and forfeited for no
consideration.

(e) Subject to  _Section_ __ _ 3.8_ in the case of the Panavision
Stockholders, Acquiror shall take such actions as are reasonably requested by
a Panavision Holder, Panavision Catch-up Plan Participant or Class F Holder
to evidence the issuances to or ownership by him, her or it pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 3.16_, including through the provision of a certified updated
book-entry with Acquirors transfer agent showing such issuances or ownership
(as certified by an officer of Acquiror or the applicable transfer agent).
Each of the Panavision Stockholders (other than in respect of Excluded
Shares), the Panavision Holders of In The Money Panavision Options,
the Panavision Catch-up Plan Participants and the Class F Holders shall be
express third party beneficiaries of this _Section_ __ _ 3.16(e)_.

 



61

    

(f) The Contingent Shares, the Minimum Target or Maximum Target, as
applicable, shall be adjusted appropriately and in good faith by the Acquiror
Board to reflect the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock
dividend (including any dividend or other distribution of securities
convertible into Acquiror Common Shares), reorganization, recapitalization,
reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other like change with
respect to the Acquiror Securities after the date of this Agreement (including
any of the foregoing in connection with the Domestication) and prior to end
of the Contingent Shares Period so as to provide the Panavision Holders (other
than holders of Excluded Shares), the Panavision Catch-up Plan Participants
and the Class F Holders with the same economic effect as contemplated by this
_Section_ __ _ 3.16_ and the other applicable provisions of this Agreement
prior to such event and as so adjusted shall, from and after the date of such
event, be the Contingent Shares, the Minimum Target and the Maximum Target,
as applicable.

(g) During the Contingent Shares Period, Acquiror shall take all
necessary actions and use commercially reasonable efforts to remain listed as
a public company on, and for the Contingent Shares to be tradable over,
Nasdaq; _provided_ , _however_ , the foregoing shall not limit Acquiror from
consummating a Change in Control or entering into a Contract that
contemplates a Change in Control. Upon the consummation of any Change in
Control during the Contingent Shares Period, other than as set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 3.16(d)_ above, Acquiror shall have no further obligations
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 3.16(g)_.

(h) From and after the Closing, until any Founder Contingent Shares or
Panavision Contingent Shares vest and become free of restrictions in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 3.16(a)_ or _Section_ __ _ 3.16(d)_, (i) the
net after-tax amount (determined assuming that each holder is a resident
individual of or a corporation doing business in New York, New York (or, if
higher, San Francisco, California), as applicable) of any and all dividends
or distributions received by a holder in respect of such unvested Founder
Contingent Shares or Panavision Contingent Shares shall be contributed to
Acquiror immediately following receipt of such dividends or distributions and
without any further action or consent required from such holder, and an
amount equal to the difference between the total amount of any such dividends
or distributions and the amount of such dividends or distributions contributed
to Acquiror by such holder pursuant to this clause (i) shall be retained by
such holder, (ii) at every meeting of the stockholders of Acquiror called with
respect to any matter, and at every adjournment or postponement thereof, and
on every action or approval by written consent of the stockholders of
Acquiror with respect to any matter, each holder of such unvested Founder
Contingent Shares or Panavision Contingent Shares shall, or shall cause the
holder of record on any applicable record date to (including via proxy), vote
such unvested Founder Contingent Shares or Panavision Contingent Shares owned
by such holder in direct proportion to the votes cast by the holders of
Acquiror Common Shares (excluding all votes in respect of any other
unvested Founder Contingent Shares and Panavision Contingent Shares) entitled
to vote thereon (including, for this purpose, any abstentions and "withhold"
votes, but disregarding any broker non-votes and other shares not present or
voted) and (iii) a holder of Founder Contingent Shares or Panavision
Contingent Shares shall not transfer, sell, pledge or otherwise dispose or
hypothecate any of his, 

 



62

    

 her or its Founder Contingent Shares or Panavision Contingent Shares unless
the transferee of such shares has, as a condition precedent to such transfer,
agreed to be bound in writing to this  _Section_ __ _ 3.16_ in a form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to Acquiror and the Panavision Holder
Representative. For example, if votes are submitted with respect to 80% of the
voting power of the Acquiror Common Shares held by the other stockholders
(excluding all votes in respect of any other unvested Founder Contingent
Shares and Panavision Contingent Shares) and 70% of those 80% are voted in
favor of the matter, 20% of the 80% are voted against the matter and 10% of
the 80% abstain, then each holder of Founder Contingent Shares or Panavision
Contingent Shares shall vote 70% of its unvested Contingent Shares in favor of
the matter, 20% of its unvested Contingent Shares against the matter and
abstain with respect to 10% of its unvested Contingent Shares. From time to
time before the scheduled date for any such meeting, at the request of any
holder of unvested Founder Contingent Shares or Panavision Contingent Shares,
Acquiror shall inform the Sponsor or Panavision Holder Representative, as
applicable, of the voting tabulations (including, for this purpose, all votes
"for" or "against" and all "abstentions" and "withhold" votes) for such
meeting (it being understood and agreed by the parties that Acquiror shall
request the proxy solicitation firm engaged by it, if any, in connection with
such meeting to provide such tabulations directly to the holders of unvested
Founder Contingent Shares or Panavision Contingent Shares from time to time
as such tabulations are provided to Acquiror) for the purpose of facilitating
the obligations and agreements to vote all unvested Founder Contingent Shares
or Panavision Contingent Shares owned by such holder in accordance with the
requirements of this _Section_ __ _ 3.16(h)_; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the failure of Acquiror to obtain, or such holder to receive, voting
tabulations pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 3.16(h)_ shall not relieve such
holder of his, her or its obligation to vote any such unvested Founder
Contingent Shares or Panavision Contingent Shares as provided in this
_Section_ __ _ 3.16(h)_. 

(i) In the event that any of the Founder Contingent Shares or Panavision
Contingent Shares have not become vested and free of restrictions pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 3.16(a)_ or _Section_ __ _ 3.16(d)_ on or prior to the end of
the Contingent Shares Period, each holder of unvested Founder Contingent
Shares or Panavision Contingent Shares shall contribute and forfeit his, her
or its unvested Contingent Shares to Acquiror for no consideration. In the
event that any Founder Contingent Shares or Panavision Contingent Shares have
not become vested and free of restrictions by the end of the Contingent
Shares Period, in furtherance of such contribution and forfeiture, each holder
of unvested Founder Contingent Shares or Panavision Contingent Shares shall
deliver his, her or its unvested Contingent Shares to Acquiror in certificated
or book entry form, as applicable, for cancellation by Acquiror. Any share
certificates representing the Founder Contingent Shares or the Panavision
Contingent Shares shall contain a legend relating to transfer restrictions
imposed by this Agreement and the risk of forfeiture associated with such
Founder Contingent Shares or such Panavision Contingent Shares. Such legend
shall, with respect to any Founder Contingent Shares or Panavision Contingent
Shares that vest and become free of restrictions pursuant to _Section_ __ _
3.16_, be removed upon the request of the holder thereof (with written notice
to Acquiror).

 

Section 3.17 _Treatment of Panavision Catch-up Plan Participants_. At the
Effective Time, any rights of the Panavision Catch-up Participants to the
Panavision Catch-up Incentive Payments shall, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of any Panavision Catch-up Plan Participant or
any other Person, be converted into (i) the right to receive the applicable
portion of the Merger Consideration as determined pursuant to  _Section_ __ _
3.1(f)_ (subject

 



63

    

 to any withholding Taxes); _provided_ , _however_ , that a portion of the
Merger Consideration that is equal to (x) the sum of the Panavision Adjustment
Escrow Amount and the Panavision Holder Representative Expense Amount,
_multiplied by_ (y) such Panavision Catch-up Participants portion of such
amounts (assuming, for purposes of such calculation, that all such amounts
are payable hereunder) (as determined in accordance with the Panavision Catch-
up Plan) shall be, in the case of the Panavision Adjustment Escrow Amount,
held in escrow in accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 2.5(c)(iii)_ and the
Escrow Agreement or, in the case of the Panavision Holder Representative
Expense Amount, held by the Panavision Holder Representative in accordance
with  _Section_ __ _ 2.5(c)(viii)_ and _Section_ __ _ 13.1_, and (ii) the
right to receive the applicable portion of the Panavision Contingent Shares as
determined pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 3.16(b)_ (subject to any withholding
taxes; _provided_ , that, prior to any amounts being withheld in respect of
the receipt of the applicable portion of the Panavision Contingent Shares, the
Company and the Panavision Holder Representative shall cooperate in good
faith to reach agreement as to the fair market value of such Panavision
Contingent Shares for purposes of such withholding). Panavision shall, upon
receipt of (x) the portion of the Aggregate Panavision Stock Consideration
and the Aggregate Panavision Cash Consideration payable to Panavision pursuant
to _Section_ __ _ 2.5(c)(x)_, or (y) any portion of the Merger Consideration
pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 3.10(f)(x)(iii)_ and _Section_ __ _
3.10(f)(y)(iii)_ or _Section_ __ _ 3.10(g)(y)(iii)_, as promptly as
practicable (and in any event not later than the next regularly
scheduled payroll date of Panavision) take all actions necessary to
distribute such Merger Consideration to the Panavision Catch-up Plan
Participants in accordance with this Agreement.

any health, life insurance or other welfare benefits to any current or former

(f) _Section_ __ _ 4.13(f)_ of the Panavision Disclosure Letter sets forth a
complete list of each Multiemployer Plan that, within the last six (6) years,

each Multiemployer Plan set forth in _Section_ __ _ 4.13(f)_ of the

any of their respective ERISA Affiliates has (i) incurred or suffered a
"complete withdrawal" or a "partial withdrawal," as such terms are

in full) or has any contingent liability under Section 4204 of ERISA, or (ii)
received written notice that any such Multiemployer Plan has undergone or is
expected to undergo a mass withdrawal or termination (or treatment of a plan
amendment as termination). The aggregate withdrawal liability of the members
of the Panavision and their respective ERISA Affiliates under Subtitle E of
Title IV of ERISA, computed as if a complete withdrawal had occurred
under each Multiemployer Plan on the date hereof, would not reasonably be
expected to result in a Panavision Material Adverse Effect.

with Section 409A of the Code with respect to any compensation paid or payable
pursuant to any Panavision Benefit Plan that is a "nonqualified deferred

(h) No member of the Panavision Group has any obligation to gross-up,
indemnify or otherwise reimburse any current or former employee, director or
other individual service provider of the Panavision Group for any tax incurred

(i) Except as set forth in _Section_ __ _ 4.13(i)_ of the Panavision
Disclosure Letter, the consummation of the Transactions will not, either

former employee, officer, director or other individual service provider of the
Panavision Group to any severance, termination, retention, change in control
or other similar payment or benefit, except as expressly provided in this
Agreement, (ii) accelerate the time of payment or vesting or trigger any
payment or funding of any compensation or benefits under any Panavision
Benefit Plan or (iii) increase the amount of compensation due any such
employee, officer, director or other individual service provider. No amounts
that could be received (whether in cash or property or the vesting
of property), either individually or in combination with any other such
payment, as a result of the consummation of the Transactions, either alone or
in a combination with another event under any Panavision Benefit Plan or
otherwise, will constitute an "excess parachute payment" under 280G of the
Code.

(j) With respect to each Panavision Benefit Plan subject to the Laws of any
jurisdiction outside the United States, (i) each such Panavision Benefit Plan
required to be registered has been registered and has been maintained in good
standing in all material respects with applicable regulatory
authorities, (ii) if intended to qualify for special Tax treatment, such
Panavision Benefit Plan meets all material requirements for such treatment and
(iii) if required under applicable Law to be funded or book reserved, such
Panavision Benefit Plan is funded or book reserved, as appropriate, in all
material respects to the extent so required by applicable Law. Each Panavision
Benefit Plan subject to the Laws of any jurisdiction outside the United States
that provides retirement benefits is a defined contribution plan.

(a) No later than three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing, Panavision
will (i) solicit from each Person who has a right to any payments or benefits
as a result of or in connection with the Transactions that would be deemed to
constitute "parachute payments" (within the meaning of Section 280G of the
Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder (hereafter, " _Section_ __ _
280G_")) (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall include payments or
benefits pursuant to agreements or arrangements entered into between Acquiror
or any of its Subsidiaries and such Person that create a right or entitlement
by such Person to receive any "parachute payments" within the meaning of
Section 280G; provided all information necessary to include any such payments
or benefits is provided to Panavision by Acquiror or its Representatives no
later than ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing), a waiver of such
Persons rights to all of such payments or benefits (to the extent waived, the

Business Days prior to soliciting such waivers and soliciting such approval
and consider in good faith any comments that Acquiror and its Representatives
may provide thereon. Prior to the Closing, Panavision shall deliver to
Acquiror reasonably satisfactory evidence that a vote of Panavisions
equityholders was solicited in accordance with the foregoing provisions of
this _Section_ __ _ 8.9_ and that either (i) the requisite number of
equityholder votes was obtained with respect to the Panavision Waived 280G
Benefits (the " _Panavision 280G Approval_ "), or (ii) that the Panavision
280G Approval was not obtained. If the Panavision 280G Approval is not
obtained, such Panavision Waived 280G Benefits shall not be paid or provided.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that any contract, agreement, or
plan is entered into by Acquiror, any of its Representatives, or the Surviving
Corporation and a disqualified individual in connection with the Transactions
prior to the Closing (the " _Panavision Acquiror Arrangements_ "),
Panavisions failure to include any Panavision Acquiror Arrangements in the
stockholder voting materials described herein, for any reason, will not
result in a breach of the covenants set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 8.9_
unless Acquiror provides a copy of such contract, agreement or plan to
Panavision at least ten (10) days prior to the Closing and sufficient
information reasonably necessary to determine the value (for purposes of

agreements or arrangements entered into between Acquiror or its Subsidiaries
and such Person that create a right or entitlement by such Person to receive
any "parachute payments" within the meaning of Section 280G; _provided_ , that
all information

 



144

    

 necessary to include any such payments or benefits is provided to SIM by
Acquiror or its Representatives no later than ten (10) Business Days prior to
the Closing), a waiver of such Persons rights to all of such payments or
benefits (to the extent waived, the " _SIM Waived 280G Benefits_ ") applicable
to such Person so that all remaining payments or benefits applicable to such
Person shall not be deemed to be "excess parachute payments" (within the
meaning of Section 280G), and (ii) solicit the approval of SIMs
equityholders, to the extent required and in a manner intended to comply with
Sections 280G(b)(5)(A)(ii) and 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and the regulations
promulgated thereunder, of any SIM Waived 280G Benefits. Prior to soliciting
such waivers and soliciting such approval, SIM shall (A) provide drafts of
such waivers and such equityholder approval materials to Acquiror and its
Representatives for their review no later than five (5) Business Days prior to
soliciting such waivers and soliciting such approval and consider in good
faith any comments that Acquiror and its Representatives may provide thereon,
and (B) provide supporting calculations with respect to all Persons who are
reasonably expected to be "disqualified individuals" for purposes of Section
280G of the Code to Acquiror, Panavision and the Panavision Holder
Representative promptly (and in any event within thirty (30) days) after the
date hereof. Prior to the Closing, SIM shall deliver to Acquiror reasonably
satisfactory evidence that a vote of SIMs equityholders was solicited
in accordance with the foregoing provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 8.9_ and
that either (1) the requisite number of equityholder votes was obtained with
respect to the SIM Waived 280G Benefits (the " _SIM 280G Approval_ "), or (2)
that the SIM 280G Approval was not obtained. In the event that SIM is unable
to obtain a signed waiver from any affected Person, and the SIM 280G Approval
is not obtained, all related SIM 280G Losses shall be treated as SIM
Transaction Expenses. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that any
contract, agreement, or plan is entered into by Acquiror or any of its
Representatives and a disqualified individual in connection with the
Transactions prior to the Closing (the " _SIM Acquiror Arrangements_ "),
SIMs failure to include any SIM Acquiror Arrangements in the stockholder
voting materials described herein, for any reason, will not result in a breach
of the covenants set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 8.9_ unless Acquiror
provides a copy of such contract, agreement or plan to SIM at least ten (10)
days prior to the Closing and sufficient information reasonably necessary to
determine the value (for purposes of Section 280G of the Code) of any
payments or benefits granted or contemplated therein, which may be paid or
granted in connection with the Transactions that would be deemed to constitute
a "parachute payment" under Section 280G of the Code.

to their exercise of carry-along requirements with respect to the Purchase
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.2_ of the SIM Shareholders Agreement (the "
_SIM Compulsory Sale Notice_ "), in the form previously approved by Acquiror.
From the date of this Agreement through the earlier of the Closing or the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Article_ __ _ XII_, none
of the Dragging SIM Holders shall revoke, modify, amend, waive or permit
termination of the SIM Compulsory Sale Notice without Acquirors prior written
consent.

(a) All rights to indemnification, exculpation and advancement of expenses
existing in favor of the current or former directors, officers, employees and

(the " _D andO Indemnified Persons_"), as provided in the certificate of
incorporation, articles of organization, bylaws or similar constituent
documents of Acquiror, Panavision, SIM or any of their respective
Subsidiaries, as applicable, in effect on the date of this Agreement, or in

Corporation, SIM and their respective successors, if any, to contain
provisions no less favorable with respect to exculpation, indemnification and
advancement of expenses of present and former directors and officers of

incorporation, bylaws or other governing documents of Acquiror, Panavision or

150

    

(c) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary,
this  _Section_ __ _ 9.2_ (i) is intended to be for the benefit of, and will
be enforceable by, each DandO Indemnified Person, and each DandO Indemnified
Persons heirs, legatees, Representatives, successors and assigns, and (ii)
shall survive the consummation of the Transactions indefinitely and shall be
binding, jointly and severally, on all successors and assigns of Acquiror, the
Surviving Corporation and SIM. In the event that Acquiror, the
Surviving Corporation, SIM or any of their respective successors or assigns
consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets
to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so
that the successors and assigns of Acquiror, the Surviving Corporation or SIM,
as the case may be, shall succeed to the obligations set forth in this
_Section_ __ _ 9.2_.

Section 9.3 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) From and after the Closing Date and for a period of one (1) year following
the Closing Date, Acquiror shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries, including
the Companies, to provide to each employee of each Company Group immediately
prior to the Closing Date who continues in employment with Acquiror or its
Subsidiaries, including such Company Group (each, a " _Continuing Employee_
"), with (i) annual base salary or hourly wage rate, as applicable, and cash
target bonus opportunity that are substantially comparable in the aggregate in
all material respects to the annual base salary or hourly wage rate,
as applicable, and cash target bonus opportunity (excluding equity-based
incentive arrangements) that were provided to such Continuing Employee
immediately prior to the Closing Date, (ii) severance benefits and protections
that are substantially comparable in the aggregate in all material respects
to the severance benefits and protections that were provided to such
Continuing Employee under the applicable Company Benefit Plan in effect
immediately prior to the Closing Date and set forth in  _Section_ __ _
9.3(a)_ of the Panavision Disclosure Letter or of the SIM Disclosure Letter,
as applicable, and (iii) employee benefits (including health, welfare and
defined contribution retirement benefits, but excluding any equity or equity-
related compensation, defined benefit pension plan, retiree health benefit
plan, retention, change of control, transaction or similar bonuses) that are
substantially comparable in the aggregate in all material respects to
those provided to the Continuing Employees under the applicable Company
Benefit Plan in effect immediately prior to the Closing Date. Notwithstanding
any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, the compensation, benefits,
and other employment terms and conditions of Continuing Employees represented
by a labor union, works council or other labor organization shall be
exclusively governed by applicable Law and the terms of any Contract with any
such labor union, works council or other labor organization.

(b) With respect to benefit plans maintained by Acquiror or its Subsidiaries,
including the Companies, that provide employee benefits to Continuing
Employees after the Closing (the " _Post-Closing Benefit Plans_ "), for
purposes of eligibility to participate, determination of severance amounts,
future vacation accruals and vesting (other than vesting of future equity
awards) (but, for the avoidance of doubt, not for benefit accrual purposes
under any defined benefit pension plan), each Continuing Employees service
with the applicable Company Group (and its respective predecessors) shall
be treated as service with Acquiror or any of its Subsidiaries, including the
Surviving Corporation to the same extent as such service was taken into
account under a corresponding Company Benefit Plan immediately prior to the
Closing; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that such service shall not be recognized
to the extent that such recognition would result in any duplication of
benefits.

 



151

    

(c) Acquiror shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries, including the Companies,
to use commercially reasonable efforts to cause (i) each Continuing Employee
to be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any
and all Post-Closing Benefit Plans (except to the extent that such waiting
periods applied to the Continuing Employee under comparable Company Benefit
Plans), (ii) with respect to each Post-Closing Benefit Plan providing medical,
dental, hospital, pharmaceutical or vision benefits, all pre-
existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such Post-
Closing Benefit Plan to be waived for such Continuing Employee and his or her
covered dependents (except to the extent that such exclusions or requirements
applied to the Continuing Employee under comparable Company Benefit Plans) and
(iii) any co-payments, deductibles and other eligible expenses incurred by
such Continuing Employee or his or her covered dependents during the plan year
ending on the Closing Date to be credited for purposes of satisfying all
deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to
such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable
plan year of each comparable Post-Closing Benefit Plan (to the extent such
credit would have been given under comparable Company Benefit Plans prior to
the Closing).

(d) Nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 9.3_, express or implied, is intended to
or shall confer upon any current or former employee or other individual
service provider of any member of either Company Group (including any
beneficiary or dependent thereof) any right, benefit or remedy of any nature
whatsoever, including any third-party beneficiary right, under or by reason of
this Agreement, and no provision of this _Section_ __ _ 9.3_ shall constitute
an amendment of, or an undertaking to establish or amend, any Company Benefit
Plan, Post-Closing Benefit Plan or other benefit plan of Acquiror or any of
its Affiliates. No provision of this Agreement shall be construed as a
guarantee of continued employment or service of any employee or other
individual service provider of any member of either Company Group and this
Agreement shall not be construed so as to prohibit any member of either
Company Group from having the right to terminate the employment or service of
any such individual following the Closing.

(e) Nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 9.3_ derogates from any rights of Canadian
employees under applicable Canadian Law (including contracts and common law).

Section 9.4 _Financing_.

 

(a) Acquiror, Panavision Acquisition Sub and SIM Acquisition Sub shall use
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and do, or
cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to arrange and
obtain the Debt Financing and the PIPE Investment on the terms and conditions
described in the applicable Debt Commitment Letters and the PIPE Documents,
as applicable, including using reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in
effect the Debt Commitment Letters and the PIPE Documents, (ii) satisfy (or
obtain the waiver of, if deemed advisable by Acquiror) on a timely basis all
conditions to the extent the satisfaction of such conditions requires the
cooperation of or is within the control of Acquiror, Panavision Acquisition
Sub or SIM Acquisition Sub (or their Affiliates) in the Debt Commitment
Letters and any definitive documentation relating to the Debt Financing and
the PIPE Documents, as

 



152

    

 applicable, as of or prior to the Closing, (iii) negotiate and enter into
definitive agreements with respect thereto on the terms and conditions
contemplated by the applicable Debt Commitment Letters (including any related

equal to or greater than $10.00 per share.

 

(b) Acquiror shall give each of the Companies and the Holder Representatives
prompt (and in any event, within two (2) Business Days) written notice (i) of
any breach or default by any party to any Debt Commitment Letters or any
definitive agreement with respect to the Debt Financing (the " _Debt
Documents_ ") or the PIPE Documents, in each case, of which Acquiror,
Panavision Acquisition Sub or SIM Acquisition Sub becomes aware, (ii) if and
when Acquiror, Panavision Acquisition Sub or SIM Acquisition Sub becomes aware
that any portion of the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letters or the PIPE Investment contemplated by the PIPE Documents
may not be available to consummate the Transactions, (iii) of the receipt of
any written notice or other written communication from any Person with respect
to any (A) actual or potential breach, default, termination or repudiation by
any party to any Debt Commitment Letter, other Debt Document or PIPE Document
or (B) material dispute or disagreement between or among any parties to any
Debt Commitment Letter, other Debt Document or PIPE Document (but excluding,
for the avoidance of doubt, any ordinary course negotiations with respect to
the terms of the Debt Financing, the PIPE Investment, the Debt Documents or
the PIPE Documents, as applicable), and (iv) if for any reason any portion of
the Debt Financing or the PIPE Investment required for Acquiror to make all
payments required by it under this Agreement on the Closing Date becomes
unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated in any Debt Commitment
Letters (including flex terms) (or on other terms that would not be prohibited
by _Section_ __ _ 9.4(d)_) or the PIPE Documents, as applicable. As soon as
reasonably practicable, but in any event, within two (2) Business Days
following delivery by Panavision to Acquiror of written request therefor,

relating to any circumstance referred to in clause (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv)
of the immediately preceding sentence; _provided_ , that in no event will
Acquiror be under any obligation to disclose any information that is (x)
subject to the terms of a confidentiality agreement with a third Person
(excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any such terms in a confidentiality
agreement with Sponsor or any of its Affiliates) or (y) subject to any
attorney-client privilege to the extent that Acquiror determines that the
disclosure of such information would reasonably be likely to result in a loss
of such privilege; _provided_ , _further_ , that if any information is
withheld pursuant to the immediately preceding proviso, Acquiror will (x)
inform each of the Companies and the Holder Representatives as to the general
nature of what is being withheld and (y) use its reasonable best efforts (1)
to accommodate any request from any of the Companies or the Holder
Representatives for information pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 9.4(b)_ in
a manner that does not result in such a violation or waiver or (2) to obtain
the required consent of such third Person to permit such access or disclosure.
Without limiting the foregoing, Acquiror, 

 



153

    

 Panavision Acquisition Sub and SIM Acquisition Sub shall keep the Companies
and the Holder Representatives informed in reasonable detail on a reasonably
current basis of the status of their efforts to arrange and consummate the
Debt Financing and the PIPE Investment (including any Alternative Financing),
and shall provide to such Company copies of (x) the drafts of the material
definitive documents related to the Debt Financing or the PIPE Investment
prior to distribution of such drafts to the applicable Debt Financing Sources
or the PIPE Investors (or, in each case, their counsel) (it being agreed that
Panavision and its Representatives shall have the right to review and provide
comments to Acquiror on any such draft material definitive documents related
to the Debt Financing or the PIPE Investment and Acquiror shall consider, in
good faith, any such comments proposed by Panavision or any of its
Representatives and any such comments promptly and reasonably proposed shall
be included in drafts thereafter provided by Acquiror or its counsel) and (y)

on the Closing Date becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions described
in the applicable Debt Commitment Letters (including flex terms) (or on other
terms that would not be prohibited by _Section_ __ _ 9.4(d)_) or the PIPE
Documents, as applicable, Acquiror, Panavision Acquisition Sub and SIM
Acquisition Sub shall use reasonable best efforts to arrange and obtain
alternative financing, including from alternative sources, in an amount
sufficient (when added to the portion of the Debt Financing and the PIPE
Investment that is available and other available funds) to consummate the
Transactions on the Closing Date (" _Alternative Financing_ ") as promptly as
practicable following the occurrence of such event but no later than the
Closing Date (i) on terms not materially less favorable (including with
respect to conditionality, to the availability and funding of any Debt
Financing) from the standpoint of Acquiror, Panavision Acquisition Sub, SIM
Acquisition Sub and the Affiliates of Acquiror, Panavision Acquisition Sub and
SIM Acquisition Sub party thereto and the Company Groups than those in the
applicable Debt Commitment Letters or the PIPE Documents, as applicable (and,
in the case of the Debt Commitment Letters, taking into account the flex
provisions), and (ii) containing conditions and other terms that would
reasonably be expected to affect the availability of the Alternative Financing
that (A) are not more onerous, taken as a whole, than those conditions and
terms contained in the Debt Commitment Letters or the PIPE Documents, as
applicable, as of the date hereof, (B) would not reasonably be expected to
delay, impede or prevent the Closing and (C) do not adversely affect the
ability of Acquiror or the Panavision Holder Representative (in the case of
the PIPE Documents) to enforce its rights against other parties to the
Alternative Financing (including all definitive documentation) relative to
the ability of Acquiror to enforce its rights against the other parties to the
Debt Commitment Letters or the PIPE Documents, as applicable, as in effect on
the date hereof or in the related definitive agreements. All references to
the Debt Financing or the PIPE Investment shall be deemed to include such
Alternative Financing and all references to the Debt Commitment Letters, the
PIPE Investment, the Debt Documents or the PIPE Documents shall include the
applicable documents for the Alternative Financing. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, after the date hereof, neither Acquiror nor any
of its Affiliates shall enter into any Contract or arrangement with any PIPE
investor related to the PIPE Investment without the prior written consent of

Acquiror, Panavision Acquisition Sub and SIM Acquisition Sub shall have the
right from time to time to amend, replace, supplement or otherwise modify, or
waive any of its rights under, any Debt Commitment Letters, the Debt Documents
or the PIPE Documents, or replace or amend the Debt Commitment Letters to add
lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities
who had not executed the Debt Commitment Letters as of the date hereof, in
each case only with the prior written consent of the Panavision Holder
Representative. All references to the Debt Commitment Letters or the PIPE

their respective assets or businesses. Such cooperation shall include the
retention of and (upon the other partys request) the provision of records
and information reasonably relevant to any such Action and making employees
available on a mutually convenient basis to provide information and
explanation of any material provided hereunder. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this _Section_ __ _ 10.3(b)_, in the event of any dispute

member of the SIM Group. The SIM Sellers shall provide, and shall cause any
member of the SIM Group to provide, to Acquiror all data and information that
any of the SIM Sellers or any member of the SIM Group has in its possession
(or that can reasonably be obtained from a third party) and that is reasonably
requested by Acquiror to enable Acquiror, in its sole discretion,
to determine whether or not to make a Section 338(g) Election; _provided_ ,
that Acquiror shall bear all reasonable third-party costs and expenses
incurred in connection with so providing or obtaining such data or
information.

the forms of insurance binder attached hereto as _Exhibit_ __ _ J-1_ with
respect to the Merger (the " _Panavision R andW Policy_") and _Exhibit_ __ _
J-2_ with respect to the Purchase (the " _SIM R andW Policy_" and, together with
the Panavision RandW Policy, the " _R andW Policies_") each of which has, as of
the date hereof, been "conditionally" bound by Acquiror; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that (i) the RandW Policies shall provide that the insurer
shall have no, and shall waive and not pursue any and all, subrogation rights

(in the case of the Panavision RandW Policy) or the SIM Sellers (in the case of
the SIM RandW Policy), in each case, except for Actual Fraud; (ii) the
Panavision Holders, the Panavision Catch-up Plan Participants and the SIM
Sellers are third party beneficiaries of such waiver; (iii) Acquiror shall
not amend the SIM RandW Policy in a manner adverse to the Panavision Holders
without the Panavision Holder Representatives prior written consent; and (iv)
Acquiror shall not amend the Panavision RandW Policy in a manner adverse to the
SIM Sellers without the SIM Holder Representatives prior written consent.
Acquiror shall keep the Panavision Holder Representative and the SIM Holder
Representative reasonably informed with respect to all material activity
concerning the status of the applicable RandW Policy. All premiums and related
costs due (a) under the Panavision RandW Policy shall be borne 70% by Acquiror
and the remaining 30% shall be treated as Panavision Transaction Expenses (
_provided_ , that if the Panavision Holders and the Panavision Catch-up Plan
Participants would, in the aggregate, bear greater than 50% of the costs due
under the Panavision RandW Policy by having such costs treated as Panavision
Transaction Expenses, taking into account the Panavision Holders and the
Panavision Catch-up Plan Participants collective equity ownership of
Acquiror immediately following the Closing, then such costs shall be
reallocated such that the Panavision Holders and the Panavision Catch-up Plan
Participants directly and indirectly bear no more than 50% of such costs and
Acquiror shall bear the cost of

 



166

    

 the reallocated amount) and (b) under the SIM RandW Policy shall be borne 70%
by Acquiror and the remaining 30% shall be treated as SIM Transaction

Closing or as otherwise provided under the applicable RandW Policy; _provided_ ,
that, for the avoidance of doubt, any premium to "conditionally" bind the RandW

of the Companies, the SIM Sellers and the Holder Representatives further

with respect to actions taken or omitted to be taken in its capacity as a
Holder Representative (except for those arising out of such Holder
Representatives gross negligence, willful breach or willful misconduct). The
Panavision Holders and the SIM Sellers shall indemnify, defend and hold
harmless the Panavision Holder Representative or the SIM Holder
Representative, as applicable, from and against any loss, liability, damage,
claim, costs, fees or expenses (including the fees and expenses of counsel
and experts and their staffs and all expense of document location, duplication
and shipment) arising out of or in connection with any Action or in connection
with any appeal thereof, relating to the acts or omissions of the applicable
Holder Representative under this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement, or

in each case arising out of or in connection with the performance of the
Panavision Holder Representative or the SIM Holder Representative, as
applicable, of its duties in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. A
decision, act, consent or instruction of either of the Holder Representatives
shall constitute a decision of all of the applicable Pre-Closing Company

Company Holder. Each of the Holder Representatives shall at all times be
entitled to rely on any directions, acts, consents, waivers or instructions
received from the applicable Pre-Closing Company Holders and shall act in
accordance with such instructions. In no event will either of the Holder
Representatives be required (absent its specific agreement to do so, in its
sole discretion), to the extent such costs are not covered by the Panavision
Holder Representative Expense Amount or the SIM Holder Representative Expense

 



182

    

 Amount, as applicable, to incur costs, expenses or fees or advance its own
funds on behalf of the applicable Pre-Closing Company Holders, or in any
other manner in connection with the performance of its duties as a Holder
Representative. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
any restrictions or limitations on liability or indemnity set forth elsewhere
in this Agreement are not intended to be applicable to the indemnities
provided to the Holder Representative under this _Section_ __ _ 13.1_. The
foregoing indemnities will survive the Closing, the resignation or removal of
either of the Holder Representatives or the termination of this Agreement.

by execution of a Letter of Transmittal or by receipt of any portion of the
Merger Consideration), each Panavision Holder authorizes the Panavision
Holder Representative to use the Panavision Holder Representative Expense
Amount to satisfy costs, expenses or liabilities of the Panavision Holder
Representative in connection with matters related to this Agreement or the
Ancillary Agreements, with any balance of the Panavision Holder Representative
Expense Amount not used for such purposes to be disbursed and paid to the
Panavision Holders and the Panavision Catch-up Plan Participants in
accordance with each Panavision Holders Fully Diluted Percentage of such
proportionate amount that the Panavision Holders are entitled to and the
proportionate amount that the Panavision Catch-up Plan Participants are
entitled to (in each case, determined based on the amounts that the Adjusted
Panavision Holder Representative Expense Amount bears to the total Panavision
Holder Expense Amount and the amount of the Panavision Holder Expense Amount
that the Panavision Catch-up Plan Participants are entitled to pursuant to the
terms of the Catch-up Plan) at such time as the Panavision Holder
Representative determines in its sole discretion that no such costs, expenses
or liabilities shall become due and payable, and (ii) by approving
this Agreement (whether by vote, resolution or by receipt of any portion of
the SIM Purchase Price), each SIM Seller authorizes the SIM Holder
Representative to use the SIM Holder Representative Expense Amount to satisfy
costs, expenses or liabilities of the SIM Holder Representative in connection
with matters related to this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements, with any
balance of the SIM Holder Representative Expense Amount not used for such
purposes to be disbursed and paid to the SIM Sellers in accordance with each
SIM Sellers Fully Diluted Percentage of such amount at such time as the SIM
Holder Representative determines in its sole discretion that no such costs,
expenses or liabilities shall become due and payable.

(a) _Designation of the Sponsor-Designated Directors_. From and after the
Effective Time, the Sponsor-Designated Directors shall, subject to the last
sentence of _Section_ __ _ 13.2(b)_, serve as representatives of Acquiror to

and direct all actions of Acquiror, in each case, related to the rights and
obligations of Acquiror, Panavision Acquisition Sub and SIM Acquisition Sub
(and the rights and obligations of the Pre-Closing Acquiror Holders) pursuant
to this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements; _provided_ , that any such
decisions and actions shall be taken in good faith based solely on, and will
be in accordance with, the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements. In the event of a Sponsor-Designated Directors death,
resignation, removal or refusal to serve, then, if prior to the Effective
Time, the Acquiror Board or, if following the Effective Time, Sponsor shall
designate another individual that is a director of the Acquiror Board as a
replacement for such Sponsor-Designated Director.

 



183

    

(b) _Authority and Rights of the Sponsor-Designated Directors_. Subject to the
last sentence of this _Section_ __ _ 13.2(b)_, each of the Sponsor-
Designated Directors shall have such powers and authority as are necessary to

_however_ , that the Sponsor-Designated Directors shall have no obligation to
act on behalf of the Pre-Closing Acquiror Holders, except as expressly
provided in this Agreement or in the Ancillary Agreements. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, but subject to the last sentence of this
_Section_ __ _ 13.2(b)_, the Sponsor-Designated Directors shall have full
power, authority and discretion, for and on behalf of the Pre-Closing
Acquiror Holders, Acquiror, Panavision Acquisition Sub and SIM Acquisition Sub
to (i) negotiate and enter into amendments to this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements and (ii) dispute, negotiate, settle and take other actions as may
be required in connection with (A) the final calculation and determination of
Closing Date NWC, Closing Date Indebtedness, Closing Date Cash, Closing Date
Unpaid Transaction Expenses and Final Capex Shortfall, as contemplated in
_Section_ __ _ 3.10_, and (B) matters arising out of or relating to this
Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements and the Transactions, in each case, with
respect to the Panavision Group (and, for the avoidance of doubt, the
Panavision-Designated Directors shall abstain from any vote with respect to
any such matter). None of the Sponsor-Designated Directors shall have any
liability to Acquiror, the Companies, the Pre-Closing Company Holders, the
Holder Representatives or any holder of Acquiror Common Shares or Acquiror
Preferred Shares or warrants to purchase Acquiror Common Shares or Acquiror
Preferred Shares, with respect to actions taken or omitted to be taken in his
or her capacity as a Sponsor-Designated Director as designated hereunder
(except for those arising out of such Sponsor-Designated Directors bad faith,
gross negligence, willful breach, fraud or willful misconduct, or a breach of
the duty of loyalty to Acquiror or its stockholders), but without effect on
such Sponsor-Designated Directors duties to Acquiror and its shareholders in
his or her capacity as a member of the Acquiror Board in matters unrelated to
this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements and the Transactions. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement or in any Ancillary Agreement to the contrary, any
matters of Acquiror or any of its Subsidiaries at or after the Effective Time
related to Sponsor (or any of the other Class F Holders) under this Agreement,
any Ancillary Agreement or otherwise related to the Transactions (including
any of the covenants, obligations or agreements of Sponsor or any of
the other Class F Holders), shall be determined by, and shall be within the
exclusive authority of, the Acquiror Board (excluding the Sponsor-Designated
Directors, such Acquiror Board constituency, the " _Disinterested
Acquiror Board_ "), including the exercise of any rights or remedies under or
the taking of any action with respect to any of the foregoing; _provided_ ,
that any such decisions and actions shall be taken in good faith based solely
on, and will be in accordance with, the terms and conditions of this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements. Any determination made by the
Disinterested Acquiror Board pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence
shall be approved by a majority of the Disinterested Acquiror Board and, for
the avoidance of doubt, the other procedures governing the meetings and
actions of the entire Acquiror Board under the Acquiror Governing Documents
(including quorum, voting, notice and other similar requirements) shall apply
to the Disinterested Acquiror Board, _mutatis mutandis_.

waive or provide consent or approval with regard to any matter requiring
consent or approval pursuant to any of the covenants, agreements or

_Section_ __ _ 10.1_, _Section_ __ _ 10.2_ and _Section_ __ _ 10.4_). Any
waiver of any term or condition shall not be construed as a waiver of
any subsequent breach or a subsequent waiver of the same term or condition,

any party hereto to assert any of its rights hereunder shall not constitute a
waiver of such rights.

governed by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of

Laws of another jurisdiction. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, any right or obligation with respect to any Debt Financing Source
in connection with this Agreement or the Debt Financing (including any
Alternative Financing), the commitment letter related thereto and the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, and any Action relating thereto
or arising hereunder or thereunder, shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the Laws of the State of New York.

Section 14.8 _Captions; Counterparts_. The captions in this Agreement are for
convenience only and shall not be considered a part of or affect the
construction or interpretation of any provision of this Agreement. This
Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be
deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the
same instrument.

 

Section 14.9 _Disclosure Letters_. The Panavision Disclosure Letter, the SIM
Disclosure Letter and the Acquiror Disclosure Letter (including, in each
case, any section thereof) referenced herein are a part of this Agreement as
if fully set forth herein. All references herein to the Panavision Disclosure
Letter, the SIM Disclosure Letter or the Acquiror Disclosure
Letter (including, in each case, any section thereof) shall be deemed
references to such parts of this Agreement, unless the context shall otherwise
require. Any disclosure made by a party in the applicable Disclosure Letter,
or any section thereof, with reference to any section of this Agreement or
section of the applicable Disclosure Letter shall be deemed to be a disclosure
with respect to such other applicable sections of this Agreement or sections
of the applicable Disclosure Letter if the relevance of such disclosure to
such other sections is reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure.
Certain information set forth in the Disclosure Letters is included solely for
informational purposes and may not be required to be disclosed pursuant to
this Agreement. The disclosure of any information shall not be deemed to
constitute an acknowledgment that such information is required to be disclosed
in connection with the representations and warranties made in this Agreement,
nor shall such information be deemed to establish a standard of materiality.
The specification of any dollar amount in the representations or warranties
contained in this Agreement or the inclusion of any specific item in the
Panavision Disclosure Letter, the SIM Disclosure Letter or the Acquiror
Disclosure Letter, as applicable, is not intended to imply that such amounts,
or higher or lower amounts, or the items so included or other items, are or
are not material, and no party shall use the fact of the setting of such
amounts or the inclusion of any such item in any dispute or controversy as to
whether any obligation, item

 



190

    

 or matter not described herein or included in the Panavision Disclosure
Letter, the SIM Disclosure Letter or the Acquiror Disclosure Letter, as
applicable, is or is not material for purposes of this Agreement. Any
capitalized term used in any Exhibit or Schedule but not otherwise defined
therein shall have the meaning given to such term in this Agreement.

 

Section 14.10 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (together with the Panavision
Disclosure Letter, the SIM Disclosure Letter and the Acquiror Disclosure
Letter), the Ancillary Agreements, the Panavision Confidentiality Agreement,
the SIM Confidentiality Agreement and the Companies Confidentiality Agreement
constitute the entire agreement among the parties relating to the
subject matter hereof and supersede any other agreements, whether written or
oral, that may have been made or entered into by or among any of the parties
hereto or any of their respective Subsidiaries relating to the subject matter
hereof. No party shall be liable or bound to any other party in any manner by
any representations, warranties, covenants, understandings, agreements, oral
or otherwise, relating to the subject matter hereof except as expressly set
forth in this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements, the Panavision
Confidentiality Agreement, the SIM Confidentiality Agreement and the Companies
Confidentiality Agreement. The parties hereto hereby agree that each of the
Panavision Confidentiality Agreement, the SIM Confidentiality Agreement and
the Companies Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate upon the Closing.

Section 14.11 _Amendments_. This Agreement may be amended or modified in
whole or in part, only by a duly authorized (including pursuant to the
provisions of _Article_ __ _ XIII_) agreement in writing by, prior to the
Closing, Acquiror, Panavision, SIM, the Panavision Holder Representative and
the SIM Holder Representative and, after the closing, Acquiror, the Panavision
Holder Representative and the SIM Holder Representative and which makes
reference to this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein,
_Section_ __ _ 14.5_, the last sentence of _Section_ __ _ 14.7_, this
_Section_ __ _ 14.11_ and _Section_ __ _ 14.14_ (and the related definitions
and other provisions of this Agreement to the extent a modification or waiver
thereof would serve to modify the substance or provisions of such sections)
may not be amended or modified in a manner materially adverse to any Debt
Financing Source without its prior written consent.

Section 14.12 _Publicity_.

 

(a) All press releases or other public communications relating to the
Transactions, and the method of the release for publication thereof, shall
prior to the Closing be subject to the prior mutual approval of Acquiror, the
Companies and the Holder Representatives, which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld by any party; _provided_ , that no party shall be
required to obtain consent pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 14.12(a)_ to the
extent any proposed release or statement is substantially equivalent to the
information that has previously been made public without breach of the
obligation under this  _Section_ __ _ 14.12(a)_.

(b) The restriction in _Section_ __ _ 14.12(a)_ shall not apply to
the extent the public announcement is required by applicable securities Law,
any Governmental Authority or stock exchange rule; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that, without otherwise limiting any other obligations in this Agreement, in
such an event, the party making the announcement shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to consult with the other parties in advance as to its
form, content and timing and shall consider, in good faith, any changes
proposed by the other parties and shall accept any

 



191

    

 reasonable comments proposed by such party. For the avoidance of doubt,
disclosures resulting from the parties efforts to obtain expiration or
termination of all waiting periods under the HSR Act or Investment Canada Act
Approval and to make any related filing, in each case, otherwise in accordance
with this Agreement shall be deemed not to violate this _Section_ __ _
14.12_.

 

Notwithstanding anything in this _Section_ __ _ 14.12_ or this Agreement to
the contrary, the parties hereto agree that certain Panavision Holders are or
are affiliated with private equity, hedge or similar funds and that such
Panavision Holders may provide general information about the subject matter of
this Agreement and the Transactions to their investors in connection with
normal fund raising and related marketing or informational or reporting
activities of such Persons of the kind customarily provided with respect to
investments of this nature.

 

Section 14.13 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement is held
invalid or unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction, the other
provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. The
parties further agree that if any provision contained herein is, to any
extent, held invalid or unenforceable in any respect under the Laws
governing this Agreement, they shall take any actions necessary to render the
remaining provisions of this Agreement valid and enforceable to the fullest
extent permitted by Law and, to the extent necessary, shall amend or otherwise
modify this Agreement to replace any provision contained herein that is held
invalid or unenforceable with a valid and enforceable provision giving effect
to the intent of the parties.

 

Section 14.14 _Jurisdiction_ _; Waiver of Jury Trial_.

 

(a) Any Action based upon, arising out of or related to this Agreement or the
Transactions must be brought in the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware (or, to the extent such court does not have subject matter
jurisdiction, the Superior Court of the State of Delaware), or, if it has or
can acquire jurisdiction, in the United States District Court for the District
of Delaware, and each of the parties irrevocably submits to the exclusive
jurisdiction of each such court in any such Action, waives any objection it
may now or hereafter have to personal jurisdiction, venue or inconvenience of
forum, agrees that all claims in respect of the Action shall be heard and
determined only in any such court, and agrees not to bring any Action arising
out of or relating to this Agreement or the Transactions in any other
court. Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to affect the right of any
party to serve process in any manner permitted by Law or to commence an Action
or otherwise proceed against any other party in any other jurisdiction, in
each case, to enforce judgments obtained in any Action brought pursuant to
this _Section_ __ _ 14.14_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, each of the Companies, the SIM Sellers, the Panavision Holder
Representative, the SIM Holder Representative, Acquiror, Panavision
Acquisition Sub and SIM Acquisition Sub agrees that it will not, and in the
case of the Companies will cause its Subsidiaries not to, bring or support any
Action of any kind or description, whether at law or in equity, whether in
contract or in tort or otherwise, against the Debt Financing Sources in any
way relating to this Agreement or any of the Transactions, including any
dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the Debt Commitment Letters
or the performance thereof, in any forum other than the Supreme Court of the
State of New York, County of New York, or, if under applicable Law exclusive
jurisdiction is vested in the federal courts, the United States District Court
for the Southern District of New York (and appellate courts thereof).

 



192

    

(b) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT AND THE TRANSACTIONS IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED
AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY,
UNCONDITIONALLY AND VOLUNTARILY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A
TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY ACTION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF
OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE DEBT FINANCING OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS.

Section 14.15  _Enforcement_. The parties hereto agree that irreparable
damage for which monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate
remedy, would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement
were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to
specific enforcement of the terms and provisions of this Agreement, in
addition to any other remedy to which any party is entitled at Law or in
equity. In the event that any Action shall be brought in equity to enforce the
provisions of this Agreement, no party shall allege, and each party hereby
waives the defense, that there is an adequate remedy at Law, and each party
agrees to waive any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in
connection therewith.

 

Section 14.16 _Non-Recourse_. This Agreement may only be enforced against, and
any Action based upon, arising out of, or related to this Agreement or the
Transactions may only be brought against, the Persons that are expressly named
as parties hereto and any express guarantor of any such partys obligations
hereunder and then only with respect to the specific obligations set forth
herein with respect to such party. Except to the extent a named party to this
Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement (and then only to the extent of the
specific obligations undertaken by such named party in this Agreement or such
Ancillary Agreement and not otherwise), no past, present or future Affiliate,
Representative, stockholder, equityholder, member or partner of any party
hereto or of any partys Affiliates shall have any liability (whether in
contract, tort, equity or otherwise) for any one or more of the
representations, warranties, covenants, agreements or other obligations or
liabilities of any one or more of the Company or Acquiror under this Agreement
(whether for indemnification or otherwise) of or for any claim based on,
arising out of, or related to this Agreement or the Transactions.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, nothing herein
shall limit or restrict the ability to bring a claim for Actual Fraud.

Section 14.17 _Conflicts and Privilege_.

 

(a) Acquiror, the Companies, the SIM Sellers and the Holder Representatives on
behalf of the applicable Pre-Closing Company Holders hereby agree that, in
the event a dispute with respect to this Agreement or the Transactions arises
after the Closing between or among Acquiror, the Sponsor-Designated Directors
or Sponsor, on the one hand, and the Company, the Pre-Closing Company Holders
or the Holder Representatives, on the other hand, any legal counsel (including
Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP) that represented Acquiror, the
Sponsor-Designated Directors or Sponsor prior to the Closing may represent the
Sponsor-Designated Directors or Sponsor in such dispute even though the
interests of the Sponsor-Designated Directors or Sponsor may be
directly adverse to Acquiror, and even though such counsel may have
represented Acquiror in a matter substantially related to such dispute, or

 



193

    

 may be handling ongoing matters for Acquiror, the Sponsor-Designated
Directors or Sponsor. Acquiror, the Companies, the SIM Sellers and the Holder
Representatives on behalf of the applicable Pre-Closing Company Holders
further agree that, as to all legally privileged communications prior to the
Closing between or among any legal counsel (including Skadden, Arps, Slate,
Meagher and Flom LLP) that represented Acquiror, the Sponsor-Designated
Directors or Sponsor prior to the Closing and any one or more such Persons
that relate in any way to the Transactions, the attorney/client privilege and
the expectation of client confidence belongs to the Sponsor-Designated
Directors and may be controlled by such Sponsor-Designated Directors, and
shall not pass to or be claimed or controlled by Acquiror (after giving effect
to the Closing), the Companies or the Pre-Closing Company Holders; _provided_
, that the Sponsor-Designated Directors shall not waive such attorney/client
privilege other than to the extent they determine appropriate in connection
with the enforcement or defense of their respective rights or obligations
existing under this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any privileged
communications or information shared by the Companies or the Pre-Closing
Company Holders (other than Granite) prior to the Closing with Acquiror,
Sponsor or the Sponsor-Designated Directors (in any capacity) shall remain the
privileged communications or information of the Surviving Corporation.

(b) Recognizing that Kirkland and Ellis LLP has acted as legal counsel to the
Panavision Group, the Principal Panavision Holders, the Panavision Holder
Representative and their respective Affiliates prior to the Closing, and that
Kirkland and Ellis LLP intends to act as legal counsel to the Principal
Panavision Holders, the Panavision Holder Representative and their respective
Affiliates (which will no longer include the Panavision Group) after the
Closing, Acquiror hereby waives, on its own behalf and agrees to cause its
Affiliates to waive, any conflicts that may arise in connection with Kirkland
and Ellis LLP representing any of the Principal Panavision Holders, the
Panavision Holder Representative or their Affiliates after the Closing as such
representation may relate to Acquiror, any Company Group or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any of the Ancillary
Agreements.

(c) Recognizing that Stikeman Elliott LLP has acted as legal counsel to the
SIM Group and Granite prior to the Closing, and that Stikeman Elliott LLP
intends to act as legal counsel to Granite after the Closing, Acquiror hereby
waives, on its own behalf and agrees to cause its Affiliates to waive,
any conflicts that may arise in connection with Stikeman Elliott LLP
representing Granite after the Closing as such representation may relate to
Acquiror, any Company Group or any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or any of the Ancillary Agreements. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
any privileged communications or information shared by Granite prior to the
Closing shall remain the privileged communications or information of Granite.
