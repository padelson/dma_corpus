                          AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

         This Agreement and Plan of Merger is dated as of June 4, 2000, among
Buffets, Inc., a Minnesota corporation (the "Company"), Big Boy Holdings, Inc.,
a Delaware corporation ("Buyer"), and Big Boy Merger Corporation, a Minnesota
corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Buyer ("Buyer Subsidiary" and,
together with the Company, sometimes referred to as the "Constituent
Corporations").

                                    RECITALS

         Buyer desires to acquire the Company by effecting a merger (the
"Merger") of Buyer Subsidiary with and into the Company under the terms hereof,
whereby the shareholders of the Company will receive cash for their shares of
capital stock of the Company.

         The Board of Directors of each of the Constituent Corporations deems
the Merger desirable and in the best interests of the shareholders of the
Constituent Corporation.

                                    AGREEMENT

         Now, therefore, in consideration of the premises and of the mutual
covenants, representations, warranties, and agreements herein contained, the
parties hereby agree as follows:

                                    ARTICLE I

                                   THE MERGER

         1.01 MERGER. At the Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.02), and in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Minnesota Business
Corporation Act (the "Minnesota Act"), Buyer Subsidiary shall be merged with and
into the Company, the separate corporate existence of Buyer Subsidiary shall
thereupon cease, and the Company shall be the surviving corporation in the
Merger (sometimes referred to as the "Surviving Corporation"). At the Effective
Time, the Merger shall have the other effects provided in the applicable
provisions of the Minnesota Act.

         1.02 EFFECTIVE TIME OF THE MERGER. Subject to, and promptly following
(but not more than one business day (unless the Company and Buyer shall
otherwise mutually agree)), the receipt of the vote of the shareholders of the
Company approving this Agreement and the satisfaction or waiver of all other
conditions to the consummation of the Merger set forth in Article V of this
Agreement, the Company and Buyer Subsidiary shall execute in the manner required
by the Minnesota Act and deliver for filing to the Secretary of State of the
State of Minnesota articles of merger with respect to the Merger ("Articles of
Merger"). The Merger shall become effective upon the filing of the Articles of
Merger with the Minnesota Secretary of State in accordance with Section 302A.615
of the Minnesota Act. The term "Effective Time" means the date and time when the
Merger becomes effective.

<PAGE>

         1.03 ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION AND BY-LAWS OF THE SURVIVING
CORPORATION. The Articles of Incorporation of Buyer Subsidiary in effect
immediately before the Effective Time shall be the Articles of Incorporation of
the Surviving Corporation, until amended in accordance with the laws of the
State of Minnesota and such Articles of Incorporation. The By-Laws of Buyer
Subsidiary in effect immediately before the Effective Time shall be the By-Laws
of the Surviving Corporation, until further amended in accordance with the laws
of the State of Minnesota, the Articles of Incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation, and such By-Laws.

         1.04 BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS OF THE SURVIVING CORPORATION. The
directors of Buyer Subsidiary immediately before the Effective Time shall be the
directors of the Surviving Corporation, each of such directors to hold office,
subject to the applicable provisions of the Articles of Incorporation and
By-Laws of the Surviving Corporation, until the expiration of the term for which
such director was elected and until his or her successor is elected and has
qualified or as otherwise provided in the Articles of Incorporation or By-Laws
of the Surviving Corporation. The officers of the Company immediately before the
Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation until their
respective successors are chosen and have qualified or as otherwise provided in
the By-Laws of the Surviving Corporation.

         1.05 CONVERSION OF SHARES. The manner and basis of converting the
shares of stock of each of the Constituent Corporations shall be as follows:

                  (a) At the Effective Time, each share of Common Stock of the
         Company, par value $.01 per share ("Company Common Stock"), issued and
         outstanding immediately before the Effective Time (other than (i)
         Dissenting Shares (as defined below) and (ii) shares of Company Common
         Stock held of record by Buyer or Buyer Subsidiary or any other direct
         or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Buyer or the Company immediately
         before the Effective Time) shall, by virtue of the Merger and without
         any action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into and
         represent the right to receive $13.85 in cash (the "Merger
         Consideration"), without interest.

                  (b) At the Effective Time, each share of Common Stock of Buyer
         Subsidiary, par value $.01 per share, issued and outstanding
         immediately before the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger
         and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted
         into and exchanged for one fully paid and nonassessable share of Common
         Stock of the Surviving Corporation ("Surviving Corporation Common
         Stock"), which shall constitute the only issued and outstanding shares
         of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation immediately after the
         Effective Time. From and after the Effective Time, each outstanding
         certificate theretofore representing shares of Common Stock of Buyer
         Subsidiary shall be deemed for all purposes to evidence ownership and
         to represent the same number of shares of Surviving Corporation Common
         Stock.

                  (c) At the Effective Time, each share of Company Common Stock
         held of record by Buyer or Buyer Subsidiary or any other direct or
         indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Buyer or the Company immediately
         before the Effective Time shall, by


                                       2
<PAGE>

         virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder
         thereof, be canceled and cease to exist, and no payment shall be made
         with respect thereto.

         1.06     DISSENTERS' RIGHTS.

                  (a) Notwithstanding Section 1.05 hereof, shares of Company
         Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately before the Effective
         Time, if any, that are held of record or beneficially owned by a person
         who has properly exercised and preserved and perfected dissenters'
         rights with respect to such shares under Sections 302A.471 and 302A.473
         of the Minnesota Act and has not withdrawn or lost such rights
         ("Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into or represent the
         right to receive the Merger Consideration for such shares, but instead
         shall be treated in accordance with Sections 302A.471 and 302A.473 of
         the Minnesota Act unless and until such person effectively withdraws or
         loses such person's right to payment under Section 302A.473 of the
         Minnesota Act (through failure to preserve or protect such right or
         otherwise). If, after the Effective Time, any such person shall
         effectively withdraw or lose such right, then each such Dissenting
         Share held of record or beneficially owned by such person will
         thereupon be treated as if it had been converted into, at the Effective
         Time, the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without interest.

                  (b) Each person holding of record or beneficially owning
         Dissenting Shares who becomes entitled, under the provisions of
         Sections 302A.471 and 302A.473 of the Minnesota Act, to payment of the
         fair value of such Dissenting Shares shall receive payment therefor
         (plus interest determined in accordance with Section 302A.473 of the
         Minnesota Act) from the Surviving Corporation.

                  (c) The Company shall give Buyer prompt written notice upon
         receipt by the Company at any time before the Effective Time of any
         notice of intent to demand the fair value of any shares of Company
         Common Stock under Section 302A.473 of the Minnesota Act and any
         withdrawal of any such notice. The Company will not, except with the
         prior written consent of Buyer, negotiate, voluntarily make any payment
         with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demand at any
         time before the Effective Time.

         1.07 STOCK OPTIONS. Immediately before the Effective Time, each holder
of a then-outstanding option (collectively, the "Options" and individually, an
"Option") to purchase shares of Company Common Stock granted under any employee
stock option or compensation plan of, or other arrangement with, the Company
shall be entitled (whether or not such Option is then exercisable) to receive in
cancellation of such Option a cash payment from the Company in an amount equal
to the amount, if any, by which the Merger Consideration exceeds the per-share
exercise price of such Option, multiplied by the number of shares of Company
Common Stock then subject to such Option (the "Option Settlement Amount"),
without interest, but subject to all required tax withholdings by the Company.
The Company shall take all steps necessary including giving such notices and
entering into such instruments consistent with the foregoing to give effect to
this Section 1.07.


                                       3

         1.08     PAYMENT FOR SHARES.

                  (a) Immediately before the Effective Time, Buyer or Buyer
         Subsidiary shall deposit or cause to be deposited in immediately
         available funds with American Stock Transfer Company or any other
         disbursing agent having capital, surplus and undivided profits
         exceeding $500 million that is selected by Buyer and reasonably
         satisfactory to the Company (the "Disbursing Agent"), cash in an amount
         equal to the product (rounded up or down to the nearest $.01) of (i)
         the number of shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding
         immediately before the Effective Time (other than (i) Dissenting Shares
         and (ii) shares then held of record by Buyer or Buyer Subsidiary or any
         other direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Buyer or the
         Company) times (ii) the Merger Consideration (such amount being
         referred to as the "Fund").

                  (b) At or before the Effective Time, Buyer shall deliver
         irrevocable written instructions to the Disbursing Agent in form and
         substance reasonably satisfactory to the Company to make, out of the
         Fund, the payments referred to in Section 1.05(a) in accordance with
         Section 1.08(c). The Fund shall not be used for any other purpose,
         except as provided in this Agreement.

                  Any amount remaining in the Fund including, without
         limitation, all interest and other income received by the Disbursing
         Agent in respect of amounts in the Fund six months after the Closing
         Date (as defined below) may be refunded to the Surviving Corporation,
         at its option; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Surviving Corporation shall
         continue to be liable for any payments required to be made thereafter
         under Section 1.05(a) hereof. If any Merger Consideration shall not
         have been disbursed prior to two years after the Effective Time (or
         immediately prior to such earlier date on which any Merger
         Consideration or Option Settlement Amount payable to the former holder
         of Company Common Stock or Option would otherwise escheat to or become
         the property of any governmental authority), any such Merger
         Consideration or Option Settlement Amount shall, to the extent
         permitted by applicable law, become the property of the Surviving
         Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any person
         previously entitled thereto.

                  (c) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, the
         Disbursing Agent shall mail to each holder of record (other than Buyer
         or Buyer Subsidiary or any other direct or indirect wholly owned
         subsidiary of Buyer or the Company) of a certificate or certificates
         that, immediately before the Effective Time, represented issued and
         outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (other than Dissenting
         Shares) a letter of transmittal for return to the Disbursing Agent, and
         instructions for use in effecting the surrender of such certificate or
         certificates and the receipt of cash for each of such holder's shares
         of Company Common Stock under Section 1.05(a). The Disbursing Agent, as
         soon as practicable following receipt of any such certificate or
         certificates together with a duly executed letter of transmittal and
         any other items specified in the letter of transmittal, shall pay by
         cashier's check of the Disbursing Agent to the persons entitled thereto


                                       4
<PAGE>

         (subject to any required withholding of taxes by the Surviving
         Corporation) the amount (rounded up or down to the nearest $.01)
         determined by multiplying the number of shares of Company Common Stock
         represented by the certificate or certificates so surrendered by the
         Merger Consideration. No interest will be paid or accrued on the cash
         payable upon the surrender of any such certificate or certificates. If
         payment is to be made to a person other than the person in whose name
         the certificate surrendered is registered, it shall be a condition of
         payment that the certificate so surrendered be properly endorsed or
         otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the person requesting
         such payment pay any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the
         payment to a person other than the registered holder of the certificate
         surrendered or establish to the satisfaction of the Surviving
         Corporation that such tax has been paid or is not applicable.

                  (d) If any such certificate or certificates shall have been
         lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact
         and customary indemnification against loss by the person claiming such
         certificate or certificates to have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the
         Disbursing Agent will pay in exchange for such lost, stolen or
         destroyed certificate to the persons entitled thereto (subject to any
         required withholding of taxes by the Surviving Corporation) the
         applicable Merger Consideration in respect thereof calculated pursuant
         to Section 1.08(c) upon receipt by the Disbursing Agent of such
         affidavit and indemnification against loss.

         1.09 NO FURTHER RIGHTS OR TRANSFERS. At the Effective Time, all shares
of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately before the Effective
Time shall be canceled and cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate or
certificates that represented shares of Company Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately before the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights
as a shareholder of the Company with respect to the shares of Company Common
Stock represented by such certificate or certificates, except for the right to
surrender such certificate or certificates in exchange for the payment provided
under Section 1.05(a) or to preserve and perfect such holder's right to receive
payment for such holder's shares under Section 302A.473 of the Minnesota Act and
Section 1.06 hereof if such holder has validly exercised and not withdrawn or
lost such right, and no transfer of shares of Company Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately before the Effective Time shall be made on the stock
transfer books of the Surviving Corporation.

         1.10 TENDER OFFER. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, Buyer shall have the right to commence a cash tender offer to
purchase all the outstanding shares of Common Stock (with at least a majority of
the fully-diluted shares of Common Stock as a minimum condition, which cannot be
waived without the written consent of the Company) at a price equal to or in
excess of what would have been the Merger Consideration. The only conditions to
acceptance of the shares shall be such conditions as are set forth in Section
5.01 and the minimum condition, unless the Company in its sole discretion shall
agree to other conditions. Notwithstanding Buyer's exercise of its right to
commence such an offer, this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.
Any shares of Common Stock not purchased in such offer shall, as promptly as
possible, be acquired on the terms set forth in this Agreement, provided that if
Buyer acquires, directly or indirectly, at least 90% of the outstanding shares
pursuant to the offer,


                                       5
<PAGE>

Buyer will take all necessary and appropriate action to cause the Merger to
become effective in accordance with Section 302A.621 of the Minnesota Act
without a meeting of the shareholders as soon as practicable after the purchase
of the shares pursuant to such offer.

                                   ARTICLE II

                                     CLOSING

"Closing") of the Merger shall occur not later than the business day next
following the special meeting of shareholders of the Company to be called under

(the "Closing Date"). The Closing shall be held at the offices of Paul, Weiss,
Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison in New York, New York, or at such other place as the
Company and Buyer may mutually agree.

         2.02 DELIVERIES AT THE CLOSING.  Subject to Articles V and VII, at the
Closing:

         the Company the certificates and other documents and instruments the
         delivery of which is contemplated under Article V;

                  (b) the Company and Buyer Subsidiary shall cause the Articles
         of Merger to be filed as provided in Section 1.02 and shall take all
         other lawful actions and do all other lawful things necessary to cause
         the Merger to become effective; and

                  (c) subject to the right of the Surviving Corporation to
         receive a refund of amounts remaining in the Fund six months after the
         Closing Date under Section 1.08(b), Buyer or Buyer Subsidiary shall
         irrevocably deposit with the Disbursing Agent the amount designated as
         the Fund in Section 1.08(a).

                                   ARTICLE III

         "Subsidiaries" and individually, a "Subsidiary") is a corporation duly
         incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of
         the jurisdiction of its incorporation (as identified in the Disclosure
         Letter) and has the requisite corporate power and corporate authority
         to own, lease and operate its properties and assets and to carry on its
         business as it is now being conducted. The Company has no subsidiaries

         other than the Subsidiaries. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries
         is duly qualified or licensed as a foreign corporation to do business,
         and is in good standing, in each jurisdiction where the character of
         the properties owned, operated or leased by it, or the nature of its
         business, makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except such
         jurisdictions where failure to be so qualified, licensed or in good
         standing would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a material
         adverse effect upon the business, operations, properties or financial
         condition of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (a
         "Material Adverse Effect"). The copies of the Articles or Certificate
         of Incorporation and By-Laws or similar organizational documents of the
         Company and each Subsidiary provided to Buyer are complete and correct
         as of the date of this Agreement.

                  (b) CAPITALIZATION. The authorized capital stock of the
         Company consists of 60 million shares of Company Common Stock, of
         which, as of the date of this Agreement, 41,577,129 shares are issued
         and outstanding, and five million shares of Preferred Stock, par value
         $.01 per share, of which 600,000 shares have been designated as Series
         A Junior Participating Preferred Stock ("Series A Preferred Stock"),
         none of which, as of the date of this Agreement, is issued and
         outstanding. All of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock
         of the Company and of each Subsidiary have been duly authorized and
         validly issued, are fully paid and nonassessable and were not granted
         in violation of any preemptive rights. There are no outstanding
         subscriptions, options, warrants, calls or other agreements or
         commitments under which the Company or any Subsidiary is or may become
         obligated to issue, sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of, or
         purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire, any shares of capital stock of,
         or other equity interests in, the Company or any Subsidiary, and there
         are no outstanding securities convertible into or exchangeable for any
         such capital stock or other equity interests, except for (i) Options to
         purchase up to 5,440,897 shares of Company Common Stock (as of the date
         of this Agreement) at the exercise prices set forth in Section 3.01(b)
         of the Disclosure Letter, (ii) the Rights Agreement dated as of October
         24, 1995 between the Company and American Stock Transfer and Trust
         Company (the "Rights Agreement") under which each outstanding share of
         Company Common Stock has attached to it certain rights (the "Rights"),
         including rights under certain circumstances to purchase a fraction of
         a share of Series A Preferred Stock at $65 per right, subject to
         adjustment, and (iii) the Company's 7% Convertible Subordinated Notes
         due 2002 (the "Convertible Notes") in aggregate principal amount of
         $41,465,000 as of the date of this Agreement. At the Effective Time,
         the Options referred to in clause (i) will be cancelled in accordance
         with Section 1.07, the Rights Agreement will not be applicable to the
         Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
         the holders of the Rights will have no rights under the Rights or the
         Rights Agreement and the Convertible Notes will be convertible solely
         into the right to receive approximately $1,187.143 in cash for each
         $1,000 principal amount converted thereunder. The Company owns,
         directly or indirectly, all of the issued and outstanding shares of
         capital stock of every class of each Subsidiary, free and clear of all
         liens, security interests, pledges, charges and other encumbrances.
         Section 3.01(b) of the Disclosure Letter contains a complete and
         correct list of each corporation, limited liability company,
         partnership, joint venture, other


                                       7

         business association or person in which the Company has any direct or
         indirect equity ownership interest.

                  (c) AUTHORIZATION AND EXECUTION. The Company has the corporate
         power and corporate authority to execute and deliver this Agreement
         and, subject to approval by the holders of the Company Common Stock at
         the special meeting of shareholders referred to in Section 4.02, to
         consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The execution,
         delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Company have been
         duly authorized by the Board of Directors of the Company, and no
         further corporate action of the Company, other than the approval of its
         shareholders, is necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated
         hereby. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the
         Company and, assuming the accuracy of the representations and
         warranties set forth in Section 3.02(b), constitutes the legal, valid
         and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company
         in accordance with its terms, except to the extent that enforceability
         may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or similar laws
         affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally, and subject,
         as to enforceability, to general principles of equity (regardless of
         whether enforcement is sought in a court of law or equity).

                  (d) NO CONFLICTS. Neither the execution and delivery of this
         Agreement by the Company nor the consummation by the Company of the
         transactions contemplated hereby, will (i) conflict with or result in a
         breach of the Articles or Certificate of Incorporation, By-Laws or
         similar organizational documents, as currently in effect, of the
         Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) except for the requirements
         under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as
         amended (the "HSR Act"), compliance with the Securities Exchange Act of
         1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), and the filing of the Articles
         of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Minnesota,
         require any filing with, or consent or approval of, any governmental
         authority having jurisdiction over any of the business or assets of the
         Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (iii) violate any statute, law,
         ordinance, rule or regulation applicable to the Company or any of its
         Subsidiaries or any injunction, judgment, order, writ or decree to
         which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has been specifically
         identified as subject, or (iv) result in a breach of, or constitute a
         default or an event that, with the passage of time or the giving of
         notice, or both, would constitute a default, give rise to a right of
         termination, cancellation or acceleration, create any entitlement of
         any third party to any material payment or benefit, require the consent
         of any third party, or result in the creation of any lien on the assets
         of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under, any Material Contract
         (as defined below), except, in the case of clauses (ii), (iii), and
         (iv), where such violation, breach, default, termination, cancellation,
         acceleration, payment, benefit or lien, or the failure to make such
         filing or obtain such consent or approval, would not, individually or
         in the aggregate, materially impair the ability of the Company to
         consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or have a
         Material Adverse Effect.

                  (e)      SEC REPORTS; FINANCIAL STATEMENTS; NO UNDISCLOSED
                           LIABILITIES.

                           (i) The Company has made available to Buyer, in the
                  form filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the
                  "SEC"), all reports, registration statements, and other
                  filings (including amendments to previously filed documents)
                  filed by the Company with the SEC since January 1, 1997 (all
                  such reports, proxy statements, registration statements and
                  filings, other than the Proxy Statement (as defined below),
                  are collectively called the "SEC Reports" and individually
                  called an "SEC Report"). No SEC Report, as of its filing date,
                  contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted
                  to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
                  necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in the
                  light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
                  misleading, and each SEC Report at the time of its filing
                  complied as to form in all material respects with all
                  applicable requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as
                  amended (the "Securities Act"), the Exchange Act, and the
                  rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder. Since
                  January 1, 1997, the Company has filed all reports that it was
                  required to file with the SEC under the Exchange Act and the
                  rules and regulations of the SEC.

                           (ii) The consolidated financial statements contained
                  in the SEC Reports were prepared in accordance with generally
                  accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent basis
                  throughout the periods involved (except as may be indicated in
                  the notes thereto) and fairly present, in all material
                  respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company
                  and its Subsidiaries as at the respective dates thereof and
                  the consolidated results of operations and consolidated cash
                  flows of the Company and its Subsidiaries for the periods
                  indicated, subject, in the case of interim financial
                  statements, to normal year-end adjustments, and except that
                  the interim financial statements do not contain all of the
                  footnote disclosures required by generally accepted accounting
                  principles.

                           (iii) Except as and to the extent reflected or
                  reserved against on the most recent balance sheet contained in
                  the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year
                  ended December 29, 1999 (the "Balance Sheet"), neither the
                  Company nor any of its Subsidiaries had, as of the date of
                  such Balance Sheet, any material obligations or liabilities of
                  any nature that as of such date would have been required to be
                  included on a balance sheet prepared in accordance with
                  generally accepted accounting principles as in effect on such
                  date (without regard to any events, incidents, assertions or
                  state of knowledge occurring after such date).

                  (f) PROXY STATEMENT. The Proxy Statement will not, at the time
         the Proxy Statement is mailed, contain any untrue statement of a
         material fact, or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
         therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light
         of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and
         will not, at the time of the meeting of shareholders to which the Proxy
         Statement relates


                                       9
<PAGE>

         or at the Effective Time, as then amended or supplemented, omit to
         state any material fact necessary to correct any statement which has
         become false or misleading in any earlier communication with respect to
         the solicitation of any proxy for such meeting (except that no
         representation is made by the Company with respect to statements made
         in, or incorporated by reference into, the Proxy Statement based on
         information furnished by Buyer or Buyer Subsidiary in writing
         specifically for inclusion in the Proxy Statement).

                  (g) ABSENCE OF CERTAIN CHANGES OR EVENTS. Since the date of
         the Balance Sheet and to and including the date of this Agreement, the
         Company and its Subsidiaries have conducted their respective businesses
         and operations in the ordinary course consistent with past practices
         and neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has (i) split,
         combined or reclassified any shares of its capital stock or made any
         other changes in its equity capital structure; (ii) purchased, redeemed
         or otherwise acquired, directly or indirectly, any shares of its

         any such capital stock; (iii) declared, set aside or paid any dividend

         stock, except for dividends or distributions by any Subsidiary to the
         Company or another Subsidiary; (iv) issued any shares of its capital
         stock or granted any options, rights or warrants to purchase any such
         capital stock or any securities convertible into or exchangeable for

         Common Stock upon the exercise of Options and grants of Options for
         308,000 shares of Company Common Stock; (v) purchased any business,
         purchased any stock of any corporation, or merged or consolidated with
         any person; (vi) sold, leased or otherwise disposed of any assets or

         business; (vii) incurred, assumed or guaranteed any indebtedness for
         money borrowed other than intercompany indebtedness; (viii) changed or

                  (h)      TAX MATTERS.

                  to be paid, including, without limitation, those shown on such
                  Tax Returns to the extent such Taxes have become due.

                           (ii) No Tax Returns filed by the Company or any of

                  the Buyer true and complete copies of all requested federal,
                  state, local and foreign income tax returns with respect to
                  the Company and each of its Subsidiaries.

                           (ix) There is no contract, agreement, plan or
                  arrangement covering any employee or former employee of the
                  Company or any of its Subsidiaries that, individually or
                  collectively, could give rise to the payment of any amount
                  that would not be deductible under Section 280G of the Code.

         for taxes, assessments and other governmental charges that are not due
         and payable or that are being contested in good faith and in respect of
         which adequate reserves have been established, (ii) mechanics',
         materialmen's, carriers', workmen's, warehousemen's, repairmen's,
         landlord's or other similar liens securing obligations that are not due
         and payable or that are being contested in good faith and in respect of
         adequate reserves have been established, (iii) mortgages, liens,
         security interests, charges and encumbrances evidenced by any lease,
         contract or agreement that is described in the Disclosure Letter or in
         the SEC Reports filed before the date of this Agreement or the
         non-disclosure of which therein does not constitute a misrepresentation
         under Section 3.01(j), (iv) imperfections of title and liens, charges
         and encumbrances that do not materially detract from the value or
         materially interfere with the present use of the properties subject
         thereto or affected thereby, (v) in the case of any Owned Real Property
         subject to a title commitment described in the Disclosure Letter,
         imperfections of title and mortgages, liens, security interests,
         charges and encumbrances that are shown on such title commitment or are
         otherwise of record, and (vi) other mortgages, liens, security
         interests, charges and encumbrances described in the Disclosure Letter
         or in the SEC Reports filed before the date of this Agreement (clauses
         (i) through (iv) and clause (vi) being collectively the "Permitted
         Encumbrances"). The Company and its Subsidiaries have good and
         marketable title to, or the right to use, all of their other tangible
         properties


                                       12

         and assets necessary to conduct their respective businesses as
         currently conducted, except for Permitted Encumbrances and other Liens
         of an immaterial nature. All of the Real Property (as hereinafter
         defined) and other tangible properties and assets are in good condition
         and repair, normal wear and tear excepted, and adequate in all material
         respects for the continued conduct of the business of the Company and
         its Subsidiaries in the manner in which it is currently conducted. The
         Company is not a guarantor of the tenant's obligations under the leases
         for the seven store sites indicated with an asterisk in Section
         3.01(i)(i) of the Disclosure Letter.

                           (ii) LEASED REAL PROPERTY. Section 3.01(i)(ii) of the
         Disclosure Letter sets forth a list of all leases, subleases and other
         agreements (collectively, the "Real Property Leases") under which the
         Company or any Subsidiary uses or occupies or has the right to use or
         occupy, now or in the future, any real property that is not Owned Real
         Property (the land, buildings and other improvements covered by the
         Real Property Leases being herein called the "Leased Real Property").
         The Company has provided the Buyer with a true and correct copy of each
         Real Property Lease and any amendments thereto. Each Real Property
         Lease is valid, binding and in full force and effect, unless the
         failure of any Real Property Lease to be in full force and effect has
         not had and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or
         in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Company nor
         any of its Subsidiaries nor, to the knowledge of the Company, any
         landlord under any Real Property Leases is in breach of or in default
         under any of the Real Property Leases, except for breaches or defaults
         which have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have,
         individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. Except for
         Permitted Encumbrances, the Company's and its Subsidiaries' interest in
         the Leased Real Property is free and clear of Liens. A Subsidiary of
         the Company, but not the Company, is the tenant under all of the Real
         Property Leases.

                           (iii) ENTIRE PREMISES. All of the land, buildings,
         structures and other improvements used by the Company or any of the
         Subsidiaries in the conduct of their businesses are included in the
         Owned Real Property or the Leased Real Property. The Leased Real
         Property and the Owned Real Property are hereinafter collectively
         referred to as the "Real Property."

                           (iv) SPACE LEASES. Section 3.01(i)(iv) of the
         Disclosure Letter contains a true, correct and complete schedule of all
         leases, subleases and other agreements (collectively, the "Space
         Leases") granting to any person or entity other than the Company or any
         of the Subsidiaries any right to the possession, use, occupancy or
         enjoyment of the Real Property or any portion thereof. The Company has
         provided the Buyer with a true and correct copy of each Space Lease. To
         the Company's knowledge, no notice of default or termination under any
         Space Lease is outstanding and no termination event or condition or
         uncured default on the part of the Company, any of the Subsidiaries or
         the Space Tenant exists under any Space Lease, except for those
         defaults or terminations which have not had and would not reasonably be
         expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse
         Effect.

                           (v) CONDEMNATION. The Company and the Subsidiaries
         have not received notice of, and to the knowledge of the Company, there
         is not any pending, threatened or contemplated condemnation proceeding
         affecting the Real Property or any part thereof, or any sale or other
         disposition of the Real Property or any part thereof in lieu of
         condemnation.

                  (J) MATERIAL CONTRACTS. Except as set forth in Section 3.01(j)
         of the Disclosure Letter or in the SEC Reports filed before the date of
         this Agreement, and except for contracts entered into after the date
         hereof in compliance with Section 4.01, neither the Company nor any of
         its Subsidiaries is a party to or bound by any:

                           (i) employment agreement (other than those that are
                  terminable by the Company or any Subsidiary without cost or
                  penalty upon 60 days' or less notice);

                           (ii) operating or capital lease, whether as lessor or
                  lessee, with respect to any real property;

                           (iii) contract, whether as licensor or licensee, for
                  the license of any patent, know-how, trademark, trade name,
                  service mark, copyright or other intangible asset (other than
                  non-negotiated licenses of commercial off-the-shelf computer
                  software);

                           (iv) loan or guaranty agreement, indenture or other
                  instrument, contract or agreement under which any money has
                  been borrowed or loaned or any note, bond or other evidence of
                  indebtedness has been issued;

                           (v) mortgage, security agreement, conditional sales
                  contract, capital lease or similar agreement which effectively
                  creates a lien on any assets of the Company or any of its
                  Subsidiaries;

                           (vi) contract restricting the Company or any of its
                  Subsidiaries in any material respect from engaging in business
                  or from competing with any other parties;

                           (vii) plan of reorganization;

                           (viii) partnership or joint venture agreement;

                           (ix) collective bargaining agreement;

                           (x) that is a "material contract" (as defined in Item
                  601(b)(10) of Regulation S-K of the SEC);

                           (xi) franchise, restaurant services management,
                  royalty or similar agreement;


                                       14
<PAGE>

                           (xii) agreements relating to the acquisition of any
                  business (but excluding any acquisition of restaurant
                  locations consistent with past practices);

                           (xiii) investment banking agreement; or

                           (xiv) except for negotiable instruments in the
                  process of collection, any power of attorney outstanding or
                  any contract, commitment or liability (whether absolute,
                  accrued, contingent or otherwise) as guarantor, surety,
                  cosigner, endorser, co-maker, indemnitor in respect of the
                  contract or commitment of any other person, corporation,
                  partnership, joint venture, association, organization or other
                  entity (other than the Subsidiaries).

                           All of the foregoing are collectively called
         "Material Contracts." To the extent Material Contracts are evidenced by
         documents, true and complete copies thereof have been delivered or made
         available to Buyer. Each Material Contract is in full force and effect,
         unless the failure of any Material Contracts to be in full force and
         effect has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have,
         individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. Neither
         the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries nor, to the knowledge of the
         Company, any other party is in breach of or in default under any of the
         Material Contracts, except for breaches or defaults which have not had
         and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
         aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

                  (k) INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. Section 3.01(k) of the Disclosure
         Letter contains a complete and correct list of all United States and
         foreign material patents and registered trademarks, trade names,
         service marks, Internet Domain names and copyrights, and all
         applications for any of the foregoing (collectively, "Proprietary
         Rights"), and all material licenses held by the Company and its
         Subsidiaries. Except as set forth in Section 3.01(k) of the Disclosure
         Letter, the Proprietary Rights constitute all the intellectual property
         rights that are required or reasonably necessary for the conduct of the
         business of the Company or its Subsidiaries as currently conducted.
         Except as set forth in Section 3.01(k) of the Disclosure Letter, the
         Company owns or otherwise possesses legally enforceable rights to use,
         sell and license, free and clear of any and all liens or material
         restrictions, any and all material intellectual property used in the
         conduct of the business of the Company and the Subsidiaries as
         currently conducted or proposed to be conducted, and the consummation
         of the transactions contemplated hereby will not materially adversely
         alter or impair any such right . None of the Proprietary Rights have
         been declared unenforceable or otherwise invalid by any court or
         governmental agency. There is, to the knowledge of the Company, no
         material existing infringement, misuse or misappropriation of any
         Proprietary Rights by others. Since January 1, 1997, neither the
         Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any written notice
         alleging that the operation of the business of the Company or any of
         its Subsidiaries infringes, misuses or misappropriates in any material
         respect the intellectual property rights of others.

                  (l) LITIGATION. Except as described in Section 3.01(l) of the
         Disclosure Letter or in the SEC Reports filed at least five (5)
         business days before the date of this Agreement, no litigation,
         arbitration or administrative proceeding is pending or, to the
         knowledge of the Company, threatened against the Company or any
         Subsidiary that, would have, individually or in the aggregate, a
         Material Adverse Effect, or that seeks to enjoin or otherwise
         challenges the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
         Agreement. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is
         specifically identified as a party subject to any material restrictions
         or limitations under any injunction, writ, judgment, order or decree of
         any court, administrative agency or commission or other governmental
         authority.

                  (m) COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS. The Company and each of the
         Subsidiaries is and at all times since January 1, 1997 has been in
         compliance with and, to the knowledge of the Company, is not under
         investigation with respect to and has not been threatened in writing to
         be charged with or given written notice of any violation of, any
         statute, law, rule, regulation, judgment, decree, order, permit,
         license or other governmental authorization or approval applicable to
         the Company or any of the Subsidiaries or by which any property, asset
         or operation of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries is bound or
         effected, except for failures to comply or violations (A) that have not
         had, or cannot reasonably be expected to have individually or in the
         aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect or (B) that have not resulted in,
         or could not reasonably be expected to result in, the imposition of a
         criminal fine, penalty or sanction against the Company, any of the
         Subsidiaries or any of their respective officers or directors.

                  (n) NO BROKERS OR FINDERS. Except for U.S. Bancorp Piper
         Jaffray Inc., the Company has not engaged any investment banker, broker
         or finder in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby. The
         Surviving Corporation shall be liable for all obligations of the
         Company under its engagement letter with U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray
         Inc., a copy of which has previously been provided to Buyer.

                  (o) RETIREMENT AND BENEFIT PLANS.

                  (i) Each employee pension benefit plan ("Pension Plan"), as
         defined in Section 3(2) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act
         of 1974, as amended ("ERISA"), each employee welfare benefit plan
         ("Welfare Plan"), as defined in Section 3 of ERISA, and each deferred
         compensation, bonus, incentive, stock incentive, option, stock
         purchase, severance or other material employee benefit plan, agreement,
         commitment or arrangement ("Benefit Plan"), which is currently
         maintained by the Company or any Subsidiary or to which the Company or
         any Subsidiary currently contributes or is under any current obligation
         to contribute, or under which the Company or any Subsidiary has any
         current liability (collectively, the "Employee Plans" and individually,
         an "Employee Plan") is listed in Section 3.01(o) of the Disclosure
         Letter and, true and complete copies of all written plans have been
         delivered or made available to Buyer. In addition, summaries of all
         oral agreements, copies of the annual report (Form 5500 Series)
         required to be filed with any governmental agency with respect to


                                       16
<PAGE>

         each Pension Plan and Welfare Plan for the most recent plan year of
         such plan for which reports have been filed, the most recent IRS
         determination letters, if relevant, and summary plan descriptions have
         been delivered or made available to Buyer.

                  (ii) The Company and each Subsidiary has made on a timely
         basis all contributions or payments required to be made by it under the
         terms of the Employee Plans, ERISA, the Code or other applicable laws,
         unless such contributions or payments that have not been made are
         immaterial in amount and the failure to make such payments or
         contributions will not materially and adversely affect the Employee
         Plans.

                  (iii) Each Employee Plan (and any related trust or other
         funding instrument) has been administered in all material respects in
         compliance with its terms and in both form and operation is in
         compliance in all material respects with the applicable provisions of
         ERISA, the Code and other applicable laws and regulations (other than
         adoption of any plan amendments for which the deadline has not yet
         expired), and all material reports required to be filed with any
         governmental agency with respect to each Employee Plan have been timely
         filed.

                  (iv) Each Employee Plan that is intended to be qualified
         within the meaning of Code section 401(a) is so qualified and has
         received a favorable determination letter from the IRS as to its
         qualification, and nothing has occurred, whether by action or failure
         to act, that could reasonably be expected to cause the loss of such
         qualification.

                  (v) Except as set forth in Section 3.01(o)(v) of the
         Disclosure Letter, no Employee Plan exists that could result in the
         payment to any present or former employee of the Company or any
         Subsidiary of any money or other property or accelerate or provide any
         other rights or benefits to any present or former employee of the
         Company or its Subsidiaries as a result of the transaction contemplated
         by this Agreement, whether or not such payment would constitute a
         parachute payment within the meaning of Code section 280G.

                  (vi) Except as set forth in Section 3.01(o)(vi) of the
         Disclosure Letter, none of the Company or the Subsidiaries has or will
         have any obligation or liability under a Welfare Plan which provides
         medical or dental benefits with respect to current or former employees
         of the Company beyond their termination of employment other than
         required by COBRA or other applicable laws, and all Welfare Plans are
         in compliance with the requirements of COBRA, to the extent applicable.

                  (vii) There has been no "mass layoff" or "plant closing" as
         each such term is defined by the Workers Adjustment and Retraining
         Notification Act ("WARN"), with respect to the employees of the Company
         or any of its Subsidiaries, with respect to which there could be any
         future liability to such employees under WARN.

                  (viii) There is no material litigation, arbitration or
         administrative proceeding pending or, to the knowledge of the Company,
         threatened against the Company or any


                                       17

         Subsidiary or, to the knowledge of the Company, any plan fiduciary by
         the Internal Revenue Service, the U.S. Department of Labor, the Pension
         Benefit Guaranty Corporation, any participant or beneficiary, or any
         other governmental agency, with respect to any Employee Plan. None of
         the Company, any Subsidiary, any ERISA affiliate, or to the knowledge
         of the Company, any plan fiduciary of any Pension or Welfare Plan has
         engaged in any transaction in violation of Section 406(a) or (b) of
         ERISA for which no exemption exists under Section 408 of ERISA or any
         "prohibited transaction" (as defined in Section 4975(c)(1) of the Code)
         for which no exemption exists under Section 4975(c)(2) or 4975(d) of
         the Code, or is subject to any excise tax imposed by the Code or ERISA
         with respect to any Employee Plan.

                  (v) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary nor any ERISA
         Affiliate (as defined below) currently maintains, nor at any time in
         the previous six calendar years maintained or had an obligation to
         contribute to, any defined benefit pension plan subject to Title IV of
         ERISA, or any "multiemployer plan" as defined in Section 3(37) of
         ERISA.

                  (vi) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has any liability
         with respect to any plan, program or arrangement maintained or
         contributed to by any ERISA Affiliate that would be an Employee Plan if
         it were maintained by the Company.

                  (vii) For purposes of this Section 3.01(o), "ERISA Affiliate"
         means (A) any trade or business with which the Company is under common
         control within the meaning of Section 4001(b) of ERISA, (B) any
         corporation with which the Company is a member of a controlled group of
         corporations within the meaning of Section 414(b) of the Code, (C) any

         meaning of Section 414(c) of the Code, (D) any entity with which the
         Company is a member of an affiliated service group within the meaning
         of Section 414(m) of the Code, and (E) any entity with which the
         Company is aggregated under Section 414(o) of the Code.

                  (p)      ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS.

                  (i)      For purposes of this Section 3.01(p),

                           (a) "Environmental Law" means the Comprehensive
                  Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, 42
                  U.S.C. Section 9601 et seq., the Resource Conservation and
                  Recovery Act, 42 U.S.C. Section 6901 et seq., the Federal
                  Water Pollution Control Act, 33 U.S.C. Section 1201 et seq.,

                  or any other chemical, substance or material listed or
                  identified in or regulated by any Environmental Law.

                  (ii) Except as described in Section 3.01(p) of the Disclosure
         Letter or in the SEC Reports filed before the date of this Agreement:

                           (a) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries are in
                  full compliance in all material respects with all applicable
                  Environmental Laws, including all limitations, restrictions,
                  conditions, standards, prohibitions, requirements,
                  obligations, schedules and timetables contained in all
                  applicable Environmental Laws.

                           (b) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries have
                  obtained, are in material compliance with, and have made all
                  appropriate filings for issuance or renewal of, all material
                  permits, licenses, authorizations, registrations and other
                  governmental consents required by applicable Environmental
                  Laws ("ENVIRONMENTAL PERMITS"), including, without limitation,
                  those regulating emissions, discharges or releases of
                  Hazardous Substances, or the use, storage, treatment,
                  transportation, release, emission and disposal of raw
                  materials, by-products, wastes and other substances used or
                  produced by or otherwise relating to the business of the
                  Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

                           (c) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has
                  released any Hazardous Substances onto any real property owned
                  or leased by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in such a
                  manner so as to create any material liability for the Company
                  or any of its Subsidiaries.

                           (d) There are no claims, notices, civil, criminal or
                  administrative actions, suits, hearing investigations,
                  inquiries or proceedings pending or, to the Knowledge of the
                  Company, threatened against the Company or any of its
                  Subsidiaries that are based on or related to the failure to
                  have any required Environmental Permits.

                           (e) To the knowledge of the Company, there are no
                  past or present conditions, events, circumstances, facts,
                  activities, practices, incidents, actions, omissions or plans
                  (i) that is reasonably likely to give rise to any material
                  liability or other material obligation for the Company under
                  any Environmental Laws or (ii) that is reasonably likely to
                  form the basis of any claim, action, suit, proceeding,
                  hearing, investigation or inquiry against or involving the
                  Company or any of its Subsidiaries resulting in material
                  liability for the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

                           (f) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
                  has received written notice from any governmental agency that
                  any of them have any material


                                       19
<PAGE>

                  liability with respect to the release of any Hazardous
                  Substances from any underground or aboveground storage tanks.

                           (g) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
                  has received any written notice that any of them is or may be
                  a potentially responsible person under the Comprehensive
                  Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act, 42
                  U.S.C. Section. 9601 ET SEQ., or any similar state or local
                  statute, in connection with any waste disposal site allegedly
                  containing any Hazardous Substances, or other location used
                  for the disposal of any Hazardous Substances.

                           (h) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
                  has received any written notice that it has any material
                  liability pursuant to any failure of the Company or any of its
                  Subsidiaries to comply in any material respect with any
                  Environmental Law or the requirements of any Environmental
                  Permit.

                           (i) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
                  has been in material violation of any Environmental Laws, nor
                  has it been requested or required by any governmental entity
                  to perform any investigatory or remedial activity or other
                  action in connection with any actual or alleged release of
                  Hazardous Substances or any other environmental matter.

                  (q) INSURANCE. The Disclosure Letter contains a list of all
         insurance policies maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries as of
         the date of this Agreement, together with a brief description of the
         coverages afforded thereby. All of such insurance policies are in full
         force and effect as of the date of this Agreement.

                  (r) NO UNDISCLOSED LIABILITIES. Except as set forth in Section
         3.01(r) of the Disclosure Letter or in the SEC Reports filed prior to
         the date hereof, neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has any
         liabilities (absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise) which
         individually, or in the aggregate, are reasonably likely to have a
         Material Adverse Effect.

                  (s) LABOR MATTERS. Except as set forth in Section 3.01(s) of
         the Disclosure Letter, (i) the Company has no knowledge of any strikes,
         slowdowns, work stoppages, lockouts, or threats thereof, by or with
         respect to any employees or former employees of the Company or of any
         Subsidiary, and (ii) neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is a party
         to any collective bargaining agreements and there are no labor unions
         or other organizations representing, purporting to represent, or
         attempting to represent, any employee of the Company.

                  (t) OPINION OF FINANCIAL ADVISOR. The Board of Directors of
         the Company has received the opinion of U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray
         Inc., a copy of which has been provided to Buyer, to the effect that,
         as of the date of this Agreement, the consideration to be received in
         the Merger by the holders of shares of Company Common Stock (other than
         Buyer or its affiliates) is fair to such holders from a financial point
         of view.


                                       20
<PAGE>

                  (u) VOTE REQUIRED. The only vote of the holders of any class
         or series of Company capital stock necessary to approve the Merger is
         the affirmative vote of the holders of not less than a majority of the
         votes entitled to be cast by the holders of all of the outstanding
         shares of Company Common Stock.

                  (v) STATE TAKEOVER STATUTES. The Company has taken all actions
         necessary under the Minnesota Act to approve the transactions
         contemplated by this Agreement. The Agreement and the Merger have been
         approved by a committee of the Board of Directors of the Company formed
         pursuant to Section 302A.673(d) of the Minnesota Act. Assuming for
         purposes of this Section 3.01(v) that no person or entity associated or
         affiliated with Buyer is an "interested shareholder" (as such term is
         defined in the Minnesota Act) of the Company who has not continuously
         been an interested shareholder of the Company during the four-year
         period preceding the Merger, Section 302A.673 of the Minnesota Act
         applicable to a "business combination" does not, and will not, prohibit
         the transactions contemplated hereunder, and the restrictions contained
         in Section 302A.671 of the Minnesota Act applicable to "control share
         acquisitions" will not prohibit the authorization, execution, delivery
         and performance of this Agreement or the consummation of the Merger by
         the Company. The authorization, execution and delivery of this
         Agreement do not, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
         hereunder do not, and any formation of a "group" for purposes of
         Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act in connection with this Agreement
         will not, result in a "control share acquisition" as defined in Section
         302A.011 of the Minnesota Act. No other "fair price," "moratorium" or
         other similar anti-takeover statute or regulation prohibits (by reason
         of Company's participation therein) the Merger or the other
         transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

                  (w) AFFILIATE TRANSACTIONS. Except to the extent disclosed in
         any SEC Report, there are no other transactions, agreements,
         arrangements or understandings between the Company or any Subsidiary,
         on the one hand, and the Company's affiliates (other than wholly-owned
         Subsidiaries of the Company) or other persons, on the other hand, that
         would be required to be disclosed under Item 404 of Regulation S-K
         under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. For purposes of this
         Agreement, the term "affiliate," when used with respect to any person,
         means any other person directly or indirectly controlling, controlled
         by, or under common control with such person. As used in the definition
         of "affiliate," the term "control" means possession, directly or
         indirectly, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the
         management or policies of a person, whether through the ownership of
         voting securities, by contract or otherwise.

         3.02 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF BUYER AND BUYER SUBSIDIARY.
Buyer and Buyer Subsidiary jointly and severally represent and warrant to the
Company as follows:

                  (a) ORGANIZATION, STANDING, EQUITY OWNERSHIP. Each of Buyer
         and Buyer Subsidiary is a corporation duly incorporated, validly
         existing and in good standing under the laws of its state of
         incorporation. Buyer owns all of the issued and outstanding capital


                                       21
<PAGE>

         stock of Buyer Subsidiary. The copies of the Articles or Certificate of
         Incorporation and By-Laws of Buyer and Buyer Subsidiary provided to the
         Company are complete and correct as of the date of this Agreement.
         Buyer Subsidiary was formed solely for the purpose of effecting the
         Merger and has not engaged in any business activities or conducted any
         operations other than in connection with the Merger and the financing
         thereof.

                  (b) AUTHORIZATION AND EXECUTION. Each of Buyer and Buyer
         Subsidiary has the corporate power and corporate authority to execute
         and deliver this Agreement and consummate the transactions contemplated
         hereby. The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by
         each of Buyer and Buyer Subsidiary have been duly authorized by the
         respective Boards of Directors of Buyer and Buyer Subsidiary and by
         Buyer as the sole shareholder of Buyer Subsidiary, and no further
         corporate action of Buyer or Buyer Subsidiary is necessary to
         consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. This Agreement has
         been duly executed and delivered by each of Buyer and Buyer Subsidiary
         and, assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties set
         forth in Section 3.01(c), constitutes the legal, valid and binding
         obligation of each of Buyer and Buyer Subsidiary, enforceable against
         Buyer and Buyer Subsidiary in accordance with its terms, except to the
         extent that enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy,
         insolvency or similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors'
         rights generally, and subject, as to enforceability, to general
         principles of equity (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a
         court of law or equity).

                  (c) NO CONFLICTS. Neither the execution and delivery of this
         Agreement by Buyer and Buyer Subsidiary, nor the consummation by Buyer
         and Buyer Subsidiary of the transactions contemplated hereby, will (i)
         conflict with or result in a breach of the Articles or Certificate of
         Incorporation or By-Laws, as currently in effect, of Buyer or Buyer
         Subsidiary, (ii) except for the requirements under the HSR Act,
         compliance with the Exchange Act, and the filing of the Articles of
         Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Minnesota, require
         any filing with, or consent or approval of, any governmental authority
         having jurisdiction over any of the business or assets of Buyer or
         Buyer Subsidiary, (iii) violate any statute, law, ordinance, rule or
         regulation applicable to Buyer or Buyer Subsidiary or any injunction,
         judgment, order, writ or decree to which Buyer or Buyer Subsidiary has
         been specifically identified as subject, or (iv) result in a breach of,
         or constitute a default or an event which, with the passage of time or
         the giving of notice, or both, would constitute a default under, or
         require the consent of any third party under, any instrument, contract
         or agreement to which Buyer or Buyer Subsidiary is a party or by which
         Buyer or Buyer Subsidiary is bound, except, in the case of clauses
         (ii), (iii) and (iv), where such violation, breach or default, or the
         failure to make such filing or obtain such consent or approval, would
         not, individually or in the aggregate, materially impair the ability of
         Buyer or Buyer Subsidiary to consummate the transactions contemplated
         by this Agreement.

                  (d) PROXY STATEMENT. None of the information furnished or to
         be furnished by Buyer or Buyer Subsidiary in writing specifically for
         inclusion in the Proxy Statement


                                       22
<PAGE>

         will, at the time the Proxy Statement is mailed, contain any untrue
         statement of a material fact, or omit to state any material fact
         required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
         statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
         made, not misleading, or will, at the time of the meeting of
         shareholders to which the Proxy Statement relates or at the Effective
         Time, as then amended or supplemented, omit to state any material fact
         necessary to correct any statement which has become false or misleading
         in any earlier communication with respect to the solicitation of any
         proxy for such meeting.

                  (e) LITIGATION. No litigation, arbitration or administrative
         proceeding is pending or, to the knowledge of Buyer or Buyer
         Subsidiary, threatened against Buyer or Buyer Subsidiary as of the date
         of this Agreement that seeks to enjoin or otherwise challenges the
         consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

                  (f) NO BROKERS OR FINDERS. Neither Buyer nor Buyer Subsidiary
         has engaged any investment banker, broker or finder in connection with
         the transactions contemplated hereby, except for persons and their
         affiliates name in clause (g) of this Section 3.02. Buyer shall be
         liable for all obligations of Buyer and Buyer Subsidiary to any such
         persons.

                  (g) AVAILABILITY OF FUNDS.

                           (i) With respect to senior bank financing, Buyer has
                  delivered to the Company a true and complete copy of a
                  commitment of Lehman Brothers Commercial Paper, Inc. and Fleet
                  National Bank (the "Senior Commitment"). The Senior Commitment
                  is in full force and effect, and neither Buyer nor Buyer
                  Subsidiary has any reason to expect that the conditions
                  included in the Senior Commitment will not be satisfied before
                  the Effective Time.

                           (ii) With respect to mezzanine financing, Buyer has
                  delivered to the Company a true and complete copy of a
                  commitment of Credit Suisse First Boston (the "Mezzanine
                  Commitment"). The Mezzanine Commitment is in full force and
                  effect, and neither Buyer nor Buyer Subsidiary has any reason
                  to expect that the conditions included in the Mezzanine
                  Commitment will not be satisfied before the Effective Time.

                           (iii) With respect to equity financing, Buyer has
                  delivered to the Company a commitment letter of Caxton-Iseman
                  Capital, Inc. ("Caxton-Iseman Capital"). The Caxton-Iseman
                  Capital commitment is in full force and effect, and neither
                  Buyer nor Buyer Subsidiary has any reason to expect that the
                  conditions included in this commitment will not be satisfied
                  before the Effective Time.

                           (iv) Buyer believes that the financing described in
                  paragraphs (i) through (iii) above is sufficient to enable
                  Buyer to complete the transactions contemplated by this
                  Agreement.

         special meeting of its shareholders to be duly called and held as soon
         as reasonably practicable after the execution of this Agreement for the
         purpose of voting on the approval of this Agreement. The Board of
         Directors of the Company shall recommend approval of this Agreement by
         the shareholders of the Company, unless the Board of Directors of the
         Company, after consulting with its legal and financial advisors,
         determines that to do so would result in a breach of the fiduciary
         duties of the Board of Directors of the Company under applicable law.

                  (b) The Company (i) as promptly as reasonably practicable
         following the execution of this Agreement, shall prepare and file with
         the SEC a proxy statement, together with a form of proxy, with respect
         to such shareholders meeting (such proxy statement, together with any
         amendments thereof or supplements thereto, being called the "Proxy
         Statement"), (ii) shall use reasonable best efforts to have the Proxy
         Statement cleared by the SEC as soon as reasonably practicable, and
         (iii) as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter, shall cause copies
         of such Proxy Statement and form of proxy to be mailed to its
         shareholders in accordance with the provisions of the Minnesota Act
         (unless the Board of Directors of the Company shall determine, in the
         good-faith exercise of its fiduciary duties, that such mailing should
         not be made). Before the filing of the Proxy Statement and form of
         proxy with the SEC, the Company shall provide reasonable opportunity
         for Buyer to review and comment upon the contents of the Proxy
         Statement and form of proxy. The Proxy Statement and form of proxy
         shall comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable
         requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations of the
         SEC promulgated thereunder. After the delivery to the Company's
         shareholders of copies of the Proxy Statement and form of proxy, the
         Company shall use reasonable efforts to solicit proxies in connection
         with such shareholders meeting in favor of approval of this Agreement,
         unless the Board of Directors of the Company, after receiving a bona
         fide unsolicited Third Party Acquisition Offer (as defined below) and
         after consulting with its legal and financial advisors, determines that
         to do so would result in a breach of the fiduciary duties of the Board
         of Directors of the Company under applicable law.

         4.03 NO SHOPPING. From the date hereof until the Effective Time, the
Company will not, and will not permit any officer, director, financial adviser
or other agent or representative of the Company, directly or indirectly, to (a)
take any action to seek, initiate or solicit any offer, proposal or indication
of interest from any person or group to acquire any shares of capital stock of
the Company or any Subsidiary, to merge, consolidate or enter into any business
combination with the Company or any Subsidiary, or to otherwise acquire, except
to the extent not prohibited by Section 4.01(d)(iv), any significant portion of
the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as whole (a "Third-Party
Acquisition Offer"), or (b) except to the extent the Board of Directors of the
Company shall otherwise determine, after receiving a bona fide unsolicited Third


                                       26
<PAGE>

Party Acquisition Offer and after consulting with its legal and financial
advisors, that to do otherwise would result in a breach of the fiduciary duties
of the Board of Directors of the Company under applicable law, engage in
negotiations concerning a Third-Party Acquisition Offer with any person or
group, or disclose financial information relating to the Company or any
Subsidiary or any confidential or proprietary trade or business information
relating to the business of the Company or any Subsidiary, or afford access to
the properties, books or records of the Company or any Subsidiary, to any person
or group that the Company has reason to believe may be considering a Third-Party
Acquisition Offer.

         The Company will as promptly as reasonably practicable notify Buyer
after receipt of any Third-Party Acquisition Offer or any indication that any
person is considering making a Third-Party Acquisition Offer or any request for
nonpublic information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or for
access to the properties, books or records of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries by any person that may be considering making, or has made, a
Third-Party Acquisition Offer or that the Company intends to engage in
negotiations with, or to provide information to any such person. The Company
shall as promptly as reasonably practicable provide Buyer with a reasonable
description of such Third-Party Acquisition Offer and a copy of such Third-Party
Acquisition Offer. The Company shall require that such person enter into a
confidentiality agreement with terms no less favorable to the Company than the
Confidentiality Agreement referred in Section 4.08. The Company shall keep Buyer
fully informed on a current basis of the status and details of any such
Third-Party Acquisition Offer, indication or request.

         4.04 ACCESS TO INFORMATION. From the date hereof until the Effective
Time, the Company will give Buyer and its counsel, financial advisers, auditors
and other authorized representatives and its financing sources reasonable access
to the offices, properties, books and records of the Company and each Subsidiary
at all reasonable times and upon reasonable notice, and will instruct the
employees, counsel, financial advisers and auditors of the Company and each
Subsidiary to cooperate with Buyer and each such representative and financing
source in all reasonable respects in its investigation of the business of the
Company and its Subsidiaries. Buyer and each such representative and financing
source will conduct such investigation in a manner as not to unreasonably
interfere with the operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries and will take
all necessary precautions (including obtaining the written agreement of its
respective employees or representatives involved in such investigation) to
protect the confidentiality of any information of the Company and its
Subsidiaries disclosed to such persons during such investigation.

         4.05 AMENDMENT OF THE COMPANY'S EMPLOYEE PLANS. The Company will,
effective at or immediately before the Effective Time, cause any Employee Plans

Buyer, for the purpose of permitting such Employee Plan to continue to operate
in conformity with ERISA and the Code following the Merger.

         4.06 HSR ACT. Each of the Company, Buyer and Buyer Subsidiary will file

under the HSR Act, will exercise reasonable efforts to obtain an early
termination of the applicable waiting period, and will make any further filings
pursuant thereto that may be necessary or advisable.

         4.07 CERTAIN RESIGNATIONS. The Company will use its reasonable efforts
to assist Buyer in procuring the resignation, effective as of the Effective
Time, of all of the members of the Boards of Directors of the Company and its
Subsidiaries.

         4.08 CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT. The Confidentiality Agreement between
the Company and Buyer dated February 25, 2000 shall remain in full force and
effect until the Effective Time. Until the Effective Time, the Company and Buyer
shall comply with the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.

         4.09 OPTIONS. The Company will take such actions as are necessary to
cause each Option outstanding immediately before the Effective Time (whether or
not such Option is then exercisable) to be canceled immediately before the
Effective Time in consideration for a cash payment by the Company equal to the
Option Settlement Amount for such Option, subject to all applicable tax
withholding. The Company shall comply with all applicable requirements regarding
income tax withholding in connection with the foregoing.

         4.10 AMENDMENT TO RIGHTS AGREEMENT. Before, or simultaneously with, the
execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Board of Directors of the Company
amended the Rights Agreement to provide that (a) neither Buyer nor Buyer
Subsidiary will become an "Acquiring Person" (as defined in the Rights
Agreement) as a result of the execution of this Agreement or the consummation of
the Merger, (b) no "Shares Acquisition Date," "Distribution Date," "Section
11(a)(ii) Event," or "Section 13 Event" (as such terms are defined in the Rights
Agreement) will occur as a result of the consummation of the Merger, and (c) all
outstanding Rights issued and outstanding under the Rights Agreement will expire
immediately before the Effective Time. Anything in this Agreement to the
contrary notwithstanding, the Company shall have the right at any time after the
date of this Agreement and before the Effective Time to further amend, or take
any other action with respect to, the Rights Agreement as deemed necessary by
the Company; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that any such further action or amendment shall
not contravene the amendment referred to in this Section 4.10; PROVIDED FURTHER,
HOWEVER, that any such amendment or action shall be subject to the prior written
approval of Buyer which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld.

         4.11 ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS; REASONABLE EFFORTS. Subject to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement, each of the parties agrees to use all
reasonable efforts to take or cause to be taken, all action and to do, or to
cause to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including cooperating fully with the other party and with Buyer's financing
sources. In case at any time after the Effective Time any further action is
necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest
the Surviving Corporation with full title to all properties, assets, rights,
approvals, immunities, and franchises of either of the Constituent


                                       28
<PAGE>

Corporations, the proper officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation
may take all such necessary action.

         4.12 SUBSTITUTE FINANCING. If for any reason any portion of the
financing described in Section 3.02(g) (the "Financing") shall not be available,
Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts to secure one or more substitute
financing commitments on terms no less favorable to Purchaser than those
contained in the commitment letters relating to the Financing until the earlier
of the termination of this Agreement and December 31, 2000.

         Time, Buyer shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation, a
         Subsidiary or any other affiliate of Buyer to maintain welfare and
         pension benefit plans, programs and arrangements that are, in the

         employees of the Company or any Subsidiary immediately before the
         Effective Time and continue to be active full-time employees of Buyer,
         the Surviving Corporation, any Subsidiary or any other affiliate of
         Buyer, no less favorable than those provided by the Company and its
         Subsidiaries immediately before the Effective Time (provided that
         nothing herein shall obligate Buyer, the Surviving Corporation, any
         Subsidiary or any other affiliate of Buyer to provide such employees
         with any equity or stock-based compensation).

                  (b) From and after the Effective Time, for purposes of
         determining eligibility, vesting and entitlement to vacation and
         severance benefits for employees actively


                                       31

         employed full-time by the Company or any Subsidiary immediately before
         the Effective Time under any compensation, severance, welfare, pension,
         benefit or savings plan of Buyer or any of its affiliates in which
         active full-time employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries become
         eligible to participate (whether under Section 6.01(a) above or
         otherwise), service with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
         (whether before or after the Effective Time) shall be credited as if
         such service had been rendered to Buyer or such affiliate.

                  (c) If the Surviving Corporation or any of the Subsidiaries,
         or any of their respective successors or assigns, transfers all or
         substantially all of its properties and assets to any person or persons
         (other than Buyer or an affiliate of Buyer) within one year of the
         Effective Date, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be
         made so that the transferee assumes (and if more than one, the
         transferees assume, jointly and severally) the obligations set forth in
         this Section 6.01.

         6.02 INDEMNIFICATION. All rights to indemnification, expense
advancement and exculpation existing in favor of any present or former director,
officer or employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as provided in the

after the Effective Time (or, in the event any relevant claim is asserted or
made within such six-year period, until final disposition of such claim) with
respect to matters occurring at or before the Effective Time, and no action
taken during such period shall be deemed to diminish the obligations set forth
in this Section 6.02. Buyer hereby guarantees, effective at the Effective Time,
all obligations of the Surviving Corporation and the Subsidiaries in respect of
such indemnification and expense advancement.

         6.03 DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS LIABILITY INSURANCE. For a period of at
least six years after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall,
and Buyer (for so long as it shall control the Surviving Corporation) shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain in effect either (i) the current
policy of directors' and officers' liability insurance maintained by the
Company (provided that Buyer or the Surviving Corporation may substitute
therefor policies of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms
and conditions which are no less advantageous in any material respect to the
insured parties thereunder) with respect to claims arising from facts or
events that occurred at or before the Effective Time (including consummation
of the Merger), or (ii) a run-off (i.e., "tail") policy or endorsement with
respect to the current policy of directors' and officers' liability insurance
covering claims asserted within six years after the Effective Time arising
from facts or events that occurred at or before the Effective Time (including
consummation of the Merger); and such policies or endorsements shall name as
insureds thereunder all present and former directors and officers of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Surviving
Corporation shall not be obligated to spend more than 200% of the average
annual premium in effect during the last three years in connection with this
Section 6.03. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the amount of the coverage
required by this Section exceeds 200% of the amount of the average annual
premium in effect


                                       32
<PAGE>

during the last three years, Buyer and the Surviving Corporation shall use all
reasonable efforts to maintain the most advantageous policies of directors' and
officers' insurance obtainable for an annual premium equal to no more than such
200% amount. If Buyer or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and
is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation
or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any person, proper provisions shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of Buyer and/or the Surviving Corporation are bound by the obligations
of the respective party set forth in Section 6.02 and this Section 6.03.

                                   ARTICLE VII

                           TERMINATION AND ABANDONMENT

         7.01 GENERALLY. This Agreement may be terminated and abandoned at any
time before the Effective Time, whether before or after approval of this
Agreement by the shareholders of the Company:

                  (a) by mutual consent of the Boards of Directors of Buyer and
         the Company;

                  (b) by Buyer or the Company if the transactions contemplated
         hereby shall not have been consummated on or before December 31, 2000
         (which date may be extended by mutual agreement of Buyer and the
         Company), PROVIDED that such failure is not due to the failure of the
         party seeking to terminate this Agreement (or, in the event Buyer is
         seeking to terminate this Agreement, of Buyer Subsidiary) to comply in
         all material respects with its obligations under this Agreement;

                  (c) by Buyer, if (i) any of the conditions set forth in
         Section 5.01 shall become impossible to fulfill other than for reasons
         within the control of Buyer or Buyer Subsidiary, and such conditions
         shall not have been waived by Buyer under Section 8.03, or (ii) the
         shareholders of the Company shall fail to approve this Agreement by the
         vote required by the Minnesota Act and the Company's Articles of
         Incorporation at the first shareholders meeting called for that purpose
         or any adjournment thereof;

                  (d) by the Company, if (i) any of the conditions set forth in
         Section 5.02 shall become impossible to fulfill other than for reasons
         within the control of the Company, and such conditions shall not have
         been waived by the Company under Section 8.03, or (ii) the shareholders
         of the Company shall fail to approve this Agreement by the vote
         required by the Minnesota Act and the Company's Articles of
         Incorporation at the first shareholders meeting called for that purpose
         or any adjournment thereof;

                  (e) by the Company upon not less than five days notice to
         Buyer, if the Board of Directors of the Company, in the good-faith
         exercise of its fiduciary duties, withdraws or adversely modifies its
         recommendation of the Merger, or if a bona fide Third-Party Acquisition
         Offer is received by the Company or its shareholders, which the Board
         of


                                       33
<PAGE>

         Directors of the Company determines, in the good faith exercise of its
         fiduciary duties, to accept, approve or recommend (provided, however,
         that the parties agree that the provision of any notice under this
         Section 7.01(e) shall not in itself provide Buyer with any right to
         terminate this Agreement); or

                  (f) by the Buyer, if the Board of Directors of the Company
         withdraws or adversely modifies its recommendation of the Merger, or if
         the Board of Directors of the Company accepts, approves or recommends,
         or publicly proposes to accept, approve or recommend, a Third-Party
         Acquisition Offer, or if there is any public announcement that any
         person or group has made or intends to make a Third-Party Acquisition
         Proposal and such Third-Party Acquisition Proposal is not rejected by
         the Board of Directors of the Company within 30 days of such
         announcement.

                  (g) by Buyer, if the Company shall have breached any
         representation or obligation contained in this Agreement, such breach
         would give rise to a failure of the condition set forth in Section
         5.01(a) and such breach has not been cured within 30 days after the
         giving of written notice to the Company.

                  (h) by the Company, if Buyer shall have breached any
         representation or obligation contained in this Agreement, such breach
         would give rise to a failure of the condition set forth in Section
         5.02(a) and such breach has not been cured within 30 days after the
         giving of written notice to Buyer.

         7.02 PROCEDURE AND EFFECT OF TERMINATION AND ABANDONMENT. In the event
of termination of this Agreement by the Company or Buyer under Section 7.01,
written notice thereof shall forthwith be given to the other party and this
Agreement shall terminate and the Merger shall be abandoned without further
action by any of the parties. If this Agreement is terminated as provided
herein, no party hereto shall have any liability or further obligation to any
other party to this Agreement, except as otherwise provided in Section 8.04 or
to the extent that the termination is a direct result of a willful and material
breach or violation by such party of a representation, warranty, or covenant
contained in this Agreement.

                                  ARTICLE VIII

                            MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS

         8.01 TERMINATION OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY. The
representations and warranties of the parties set forth in this Agreement
(including those set forth in the Disclosure Letter) or in any certificate
furnished under this Agreement shall not survive the Effective Time.

         8.02 AMENDMENT AND MODIFICATION. To the extent permitted by applicable
law, this Agreement may be amended, modified or supplemented only by written
agreement of the parties hereto at any time before the Effective Time with
respect to any of the terms contained herein, except that after the meeting of
shareholders contemplated by Section 4.02, the amount of the


                                       34
<PAGE>

Merger Consideration shall not be decreased and the form of the Merger
Consideration shall not be altered without the approval of the shareholders.

         8.03 WAIVER OF COMPLIANCE; CONSENTS. Any failure of Buyer or Buyer
Subsidiary, on the one hand, or the Company, on the other hand, to comply with
any obligation, covenant, agreement or condition herein (except the conditions
in Sections 5.01(b) and (e) and 5.02(b) and (d) of this Agreement) may be waived
in writing by the Company or by Buyer and Buyer Subsidiary, respectively, but
such waiver or failure to insist upon strict compliance with such obligation,
covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel
with respect to, any subsequent or other failure. Whenever this Agreement
requires or permits consent by or on behalf of any party hereto, such consent
shall be given in writing in a manner consistent with the requirements for a
waiver of compliance as set forth in this Section 8.03.

         8.04     EXPENSES AND TERMINATION FEE.

                  (a) Except as otherwise provided in Sections 8.04(b) and (e),
         all expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
         consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by
         the party incurring such expenses. Any such expenses incurred by the
         Company and not paid before the Effective Time shall be liabilities of
         the Surviving Corporation. Provided that if the Merger is completed,
         Buyer's expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
         consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will be paid by
         the Surviving Corporation immediately following the Effective Time.

                  (b) If this Agreement is terminated under Section 7.01 and if
         Buyer is entitled to a Termination Fee (as defined below) under
         paragraph (c) of this Section 8.04 or the Agreement is terminated in
         accordance with Section 7.01(c)(ii) or 7.01(d)(ii) and Buyer is not
         entitled to a Termination Fee under paragraph (c) of this Section 8.04
         and has not materially breached its obligations hereunder, then the
         Company shall, at the same time as the Termination Fee is required to
         be paid under paragraph (c) of this Section 8.04 (or not later than
         five business days following such termination under Section 7.01(c)(ii)
         or 7.01(d)(ii)), pay Buyer an amount equal to all reasonable,
         documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred by or on behalf of Buyer or

         transactions contemplated hereby, including reasonable legal,
         accounting, travel, filing, printing, financing commitment and other
         out-of-pocket expenses; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the aggregate expenses
         payable by the Company to Buyer under this Section 8.04(b) in the event
         Buyer is entitled to a Termination Fee shall not exceed $6.43 million,
         and that the aggregate expenses payable by the Company to Buyer under
         this Section 8.04(b) in the event of a termination under Section
         7.01(c)(ii) or 7.01(d)(ii) where no Termination Fee is payable shall
         not exceed $4 million.

                  (c) The Company shall, within five business days after
         termination of this Agreement under Section 8.04(c)(i) and within five
         business days after the consummation or the execution of the definitive
         agreement referred to in Section 8.04(c)(ii), pay Buyer a


                                       35
<PAGE>

         fee of $19.29 million (a "Termination Fee"), in addition to the
         expenses set forth in Section 8.04(b), if any of the following occurs:

                           (i) this Agreement is terminated (A) by the Company
                  under Section 7.01(e), (B) by Buyer under Section 7.01(f) or
                  (C) by Buyer if there shall have been any material breach of

                           (ii) this Agreement is terminated (A) by Buyer under
                  Section 7.01(b) or (c)(i) and the condition giving rise to
                  Buyer's right of termination resulted from a breach by the
                  Company of any of its representations, warranties or covenants
                  contained in this Agreement (except as provided in paragraph
                  8.04(c)(i)(C)), (B) by Buyer under Section 7.01(c)(ii), or (C)
                  by the Company under Section 7.01(d)(ii); PROVIDED, HOWEVER,
                  that (I) prior to any termination under Section 7.01(b) or
                  (c)(i)) or in the case of a termination under Section
                  7.01(c)(ii) or (d)(ii) prior to any meeting of the
                  shareholders of the Company called for purposes of approving
                  this Agreement either (A) any person or group shall have
                  informed the Company that such person or group proposes,
                  intends to propose, is considering proposing, or will or may,
                  if the Merger is delayed, abandoned or not approved by the
                  Company's shareholders, propose, a Third-Party Transaction (as
                  defined below), or (B) any such person or group or the Company
                  publicly announces (including any filing with any federal or
                  state office or agency) that such person or group has
                  proposed, intends to propose, is considering proposing, or
                  will or may, if the Merger is delayed, abandoned or not
                  approved by the Company's shareholders, propose, a Third-Party
                  Transaction; AND (II) within six months after such termination
                  a Third-Party Transaction is consummated or a binding
                  agreement providing for a Third-Party Transaction is entered
                  into by the Company.

                  (d) In no event shall more than one Termination Fee be payable
         under this Section 8.04. As used herein, "Third-Party Transaction"
         means the occurrence of any of the following events:

                  consideration that indicates a total value for the Company and
                  its Subsidiaries in excess of the sum of (A) the product of
                  the number of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding on
                  the date of this Agreement multiplied
