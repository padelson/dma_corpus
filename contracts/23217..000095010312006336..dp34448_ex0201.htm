ARTICLE 2

  

The Merger

  

  

Section 2.01. The Merger. (a) At the Effective Time, Merger Subsidiary shall
be merged (the "Merger") with and into the Company in accordance with Missouri
Law, whereupon the separate existence of Merger Subsidiary shall cease, and
the Company shall be the surviving corporation (the "Surviving Corporation").

  

  

(b) Subject to the provisions of Article 9, the closing of the Merger (the
"Closing") shall take place in New York City at the offices of Davis Polk and
Wardwell LLP, 450 Lexington Avenue, New York, New York, 10017 as soon as
possible, but in any event no later than four Business Days after the date the
conditions set forth in Article 9 (other than conditions that by their nature
are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or, to the
extent permissible, waiver of those conditions at the Closing) have been
satisfied or, to the extent permissible, waived by the party or parties
entitled to the benefit of such conditions (provided, however, that if such
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing shall not
have been satisfied or, to the extent permitted, waived on such fourth
Business Day, then the Closing shall take place on the fourth Business Day
after which all such conditions shall have been satisfied or, to the extent
permitted, waived) or at such other place, at such other time or on such other
date as Parent and the Company may mutually agree. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in no event shall Parent or Merger Subsidiary be obligated to
consummate the Closing prior to January 15, 2013.

  

  

(c) At the Closing, the Company and Merger Subsidiary shall file summary
articles of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Missouri and
make all other filings or recordings required by Missouri Law in connection
with the Merger. The Merger shall become effective at such time (the
"Effective Time") as summary articles of merger are duly filed with the
Secretary of State of the State of Missouri (or at such later time as may be
agreed by Parent and the Company, as permitted by Missouri Law, and specified
in the summary articles of merger).

  

  

(d) The effects of the Merger shall be as provided in this Agreement and in
the applicable provisions of Missouri Law. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing and subject thereto, from and after the Effective Time, the

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

9  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Surviving Corporation shall possess all the rights, privileges, immunities and
franchises and be subject to all of the obligations and liabilities of the
Company and Merger Subsidiary, all as provided under Missouri Law.

  

  

Section 2.02. Conversion of Shares. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Subsidiary, the
Company or the holders of any shares of Company Stock or any shares of capital
stock of Parent or Merger Subsidiary:

  

  

(a) Except as otherwise provided in Section 2.02(b), Section 2.02(c), Section
2.04, or Section 2.05, each share of Company Stock outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (together with any Company Rights attached to each
such share) shall be converted into the right to receive $90.00 in cash,
without interest (such per share amount, the "Merger Consideration"). As of
the Effective Time, all such shares of Company Stock shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to
exist, and shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the Merger
Consideration to be paid in accordance with Section 2.03, without interest.

  

  

(b) Each share of Company Stock held by the Company or owned by Parent
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares held for the
account of clients, customers or other Persons) together with any Company
Rights attached to each such share shall be canceled, and no payment shall be
made with respect thereto.

  

  

(c) Each share of Company Stock held by any Subsidiary of either the Company
or Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into such
number of shares of stock of the Surviving Corporation such that each such
Subsidiary owns the same percentage in the Surviving Corporation immediately
following the Effective Time as such Subsidiary owned in the Company
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

  

  

(d) Each share of common stock of Merger Subsidiary outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one share of
common stock of the Surviving Corporation with the same rights, powers and
privileges as the shares so converted and, except as provided in Section
2.02(c), shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the
Surviving Corporation.

  

  

Section 2.03. Surrender and Payment. (a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent
shall appoint an agent reasonably satisfactory to the Company (the "Exchange
Agent") for the purpose of exchanging for the Merger Consideration (i)
certificates representing shares of Company Stock (the "Certificates") or (ii)
subject to Section 2.05, uncertificated shares of Company Stock (the
"Uncertificated Shares"). Substantially concurrently with the Effective Time,
Parent shall deposit with the Exchange Agent the Merger Consideration, for the
benefit of the holders of, and to be paid in respect of, the Certificates and
the

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

10  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Uncertificated Shares (any funds deposited with the Exchange Agent, the
"Exchange Fund"). Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall send, or
shall cause the Exchange Agent to send, to each holder of shares of Company
Stock at the Effective Time a letter of transmittal and instructions (which
shall specify that the delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title
shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates or transfer of the
Uncertificated Shares to the Exchange Agent) for use in such exchange.

  

  

(b) Each holder of shares of Company Stock that have been converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration shall be entitled to receive, upon
(i) surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together with a properly
completed letter of transmittal, or (ii) receipt of an "agent's message" by
the Exchange Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the
Exchange Agent may reasonably request) in the case of a book-entry transfer of
Uncertificated Shares, the Merger Consideration in respect of the Company
Stock represented by a Certificate or Uncertificated Share. Until so
surrendered or transferred, as the case may be, each such Certificate or
Uncertificated Share shall represent after the Effective Time for all purposes
only the right to receive such Merger Consideration.

  

  

(c) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person other
than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or the transferred
Uncertificated Share is registered, it shall be a condition to such payment
that (i) either such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise
be in proper form for transfer or such Uncertificated Share shall be properly
transferred and (ii) the Person requesting such payment shall pay to the
Exchange Agent any transfer, documentary, stamp or similar taxes required as a
result of such payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate or Uncertificated Share or establish to the satisfaction of the
Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid or is not payable.

  

  

(d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of
transfers of shares of Company Stock. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are presented to the Surviving
Corporation or the Exchange Agent, they shall be canceled and exchanged for
the Merger Consideration provided for, and in accordance with the procedures
set forth, in this Article 2.

  

  

(e) Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Exchange
Agent pursuant to Section 2.03(a) that remains unclaimed by the holders of
shares of Company Stock six months after the Effective Time shall be returned
to Parent, upon demand, and any such holder who has not exchanged shares of
Company Stock for the Merger Consideration in accordance with this Section
2.03 prior to that time shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of
the Merger Consideration in respect of such shares without any interest
thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall not be liable to any
holder of shares of Company Stock for any amounts paid to a public official
pursuant to applicable

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

11  

  

 

 

 

  

  

abandoned property, escheat or similar laws. Any amounts remaining unclaimed
by holders of shares of Company Stock immediately prior to such time when the
amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental
Authority shall become, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, the
property of Parent free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto. Any portion of the Merger Consideration made
available to the Exchange Agent pursuant to Section 2.03(a) to pay for shares
of Company Stock for which appraisal rights have been perfected shall be
returned to Parent, upon demand.

  

  

(f) The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash in the Exchange Fund as directed
by Parent; provided, however, that any investment of such cash shall in all
events be limited to direct short-term obligations of, or short-term
obligations fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, the U.S.
government, in commercial paper rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody's
Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poor's Corporation, respectively, or in
certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or banker's acceptances of
commercial banks with capital exceeding $50 billion (based on the most recent
financial statements of such bank that are then publicly available), and that
no such investment or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable pursuant
to this Agreement. Any interest and other income resulting from such
investments shall be paid to Parent. In the event the Exchange Fund shall be
insufficient to make the payments contemplated by this Agreement, Parent
shall, or shall cause Merger Subsidiary to, promptly deposit additional funds
with the Exchange Agent in an amount which is equal to the deficiency in the
amount required to make such payment. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for
any purpose that is not expressly provided for in this Agreement.

  

  

Section 2.04. Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding Section 2.02 or any other
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, shares of Company Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who
has not voted in favor of the Merger or consented thereto in writing and who
is entitled to demand, and who properly demands payment of the fair value of
such shares of Company Stock pursuant to, and who complies in all respects
with, Section 351.455 of the Missouri Law shall not be converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration, unless and until such holder fails
to perfect or effectively withdraws or loses the right to appraisal under
Missouri Law. If, after the Effective Time, such holder fails to perfect,
withdraws or otherwise loses the right to appraisal, such shares shall be
treated as if they had been converted as of the Effective Time into the right
to receive the Merger Consideration without any interest thereon. The Company
shall give Parent prompt notice of any demands received by the Company for
appraisal of any shares of Company Stock under Section 351.455 of Missouri
Law, and Parent shall have the right to direct all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to such demands. Except with the prior written
consent of Parent, the Company shall not voluntarily make any payment with
respect to, or offer to settle or settle, any such demands.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

12  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Section 2.05. Employee Equity. (a) At or immediately prior to the Effective
Time, each option to purchase shares of Company Stock (each, a "Company Stock
Option") and each stock appreciation right which represents the right to
receive a payment in cash (each, a "Company Cash SAR") or shares of Company
Stock (each, a "Company Stock SAR" and together with the Company Stock Options
and the Company Cash SARs, the "Company Option Awards") outstanding under any
equity compensation plan or arrangement of the Company, whether or not vested
or exercisable, shall, automatically and without any action on behalf of the
holder thereof, be canceled, and the Company shall pay each holder of any such
Company Option Award for each such Company Option Award an amount in cash
determined by multiplying (i) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration
over the applicable exercise price of such Company Option Award by (ii) the
number of shares of the Company Stock underlying such award (assuming full
vesting of such Company Option Award) had such holder exercised such Company
Option Award in full immediately prior to the Effective Time.

  

  

(b) At or immediately prior to the Effective Time, (i) each award of
restricted Company Stock (each, a "Company Restricted Share") and each
restricted or deferred stock unit, whether settled in cash (each, a "Company
Cash RSU") or in stock (each, a "Company Stock RSU" and together with the
Company Restricted Shares and the Company Cash RSUs, the "Company Restricted
Stock Awards") outstanding under any compensation plan or arrangement of the
Company, whether or not vested, automatically and without any action on behalf
of the holder or beneficiary thereof, shall be canceled, and the Company shall
pay the holder of any such Company Restricted Stock Award at or promptly after
the Effective Time an amount in cash equal to the product of the Merger
Consideration and the number of shares of the Company Stock represented by
such Company Restricted Stock Award and (ii) all dividends and interest, if
any, accrued but unpaid as of the Effective Time with respect to Company
Restricted Shares outstanding under any compensation plan or arrangement of
the Company, automatically and without any action on behalf of the holder or
beneficiaries thereof, shall vest and be paid or distributed, as applicable,
to the holder of the associated Company Restricted Shares; provided, however,
that with respect to Company Cash RSUs, Company Stock RSUs and accrued but
unpaid dividends (and interest thereon), if any, that constitute "deferred
compensation" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code, such payment
shall occur on the date that it would otherwise occur under the applicable
equity or deferred compensation plan, arrangement or award agreement absent
the application of this Section 2.05(b) to the extent necessary to avoid the
imposition of any penalty or other taxes under Section 409A of the Code.

  

  

(c) At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the Board of Directors of
the Company or the compensation committee of the Board of Directors of the
Company, as applicable, shall adopt any resolutions and take any

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

13  

  

 

 

 

  

  

actions which are reasonably necessary to effectuate the provisions of this
Section 2.05.

  

  

Section 2.06. Adjustments. If, during the period between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of
capital stock of the Company shall occur by reason of any reclassification,
recapitalization, stock split or combination, exchange or readjustment of
shares, or any stock dividend thereon with a record date during such period,
but excluding any change that results from any exercise of Company Option
Awards or settlement of Company Cash RSUs or Company Stock RSUs, the Merger
Consideration and any other amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement shall
be appropriately adjusted.

  

  

Section 2.07. Withholding Rights. Notwithstanding any provision contained
herein to the contrary, each of the Exchange Agent, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation and Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Article 2 such
amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of
such payment under any provision of Applicable Law. To the extent that amounts
so deducted and withheld are paid over to the relevant Taxing Authority, such
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made.

  

  

Section 2.08. Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond,
in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct, as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of
the shares of Company Stock represented by such Certificate, as contemplated
by this Article 2.

  

  

  

ARTICLE 3

ARTICLE 4

  

Representations and Warranties of the Company

  

  

Subject to Section 11.05, except (x) as disclosed in (i) the Company 10-K,
(ii) the Company's quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period
ended December 31, 2011, March 31, 2012 or June 30, 2012, (iii) each of the
Company's current reports on Form 8-K filed with or furnished to the SEC since
the date of the filing of the Company's quarterly report for the quarterly
period ended June 30, 2012 and prior to the date hereof or (iv) the Company's
proxy statement relating to its 2012 annual meeting of shareholders (the
documents referred to in the foregoing clauses (i) through (iv), collectively,
the "Company SEC Documents") or (y) as set forth in the Company Disclosure
Schedule, the Company represents and warrants to Parent that:

  

  

Section 4.01. Corporate Existence and Power. The Company is a corporation duly
incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
State of Missouri and has all corporate powers and all governmental licenses,
authorizations, permits, consents and approvals required to carry on its
business as now conducted, except for those licenses, authorizations, permits,
consents and approvals the absence of which would not reasonably be expected
to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.
The Company is duly qualified to do business as a foreign corporation and is
in good standing in each jurisdiction where such qualification is necessary,
except for those jurisdictions where failure to be so qualified or in good
standing would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company has heretofore made
available to Parent true and complete copies of the articles of incorporation
and bylaws of the Company as currently in effect.

  

  

Section 4.02. Corporate Authorization. (a) The execution, delivery and
performance by the Company of this Agreement and the consummation by the
Company of the transactions contemplated hereby are within the Company's
corporate powers and, except for the required approval of the Company's
shareholders in connection with the consummation of the Merger, have been duly
authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Company. The
affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of the outstanding
shares of Company Stock entitled to vote thereon is the only vote of the
holders of any of the Company's capital stock necessary in connection with the
consummation of the Merger (the "Company Shareholder Approval"). This
Agreement

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

15  

  

 

 

 

  

  

constitutes a valid and binding agreement of the Company enforceable against
the Company in accordance with its terms (subject to applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and other laws
affecting creditors' rights generally and general principles of equity).

  

  

(b) At a meeting duly called and held, the Company's Board of Directors has
(i) unanimously determined that this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby are fair to and in the best interests of the Company's
shareholders, (ii) unanimously approved this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, (iii) unanimously resolved, subject to Section 6.03(b),
to recommend approval of this Agreement by the shareholders of the Company
(such recommendation, the "Company Board Recommendation"), (iv) unanimously
approved an amendment to the Company Rights Agreement to render the Company
Rights inapplicable to the Merger, this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby (a copy of which amendment was provided to Parent by the
Company prior to the date of this Agreement) and (v) unanimously adopted a
resolution for the purpose of causing Sections 351.407 and 351.459 of the
Missouri Law and Article Nine of the Company's Restated Articles of
Incorporation not to apply or to have been satisfied with respect to (A)
Parent or Merger Subsidiary with respect to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and (B) the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by
this Agreement.

  

  

Section 4.03. Governmental Authorization. The execution, delivery and
performance by the Company of this Agreement and the consummation by the
Company of the transactions contemplated hereby require no action by or in
respect of, or filing by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with, any
Governmental Authority, other than (i) the filing of summary articles of
merger with respect to the Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of
Missouri and appropriate documents with the relevant authorities of other
states in which the Company is qualified to do business, (ii) compliance with
any applicable requirements of the HSR Act and of the Competition Act, (iii)
compliance with any applicable requirements of the 1934 Act and the rules and
regulations of the NYSE and (iv) any actions or filings the absence of which
would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Company Material Adverse Effect.

  

  

Section 4.04. Non-contravention. The execution, delivery and performance by
the Company of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby do not and will not (i) contravene, conflict with, or
result in any violation or breach of any provision of the articles of
incorporation or bylaws of the Company, (ii) assuming compliance with the
matters referred to in Section 4.03, contravene, conflict with or result in a
violation or breach of any provision of any Applicable Law, (iii) require any
consent or other action by any Person under, constitute a default, or an event
that, with or without notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a
default, under,

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

16  

  

 

 

 

  

  

or cause or permit the termination, cancellation, acceleration or other change
of any right or obligation or the loss of any benefit to which the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries is entitled under any provision of any agreement or
other instrument binding upon the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any
Company Permit or (iv) result in the creation or imposition of any Lien on any
asset of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, with only such exceptions, in
the case of each of clauses (ii) through (iv), as would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse
Effect.

  

  

Section 4.05. Capitalization. (a) The authorized capital stock of the Company
consists of (x) 300,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share,

to the date hereof, no shares of Company Stock have been issued other than
pursuant to Company Option Awards or Company Restricted Stock Awards
outstanding on November 16, 2012, in accordance with their terms. All
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company have been, and all shares
that may be issued pursuant to any equity compensation plan or arrangement
will be, when issued in accordance with the respective terms thereof, duly
authorized and validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and free of
preemptive rights.

  

  

(b) There are no outstanding bonds, debentures, notes or other indebtedness of
the Company having the right to vote (or convertible into, or exchangeable
for, securities having the right to vote) on any matters on which shareholders
of the Company may vote. Except as set forth in this Section 4.05 and except
for the Company Rights, there are no issued, reserved-for-issuance or
outstanding (i) shares of capital stock or other voting securities of or
ownership interests in the Company, (ii) securities of the Company convertible
into or exchangeable for shares of capital stock or other voting securities of
or ownership interests in the Company, (iii) warrants, calls, options or other
rights to acquire from the Company, or other obligation of the Company to
issue, any capital stock, voting securities or other ownership interests or
securities convertible into or exchangeable for capital stock, voting
securities or other ownership interests in the Company or (iv) restricted
shares, stock appreciation rights, performance

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

17  

  

 

 

 

  

  

shares or units, contingent value rights, "phantom" stock or similar
securities or rights issued by the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company
that are derivative of, or provide economic benefits based, directly or
indirectly, on the value or price of, any capital stock of or voting
securities of the Company (the items in clauses (i) through (iv) being
referred to collectively as the "Company Securities"). There are no
outstanding obligations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any of the Company Securities. Neither

organized, is validly existing and (where applicable) in good standing under
the laws of its jurisdiction of organization, has all organizational powers
and all governmental licenses, authorizations, permits, consents and approvals
required to carry on its business as now conducted, except for any failure to
be so organized, existing and in good standing or to have such corporate power
or licenses, authorizations, permits, consents and approvals as would not

Material Adverse Effect. Each such Subsidiary is duly qualified to do business
as a foreign entity and is in good standing in each jurisdiction where such
qualification is necessary, except for those jurisdictions where failure to be
so qualified or in good standing would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. Section

jurisdictions of organization.

  

  

(b) All of the outstanding capital stock or other voting securities of, or

other limitation or restriction (including any restriction on the right to
vote, sell or otherwise dispose of such capital stock or other voting
securities or ownership interests), except for restrictions imposed by
applicable securities laws. There are no issued, reserved for issuance or
outstanding (i) securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
convertible into, or exchangeable for, shares of capital stock or other voting
securities of, or ownership interests in, any Subsidiary of the Company, (ii)
warrants, calls, options or other rights to acquire from the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, or other obligations of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to issue, any capital stock or other voting securities of, or
ownership interests in, or any securities convertible into, or exchangeable
for, any capital stock or other voting securities of, or ownership interests
in, any Subsidiary of the Company or (iii) restricted shares, stock
appreciation rights, performance units, contingent value rights, "phantom"
stock or similar securities or rights that are derivative of, or provide

indirectly, on the value or price of, any capital stock or other voting
securities of, or ownership interests in, any Subsidiary of the Company (the
items in clauses (i) through (iii) being referred to collectively as the
"Company Subsidiary Securities"). There are no outstanding obligations of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire
any of the Company Subsidiary Securities. Except for the capital stock or
other voting securities of, or ownership interests in, its Subsidiaries, the

pursuant to the 1934 Act did not, and each Company Filing filed subsequent to
the date hereof will not, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements made
therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading.

  

  

(d) Each Company Filing that is a registration statement, as amended or
supplemented, if applicable, filed pursuant to the 1933 Act, as of the date

(e) The Company has established and maintains disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15 under the 1934 Act). Such disclosure
controls and procedures are reasonably designed to ensure that material
information relating to the Company, including its consolidated Subsidiaries,
is made known to the Company's principal executive officer and its principal
financial officer by others within those entities, particularly during the
periods in which the periodic reports required under the 1934 Act are being

reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of the Company's financial
reporting and the preparation of Company financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with GAAP. The Company has disclosed, based on its most
recent evaluation of internal controls prior to the date hereof, to the
Company's auditors and audit committee (i) any significant deficiencies and
material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls which are
reasonably likely to adversely affect the Company's ability to record,
process, summarize and report financial information and (ii) any fraud,
whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have
a significant role in internal controls.

  

  

Section 4.08. Financial Statements. The audited consolidated financial
statements and unaudited consolidated interim financial statements of the
Company included in the Company Filings fairly present in all material
respects, in conformity with GAAP applied on a consistent basis (except as may

interim financial statements).

  

  

Section 4.09. Disclosure Documents. The proxy statement of the Company to be
filed with the SEC in connection with the Merger (the "Proxy Statement") will,
when filed, comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable
requirements of the 1934 Act. At the time the Proxy Statement and any
amendments or supplements thereto are first mailed to the shareholders of the
Company and at the time of the Company Shareholder Approval, the Proxy
Statement, as supplemented or amended, if applicable, will not contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading. The representations and warranties contained in this Section 4.09

reference in the Proxy Statement based upon information supplied by Parent,
Merger Subsidiary or any of their respective representatives or advisors
specifically for use or incorporation by reference therein.

been any action taken by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that, if

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

20

solicit, initiate or knowingly take any action to facilitate or encourage the

discussions or negotiations with, furnish any information relating to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or afford access to the business,
properties, assets, books or records of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
to, otherwise cooperate in any way with, or knowingly assist, participate in,

or has made, an Acquisition Proposal, (iii) fail to make, publicly withdraw or
publicly modify in a manner adverse to Parent the Company Board Recommendation

grant any waiver or release under any standstill or similar agreement with
respect to any class of equity securities of the Company or any of its

or other similar instrument relating to an Acquisition Proposal. It is agreed
that any violation of the restrictions on the Company set forth in this
Section by any Representative of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall
be a breach of this Section by the Company.

  

  

(b) Exceptions. Notwithstanding Section 6.03(a), but subject to compliance
with Sections 6.03(c) and (d), at any time prior to the approval of this
Agreement by the Company's shareholders:

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

37  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(i) the Company, directly or indirectly through advisors, agents or other
intermediaries, may (A) in response to a bona fide written Acquisition
Proposal, make inquiries to understand and clarify such Acquisition Proposal,
(B) engage in negotiations or discussions with any Third Party and its
Representatives that, subject to the Company's compliance with Section
6.03(a), has made after the date of this Agreement a bona fide, written
Acquisition Proposal that the Board of Directors of the Company in good faith
believes is or is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal and (C)
furnish to such Third Party or its Representatives and financing sources non-
public information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant
to a confidentiality agreement (a copy of which shall be provided for
informational purposes only to Parent) with such Third Party with terms no
less favorable to the Company as to the use of such information than those
contained in the confidentiality agreement dated October 30, 2012 between the
Company and Parent (the "Confidentiality Agreement") (it being understood that
such confidentiality agreement need not contain a standstill, non-solicitation
of employees or similar provision); provided that (1) all such information (to
the extent that such information has not been previously provided or made
available to Parent) is provided or made available to Parent, as the case may
be, prior to or substantially concurrently with the time it is provided or
made available to such Third Party and (2) if the Company enters into any such
confidentiality agreement that contains a standstill, non-solicitation of
employees or similar provision that is less favorable to the Company than the
terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, then, if this Agreement is terminated,
the Company shall promptly notify Parent thereof and the Confidentiality
Agreement shall be automatically amended to contain such less favorable terms;
and

  

  

(ii) subject to compliance with Section 6.03(d), the Board of Directors of the
Company may make an Adverse Recommendation Change (A) following receipt of a
Superior Proposal or (B) in response to material events or changes in
circumstances after the date hereof that were not known to the Company as of
or prior to the date hereof;

  

  

in each case referred to in the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) only if the
Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after consultation
with outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would be
reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
Applicable Law. For the avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding any Adverse
Recommendation Change, until the termination of this Agreement in accordance
with its terms (x) in no event may the Company (A) enter into any agreement in
principle, letter of intent, term sheet, merger agreement, acquisition
agreement, option agreement or other similar instrument relating to an
Acquisition Proposal, (B) make or facilitate any SEC or other regulatory
filings required in connection with implementation of the transactions
contemplated by any Acquisition Proposal or (C) seek any third party

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

38  

  

 

 

 

  

  

consents in connection with the transactions contemplated by any Acquisition
Proposal, and (y) the Company shall otherwise remain subject to all of its
obligations under this Agreement.

  

  

In addition, nothing contained herein shall prevent the Board of Directors of
the Company from complying with Rule 14e-2(a) under the 1934 Act with regard
to an Acquisition Proposal; provided that any action taken or statement made
to so comply that relates to an Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be an
Adverse Recommendation Change unless the Board of Directors of the Company
reaffirms the Company Board Recommendation (or expressly states that it is not
withdrawing the Company Board Recommendation) in such statement or in
connection with such action.

  

  

(c) Required Notices. The Company shall notify Parent promptly (but in no
event later than 24 hours) after receipt by the Company (or any of its
Representatives) of each Acquisition Proposal or any bona fide indication that
a Third Party intends to make an Acquisition Proposal, or any request for
information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or for access
to the business, properties, assets, books or records of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries by any Third Party that has made or has indicated that it
intends to make an Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall provide such notice
orally and in writing and shall identify the Third Party making, and the
material terms and conditions of, any such Acquisition Proposal, indication or
request. The Company shall keep Parent informed, on a reasonably current
basis, of the status of, and any material changes to, any such Acquisition
Proposal, indication or request, and shall promptly (but in no event later
than 24 hours after receipt) provide to Parent copies of all correspondence
and written materials sent or provided to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries that describes any material terms or conditions of any
Acquisition Proposal. Any material amendment to any Acquisition Proposal will
be deemed to be a new Acquisition Proposal for purposes of the Company's
compliance with this Section 6.03(c).

  

  

(d) "Last Look". Further, the Board of Directors of the Company shall not make
an Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to Section 6.03(b)(ii) (or terminate
this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.01(d)(i)), unless (i) the Company
promptly provides written notice to Parent, in writing at least three Business
Days before taking that action, of its intention to do so, attaching (A) in
the case of an Adverse Recommendation Change to be made following receipt of a
Superior Proposal, the most current version of the proposed agreement under
which such Superior Proposal is proposed to be consummated and the identity of
the third party making the Acquisition Proposal or (B) in the case of any
Adverse Recommendation Change to be made pursuant to Section 6.03(b)(ii)(B), a
reasonably detailed description of the reasons for making such Adverse
Recommendation Change, and (ii) Parent does not make, within three Business
Days after its receipt of that written notification, an offer that (A) in the
case of any Adverse Recommendation Change to be made following receipt of a
Superior

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

39  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Proposal, is at least as favorable to the shareholders of the Company as such
Superior Proposal (it being understood and agreed that any amendment to the
financial terms or other material amendment of such Superior Proposal shall
require a new written notification from the Company and a new three Business
Day period under this Section 6.03(d)) or (B) in the case of any Adverse
Recommendation Change to be made pursuant to Section 6.03(b)(ii)(B), obviates
the need for such Adverse Recommendation Change. The Company agrees that,
during any applicable three Business Day period referred to in this Section
6.03(d), the Company shall negotiate in good faith with Parent regarding any
revisions to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent.

  

  

(e) Definition of Superior Proposal. For purposes of this Agreement, "Superior
Proposal" means a bona fide, unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal for at
least a majority of the outstanding shares of Company Stock or all or
substantially all of the consolidated assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries on terms that the Board of Directors of the Company determines in
good faith by a majority vote, after considering the advice of a financial
advisor of nationally recognized reputation and outside legal counsel and
taking into account all the terms and conditions of the Acquisition Proposal,
including any break-up fees, expense reimbursement provisions and conditions
to consummation, are more favorable to the Company's shareholders than the
Merger (taking into account any proposal by Parent to amend the terms of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 6.03(d)), which the Board of Directors of the
Company determines is reasonably capable of being consummated and for which
financing, if a cash transaction (whether in whole or in part), is then fully
committed or determined by the Board of Directors of the Company to be
reasonably likely to be available.

  

  

(f) Obligation to Terminate Existing Discussions. The Company shall, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries and its and their Representatives to, cease immediately
and cause to be terminated any and all existing activities, discussions or
negotiations, if any, with any Third Party and its Representatives conducted
prior to the date hereof with respect to any Acquisition Proposal. The Company
shall promptly request that each Third Party, if any, that has executed a
confidentiality agreement within the 24-month period prior to the date hereof
in connection with its consideration of any Acquisition Proposal return or
destroy all confidential information heretofore furnished to such Person by or
on behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (and all analyses and
other materials prepared by or on behalf of such Person that contain, reflect
or analyze that information).

  

  

Section 6.04. Access to Information. From the date hereof until the Effective
Time and subject to Applicable Law and the Confidentiality Agreement, the
Company shall (i) give to Parent, its counsel, financial advisors, auditors
and other authorized representatives reasonable access to the offices,
properties, books and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries, (ii)
furnish to Parent, its counsel, financial advisors, auditors and other
authorized representatives such financial

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

40  

  

 

 

 

  

  

and operating data and other information as such Persons may reasonably
request and (iii) instruct its employees, counsel, financial advisors,
auditors and other authorized representatives to cooperate reasonably with
Parent in its investigation of the Company and its Subsidiaries; provided,
however, that the Company may withhold any document or information that is
subject to the terms of a confidentiality agreement with a third party or
subject to any attorney-client privilege so long as the Company uses its
reasonable best efforts to make alternative accommodations to convey the
information contained in such document or information to Parent in a manner
that preserves such privilege and/or does not breach such agreement. Any
investigation pursuant to this Section shall be conducted in such manner as
not to interfere unreasonably with the conduct of the business of the Company
and its Subsidiaries. All information exchanged pursuant to this Section 6.04
shall be subject to the Confidentiality Agreement.

  

  

Section 6.05. Certain Litigation. The Company shall give Parent the
opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any litigation
(including derivative claims) against the Company and/or its directors or
executive officers relating to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. The Company agrees that it shall not settle or offer to settle any
litigation commenced on or after the date of this Agreement against it or any
of its directors or executive officers relating to this Agreement, the Merger
or any other transaction contemplated hereby or otherwise, without the prior
written consent of Parent.

  

  

  

ARTICLE 7

  

Covenants of Parent

  

  

Parent agrees that:

  

  

Section 7.01. Obligations of Merger Subsidiary. Parent shall take all action
necessary to cause Merger Subsidiary to perform its obligations under this
Agreement and to consummate the Merger on the terms and conditions set forth
in this Agreement.

  

  

Section 7.02. Director and Officer Liability. Parent shall, and shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to, and the Surviving Corporation hereby agrees, to
do the following:

  

  

(a) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
indemnify and hold harmless the present and former officers, directors,
employees, fiduciaries or agents of the Company and any person who becomes an
officer, director, employee, fiduciary or agent prior to the Effective Time or
who is as of the date of this Agreement, or who thereafter commences prior to
the Effective Time, serving at the request of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries as a director, officer, employee, fiduciary or agent of another
Person (each, an

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

41  

  

 

 

 

  

  

"Indemnified Person") against all claims, losses, liabilities, damages,
judgments, inquiries, fines and reasonable fees, costs and expenses, including
attorneys' fees and disbursements, incurred or arising in connection with any
claim, action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time (including with respect to matters existing or occurring or
alleged to have existed or occurred at or prior to the Effective Time
(including this Agreement and the transactions and actions contemplated
hereby)) to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law. In the event of
any such claim, action, suit or proceeding, (x) each Indemnified Person will
be entitled to advancement of expenses incurred in the defense of any such
claim, action, suit or proceeding from within ten Business Days of receipt by
the Surviving Company from the Indemnified Person of a request therefor,
subject to any required undertaking under Applicable Law and (y) the Surviving
Corporation and Parent shall cooperate in the defense of any such matter.

  

  

(b) For six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to be
maintained in effect provisions in the Surviving Corporation's articles of
incorporation and bylaws (or in such documents of any successor to the
business of the Surviving Corporation) regarding elimination of liability of
directors, indemnification of officers, directors and employees and
advancement of expenses that are no less advantageous to the intended
beneficiaries than the corresponding provisions in existence on the date of
this Agreement.

  

  

(c) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to either (i) continue to
maintain in effect for six years after the Effective Time the Company's
directors' and officers' insurance policies and fiduciary liability insurance
policies (collectively, the "DandO Insurance") in place as of the date hereof
with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are at least
as favorable as those contained in the Company's DandO Insurance policies in
effect as of the date hereof or (ii) purchase comparable DandO Insurance for
such six-year period with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of
liability that are at least as favorable as those contained in the Company's
DandO Insurance policies in effect as of the date hereof; provided that if the
aggregate cost for such insurance coverage in respect of any one policy year
exceeds 200% of the current annual premium paid by the Company (which amount
is set forth in Section 7.02 of the Company Disclosure Schedule), the
Surviving Corporation shall instead be obligated to obtain DandO Insurance with
the best available coverage with respect to matters occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time for an aggregate cost in respect of each policy year within
such six-year period of 200% of the current annual premium paid by the
Company. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Company shall, in good
faith, explore the possibility of purchasing a prepaid six-year "tail"
directors' and officers' liability insurance policy and fiduciary liability
insurance policy on mutually agreeable terms.

  

  

(d) If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns
(i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

42  

  

 

 

 

  

  

continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger,
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, to the extent necessary,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or
the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations
set forth in this Section 7.02.

  

  

(e) The rights of each Indemnified Person under this Section 7.02 shall be in
addition to any rights such Person may have under the articles of
incorporation or bylaws of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or under
Missouri Law or any other Applicable Law or under any agreement of any
Indemnified Person with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, which Parent
and the Surviving Corporation agree shall continue in full force and effect in
accordance with their terms. These rights shall survive consummation of the
Merger and are intended to benefit, and shall be enforceable by, each
Indemnified Person, his or her heirs and his or her representatives.

  

  

Section 7.03. Employee Matters. (a) For a period of one year immediately
following the Effective Time (or such shorter period of employment, as the
case may be), Parent shall provide each Continuing Employee with base salary
or wages that are no less than, and other compensation and benefits (excluding
equity or equity-based compensation) that are substantially equivalent to, the
base salary or wages, and other compensation and benefits (excluding equity or
equity-based compensation), as applicable, as in effect with respect to such
Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time.

  

  

(b) Following the Effective Time, Parent will, subject to Applicable Law, give
each Continuing Employee full credit for prior service with the Company and
its Subsidiaries for all purposes, except for participation in and benefit
accrual under any defined benefit retirement plans or postretirement plans
(other than Employee Plans in effect as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time) providing medical, dental or life benefits, under any Parent employee
benefit plan, program or arrangement for which the Continuing Employee is
otherwise eligible and in which the Continuing Employee is offered
participation, except if such credit would result in a duplication of
benefits. In addition, Parent shall use its best efforts to waive, or cause to
be waived, for each Continuing Employee, any limitations on benefits relating
to pre-existing conditions to the same extent such limitations are waived
under any comparable plan of the Company or its Subsidiaries prior to the
Effective Time and recognize for purposes of annual deductible and out-of-
pocket limits under its medical and dental plans, deductible and out-of-pocket
expenses paid by each Continuing Employee in the calendar year in which the
Effective Time occurs.

  

  

(c) The Company and Parent each acknowledge and agree that it will take all
actions required of it pursuant to Section 6.01(j) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule. Nothing contained in this Section 7.03, expressed or implied, is
intended to confer upon any Continuing Employee any right to

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

43  

  

 

 

 

  

  

employment or continued employment with Parent or any of its Subsidiaries for
any period by reason of this Agreement or be construed as an amendment to any
Employee Plan. In addition, the provisions of this Agreement, in particular
this Section 7.03, are solely for the benefit of the parties to this
Agreement, and no current or former Service Provider or any other individual
associated therewith shall be regarded for any purpose as a third-party
beneficiary of this Agreement.

  

  

Section 7.04. Certain Obligations of Parent. Parent agrees that it will not,
and will not permit any of its Subsidiaries to, enter into any business
combination or similar transaction that could reasonably be expected to
prevent or materially delay the Merger or any of the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

trust or otherwise), or taking any other action (or otherwise agreeing to do

Corporation's Subsidiaries or any of their respective Affiliates' businesses,
assets or properties, in the case of each of clauses (A) and (B), if such
actions would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to
have a Company Material Adverse Effect (it being understood that, for purposes
of measuring any "Company Material Adverse Effect" under this Section 8.01(a),
any action to be taken by Parent or its Affiliates will be taken into account
as though such action were required to be taken by the Surviving Corporation,
mutatis mutandis); and provided further that no party hereto shall be required

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

44

Competition Act, (ii) shall use their reasonable best efforts to take all
other actions necessary to cause the expiration or termination of the
applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act and to obtain Competition Act
Approval as soon as practicable, and (iii) shall not extend any waiting period
under the HSR Act or the Competition Act relating to the Merger, except with
the prior written consent of the other party hereto (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

to the businesses of Parent and its Subsidiaries.

reasonable best efforts to cause its and their respective officers, directors,

reasonably cooperate with the marketing efforts of Parent and its financing
sources for such financing, including use of the Company's logos (provided

applicable, not to be satisfied prior to the End Date; and

  

  

(e) any failure of that party to comply with or satisfy any covenant,

Company or any of their respective Affiliates to take any action that would
not be required to be taken pursuant to Section 8.01(a), and no Applicable Law
shall have been enacted, enforced, promulgated or issued that has, or is
reasonably likely to have, any of the effects described in the preceding

and as of such time (other than representations and warranties that by their

(b) either the Commissioner shall have issued an advance ruling certificate

ARTICLE 10

  

Termination

  

  

Section 10.01. Termination. This Agreement may be terminated and the Merger
may be abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time (notwithstanding any
approval of this Agreement by the shareholders of the Company):

  

  

(a) by mutual written agreement of the Company and Parent;

  

  

(b) by either the Company or Parent, if:

  

  

(i) the Merger has not been consummated on or before the nine-month
anniversary of the date of this Agreement (the "End Date"); provided that the
right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 10.01(b)(i) shall
not be available to any party (including, in the case of Parent, Merger
Subsidiary) whose breach of any provision of this Agreement results in the
failure of the Merger to be consummated by such time;

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

51  

  

 

 

 

  

  

 

(ii) there shall be any Applicable Law that (A) makes consummation of the
Merger illegal or otherwise prohibited or (B) enjoins the Company or Parent
from consummating the Merger and such injunction shall have become final and
nonappealable; or

 

  

  

(iii) at the Company Shareholder Meeting (including any adjournment or
postponement thereof), the Company Shareholder Approval shall not have been
obtained; or

  

  

(c) by Parent:

  

  

(i) prior to the Company Shareholder Meeting, within 15 days after an Adverse
Recommendation Change shall have occurred;

  

  

(ii) if a breach of any representation or warranty or failure to perform any
covenant or agreement on the part of the Company set forth in this Agreement
shall have occurred that would cause the condition set forth in Section
9.02(a) not to be satisfied, and such condition is incapable of being
satisfied by the End Date; or

  

  

(iii) there shall have been an intentional and material breach of Section
6.02(a) or Section 6.03(a); or

  

  

(d) by the Company:

  

  

(i) prior to the Company Shareholder Meeting, if the Board of Directors of the
Company shall have made an Adverse Recommendation Change in compliance with
the terms of this Agreement, including Section 6.03(d), in order to enter into
a definitive, written agreement concerning a Superior Proposal; provided that
the Company shall have paid any amount due pursuant to Section 11.04(b) in
accordance therewith; or

  

  

(ii) if a breach of any representation or warranty or failure to perform any
covenant or agreement on the part of Parent or Merger Subsidiary set forth in
this Agreement shall have occurred that would cause the condition set forth in
Section 9.03(a) not to be satisfied, and such condition is incapable of being
satisfied by the End Date.

  

  

The party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 10.01
(other than pursuant to Section 10.01(a)) shall give notice of such
termination to the other party.

  

  

Section 10.02. Effect of Termination. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant
to Section 10.01, this Agreement shall become void and of no effect without
liability of any party (or any shareholder, director, officer, employee,
agent, consultant or representative of such party) to the other party hereto
except as provided in this Section 10.02 or Section 11.04. The provisions of
this Section 10.02, the last sentence of Section 6.04 and Article 11 shall
survive any termination hereof pursuant to Section 10.01, and no such
termination shall

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

52  

  

 

 

 

  

  

relieve any party from any liability for any willful and intentional breach of
any covenant or agreement set forth in this Agreement (which in the case of
any of the foregoing the parties acknowledge and agree shall not be limited to
reimbursement of expenses or out-of-pocket costs, and in the case of the
Company may include the benefit of the bargain lost by the Company's
shareholders , which shall be deemed to be damages of the Company); provided,
however, that, if the Termination Fee becomes due and payable, the payment by
the Company of the Termination Fee as required by this Agreement shall relieve
the Company from all further liability and obligations under this Agreement.
For the avoidance of doubt, and without limiting the foregoing, any failure of
the Company, on the one hand, or Parent and Merger Subsidiary, on the other
hand, to close the Merger following the satisfaction or waiver of such party's
conditions to closing shall be a willful and intentional breach by such party
of such party's covenants hereunder.

Section 11.03. Amendments and Waivers. (a) Any provision of this Agreement may
be amended or waived prior to the Effective Time if, but only if, such
amendment or waiver is in writing and is signed, in the case of an amendment,
by each party to this Agreement or, in the case of a waiver, by each party
against whom the waiver is to be effective; provided that after the Company
Shareholder Approval has been obtained there shall be no amendment or waiver
that would require the further approval of the shareholders of the Company
under Missouri Law without such approval having first been obtained.

  

  

(b) No failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, power or
privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or
partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The rights and remedies
herein provided shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or
remedies provided by Applicable Law.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

54  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Section 11.04. Expenses. (a) General. Except as otherwise provided herein, all
costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement shall be paid by
the party incurring such cost or expense.

  

  

(b) Termination Fee.

  

  

(i) If this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 10.01(c)(i)
or by the Company pursuant to Section 10.01(d)(i), then the Company shall pay
to Parent in immediately available funds $180 million (the "Termination Fee"),
in the case of a termination by Parent, within one Business Day after such
termination and, in the case of a termination by the Company, immediately
before and as a condition to such termination.

  

  

(ii) If (A) this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the Company pursuant to
Section 10.01(b)(i) or Section 10.01(b)(iii), (B) after the date of this
Agreement and prior to such termination (in the case of termination pursuant
to Section 10.01(b)(i))) or prior to the Company Shareholder Meeting (in the
case of termination pursuant to Section 10.01(b)(iii)), a bona fide
Acquisition Proposal shall have been publicly announced or otherwise been
communicated to the Board of Directors of the Company or its shareholders and
not withdrawn, and (C) within 12 months following the date of such
termination, the Company shall have entered into a definitive agreement with
respect to an Acquisition Proposal, recommended that its shareholders tender
into any tender offer made in connection with an Acquisition Proposal, or an
Acquisition Proposal shall have been consummated (provided that for purposes
of this clause (C), each reference to "20%" in the definition of Acquisition
Proposal shall be deemed to be a reference to "50%"), then the Company shall
pay to Parent in immediately available funds, concurrently with the occurrence
of the applicable event described in clause (C), the Termination Fee.

  

  

(iii) If this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section
10.01(c)(iii) and within 12 months following the date of such termination the
Company shall have entered into a definitive agreement with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal, recommended that its shareholders tender into any tender
offer made in connection with an Acquisition Proposal, or an Acquisition
Proposal shall have been consummated (provided that for purposes of this
clause (iii), each reference to "20%" in the definition of Acquisition
Proposal shall be deemed to be a reference to "50%"), then the Company shall
pay to Parent in immediately available funds, concurrently with the occurrence
of the applicable event, the Termination Fee.

  

  

(c) Other Costs and Expenses. The Company acknowledges that the agreements
contained in this Section 11.04 are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and that, without these agreements, Parent and

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

55  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Merger Subsidiary would not enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the
Company fails promptly to pay any amount due to Parent pursuant to this
Section 11.04, it shall also pay any costs and expenses incurred by Parent or
Merger Subsidiary in connection with a legal action to enforce this Agreement
that results in a judgment against the Company for such amount, together with
interest on the amount of any unpaid fee, cost or expense at the publicly
announced prime rate of Citibank, N.A. from the date such fee, cost or expense
was required to be paid to (but excluding) the payment date.

  

  

Section 11.05. Disclosure Schedule and SEC Document References. (a) The
parties hereto agree that any reference in a particular Section of either the
Company Disclosure Schedule or the Parent Disclosure Schedule shall only be
deemed to be an exception to (or, as applicable, a disclosure for purposes of)
(i) the representations and warranties (or covenants, as applicable) of the
relevant party that are contained in the corresponding Section of this
Agreement and (ii) any other representations and warranties of such party that
is contained in this Agreement, but only if the relevance of that reference as
an exception to (or a disclosure for purposes of) such representations and
warranties would be reasonably apparent to a person who has read that
reference and such representations and warranties, without any independent
knowledge on the part of the reader regarding the matter(s) so disclosed.

  

  

(b) The parties hereto agree that any information contained in any part of any
Company SEC Document shall only be deemed to be an exception to (or a
disclosure for purposes of) the Company's representations and warranties if
the relevance of that information as an exception to (or a disclosure for
purposes of) such representations and warranties would be reasonably apparent
to a person who has read that information concurrently with such
representations and warranties, without any independent knowledge on the part
of the reader regarding the matter(s) so disclosed; provided that in no event
shall any information contained in any part of any Company SEC Document
entitled "Risk Factors" or containing a description or explanation of
"Forward-Looking Statements" be deemed to be an exception to (or a disclosure
for purposes of) any representations and warranties of the Company contained
in this Agreement.

  

  

Section 11.06. Binding Effect; Benefit; Assignment. (a) The provisions of this
Agreement shall be binding upon and, except as provided in Section 7.02 and
Section 11.10, shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and assigns. Except as provided in Section 7.02 and
Section 11.10, no provision of this Agreement is intended to confer any
rights, benefits, remedies, obligations or liabilities hereunder upon any
Person other than the parties hereto and their respective successors and
assigns; provided that nothing in this Section 11.06(a) shall limit the right
of the Company to seek damages as contemplated by Section 10.02.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

56  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) No party may assign, delegate or otherwise transfer any of its rights or
obligations under this Agreement without the consent of each other party
hereto, except that Parent or Merger Subsidiary may transfer or assign its
rights and obligations under this Agreement, in whole or from time to time in
part, (i) in the case of Merger Subsidiary, to any other wholly-owned
Subsidiary of Parent that is organized under the laws of Missouri and (ii)
after the Effective Time, to any Person; provided that such transfer or
assignment shall not relieve Parent or Merger Subsidiary of its obligations
hereunder or enlarge, alter or change any obligation of any other party hereto
or due to Parent or Merger Subsidiary.

  

  

Section 11.07. Governing Law. This Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby, and all disputes between the parties under or related to this
Agreement or the facts and circumstances leading to its execution, whether in
contract, tort or otherwise, shall be governed by and construed in accordance
with the laws of the State of Delaware applicable to contracts executed in and
to be performed entirely within such State; provided that notwithstanding the
foregoing Missouri Law shall govern to the extent that Missouri Law is
mandatorily applicable to the Merger and the internal affairs of the Company
(including the fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors of the Company and
any determination under Section 6.03 pursuant to such fiduciary duties).

  

  

Section 11.08. Jurisdiction. The parties hereto agree that any suit, action or
proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any matter arising
out of or in connection with, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby (whether brought by any party or any of its Affiliates or against any
party or any of its Affiliates) shall be brought in the Court of Chancery of
the State of Delaware or, if such court shall not have jurisdiction, any
federal court located in the State of Delaware or other Delaware state court,
and each of the parties hereby irrevocably consents to the jurisdiction of
such courts (and of the appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in any such
suit, action or proceeding and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the
laying of the venue of any such suit, action or proceeding in any such court
or that any such suit, action or proceeding brought in any such court has been
brought in an inconvenient forum. Process in any such suit, action or
proceeding may be served on any party anywhere in the world, whether within or
without the jurisdiction of any such court. Without limiting the foregoing,
each party agrees that service of process on such party as provided in Section
11.01 shall be deemed effective service of process on such party.

  

  

Section 11.09. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

57  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Section 11.10 . Financing Source Arrangements. Notwithstanding anything
contained herein to the contrary, including Section 11.08, each of the parties
hereto agrees that (a) any claim, suit, action or proceeding arising out of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the debt commitment letter,
dated as of the date hereof, among Parent, Bank of America, N.A. and Merrill
Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and Smith Incorporated (the "Debt Commitment Letter"), to
the extent involving any party to the Debt Commitment Letter, any of the
entities that have at any time committed to provide financing in connection
with the Merger, or any of their respective Affiliates or Representatives (the
"Financing Sources"), shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of a
state or federal court sitting in the County of New York, (b) it will not, and
it will not permit any of its controlled Affiliates to, bring or support
anyone else in bringing any claim, suit, action or proceeding in any other
court, against any of the Financing Sources in any way relating to this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (c) it
waives any right to trial by jury in respect of any such claim, suit, action
or proceeding and (d) the parties to the Debt Commitment Letter and the
Financing Sources are express third-party beneficiaries of this Section 11.10.

  

  

Section 11.11. Counterparts; Effectiveness. This Agreement may be signed in
any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same
effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument.
This Agreement shall become effective when each party hereto shall have
received a counterpart hereof signed by all of the other parties hereto. Until
and unless each party has received a counterpart hereof signed by the other
party hereto, this Agreement shall have no effect and no party shall have any
right or obligation hereunder (whether by virtue of any other oral or written
agreement or other communication).

  

  

Section 11.12. Entire Agreement. This Agreement and the Confidentiality
Agreement constitute the entire agreement between the parties with respect to
the subject matter of this Agreement and supersede all prior agreements and
understandings, both oral and written, between the parties with respect to the
subject matter of this Agreement.

  

  

Section 11.13. Severability. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction
of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other
Governmental Authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of
the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall
remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or
invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions
contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any
party. Upon such a determination, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as
closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions
contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest
extent possible.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

58  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Section 11.14. Specific Performance. The parties hereto agree that irreparable
damage would occur if any provision of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with the terms hereof and that monetary damages, even if available,
would not be an adequate remedy therefor, and, accordingly that the parties
shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement or to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and
provisions hereof, without proof of actual damages (and each party hereby
waives any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection
with such remedy), in any federal court located in the State of Delaware or
any Delaware state court, in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at law or in equity. The parties further agree not to assert that a
remedy of specific enforcement is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to law or
inequitable for any reason, nor to assert that a remedy of monetary damages
would provide an adequate remedy for any such breach.
