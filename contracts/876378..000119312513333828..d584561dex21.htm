by and among SAFESTITCH MEDICAL, INC., a Delaware corporation ("SafeStitch"),
TWEETY ACQUISITION CORP., a Delaware corporation and a direct wholly owned
subsidiary of SafeStitch ("Merger Sub"), and TRANSENTERIX, INC., a Delaware
corporation ("TransEnterix").

WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of SafeStitch and Merger Sub have
approved this Agreement, and deem it advisable and in the best interests of
their respective stockholders to consummate the merger of Merger Sub with and
into TransEnterix, with TransEnterix surviving the Merger, on the terms and
conditions set forth herein (the "Merger");

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of TransEnterix has approved this Agreement,
and deems it in the best interest of TransEnterix and its stockholders that it
consummate the Merger on the terms and conditions set forth herein and has
recommended to the stockholders of TransEnterix that they adopt this
Agreement and approve the Merger;

WHEREAS, SafeStitch and TransEnterix desire to make certain representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the Merger and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and also to prescribe various
conditions to the Merger;

 

WHEREAS, certain existing stockholders of SafeStitch and TransEnterix intend
to subscribe for shares of SafeStitch Common Stock, with the consummation of
such subscription to occur immediately after the Closing (the "Equity
Financing"), pursuant to the security purchase agreements entered into among
SafeStitch and such stockholders prior to the Closing;

 

WHEREAS, in connection with the Equity Financing, SafeStitch shall enter into
a registration rights agreement providing for the future registration of the
SafeStitch Common Stock received in the Merger and in the Equity Financing
(the "Registration Rights Agreement");

WHEREAS, certain existing stockholders of SafeStitch and TransEnterix are
entering into lock-up and voting agreements restricting their ability to
transfer shares of SafeStitch Common Stock, including shares received in the
Merger and in the Equity Financing, concurrently with this Agreement, and
agreeing to take certain other actions in their capacity as stockholders of
SafeStitch (the "Lock-up Agreements");

 

WHEREAS, for United States federal income tax purposes, it is intended that
the Merger shall qualify as a reorganization under Section 368(a) of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and this Agreement is
intended to be, and is hereby, adopted as a plan of reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and of the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement, the parties
intending to be legally bound hereby agree as follows: ARTICLE I.

THE MERGER

Section 1.01. The Merger. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged
with and into TransEnterix in accordance with the Delaware General Corporation
Law (the "DGCL"). At the Effective Time, the separate corporate existence of
Merger Sub shall cease, and TransEnterix shall be the surviving corporation in
the Merger (the "Surviving Corporation") and shall continue its corporate
existence under the laws of the State of Delaware and shall succeed to and
assume all of the rights and obligations of TransEnterix and Merger Sub in
accordance with the DGCL and shall become, as a result of the Merger, a direct
wholly owned subsidiary of SafeStitch.

 

Section 1.02. Closing. Unless this Agreement shall have been terminated
pursuant to Section 8.01, the closing of the Merger (the "Closing") will take
place at 10:00 a.m., PST, on a date to be specified by the parties (the
"Closing Date"), which shall be no later than the second (2nd) Business Day
after satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VII
(other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the
Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted by
applicable Legal Requirements) of such conditions at such time), unless
another time or date is agreed to by the parties hereto. The Closing shall be
held at such location as is agreed to by the parties hereto. By agreement of
the parties, the Closing may take place by delivery of documents required to
be delivered hereby by facsimile or other electronic transmission, including
by email attachment.

Section 1.03. Effective Time of the Merger. Upon the Closing, SafeStitch and
TransEnterix will cause a Certificate of Merger (the "Certificate of Merger")
to be executed, acknowledged and filed with the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware in accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL and
shall make all other filings or recordings required under the DGCL. The Merger
shall become effective at such time as the Certificate of Merger shall have
been duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at
such later date or time as may be agreed by the parties in writing and
specified in the Certificate of Merger (the time at which the Merger becomes
effective is referred to herein as the "Effective Time").

Section 1.04. Effects of the Merger. The Merger shall generally have
the effects set forth in this Agreement and the applicable provisions of the
DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto,
at the Effective Time, all the properties, rights, privileges, powers and
franchises of TransEnterix and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving
Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of TransEnterix and Merger
Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving
Corporation.

 



-2-  Section 1.05. Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws of the
Surviving Corporation.

(a) At the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation of Merger Sub as
in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the certificate of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in
accordance with the provisions thereof and hereof and applicable Legal
Requirements, in each case consistent with the obligations set forth in
Section 6.08.

(b) At the Effective Time, the by-laws of Merger Sub as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be the by-laws of the Surviving Corporation
until thereafter amended in accordance with the provisions thereof and hereof
and applicable Legal Requirements, in each case consistent with the
obligations set forth in Section 6.08.

Section 1.06. Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation.

 

(a) The directors of Merger Sub at the Effective Time shall, from and after
the Effective Time, be the directors of the Surviving Corporation in the
Merger until their successors have been duly elected or appointed and
qualified, or their earlier death, resignation or removal.

(b) The officers of TransEnterix at the Effective Time shall, from and after
the Effective Time, be the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation until
their successors have been duly elected or appointed and qualified, or their
earlier death, resignation or removal.

Section 1.07. Post-Merger Operations.

(a) Board Matters. Subject to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule and
Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder, SafeStitch shall take all necessary
corporate action to cause the following to occur as of the Effective Time: (i)
the number of directors constituting the Board of Directors of SafeStitch
shall be nine (9), of which SafeStitch shall be entitled to designate three
(3) directors (each, a "SafeStitch Designee") and TransEnterix shall be
entitled to designate six (6) directors (each, a "TransEnterix Designee" and
the TransEnterix Designees together with the SafeStitch Designees, the "Board
Designees"), in each case at any time prior to the Closing and in each case
subject to such individuals ability and willingness to serve, (ii)
the chairperson of the Board of Directors of SafeStitch will be a
TransEnterix Designee, as designated by TransEnterix at any time prior to the
Closing, subject to such individuals ability and willingness to serve, and
(iii) the committees of the Board of Directors of SafeStitch, and the
chairpersons of each such committee, shall be allocated among the SafeStitch
Designees and TransEnterix Designees in the

 



-3-   same proportion as their respective representation on the Board of
Directors, subject to such individuals ability and willingness to serve;
_provided_ , that the parties shall cooperate in good faith to ensure that
the Board of Directors of SafeStitch is composed of at least 50% "independent"
directors (as determined by the rules of the Nasdaq) and the Audit Committee
of the SafeStitch Board of Directors is composed of only those persons who
qualify under the applicable rules of the Exchange Act and the Nasdaq to serve
on the audit committee of the board of directors of a public company listed on
a national securities exchange, and that one such person is an "audit
committee financial expert" (as defined by Rule 407(d)(5)(ii) of Regulation
S-K). If, prior to the Effective Time, any SafeStitch Designee or any
TransEnterix Designee becomes unable or unwilling to serve as a director on
the Board of Directors of SafeStitch, as Chairperson of the Board of
Directors of SafeStitch or as a chairperson of a committee, then a replacement
for such designee shall be designated by the party originally entitled to
designate such individual. 

(b) Executive Officers. Subject to such individuals ability and willingness
to so serve, SafeStitch shall take all necessary corporate action so that the
individuals designated in writing by TransEnterix at any time prior to Closing
be appointed to the SafeStitch senior executive officer positions specified by
TransEnterix, effective as of the Effective Time. If, prior to the Effective
Time, any such individual(s) is(are) unwilling or unable to serve in such
officer position(s) as of the Effective Time, then TransEnterix shall be
entitled to appoint other individual(s) to serve in such officer position(s),
and SafeStitch shall take all necessary corporate action to effect such
appointments.

(c) Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act. Each of TransEnterix and SafeStitch
shall provide sufficient information regarding their respective Board
Designees to enable SafeStitch to make any filings required by Section 14(f)
of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder. SafeStitch shall
take all action required pursuant to Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 in order to
fulfill its obligations under Section 1.07(a).

 

ARTICLE II.

CONVERSION OF SHARES; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

Section 2.01. Effect on Capital Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of holders of any shares of
TransEnterix Common Stock or any capital stock of Merger Sub:

 

(a) Cancellation of Certain TransEnterix Capital Stock. Each share of
TransEnterix Capital Stock that is owned by TransEnterix, SafeStitch, Merger
Sub or any Subsidiaries of SafeStitch ("Cancelled Shares") shall automatically
be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall
be delivered in exchange therefor.

 



-4-  (b) Conversion of TransEnterix Capital Stock.

 

(i) Each issued and outstanding share of TransEnterix Capital Stock (other
than Cancelled Shares, Dissenting Shares and shares of TransEnterix Capital
Stock held by Unaccredited Investors) shall be converted into the right to
receive 1.1723 (the "Exchange Ratio") fully paid and nonassessable shares of
SafeStitch Common Stock (such aggregate amount, the "Stock Merger
Consideration"). As of the Effective Time, all such shares of TransEnterix
Capital Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of
a certificate representing any such shares of TransEnterix Capital Stock
(other than Unaccredited Investors) shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except the right to receive the Stock Merger Consideration as
contemplated by this Section 2.01(b)(i) (and cash in lieu of fractional
shares of SafeStitch Common Stock payable in accordance with Section 2.02(d))
to be issued or paid in consideration therefor upon the surrender of
certificates in accordance with Section 2.02, without interest.

(ii) Each issued and outstanding share of TransEnterix Capital Stock held
by Unaccredited Investors (other than Cancelled Shares and Dissenting Shares)
shall be converted into the right to receive a cash payment equal to the Per
Share Cash Consideration (the "Cash Merger Consideration", and together with
the Stock Merger Consideration, the "Merger Consideration"). As of the
Effective Time, all such shares of TransEnterix Capital Stock shall no longer
be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease
to exist, and each holder of a certificate representing any such shares of
TransEnterix Capital Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive the Cash Merger Consideration as
contemplated by this Section 2.01(b)(ii) to be paid in consideration therefor
upon the surrender of certificates in accordance with Section 2.02, without
interest.

(c) Conversion of Merger Sub Common Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, each
share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common
stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation and shall
constitute the only outstanding capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.
From and after the Effective Time, all certificates representing the common
stock of Merger Sub shall be deemed for all purposes to represent the number
of shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation into which they were
converted in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence.

(d) Dissenting Shares.

(i) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any shares of
TransEnterix Capital Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
and held by a holder who has not voted in favor of the Merger or consented
thereto in writing and who has exercised and perfected appraisal
or dissenters rights for such shares in accordance with Section 262 of the
DGCL and has not effectively withdrawn or lost such appraisal rights
(collectively, the "Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into or
represent the right to receive Merger Consideration, and the holder or
holders of Dissenting Shares shall be entitled only to such rights as may be
granted to such holder or holders in Section 262 of the DGCL.

 



-5-  (ii) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 2.01(d)(i), if any holder of
Dissenting Shares shall effectively withdraw or lose (through failure to
perfect or otherwise) such holders appraisal rights under Section 262 of the
DGCL, then, as of the later of the Effective Time and the occurrence of such
event, such holders shares shall automatically be converted into and
represent only the right to receive the applicable Merger Consideration in
accordance with this Agreement, without interest, upon surrender of the
certificate representing such shares. 

(e) TransEnterix Options. The treatment of TransEnterix Stock Options shall be
as set forth in Section 6.05. 

(f) TransEnterix Warrants. The treatment of TransEnterix Warrants shall be as
set forth in Section 6.07. 

Section 2.02. Exchange of Certificates.

(a) Exchange Agent. Prior to the Effective Time, SafeStitch shall enter into
an agreement with such bank or trust company as may be mutually agreed by
SafeStitch and TransEnterix (the "Exchange Agent"), which agreement shall
provide that SafeStitch shall deposit with the Exchange Agent at the Effective
Time, for the benefit of the holders of shares of TransEnterix Capital Stock,
for exchange in accordance with this Article II, through the Exchange Agent,
certificates representing the shares of SafeStitch Common Stock representing
the Stock Merger Consideration, and cash sufficient for the payment of the
aggregate Cash Merger Consideration (such shares of SafeStitch Common Stock
and cash to be deposited being hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange
Fund"), _provided_ , that in lieu of depositing shares of SafeStitch Common
Stock with the Exchange Agent, SafeStitch may elect to instruct its transfer
agent to issue shares of SafeStitch Common Stock directly to holders of shares
of TransEnterix Capital Stock, in which case such transfer agent shall be
deemed an agent of the Exchange Agent for purposes of issuing Stock
Merger Consideration hereunder.

(b) Exchange Procedures. As soon as reasonably practicable after
the Effective Time and in any event not later than the tenth (10th) Business
Day following the Effective Time, SafeStitch shall cause the Exchange Agent to
mail to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates that
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of
TransEnterix Capital Stock (the "Certificates") whose shares were converted
into the right to receive Merger Consideration, (i) a letter of transmittal
(which (a) shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss
and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates to the Exchange Agent, and (b) shall be in such form and have
such other provisions as SafeStitch and TransEnterix may reasonably specify)
and (ii) instructions for use in surrendering the Certificates in exchange for
certificates representing whole shares of SafeStitch Common Stock and cash as
Cash Merger Consideration or cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to
Section 2.02(d). Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the
Exchange Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and
validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such
other documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the
holder of such

 



-6-   Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor that number of
whole shares of SafeStitch Common Stock, or cash in the amount of the Cash
Merger Consideration, that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to
the provisions of this Article II, and cash in lieu of any fractional share of
SafeStitch Common Stock in accordance with Section 2.02(d), and the
Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a
transfer of ownership of TransEnterix Capital Stock that is not registered in
the transfer records of TransEnterix, the proper number of shares of
SafeStitch Common Stock (or the proper amount of Cash Merger Consideration)
may be issued to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate
so surrendered is registered if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or
otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the Person requesting such
issuance shall pay any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the
issuance of shares of SafeStitch Common Stock (or the payment of cash
consideration) to a Person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate or establish to the reasonable satisfaction of SafeStitch that
such tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated
by this Section 2.02, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender
the applicable Merger Consideration, which the holder thereof has the right
to receive in respect of such Certificate pursuant to the provisions of this
Article II, and cash in lieu of any fractional share of SafeStitch Common
Stock, in accordance with Section 2.02(d). No interest shall be paid or will
accrue on the Merger Consideration or any other cash payable to holders of
Certificates pursuant to the provisions of this Article II.

 

(c) No Further Ownership Rights in TransEnterix Capital Stock; Closing of
Transfer Books. All shares of SafeStitch Common Stock issued upon the
surrender for exchange of Certificates in accordance with the terms of this
Article II (including any cash paid pursuant to this Article II) shall be
deemed to have been issued (and paid) in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to the shares of TransEnterix Capital Stock theretofore
represented by such Certificates, subject, however, to TransEnterixs
obligation to pay any dividends or make any other distributions with a record
date prior to the Effective Time that may have been declared or made by
TransEnterix on such shares of TransEnterix Capital Stock that remain unpaid
at the Effective Time. As of the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of
TransEnterix shall be closed, and there shall be no further registration of
transfers on the stock transfer books of TransEnterix of the shares of
TransEnterix Capital Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented
to TransEnterix, SafeStitch or the Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall
be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article II, except as otherwise
required by Legal Requirements.

 

(d) No Fractional Shares. No certificates or scrip representing fractional
shares of SafeStitch Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for
exchange of Certificates, no dividend or distribution of SafeStitch shall
relate to such fractional share interests and such fractional share interests
will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any rights of a stockholder
of SafeStitch but, in lieu thereof, each holder of such Certificate will be
entitled to a cash payment in accordance with the provisions of this Section
2.02(d). For purposes of calculating the amount of such cash payment (if any)
due to any former holder of TransEnterix Capital Stock, SafeStitch shall
aggregate the total number of shares of TransEnterix Capital Stock represented
by the Certificates surrendered by such holder and calculate the number of
whole shares of SafeStitch Common Stock issuable based on such aggregate
number. If, after such aggregation, any fractional share of

 



-7-   TransEnterix Common Stock would otherwise be issuable to such holder, then
such holder shall instead be entitled to receive, in lieu of such fractional
share, an amount in cash equal to the product of such fraction _multiplied
by_ the SafeStitch Trading Price, without interest thereon. At the Effective
Time, SafeStitch shall deposit with the Exchange Agent as part of the Exchange
Fund an amount in cash equal to the estimated amount required to pay for all
such fractional shares. If at any time during the term of the Exchange Fund,
there shall be insufficient cash to pay for fractional shares, then, upon
notice thereof by the Exchange Agent to SafeStitch, SafeStitch shall promptly
deposit with the Exchange Agent an amount in cash necessary to pay the amounts
so required in respect of such fractional shares.

(e) Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates for one year after
the Effective Time shall be delivered to SafeStitch, upon demand, and any
holders of the Certificates who have not theretofore complied with this
Article II shall thereafter look only to SafeStitch for payment of their claim
for Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of
SafeStitch Common Stock, in each case in accordance with this Agreement, and
any dividends or distributions with respect to SafeStitch Common Stock
issuable to such holders as Merger Consideration in accordance with this
Agreement. 

(f) No Liability. None of SafeStitch, TransEnterix, Merger Sub, the Surviving
Corporation or the Exchange Agent or any of their respective directors,
officers, employees and agents shall be liable to any Person in respect of any
shares of SafeStitch Common Stock, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of
SafeStitch Common Stock or any cash from the Exchange Fund, in each case
delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Legal Requirements. If any Certificate shall not have been
surrendered prior to five years after the Effective Time (or immediately prior
to such earlier date on which any Merger Consideration, or any cash payable
to the holder of such Certificate formerly representing TransEnterix Capital
Stock pursuant to this Article II, would otherwise escheat to or become the
property of any Governmental Entity), any such Merger Consideration, or such
cash for fractional shares shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Legal
Requirements, become the property of SafeStitch, free and clear of all claims
or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

(g) Withholding Rights. SafeStitch and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from any Merger Consideration payable pursuant to this
Agreement to any Person who was a holder of TransEnterix Capital Stock
immediately prior to the Effective Time such amounts as SafeStitch and the
Exchange Agent may be required to deduct and withhold with respect to the
making of such payment under the Code or any other provision of applicable
federal, state, local or foreign tax Legal Requirements. To the extent that
amounts are so withheld by SafeStitch or the Exchange Agent and duly paid
over to the applicable taxing authority, such withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person
to whom such consideration would otherwise have been paid.

 

(h) Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been
lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by
the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by SafeStitch, the posting by such Person

 



-8-   of a bond in such reasonable amount as SafeStitch may direct as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of
fractional shares, in each case pursuant to this Agreement.

(i) Adjustments to Prevent Dilution. In the event that TransEnterix changes
the number of shares of TransEnterix Capital Stock or securities convertible
or exchangeable into or exercisable for shares of TransEnterix Capital Stock,
or SafeStitch changes the number of shares of SafeStitch Common Stock or
securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for shares of
SafeStitch Common Stock, issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time,
in each case as a result of a reclassification, stock split (including a
reverse stock split), stock dividend or distribution, subdivision, exchange or
readjustment of shares, or other similar transaction, the Exchange Ratio shall
be ratably adjusted; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this Section
2.02(i) shall be deemed to permit or authorize any party hereto to effect any
such change that it is not otherwise authorized or permitted to undertake
pursuant to this Agreement.

(j) Legends. The shares of SafeStitch Common Stock issued as Stock Merger
Consideration pursuant to this Agreement will not be registered under the
Securities Act or the securities laws of any State, and each certificate
evidencing any such shares of SafeStitch Common Stock shall bear a restrictive
legend substantially in the following form:

provides health benefits that are not fully insured through an insurance
contract.

(e) No Post-Employment Obligations. Except as set forth in Section 3.11(e) of
the TransEnterix Disclosure Letter, no TransEnterix Employee Plan or
TransEnterix Employee Agreement provides, or reflects or represents any
material liability to provide post-termination or retiree welfare benefits to
any person for any reason, except as may be required by COBRA or other
applicable Legal Requirements.

(f) Effect of Transaction. Except as set forth on Section 3.11(f) of the
TransEnterix Disclosure Letter, the execution of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will not (either alone
or upon the occurrence of any additional or subsequent events) constitute an
event under any TransEnterix Employee Plan or TransEnterix Employee Agreement

otherwise), acceleration, forgiveness of indebtedness, vesting, distribution,
increase in benefits or obligation to fund benefits with respect to any
TransEnterix Employee.

Legal Requirements, or collective bargaining agreements or arrangements
respecting employment, employment practices, terms and conditions of
employment, Tax withholding, prohibited discrimination, equal employment,
fair employment practices, immigration status, employee safety and health,
and wages and hours, except for those conflicts, defaults or violations that,
individually or in the aggregate, would not be material, individually or in
the aggregate, to TransEnterix.

(h) Labor. TransEnterix is not a party to any collective bargaining agreement
or union contract with respect to TransEnterix Employees and no collective
bargaining agreement is being negotiated by TransEnterix. There is no labor
dispute, strike or work stoppage against TransEnterix pending or, to the

to the Knowledge of TransEnterix, threatened against TransEnterix, relating to
any labor, safety or discrimination matters involving any TransEnterix
Employee, including, without limitation, charges of material unfair labor
practices or discrimination complaints.

 

(i) Section 409A. Each "nonqualified deferred compensation plan" (as such term
is defined in Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code) to which TransEnterix is a
party complies in all material respects with the requirements of paragraph
(2), (3) and (4) of Section 409A(a) by its terms and has been operated in
accordance with such requirements.

 



-18-  Section 3.12. Real Property. TransEnterix does not own any real
property. Section 3.12 of the TransEnterix Disclosure Letter sets forth a
list of the real property currently leased, subleased or licensed by or from

default by TransEnterix, nor, to the Knowledge of TransEnterix, by and other
party thereto. There are no other parties occupying, or with a right to
occupy, the TransEnterix Leased Real Property other than TransEnterix. The

tear excepted).

 

Section 3.13. Assets. With respect to the machinery, equipment, furniture,
fixtures and other tangible property and assets purported to be owned, leased
or used by TransEnterix, TransEnterix owns, or has a valid leasehold interest
in, all such assets free and clear of all Liens, except Permitted Liens, and
such assets are in good operating condition (normal wear and tear excepted).
The assets owned or leased by TransEnterix constitute all of the personal
property reasonably necessary for TransEnterix to carry on its business as
currently conducted. For purposes of clarity, this Section 3.13 does
not relate to real property (such items being the subject of Section 3.12) or
Intellectual Property (such items being the subject of Section 3.08).

Section 3.14. Environmental Matters. Except as would not reasonably be
expected to result in a material liability to TransEnterix, (i) TransEnterix
is in compliance with all Environmental Laws; (ii) TransEnterix has not
received any written notice of any claim or order alleging TransEnterixs
violation of, or liability under any Environmental Law which has not
heretofore been cured; and (iii) there is no action or proceeding pending, or
to the Knowledge of TransEnterix, threatened against TransEnterix alleging
TransEnterixs failure to comply with Environmental Laws. The parties agree
that the only representations and warranties of TransEnterix in this
Agreement which relate to Environmental Laws or Hazardous Materials are those
contained in this Section 3.14.

a list of all TransEnterix Material Contracts to which TransEnterix is a party
or is bound by as of the date hereof.

 



-19-  (b) No Breach. Each TransEnterix Material Contract is a legal, valid,
binding agreement, and all TransEnterix Material Contracts are enforceable
against TransEnterix and, to the Knowledge of TransEnterix, against the other
parties thereto except in each case (i) as enforcement may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and
other Legal Requirements affecting the rights of creditors generally and
general equitable principles (whether considered in a proceeding in equity or
at law), and (ii) as the remedy of specific performance and injunctive and
other forms of equitable relief may be subject to equitable defenses and to
the discretion of a court of competent jurisdiction before which any
proceeding may be brought. TransEnterix has not materially violated any
provision of any TransEnterix Material Contract, or committed or failed to
perform any act which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both would
constitute a material default under the provisions of any TransEnterix
Material Contract.

applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods indicated and with each
other. The SafeStitch Financial Statements present fairly the financial
condition and operating results of SafeStitch and its consolidated

pursuant to the Securities Act or the Exchange Act with the SEC since January
1, 2010 (as such documents have since the time of their filing been amended or
supplemented, the "SafeStitch SEC Reports"). As of their respective dates,
after giving effect to any amendments or supplements thereto, the SafeStitch
SEC Reports (A) complied as to form in all material respects with the
requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, as the case may be,
and, to the extent applicable, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 ("SOX"), and
(B) did not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. The SafeStitch Financial Statements complied as to form in all
material respects with the published rules and regulations of the SEC with
respect thereto in effect at the time of filing or furnishing the applicable
SafeStitch SEC Report.

(i) Each of the principal executive officer of SafeStitch and the principal

disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and
15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to provide reasonable assurance that all
information required to be disclosed by SafeStitch in the reports that it
files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms
and is accumulated and communicated to SafeStitchs management as appropriate
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure, and (y) has
disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation of internal control over
financial reporting, to SafeStitchs outside auditors and the audit committee
of the Board of Directors of SafeStitch (A) all significant deficiencies and
material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over
financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect
SafeStitchs ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
information and (B) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves
management or other employees who have a significant role in SafeStitchs
internal control over financial reporting. Since December 31, 2009, any
material change in internal control over financial reporting required to be
disclosed in any SafeStitch SEC Report has been so disclosed.

Section 6.05. Stock Options; Stock Plans.

 

(a) At the Effective Time, each TransEnterix Stock Option, whether vested or
unvested, shall be assumed by SafeStitch and converted into an option to
acquire, on the same terms and conditions as were applicable under such
TransEnterix Stock Option, including vesting, a number of shares of SafeStitch
Common Stock equal to the number of shares of TransEnterix 

 



-44-   Common Stock subject to such TransEnterix Stock Option immediately before
the Effective Time _multiplied by_ the Exchange Ratio (rounded down to the
nearest whole share) at an exercise price per share of SafeStitch Common
Stock equal to the exercise price per share under such TransEnterix Stock
Option _divided by_ the Exchange Ratio (rounded up to the nearest cent) (each,
as so adjusted, a "TransEnterix Adjusted Option"). The exercise price of the
TransEnterix Adjusted Option, the number of shares purchasable pursuant to
such option and the terms and conditions of exercise of such option shall be
determined in order to comply with Section 409A of the Code, and _provided_ ,
_further_ that in the case of any TransEnterix Stock Option to which Section
421 of the Code applies by reason of its qualification under Section 422 of
the Code, the exercise price of the option, the number of shares purchasable
pursuant to such option and the terms and conditions of exercise of such
option shall be determined in order to comply with Section 424 of the Code.
Following the Effective Time, SafeStitch will issue to each person who,
immediately prior to the Effective Time, was a holder of a TransEnterix Stock
Option a document evidencing the foregoing assumption of such option by
SafeStitch. To the extent that a TransEnterix Stock Option qualified as an
incentive stock option as defined in Section 422 of the Code prior to the
Effective Time, it is the intention of the parties that such TransEnterix
Stock Option so assumed by SafeStitch shall continue to qualify following the
Effective Time as an incentive stock option to the extent permitted under
Section 422 of the Code.

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Board of Directors of TransEnterix (or,
if appropriate, any committee administering the TransEnterix equity incentive
plans under which outstanding TransEnterix Stock Options were granted) shall
adopt such resolutions or take such other actions as may be required to
effect the foregoing.

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, TransEnterix shall deliver to the holders of
TransEnterix Stock Options appropriate notices setting forth such holders
rights pursuant to the respective plans and this Agreement.

 

(d) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger, the TransEnterix Stock
Plans shall be assumed by SafeStitch, with the result that all obligations of
TransEnterix under the TransEnterix Stock Plans, including with respect to
awards outstanding at the Effective Time under each TransEnterix Stock Plan,
shall be obligations of SafeStitch following the Effective Time. Prior to
the Effective Time, SafeStitch shall take all necessary actions for the
assumption of the TransEnterix Stock Plans, including the reservation and
issuance of SafeStitch Common Stock in a number at least equal to the number
of shares of SafeStitch Common Stock that will be subject to TransEnterix
Adjusted Options. As promptly as practicable following the Effective Time,
SafeStitch shall prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement on
Form S-8 (or another appropriate form) registering a number of shares of
SafeStitch Common Stock determined in accordance with the preceding sentence.
Such registration statement shall be kept effective (and the current status of
the prospectus or prospectuses required thereby shall be maintained) at least
for so long as TransEnterix Adjusted Options remain outstanding.

 



-45-  Section 6.06. Employee Matters.

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, the SafeStitch Employee Plans and the
TransEnterix Employee Plans in effect as of the date of this Agreement and at
the Effective Time shall remain in effect in accordance with their respective
terms with respect to employees and former employees of SafeStitch or
TransEnterix and their Subsidiaries (the "Newco Employees"), respectively,
covered by such Employee Plans at the Effective Time, until such time as
SafeStitch and TransEnterix together shall otherwise determine, subject to
applicable Legal Requirements and the terms of such plans. Prior to the
Effective Time, SafeStitch and TransEnterix shall cooperate in reviewing,
evaluating and analyzing SafeStitch Employee Plans and TransEnterix Employee
Plans with a view towards maintaining appropriate Employee Plans for Newco
Employees.

 

(b) With respect to any Employee Plans in which any Newco Employees who are
employees of SafeStitch or TransEnterix (or their Subsidiaries) prior to the
Effective Time first become eligible to participate on or after the Effective
Time, and in which such Newco Employees did not participate prior to the
Effective Time (the "New Plans"), SafeStitch shall, or shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, use reasonable best efforts, subject to applicable Legal
Requirements, to: (i) waive all pre-existing conditions, exclusions and
waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements
applicable to the Newco Employees and their eligible dependents under any New
Plans in which such employees may be eligible to participate after the
Effective Time, except to the extent such pre-existing conditions, exclusions
or waiting periods would apply under the analogous Employee Plan, as the case
may be; (ii) provide each Newco Employee and their eligible dependents with
credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid prior to the Effective Time
under a Employee Plan (to the same extent that such credit was given under
the analogous Employee Plan prior to the Effective Time) in satisfying any
applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under any New Plans in
which such employees may be eligible to participate after the Effective Time;
and (iii) recognize all service of the Newco Employees with TransEnterix and
SafeStitch, and their respective affiliates, for all purposes (including, for
purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting credit, entitlement
to benefits, and, except with respect to defined benefit pension plans,
benefit accrual) in any New Plan in which such employees may be eligible to
participate after the Effective Time, including any severance plan, to the
extent such service is taken into account under the applicable New Plan;
_provided_ that the foregoing shall not apply to the extent it would result in
duplication of benefits.

(c) SafeStitch shall retain and otherwise provide benefits and severance pay
to those employees named on Section 6.06(c) of the SafeStitch Disclosure
Letter (the "SafeStitch Specified Employees") in accordance with the terms
set forth in Section 6.06(c) of the SafeStitch Disclosure Letter.

(d) Prior to the Effective Time, the Compensation Committee of SafeStitchs
Board of Directors shall take such action as is necessary to provide for the
immediate vesting as of the Effective Time of all SafeStitch Stock Options,
except as set forth in Section 6.06(d) of the SafeStitch Disclosure Letter.

(e) Without limiting the generality of Section 9.06, the provisions of this
Section 6.06 are solely for the benefit of the parties to this Agreement, and
no current or former director, officer, employee or independent contractor or
any other person shall be a third-party beneficiary of this Agreement, and
nothing herein shall be construed as an amendment to any Employee Plan or
other compensation or benefit plan or arrangement for any purpose.

 



-46-  Section 6.07. Treatment of TransEnterix Warrants. At the Effective Time,
each TransEnterix Warrant shall be assumed by SafeStitch and converted into a
warrant to acquire, on the same terms and conditions as were applicable under
such TransEnterix Warrant, a number of shares of SafeStitch Common Stock equal
to the number of shares of TransEnterix Common Stock subject to such
TransEnterix Warrant immediately before the Effective Time _multiplied by_ the
Exchange Ratio (rounded down to the nearest whole share) at an exercise price
per share of SafeStitch Common Stock equal to the exercise price per share
under such TransEnterix Warrant _divided by_ the Exchange Ratio (rounded up to
the nearest cent).

Section 6.08. Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance.

(a) Each of SafeStitch, Merger Sub and TransEnterix agrees that, to the
fullest extent permitted under applicable Legal Requirements, all rights to
indemnification, advancement and exculpation from liabilities for acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time now existing in favor
of the current or former directors and officers of such entity, or any person
who comes to serve in such capacity prior to the Effective Time, as provided
in such entitys certificate or certificate of incorporation, by-laws or
other agreements providing indemnification, advancement or exculpation shall
survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance
with their terms, and no such provision in any certificate or certificate of
incorporation, by-laws (or comparable organizational document) or other
agreement shall be amended, modified or repealed in any manner that would
adversely affect the rights or protections thereunder to any such individual
with respect to acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time. From and after the Effective Time, SafeStitch shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, honor and perform, in
accordance with their respective terms, each of the covenants contained in
this Section 6.08 without limit as to time.

(b) For six years after the Effective Time, SafeStitch shall maintain in
effect the directors and officers liability (and fiduciary) insurance
policies currently maintained by TransEnterix covering acts or omissions
occurring on or prior to the Effective Time with respect to those persons who
are currently covered by TransEnterixs respective directors and officers
liability insurance policies on terms with respect to such coverage and in
amounts no less favorable than those set forth in the relevant policy in
effect on the date of this Agreement; _provided_ that the annual cost thereof
shall not exceed 300% of the annual cost of such policies as of the date
hereof. If such no less favorable insurance coverage cannot be maintained for
such cost, SafeStitch shall maintain the most advantageous policies of
directors and officers insurance otherwise obtainable for such cost. Prior
to the Effective Time, TransEnterix may, with SafeStitchs prior written
consent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed, purchase a six-year tail prepaid policy on terms and conditions no
less advantageous to the TransEnterix Indemnified Parties, or any other person
entitled to the benefit of Section 6.08(a) and (b), as applicable, than the

 



-47-   existing directors and officers liability insurance maintained by
TransEnterix, covering without limitation the transactions contemplated
hereby; _provided_ that the aggregate cost thereof shall not exceed 300% of
the annual cost of the directors and officers liability insurance maintained
by TransEnterix as of the date hereof. If such tail prepaid policy has been
obtained by TransEnterix prior to the Effective Time, it shall satisfy the
obligations set forth in the first two sentences of this paragraph (b) and
SafeStitch shall, after the Effective Time, maintain such policy in full force
and effect, for its full term, and continue to honor its obligations
thereunder.

(c) From and after the Effective Time, subject to applicable Legal
Requirements, SafeStitch will cause the Surviving Corporation to indemnify
and hold harmless each present director and officer of TransEnterix (in each
case, for acts or failures to act in such capacity), determined as of the date
hereof, and any person who becomes such a director or officer between the
date hereof and the Effective Time (collectively, the "TransEnterix
Indemnified Parties"), against any costs or expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees, costs and expenses), judgments, fines, losses, claims,
damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, arising out of matters existing or occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
Effective Time (including any matters arising in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement), to the fullest extent permitted
by applicable Legal Requirements (and SafeStitch will cause the Surviving
Corporation to also advance expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees,
costs and expenses) as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable Legal Requirements; _provided_ that if required by applicable
Legal Requirements the person to whom expenses are advanced provides an
undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such
person is not entitled to indemnification); and _provided_ ,  _further_ ,
that any determination as to whether a TransEnterix Indemnified Party is
entitled to indemnification or advancement of expenses hereunder pursuant to
applicable Legal Requirements shall be made by independent counsel jointly
selected by the Surviving Corporation and such TransEnterix Indemnified
Party.

(d) At or prior to the Effective Time, SafeStitch shall obtain, and shall
thereafter maintain, at SafeStitchs expense, a directors and officers runoff
(or "tail") liability insurance policy for SafeStitch for a period of six (6)
years immediately following the Effective Time, covering acts or omissions
occurring on or prior to the Effective Time with respect to those persons who
are currently covered by SafeStitchs directors and officers liability
insurance policy on terms with respect to such coverage and in amounts no
less favorable than those set forth in such policy in effect on the date of
this Agreement; _provided_ that the annual cost thereof shall not exceed 300%
of the annual cost of such policies as of the date hereof. If such no less
favorable insurance coverage cannot be maintained for such cost, SafeStitch
shall maintain the most advantageous policies of directors and officers
insurance otherwise obtainable for such cost.

 

(e) The obligations of SafeStitch and the Surviving Corporation under this
Section 6.08 shall not be terminated or modified by such parties in a manner
so as to adversely affect any TransEnterix Indemnified Party, or any other
person entitled to the benefit of Section 6.08(a), (b) or (d), as the case may
be, to whom this Section 6.08 applies without the consent of the affected
TransEnterix Indemnified Party, or such other person, as the case may be. If
SafeStitch, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or
assigns (i) shall consolidate with or 

 



-48-   merge into any other corporation or entity and shall not be the continuing
or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii)
shall transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
individual, corporation or other entity, then, and in each such case, proper
provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns of SafeStitch or
the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume all of the
obligations of SafeStitch, or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be,
set forth in this Section 6.08.

 

(f) The provisions of Section 6.08 are (i) intended to be for the benefit of,
and will be enforceable by, each indemnified party, his or her heirs and his

that any such person may have by contract or otherwise.

with the Merger, this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring such fees or expenses, whether

with each other before issuing, and provide each other the reasonable
opportunity to review, comment upon and concur with, any press release or
other public statements with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the Merger, and shall not issue any such press release or
make any such public statement prior to such consultation, except as any
party, after consultation with counsel, determines is required by applicable
Legal Requirements.

 

Section 6.11. Stockholder Litigation. Each of TransEnterix and SafeStitch
shall give the other the reasonable opportunity to consult concerning the
defense of any stockholder litigation against TransEnterix or SafeStitch, as
applicable, or any of their respective directors or officers relating to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Neither party shall settle any
such litigation without the prior consent of the other party, not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

Section 6.12. Tax-Free Reorganization Treatment. The parties to this Agreement
intend that the Merger will qualify as a reorganization under Section 368(a)

8.02 and Article IX, which provisions shall survive such termination, and

in this Agreement to an Article, Section or Exhibit, such reference shall be
to an Article or Section of, or an Exhibit to, this Agreement unless otherwise
indicated. The table of contents and headings contained in this Agreement are
for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement.

(a) Whenever the words "include", "includes" or "including" are used in this
Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words without
limitation. The words "hereof," "herein" and "hereunder" and words of similar
import when used in this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as a whole
and not to any particular provision of this Agreement. All terms defined in
this Agreement shall have the defined meanings when used in any certificate
or other document made or delivered pursuant hereto unless otherwise defined
therein. The definitions contained in this Agreement are applicable to the
singular as well as the plural forms of such terms and to the masculine as
well as to the feminine and neuter genders of such terms. Any agreement,
instrument or statute defined or referred to herein or in any agreement or
instrument that is referred 

 



-64-   to herein means such agreement, instrument or statute as from time to time

section of a disclosure letter need not be set forth in any other section of
the disclosure letter so long as its relevance to the latter section of
the disclosure letter is readily apparent on the face of the information
disclosed in the disclosure letter to the person to which such disclosure is
being made. The fact that any item of information is disclosed in a disclosure
letter to this Agreement shall not be construed to mean that such information
is required to be disclosed by this Agreement, that such information is
material, constitutes or has resulted in or would reasonably be expected to
result in a Material Adverse Effect or is outside the ordinary course of
business. Such information and the dollar thresholds set forth herein shall
not be used as a basis for interpreting the terms "material", Material Adverse
Effect" or other similar terms in this Agreement.

this Agreement.

TransEnterix Indemnified Parties and such other persons who are entitled to
the benefit of Section 6.08(a), (b) or Section 6.08(d), as the case may be),
and except for the rights of TransEnterixs stockholders to receive the Merger
Consideration after the Effective Time in the event the Merger is
consummated, are not intended to confer upon any Person other than the parties
any rights or remedies. The representations and warranties in this Agreement
are the product of negotiations among the parties and are for the sole benefit
of the parties. Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are
subject to waiver by the parties in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement without notice or liability to any other person. The representations
and warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation among the
parties of risks associated with particular matters regardless

 



-65-   of the knowledge of any of the parties and may have been qualified by
certain disclosures not reflected in the text of this Agreement. Accordingly,
persons other than the parties may not rely upon the representations and
warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of actual facts or
circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any other date.

Section 9.07. Representations.

Each party hereto agrees that, except for the representations and warranties
contained in Article III and Article IV of this Agreement, neither
TransEnterix, SafeStitch or Merger Sub makes any other representations or
warranties and each hereby disclaims any other representations or warranties
made by itself or any of its Representatives, with respect to the execution
and delivery of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Merger, notwithstanding the delivery or disclosure to any other
party or any other partys Representatives of any document or other
information with respect to any one or more of the foregoing. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, and notwithstanding any otherwise express
representations and warranties made by the parties in this Agreement, each of
the parties agrees that none of the other parties makes or has made any
representation or warranty with respect to (i) any projections, forecasts,
estimates, plans or budgets or future revenues, expenses or expenditures,
future results of operations (or any component thereof), future cash flows (or
any component thereof) or future financial condition (or any component
thereof) of such party or the future business, operations or affairs of such
party heretofore or hereafter delivered to or made available to it, or (ii)
any other information, statements or documents heretofore or hereafter
delivered to or made available to it with respect to such party or the
business, operations or affairs of such party, except to the extent and as
expressly covered by a representation and warranty made in this Agreement.

Section 9.08. Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of

of laws.

Section 9.09. Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned, in whole or
in part, by operation of law or otherwise by any of the parties hereto without
the prior written consent of the other party. Any attempted or purported
assignment in violation of the preceding sentence shall be null and void and
of no effect whatsoever. Subject to the preceding two sentences, this
Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable
by, the parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

Section 9.10. Enforcement.

 

(a) The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur and that the parties
would not have any adequate remedy at law in the event that any of the
provisions of this Agreement

 



-66-   were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, without the
necessity of posting bonds or similar undertakings in connection therewith,
this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law
or in equity.

(b) Each of the parties (i) irrevocably submits itself to the personal
jurisdiction of each state or federal court sitting in the State of Delaware,
as well as to the jurisdiction of all courts to which an appeal may be taken
from such courts, in any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating
to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated herein, (ii) agrees
that every such suit, action or proceeding shall be brought, heard and
determined exclusively in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (
_provided_ that, in the event subject matter jurisdiction is unavailable in
or declined by the Court of Chancery, then all such claims shall be brought,
heard and determined exclusively in any other state or federal court sitting
in the State of Delaware), (iii) agrees that it shall not attempt to deny or
defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from
such court, (iv) agrees not to bring any suit, action or proceeding arising
out of or relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated
herein in any other court, and (v) waives any defense of inconvenient forum to
the maintenance of any suit, action or proceeding so brought.

(c) Each of the parties agrees that service of any process, summons, notice or
document by U.S. registered mail to its address set forth in Section 9.02
shall be effective service of process for any action, suit or proceeding
brought against it, _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing contained in the
foregoing clause shall affect the right of any party to serve legal process in
any other manner permitted by applicable Legal Requirements. 

Section 9.11. Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect. Upon such determination that any
term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced,
the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so
as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements in an acceptable
manner to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to
the extent possible.

 

Section 9.12. Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT KNOWINGLY AND
VOLUNTARILY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LEGAL
REQUIREMENTS, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY
ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT.
