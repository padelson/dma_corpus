2015, between WEYERHAEUSER COMPANY, a Washington corporation (" _Weyerhaeuser_
"), and PLUM CREEK TIMBER COMPANY, INC., a Delaware corporation (" _Plum

WHEREAS the Board of Directors of Plum Creek has approved and declared
advisable and resolved to recommend to Plum Creeks stockholders the adoption
of this Agreement and the merger of Plum Creek with and into Weyerhaeuser upon
the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement;

 

WHEREAS the Board of Directors of Weyerhaeuser has (i) approved and adopted
this Agreement and the merger of Plum Creek with and into Weyerhaeuser upon
the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and
resolved to recommend this Agreement to Weyerhaeusers shareholders and (ii)
recommended the approval by its shareholders of the issuance of common shares

the State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ ") and the Business Corporation Act of the
State of Washington (the " _WBCA_ "), on the Closing Date Plum Creek shall be
merged with and into Weyerhaeuser (the " _Merger_ "). At the Effective Time,

a date to be specified by Weyerhaeuser and Plum Creek, which shall be no
later than the second Business Day following the satisfaction or (to the
extent permitted by Law) waiver by the party or parties entitled to the
benefits thereof of the conditions set forth in Article VII (other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by Law) waiver of
those conditions), 

 



1  or at such other place, time and date as may be agreed in writing between
Weyerhaeuser and Plum Creek; _provided_ , _however_ , that if all the
conditions set forth in Article VII have not been satisfied or (to the extent
permitted by Law) waived by such second Business Day, then the Closing shall
take place on the second Business Day after which all such conditions have
been satisfied or (to the extent permitted by Law) waived. The date on which
the Closing occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the " _Closing Date_ ".

SECTION 1.03.  _Effective Time._ Subject to the provisions of this Agreement,
as soon as practicable on the Closing Date, the parties shall (i) file with
the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware a certificate of merger
relating to the Merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ "), executed and

relating to the Merger (the " _Articles of Merger_ "), executed and
acknowledged in accordance with the relevant provisions of the WBCA, and (iii)
make all other filings required under the DGCL and the WBCA or by the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or the Secretary of State of the
State of Washington in connection with the Merger. The Merger shall become
effective at the time that the Certificate of Merger has been duly filed with
the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware and the Articles of Merger
have been duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Washington,
or at such later time as Weyerhaeuser and Plum Creek shall agree and specify
in the Certificate of Merger and the Articles of Merger (the time the Merger
becomes effective being the " _Effective Time_ ").

SECTION 1.04. _Effects._ The Merger shall have the effects set forth in this
Agreement and the applicable provisions of the DGCL and the WBCA.

SECTION 1.05. _Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws._ The articles of
incorporation of Weyerhaeuser, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time, shall be the articles of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation
until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law.
The bylaws of Weyerhaeuser, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time, shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter
changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law.

 

SECTION 1.06. _Directors and Officers of Surviving Corporation._ The directors
and executive officers of the Surviving Corporation shall be determined in
accordance with _Exhibit A_.

 



2 ARTICLE II

 

 _Effect on the Capital Stock of the Constituent Entities; Exchange of
Certificates_

 

SECTION 2.01. _Effect on Capital Stock._ At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of Weyerhaeuser, Plum Creek or
any holder of any of the following securities:

(a) _Cancelation of Treasury Stock._ Each share of common stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of Plum Creek (" _Plum Creek Common Stock_ ") that is owned
by Plum Creek as treasury stock immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease
to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

(b) _Conversion of Plum Creek Common Stock._ Subject to Section 2.02, each
share of Plum Creek Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time (other than shares to be canceled in accordance with
Section 2.01(a)) shall be converted into and shall thereafter represent the
right to receive that number of fully paid and nonassessable common shares,
par value $1.25 per share, of Weyerhaeuser (the " _Weyerhaeuser Common Shares_
") equal to the Exchange Ratio (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). All such
shares of Plum Creek Common Stock, when so converted, shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and
each holder of a certificate that immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented any such shares of Plum Creek Common Stock (each such certificate,
a " _Certificate_ ") or shares of Plum Creek Common Stock held in direct
registration form (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") shall cease to have any rights
with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration and
any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Weyerhaeuser Common Shares to be
issued or paid in consideration therefor and any dividends or other
distributions to which holders become entitled in accordance with Section
2.02, in each case, without interest. For purposes of this Agreement, the "
_Exchange Ratio_ " means 1.60. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if between the
date of this Agreement and the Effective Time the outstanding Weyerhaeuser
Common Shares or shares of Plum Creek Common Stock shall have been changed
into a different number of shares or a different class, by reason of any stock
dividend, recapitalization, split, reverse split, combination, consolidation,
subdivision, reclassification or exchange of shares, or any similar event
(including any stock dividend for the purpose of distributing earnings so as
to maintain qualification as a REIT or to cure any issue of qualification as
a REIT) shall have occurred, then any number or amount contained herein that
is based upon the number of Weyerhaeuser Common Shares or shares of Plum Creek
Common Stock, as the case may be, will be appropriately adjusted to provide
to Weyerhaeuser and the holders of Plum Creek Common Stock the same economic
effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that this sentence shall not be construed to permit Weyerhaeuser
or Plum Creek to take any action with respect to its securities that is
prohibited by Section 5.01(a) or 5.01(b), as applicable.

 



3 SECTION 2.02. _Exchange._ (a) _Exchange Agent._ Prior to the Effective
Time, Weyerhaeuser shall appoint a bank or trust company reasonably
acceptable to Plum Creek to act as exchange agent (the " _Exchange Agent_ ")
for the payment of the Merger Consideration. At or prior to the Effective
Time, Weyerhaeuser shall deposit with the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of
the former holders of Plum Creek Common Stock entitled to receive Merger
Consideration under Section 2.01(b), for exchange in accordance with this
Article II through the Exchange Agent, a sufficient number of Weyerhaeuser
Common Shares (whether represented in certificated or non-certificated direct
registration form) to issue the aggregate Merger Consideration. From time to
time as needed as reasonably determined by Weyerhaeuser, Weyerhaeuser shall
deposit with the Exchange Agent cash sufficient to make payments in lieu of
fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.02(f) and to pay any dividends or
other distributions which former holders of Plum Creek Common Stock have the
right to receive pursuant to Section 2.02(d). All such cash and Weyerhaeuser
Common Shares deposited with the Exchange Agent is hereinafter referred to as
the " _Exchange Fund_ ".

 

(b) _Letter of Transmittal_. As promptly as practicable after the Effective
Time, and in any event not later than the second Business Day thereafter,
Weyerhaeuser shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record
of Plum Creek Common Stock a form of letter of transmittal (the " _Letter of
Transmittal_ ") which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk
of loss and title to any Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall pass, only
upon delivery of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares to the Exchange Agent
and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Weyerhaeuser
may specify subject to Plum Creeks reasonable approval, together with
instructions thereto.

(c) _Merger Consideration Received in Connection with Exchange._ (i) After
the Effective Time, upon the surrender of a Certificate for cancelation to the
Exchange Agent, together with the Letter of Transmittal, duly completed and
validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other
documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of
such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (A) the
Merger Consideration into which the shares of Plum Creek Common Stock
previously represented by such Certificate have been converted pursuant to
Section 2.01(b) and (B) any cash in lieu of fractional shares which such
holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.02(f) and in respect of
any dividends or other distributions which such holder has the right to
receive pursuant to Section 2.02(d). In the event of a transfer of ownership
of Plum Creek Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of
Plum Creek, the proper number of Weyerhaeuser Common Shares pursuant to
Section 2.01 and cash in lieu of fractional shares which the holder has the
right to receive pursuant to Section 2.02(f) and in respect 

 



4  of any dividends or other distributions which the holder has the right to
receive pursuant to Section 2.02(d) may be issued to a transferee if the
Certificate (or, for Book-Entry Shares, proper evidence of such transfer)
representing such Plum Creek Common Stock is presented to the Exchange Agent,
accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and
by evidence that any applicable stock transfer Taxes have been paid. Until
surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.02(c), each Certificate or Book-
Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent
only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration which
the holder of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares were entitled to receive
pursuant to Section 2.01 (and cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to
Section 2.02(f) and in respect of any dividends or other distributions
pursuant to Section 2.02(d)). No interest shall be paid or shall accrue on
the cash payable under this Section 2.02(c) or under Section 2.02(d), 2.02(e)
or 2.02(f).

 

(ii) As promptly as practicable following the Effective Time, the Exchange
Agent shall deliver to each former holder of Book-Entry Shares (A) the Merger
Consideration into which such shares of Plum Creek Common Stock have been
converted pursuant to Section 2.01(b) and (B) any cash in lieu of fractional
shares which such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section
2.02(f). The Weyerhaeuser Common Shares deliverable to any holder under this
Section 2.02(c)(ii) shall be deemed issued to such holder on the Closing Date.

 

(d) _Treatment of Unexchanged Shares._ No dividends or other distributions
declared or made with respect to Weyerhaeuser Common Shares with a record
date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
Certificate or Book-Entry Share with respect to the Weyerhaeuser Common Shares
issuable upon surrender thereof, and no cash payment in lieu of
fractional shares shall be paid to any such holder pursuant to Section
2.02(f), until the surrender of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share in
accordance with this Article II. Subject to abandoned property, escheat, Tax
or other applicable Law, following surrender of any such Certificate or Book-
Entry Share, there shall be paid to the holder of the Weyerhaeuser Common
Shares issued in exchange therefor (i) at the time of such surrender, the
amount of any cash payable in lieu of a fractional Weyerhaeuser Common Share
to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.02(f) and the amount of
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time
previously paid with respect to such whole shares of Weyerhaeuser Common
Shares and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or
other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to
such surrender and a payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with
respect to such whole shares of Weyerhaeuser Common Shares.

(e) _No Further Ownership Rights in Plum Creek Common Stock._ The
Weyerhaeuser Common Shares issued and cash paid in accordance with the terms
of this Article II upon conversion of any shares of Plum Creek Common Stock
(including

 



5  any cash paid pursuant to Section 2.02(f)) shall be deemed to have been
issued and paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares
of Plum Creek Common Stock, subject to the Surviving Corporations obligation
to pay any dividends or other distributions with a record date prior to the
Effective Time that may have been declared or made by Plum Creek on such
shares of Plum Creek Common Stock in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement and which remain unpaid at the Effective Time. From and after the
Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers on the
stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Plum Creek
Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.
Subject to the last sentence of Section 2.02(h), if, after the Effective Time,
any Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented for transfer to the
Surviving Corporation, Weyerhaeuser or the Exchange Agent for any reason,
they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article II.

(f) _No Fractional Shares._ No certificates or scrip representing fractional
Weyerhaeuser Common Shares shall be issued upon the conversion of Plum Creek
Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.01(b), and such fractional share interests
shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any rights of a holder of
Weyerhaeuser Common Shares. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, each holder of shares of Plum Creek Common Stock converted pursuant
to the Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of
a Weyerhaeuser Common Share (after taking into account all Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares surrendered by such holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof,
cash in an amount equal to such fractional amount multiplied by the average
of the volume weighted average price per share of Weyerhaeuser Common Shares
on the New York Stock Exchange (" _NYSE_ ") (as reported by Bloomberg, L.P.
or, if not reported by Bloomberg, L.P., in another authoritative source
mutually selected by Weyerhaeuser and Plum Creek) on each of the five
consecutive trading days ending with the last complete trading day prior to
the Closing Date.

 

(g) _Termination of Exchange Fund._ Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including any interest or other amounts received with respect thereto) that
remains undistributed to the holders of Plum Creek Common Stock for 12 months
after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Weyerhaeuser, upon demand, and
any former holder of Plum Creek Common Stock who has not previously
complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to Weyerhaeuser for,
and Weyerhaeuser shall remain liable for, payment of its claim for Merger
Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares and any dividends and
other distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to this Article
II.

(h) _No Liability._ None of Weyerhaeuser, Plum Creek or the Exchange Agent
shall be liable to any Person in respect of any portion of the Exchange Fund
delivered to any Governmental Entity pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate or Book-Entry Share has
not been

 



6  surrendered or transferred prior to the date on which any Merger
Consideration in respect thereof would otherwise escheat to, or become the
property of, any Governmental Entity pursuant to applicable Law, any Merger
Consideration in respect of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of Weyerhaeuser, free
and clear of all claims or interests of any Person previously entitled
thereto.

(i) _Investment of Exchange Fund._ The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash in
the Exchange Fund as directed by Weyerhaeuser. Any interest and other income
resulting from such investments shall be paid to Weyerhaeuser; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that no investment of the Exchange Fund shall relieve Weyerhaeuser
or the Exchange Agent from promptly making the payments required by this
Article II, and following any losses from any such investment, Weyerhaeuser
shall promptly provide additional cash funds to the Exchange Agent for the
benefit of the holders of shares of Plum Creek Common Stock at the Effective
Time in the amount of such losses, which additional funds will be deemed to be
part of the Exchange Fund.

(j) _Withholding Rights._ Each of Weyerhaeuser and the Exchange Agent

any holder of Plum Creek Common Stock, Plum Creek Stock Options, Plum Creek
Restricted Stock Units, Plum Creek Deferred Stock Units or Plum Creek Value
Management Awards such amounts as may be required to be deducted and withheld
with respect to the making of such payment under applicable Tax Law. Amounts
so withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority shall be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Plum
Creek Common Stock in respect of which such deduction or withholding was
made.

(k) _Lost Certificates._ If any Certificate has been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by
Weyerhaeuser, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable and
customary amount as Weyerhaeuser may direct, as indemnity against any claim
that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange
Agent (or, if subsequent to the termination of the Exchange Fund and subject
to Section 2.02(h), Weyerhaeuser) shall deliver and pay, in exchange for such
lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration, any cash in
lieu of fractional shares and any other cash deliverable in respect thereof

 _Representations and Warranties of Weyerhaeuser_

 

Weyerhaeuser represents and warrants to Plum Creek that the statements
contained in this Article III are true and correct, except (i) as set forth
in the Weyerhaeuser Reporting Documents publicly available and filed with or
furnished to the SEC after January 1, 2014 and at least two Business Days
prior to the date of this Agreement (the " _Filed Weyerhaeuser Reporting
Documents_ ") (excluding (x) any exhibits to the Filed Weyerhaeuser Reporting
Documents and (y) any disclosures in the Filed Weyerhaeuser Reporting
Documents (A) in any risk factors section, (B) in the "Forward-Looking
Statements" section and (C) in any other disclosures that are similarly
predictive or forward-looking in nature) or (ii) as set forth in the
disclosure letter delivered by Weyerhaeuser to Plum Creek prior to
the execution and delivery by Weyerhaeuser of this Agreement (the "
_Weyerhaeuser Disclosure Letter_ "). The Weyerhaeuser Disclosure Letter shall
be arranged in numbered and lettered sections corresponding to the numbered
and lettered sections contained in this Article III, and the disclosure in
any section shall be deemed to qualify other sections in this Article III to
the extent (and only to the extent) that it is reasonably apparent from the
face of such disclosure that such disclosure also qualifies or applies to
such other sections.

SECTION 3.01. _Organization, Standing and Power._  (a) Each of Weyerhaeuser
and each of Weyerhaeusers Subsidiaries (the " _Weyerhaeuser Subsidiaries_ ")
is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
jurisdiction in which it is organized (in the case of good standing, to the
extent such jurisdiction recognizes such concept), except, in the case of the
Weyerhaeuser Subsidiaries, where the failure to be so organized, existing or
in good standing, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have a Weyerhaeuser Material Adverse Effect. Each of
Weyerhaeuser and each Weyerhaeuser Subsidiary is duly qualified or licensed to
do business in each jurisdiction where the nature of its business or
the ownership, operation or leasing of its properties and assets makes such
qualification necessary, other than in such jurisdictions where the failure to
be so qualified or licensed, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and
would not reasonably be expected to have a Weyerhaeuser Material Adverse
Effect. Weyerhaeuser has made available to Plum Creek, prior to execution of
this Agreement, true and complete copies of the articles of incorporation of
Weyerhaeuser in effect as of the date of this Agreement (the " _Weyerhaeuser
Charter_ ") and the bylaws of Weyerhaeuser in effect as of the date of this

Subsidiary or by Weyerhaeuser and another Weyerhaeuser Subsidiary, free and
clear of all pledges, liens, claims, charges, mortgages, encumbrances and
security interests of any kind or nature whatsoever (collectively, " _Liens_
"), and free of any other restriction (including any restriction on the right
to vote, sell or otherwise dispose of such capital stock, voting securities or
other equity interests), except for restrictions imposed by applicable
securities Laws. Section 3.02(a) of the Weyerhaeuser Disclosure Letter sets
forth, as of the date of this Agreement, a true and complete list of the

that is a "qualified REIT subsidiary" within the meaning of Section 856(i)(2)
of the Code (a " _Qualified REIT Subsidiary_ ") or a "taxable REIT subsidiary"
within the meaning of Section 856(l) of the Code (a " _Taxable REIT
Subsidiary_ "), together with (i) the jurisdiction of incorporation or
organization, as the case may be, of each Weyerhaeuser Subsidiary, (ii) the

in each Weyerhaeuser Subsidiary, (iii) the names of and the type of and
percentage of interest held (including capital account balances for any
entity treated as a partnership for income tax purposes from the most recently
filed relevant Tax Return) by any Person other than Weyerhaeuser or a

the classification for U.S. federal income tax purposes of each Weyerhaeuser
Subsidiary.

(b) Except for the capital stock and voting securities of, and other equity
interests in, the Weyerhaeuser Subsidiaries, neither Weyerhaeuser nor any
Weyerhaeuser Subsidiary owns, directly or indirectly, any capital stock or

interest convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for, any capital
stock or voting securities of, or other equity interests in, any firm,
corporation, partnership, company, limited liability company, trust, joint
venture, association or other entity other than ordinary course investments
in publicly traded securities constituting one percent or less of a class of
outstanding securities of any entity.

(including the Weyerhaeuser Stock Plans). The Weyerhaeuser Common Shares
constituting the Merger Consideration will be, when issued, duly authorized,

deliver this Agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder and to consummate
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, subject,
in the case of the Share Issuance, to the receipt of the
Weyerhaeuser Shareholder Approval. The Board of Directors of Weyerhaeuser

Issuance be submitted to Weyerhaeusers shareholders for approval at a duly
held meeting of such shareholders for such purpose (the " _Weyerhaeuser
Shareholders Meeting_ ") (clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) being referred to as
the " _Weyerhaeuser Recommendation_ "). Such resolutions have not been amended

other corporate proceedings on the part of Weyerhaeuser are necessary to
authorize, adopt or approve this Agreement or to consummate the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (except for the filing of
the appropriate merger documents as required by the DGCL and the WBCA).

similar antitakeover statute or similar statute or regulation applies with
respect to this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement in respect of Weyerhaeuser.

 

SECTION 3.05. _No Conflicts; Consents._ (a) The execution and delivery by
Weyerhaeuser of this Agreement does not, and the performance by Weyerhaeuser
of its obligations hereunder and the consummation of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not, conflict with, or result
in any violation of or default (with or without notice or lapse of time, or
both) under, or give rise to a right of termination, cancelation or
acceleration of any obligation, any obligation to make an offer to purchase or
redeem any Indebtedness or capital stock, voting securities or other equity
interests or any loss of a material benefit under, or result in the creation
of any Lien upon any of the properties or assets of Weyerhaeuser or any
Weyerhaeuser Subsidiary under, any provision of (i) the Weyerhaeuser Charter,
the Weyerhaeuser By-laws or the comparable organizational documents of any
Weyerhaeuser Subsidiary that is a "significant subsidiary" as defined in Rule
1-02(w) of Regulation S-X under the Exchange Act (assuming that the
Weyerhaeuser Shareholder Approval is obtained), (ii) any contract, lease,
license, indenture, note, bond, agreement, concession, franchise or other
instrument (a " _Contract_ ") to which Weyerhaeuser or any Weyerhaeuser
Subsidiary is a party or by which any of their respective properties or
assets is bound or any Weyerhaeuser Permit or (iii) subject to the filings and
other matters referred to in

 



12  Section 3.05(b), any judgment, order or decree of a Governmental Entity or
arbitrator (" _Judgment_ ") or statute, law (including common law), ordinance,
rule or regulation, including the rules and regulations of the NYSE (" _Law_
"), in each case applicable to Weyerhaeuser or any Weyerhaeuser Subsidiary or
their respective properties or assets (assuming that the Weyerhaeuser
Shareholder Approval is obtained), other than, in the case of clauses (ii)
and (iii) above, any matters that, individually or in the aggregate, have not
had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Weyerhaeuser Material
Adverse Effect (it being agreed that for purposes of this Section 3.05(a),
effects resulting from or arising in connection with the matters set forth in
clause (iv) of the definition of the term "Material Adverse Effect" shall not
be excluded in determining whether a Weyerhaeuser Material Adverse Effect has
occurred or would reasonably be expected to occur) and would not prevent or
materially impede, interfere with, hinder or delay the consummation of the
Merger.

 

(b) No consent, waiver or Permit (" _Consent_ ") of or from, or registration,
declaration, notice or filing made to or with, any federal, national, state,
provincial or local, whether domestic or foreign, government or any court of
competent jurisdiction, administrative agency or commission or other
governmental authority or instrumentality, whether domestic, foreign
or supranational (a " _Governmental Entity_ "), is required to be obtained or
made by or with respect to Weyerhaeuser or any Weyerhaeuser Subsidiary in
connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement or its

business, (iv) such Consents, registrations, declarations, notices or filings
as are required to be made or obtained under the securities or "blue sky"
Laws of various states in connection with the issuance of the Merger
Consideration, (v) such Consents of or from, or registrations, declarations,
notices or filings to or with the NYSE as are required to permit the
consummation of the Merger and the listing of the Weyerhaeuser Common Shares
to be issued as Merger Consideration and (vi) such other matters that,
individually or in the aggregate, have not 

 



13  had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Weyerhaeuser Material
Adverse Effect (it being agreed that for purposes of this Section 3.05(b),
effects resulting from or arising in connection with the matters set forth in
clause (iv) of the definition of the term "Material Adverse Effect" shall not
be excluded in determining whether a Weyerhaeuser Material Adverse Effect has
occurred or would reasonably be expected to occur) and would not prevent or
materially impede, interfere with, hinder or delay the consummation of the
Merger.

SECTION 3.06. _Reporting Documents; Undisclosed Liabilities._ (a)
Weyerhaeuser has furnished or filed all reports, schedules, forms, statements
and other documents (including exhibits and other information incorporated
therein) required to be furnished or filed by Weyerhaeuser with the SEC since
January 1, 2013 (such documents, excluding the Joint Proxy Statement and the
Form S-4, being collectively referred to as the " _Weyerhaeuser Reporting
Documents_ ").

(b) Each Weyerhaeuser Reporting Document (i) at the time filed, complied
in all material respects with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of
2002 (" _SOX_ "), the Exchange Act and the Securities Act, as applicable to
such Weyerhaeuser Reporting Document and (ii) did not at the time it was filed
(or if amended or superseded by a filing or amendment prior to the date of
this Agreement, then at the time of such filing or amendment) contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required
to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Each of
the consolidated financial statements of Weyerhaeuser included in the
Weyerhaeuser Reporting Documents complied at the time it was filed as to form
in all material respects with applicable accounting requirements and the
published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, was prepared
in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles ("
_GAAP_ ") (except, as indicated in the notes thereto, in the case of unaudited
statements, as permitted by the rules and regulations of the SEC) applied on a
consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be indicated in
the notes thereto) and fairly presented in all material respects the
consolidated financial position of Weyerhaeuser and its consolidated
subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the consolidated results of their
operations and cash flows for the periods shown (subject, in the case of
unaudited statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments).

(c) Neither Weyerhaeuser nor any Weyerhaeuser Subsidiary has any liabilities
or obligations of any nature (whether accrued, absolute, contingent or
otherwise) that, individually or in the aggregate, have had or would
reasonably be expected to have a Weyerhaeuser Material Adverse Effect.

(d) Each of the principal executive officer of Weyerhaeuser and the principal
financial officer of Weyerhaeuser (or each former principal executive officer
of

 



14  Weyerhaeuser and each former principal financial officer of Weyerhaeuser)
has made all applicable certifications required by Rule 13a-14 or 15d-14 under
the Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906 of SOX with respect to the
Weyerhaeuser Reporting Documents, and the statements contained in such
certifications are true and correct. For purposes of this Agreement,
"principal executive officer" and "principal financial officer" shall have
the meanings given to such terms in SOX. Neither Weyerhaeuser nor any
Weyerhaeuser Subsidiary has outstanding, or has arranged any outstanding,
"extensions of credit" to directors or executive officers within the meaning
of Section 402 of SOX.

(e) Weyerhaeuser maintains a system of "internal control over financial
reporting" (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange
Act) sufficient to provide reasonable assurance (i) that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements
in conformity with GAAP, consistently applied, (ii) that transactions are
executed only in accordance with the authorization of management and (iii)
regarding prevention or timely detection of the unauthorized acquisition, use
or disposition of Weyerhaeusers properties or assets.

(f) The "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined in Rules
13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) utilized by Weyerhaeuser are
reasonably designed to ensure that all information (both financial and non-
financial) required to be disclosed by Weyerhaeuser in the reports that it
files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the
SEC and that all such information required to be disclosed is accumulated and
communicated to the management of Weyerhaeuser, as appropriate, to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to enable the principal
executive officer and principal financial officer of Weyerhaeuser to make the
certifications required under the Exchange Act with respect to such reports.

(g) Since January 1, 2014, none of Weyerhaeuser, Weyerhaeusers independent
accountants, the Weyerhaeuser Board or the audit committee of the
Weyerhaeuser Board has received any oral or written notification of any (i)
"significant deficiency" in the internal controls over financial reporting of
Weyerhaeuser, (ii) "material weakness" in the internal controls over
financial reporting of Weyerhaeuser or (iii) fraud, whether or not material,
that involves management or other employees of Weyerhaeuser who have a
significant role in the internal controls over financial reporting of
Weyerhaeuser. For purposes of this Agreement, the terms "significant
deficiency" and "material weakness" shall have the meanings assigned to them
in Auditing Standard No. 5 of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board,
as in effect on the date of this Agreement.

SECTION 3.07. _Information Supplied._  None of the information supplied or to
be supplied by Weyerhaeuser for inclusion or incorporation by reference in (i)
the Form S-4 will, at the time the Form S-4 is filed with the SEC, at any time
it is amended 

 



15  or supplemented or at the time it is declared effective under the Securities
Act, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading or (ii) the Joint Proxy Statement will, at
the date it is first mailed to each of Weyerhaeusers shareholders and Plum
Creeks stockholders or at the time of each of the Weyerhaeuser Shareholders
Meeting and the Plum Creek Stockholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, except that no
representation is made by Weyerhaeuser with respect to statements made or
incorporated by reference therein based on information supplied by Plum Creek
for inclusion or incorporation by reference therein.

SECTION 3.08. _Absence of Certain Changes or Events._ From January 1, 2015 to
the date of this Agreement, each of Weyerhaeuser and each Weyerhaeuser
Subsidiary has conducted its respective business in the ordinary course in all
material respects, and during such period there has not occurred:

corporation does not file Tax Returns that it is or may be subject to material

state or foreign Law).

would reasonably be expected to result in a challenge by the IRS or any other
Governmental Entity to its status as a REIT, and no such challenge is
pending or, to the Knowledge of Weyerhaeuser, threatened.

(f) Each Weyerhaeuser Subsidiary has been, since the later of its acquisition
or formation, and continues to be treated for federal and state Tax purposes

letter from the IRS or is entitled to rely upon a favorable opinion issued by
the IRS, and there are no circumstances or any events that have occurred that
would reasonably be expected to cause the loss of such qualification status of
any such Weyerhaeuser Benefit Plan, except where such loss of qualification
status would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to
have a Weyerhaeuser Material Adverse Effect. Except as would not, individually
or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Weyerhaeuser Material
Adverse Effect, there are no pending or, to the Knowledge of
Weyerhaeuser, threatened claims by, on behalf of or against any Weyerhaeuser
Benefit Plan or any trust related thereto that could result in any liability

proceeding by a Governmental Entity is pending or, to the Knowledge of
Weyerhaeuser, threatened with respect to any Weyerhaeuser Benefit Plan.

(b) With respect to each Weyerhaeuser Benefit Plan that is subject to Title
IV or Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 or 4971 of the Code, except for
matters that, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have a Weyerhaeuser Material Adverse Effect, (i) no
such Weyerhaeuser Benefit Plan is currently in "at risk status" within the
meaning of Section 430(i) of the Code or Section 303(i) of ERISA; (ii) neither

by Weyerhaeuser or any of the Weyerhaeuser Subsidiaries and (iv) all
contributions required to be made with respect thereto (whether pursuant to
the terms of such Weyerhaeuser Benefit Plan or by applicable Law) have been
made.

(c) None of Weyerhaeuser and its Subsidiaries nor any of their respective
ERISA Affiliates has, at any time during the last six years, maintained,
established, contributed to or been obligated to contribute to any plan that
is a "multiemployer plan" within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA (a
" _Multiemployer Plan_ ") or a plan that has two or more contributing
sponsors at least two of whom are not under common control, within the meaning
of Section 4063 of ERISA, and none of Weyerhaeuser and its Subsidiaries nor
any of their Commonly Controlled Entities has incurred any liability to a

Multiemployer Plan, as those terms are defined in Part I of Subtitle E of

Weyerhaeuser Material Adverse Effect, there is no demand or investigation by
or before any Governmental Entity pending or, to the Knowledge of
Weyerhaeuser, threatened alleging that Weyerhaeuser or any Weyerhaeuser
Subsidiary is not in compliance with any applicable Law or Weyerhaeuser Permit
or which challenges or questions the validity of any rights of the holder of
any Weyerhaeuser Permit. To the Knowledge of Weyerhaeuser, no noncompliance
with any applicable Law or Weyerhaeuser Permit exists, except for any
noncompliance that, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would
not reasonably be expected to have a Weyerhaeuser Material Adverse Effect.

this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement in respect of Plum Creek. 

SECTION 4.05. _No Conflicts; Consents._ (a) The execution and delivery by Plum
Creek of this Agreement does not, and the performance by Plum Creek of its
obligations hereunder and the consummation of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not, conflict with, or result
in any violation of or default (with or without notice or lapse of time, or
both) under, or give rise to a right of termination, cancelation or
acceleration of any obligation, any obligation to make an offer to purchase or
redeem any Indebtedness or capital stock, voting securities or other equity
interests or any loss of a material benefit under, or result in the creation
of any Lien upon any of the properties or assets of Plum Creek or any Plum

Creek By-laws or the comparable organizational documents of any Plum Creek

the matters set forth in clause (iv) of the definition of the term "Material
Adverse Effect" shall not be excluded in determining whether a Plum Creek
Material Adverse Effect has occurred or would reasonably be expected to occur)

the consummation of the Merger.

(b) No Consent of or from, or registration, declaration, notice or filing
made to or with, any Governmental Entity is required to be obtained or made by

term "Material Adverse Effect" shall not be excluded in determining whether a
Plum Creek Material Adverse Effect has occurred or would reasonably be

(b) Each Plum Creek Reporting Document (i) at the time filed, complied in all
material respects with the requirements of SOX, the Exchange Act and the
Securities Act, as applicable to such Plum Creek Reporting Document and (ii)

filing or amendment) contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading. Each of the consolidated financial statements of
Plum Creek included in the Plum Creek Reporting Documents complied at the time
it was filed as to form in all material respects with applicable accounting
requirements and the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect
thereto, was prepared in accordance with GAAP (except, as indicated in the
notes thereto, in the case of unaudited statements, as permitted by the rules
and regulations of the SEC) applied on a consistent basis during the periods
involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto) and fairly
presented in all material respects the consolidated financial position of Plum
Creek and its consolidated subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the
consolidated results of their operations and cash flows for the periods shown
(subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to normal year-end audit
adjustments).

 

(c) Neither Plum Creek nor any Plum Creek Subsidiary has any liabilities or
obligations of any nature (whether accrued, absolute, contingent or
otherwise) that, individually or in the aggregate, have had or would
reasonably be expected to have a Plum Creek Material Adverse Effect.

Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906 of SOX with respect to the Plum Creek
Reporting Documents, and the statements contained in such certifications are
true and correct. Neither Plum Creek nor any Plum Creek Subsidiary has
outstanding, or has arranged any outstanding, "extensions of credit" to
directors or executive officers within the meaning of Section 402 of SOX.

 



32 (e) Plum Creek maintains a system of "internal control over financial
reporting" (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange
Act) sufficient to provide reasonable assurance (i) that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
conformity with GAAP, consistently applied, (ii) that transactions are
executed only in accordance with the authorization of management and (iii)
regarding prevention or timely detection of the unauthorized acquisition, use
or disposition of Plum Creeks properties or assets.

(f) The "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e)
and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) utilized by Plum Creek are reasonably
designed to ensure that all information (both financial and non-financial)
required to be disclosed by Plum Creek in the reports that it files or
submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and that
all such information required to be disclosed is accumulated and communicated
to the management of Plum Creek, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure and to enable the principal executive officer
and principal financial officer of Plum Creek to make the certifications
required under the Exchange Act with respect to such reports.

(g) Since January 1, 2014, none of Plum Creek, Plum Creeks independent
accountants, the Plum Creek Board or the audit committee of the Plum Creek
Board has received any oral or written notification of any (i) "significant

Plum Creek or (iii) fraud, whether or not material, that involves management
or other employees of Plum Creek who have a significant role in the internal
controls over financial reporting of Plum Creek.

SECTION 4.07. _Information Supplied._ None of the information supplied or to
be supplied by Plum Creek for inclusion or incorporation by reference in (i)
the Form S-4 will, at the time the Form S-4 is filed with the SEC, at any time
it is amended or supplemented or at the time it is declared effective under
the Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading or (ii) the Joint Proxy Statement will, at
the date it is first mailed to each of Weyerhaeusers shareholders and Plum
Creeks stockholders or at the time of each of the Weyerhaeuser Shareholders
Meeting and the Plum Creek Stockholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, except that
no representation is made by Plum Creek with respect to statements made or
incorporated by reference therein based on information supplied by
Weyerhaeuser for inclusion or incorporation by reference therein.

 



33 SECTION 4.08. _Absence of Certain Changes or Events._ From January 1, 2015 to
the date of this Agreement, each of Plum Creek and each Plum Creek Subsidiary
has conducted its respective business in the ordinary course in all material

Subsidiary has timely filed, taking into account any extensions, all material
Tax Returns required to have been filed and such Tax Returns are accurate and

audit or examination by any taxing authority, and no written (or, to the
Knowledge of Plum Creek, oral) notice of such an audit or examination has been

(c) Other than for Taxes not yet due and delinquent or that are being
contested in good faith in appropriate proceedings, there are no Liens with
respect to material Taxes against any of the properties or assets of Plum
Creek or any Plum Creek Subsidiary. No written or, to the Knowledge of Plum
Creek, other claim has been received by Plum Creek or any Plum Creek
Subsidiary from an authority in a jurisdiction where such corporation does not
file Tax Returns that it is or may be subject to material taxation by such
jurisdiction. Neither Plum Creek nor any Plum Creek Subsidiary is a party
to or is otherwise bound by any material Tax sharing, allocation or

35 (d) Neither Plum Creek nor any Plum Creek Subsidiary has participated in or
been a party to a transaction that, as of the date of this Agreement,

Plum Creek

 



36  Material Adverse Effect. Each Plum Creek Benefit Plan that is intended to be
"qualified" within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code has received a
favorable determination letter from the IRS or is entitled to rely upon a
favorable opinion issued by the IRS, and there are no circumstances or any
events that have occurred that would reasonably be expected to cause the loss
of such qualification status of any such Plum Creek Benefit Plan, except
where such loss of qualification status would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Plum Creek Material Adverse
Effect. Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
be expected to have a Plum Creek Material Adverse Effect, there are no
pending or, to the Knowledge of Plum Creek, threatened claims by, on behalf of
or against any Plum Creek Benefit Plan or any trust related thereto that could
result in any liability to Plum Creek or any of the Plum Creek Subsidiaries,
and no audit or other proceeding by a Governmental Entity is pending or, to
the Knowledge of Plum Creek, threatened with respect to any Plum Creek Benefit
Plan.

 

(d) With respect to each Plum Creek Benefit Plan that is subject to Title IV
or Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 or 4971 of the Code, except for
matters that, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have a Plum Creek Material Adverse Effect, (i) no
such Plum Creek Benefit Plan is currently in "at risk status" within the
meaning of Section 430(i) of the Code or Section 303(i) of ERISA; (ii) neither
Plum Creek nor any Commonly Controlled Entity has engaged in any transaction
described in Section 4069, 4204(a) or 4212(c) of ERISA; (iii) no liability

with respect thereto (whether pursuant to the terms of such Plum Creek Benefit
Plan or by applicable Law) have been made.

 

(e) None of Plum Creek and its Subsidiaries nor any of their respective ERISA
Affiliates has, at any time during the last six years, maintained,
established, contributed to or been obligated to contribute to any
Multiemployer Plan or a plan that has two or more contributing sponsors at
least two of whom are not under common control, within the meaning of Section
4063 of ERISA, and none of Plum Creek and its Subsidiaries nor any of their
Commonly Controlled Entities has incurred any liability to a Multiemployer
Plan as a result of a complete or partial withdrawal from such Multiemployer
Plan, as those terms are defined in Part I of Subtitle E of Title IV of
ERISA.

(f) Section 4.10(f) of the Plum Creek Disclosure Letter sets forth each Plum
Creek Benefit Plan and Plum Creek Benefit Agreement that provides health,
medical or life insurance or other welfare benefits (whether or not insured)

termination of employment, other than

 



37  coverage or benefits (i) required to be provided under Part 6 of Title I of
ERISA, Section 4980(B)(f) of the Code or any other applicable Law or (ii) the
full cost of which is borne by such Plum Creek Personnel (or any of their

either party of its obligations hereunder or the consummation of the Merger

conjunction with any other event, including any termination of employment on
or following the Effective Time) will (i) entitle any Plum Creek Personnel to
any material compensation or benefit, (ii) accelerate the time of payment or
vesting, or trigger any payment or funding, of any material compensation or
benefit or trigger any other material obligation under any Plum Creek Benefit
Plan or Plum Creek Benefit Agreement, (iii) result in any breach or violation
of, or default under, or limit Plum Creeks right to extend, renew, replace,
amend, modify or terminate, any Plum Creek Benefit Plan or Plum Creek Benefit
Agreement or (iv) result in any payment (whether in cash or property or the
vesting of property) that could, individually or in combination with any other
such payment, subject any Person to Section 4999 of the Code or result in the
non-deductibility of any payment under Section 280G of the Code. No Plum Creek
Benefit Plan or Plum Creek Benefit Agreement provides for the gross-up or
reimbursement of Taxes under Section 4999 of the Code, Section 409A of the
Code or otherwise.

SECTION 4.11. _Labor and Employment Matters._ (a) As of the date of this

SECTION 5.02. _No Solicitation by Weyerhaeuser; Weyerhaeuser Board
Recommendation._ (a) Weyerhaeuser shall, and shall instruct its Affiliates
and its and their respective Representatives to, immediately cease and cause
to be terminated all

 



54  existing discussions or negotiations with any Person conducted heretofore
with respect to any Weyerhaeuser Takeover Proposal or any inquiry or proposal
that may reasonably be expected to lead to a Weyerhaeuser Takeover Proposal,
request the prompt return or destruction of all confidential information
previously furnished to any such Person or its Representatives and immediately
terminate all physical and electronic data room access previously granted to
any such Person or its Representatives. From the date of this Agreement until
the earlier of the Effective Time or the date of the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with Article VIII, Weyerhaeuser shall not, nor
shall it authorize any of its Affiliates or any of its or their respective
directors, officers or employees or any of their respective investment
bankers, accountants, attorneys or other advisors, agents or representatives
(collectively, " _Representatives_ ") to, (i) directly or indirectly solicit,
initiate, or knowingly encourage or facilitate any Weyerhaeuser Takeover
Proposal or any inquiry or proposal that may reasonably be expected to lead to
a Weyerhaeuser Takeover Proposal or (ii) enter into or participate in any
discussions or negotiations with, or furnish any information with respect to,
or cooperate in any way with any Person who is seeking to make or has made a
Weyerhaeuser Takeover Proposal with respect to any Weyerhaeuser Takeover
Proposal or any inquiry or proposal that may reasonably be expected to lead to
a Weyerhaeuser Takeover Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time
prior to obtaining the Weyerhaeuser Shareholder Approval, in response to a
bona fide written Weyerhaeuser Takeover Proposal that the Weyerhaeuser Board
determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel and a
financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) constitutes or
is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Weyerhaeuser Proposal, and which
Weyerhaeuser Takeover Proposal was made after the date of this Agreement and
did not otherwise result from a material breach of the non-solicitation
provisions of this Section 5.02(a), Weyerhaeuser may (and may authorize the
Weyerhaeuser Subsidiaries and its and their respective Representatives to),
subject to compliance with Section 5.02(c), (x) furnish information with
respect to Weyerhaeuser and the Weyerhaeuser Subsidiaries to the Person
making such Weyerhaeuser Takeover Proposal (and its Representatives) (
_provided_ that all such information has previously been provided to Plum
Creek or is provided to Plum Creek prior to or substantially concurrent with
the time it is provided to such Person) pursuant to a customary
confidentiality agreement not less restrictive of such Person than the
Confidentiality Agreement; _provided_ that such confidentiality agreement
shall not be required to contain standstill provisions (a " _Weyerhaeuser
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement_ ") and (y) participate in discussions
regarding the terms of such Weyerhaeuser Takeover Proposal and the negotiation
of such terms with, and only with, the Person making such Weyerhaeuser
Takeover Proposal (and such Persons Representatives). Without limiting the
foregoing, it is agreed that any violation of, or the taking of any action
inconsistent with, the restrictions set forth in this Section 5.02(a) by (x)
any controlled Affiliate of Weyerhaeuser or (y) any other Affiliates of
Weyerhaeuser or any of its or their Representatives which violation or action
was known or should have been known by Weyerhaeuser, in each case shall
constitute a breach of this Section 5.02(a) by Weyerhaeuser.

 



55 (b) Except as set forth below, neither the Weyerhaeuser Board nor any
committee thereof shall (i) (A) withdraw (or modify in any manner adverse to
Plum Creek), or propose publicly to withdraw (or modify in any manner adverse
to Plum Creek), the Weyerhaeuser Recommendation or (B) adopt, approve,
recommend or declare advisable, or propose publicly to adopt, approve,
recommend or declare advisable, any Weyerhaeuser Takeover Proposal (any action
in this clause (i) being referred to as a " _Weyerhaeuser Adverse
Recommendation Change_ ") or (ii) approve, recommend or declare advisable, or
propose publicly to approve, recommend or declare advisable, or allow
Weyerhaeuser or any of its Affiliates to execute or enter into, any letter of
intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, merger
agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement,
alliance agreement, partnership agreement or other similar or comparable
Contract (each, an " _Acquisition Agreement_ ") (other than a
Weyerhaeuser Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement) constituting or relating
to, or that is intended to or would reasonably be expected to lead to, any
Weyerhaeuser Takeover Proposal, or requiring, or reasonably expected to cause,
Weyerhaeuser to abandon, terminate, delay or fail to consummate, or that
would otherwise prevent or materially impede, interfere with, hinder or delay
the consummation of, or be inconsistent with, the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or requiring, or reasonably
expected to cause, Weyerhaeuser to fail to comply with this Agreement in any
material respect. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to
obtaining the Weyerhaeuser Shareholder Approval, the Weyerhaeuser Board may
make a Weyerhaeuser Adverse Recommendation Change if Weyerhaeuser receives a
Superior Weyerhaeuser Proposal or the Weyerhaeuser Board determines in good
faith (after consultation with outside counsel and a financial advisor of
nationally recognized reputation) that the failure to do so would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Weyerhaeuser shall not be entitled to exercise its right to
make a Weyerhaeuser Adverse Recommendation Change in connection with a
Weyerhaeuser Takeover Proposal or a Superior Weyerhaeuser Proposal until after
the fifth Business Day following Plum Creeks receipt of written notice (a "
_Weyerhaeuser Notice of Recommendation Change_ ") from Weyerhaeuser advising
Plum Creek that the Weyerhaeuser Board intends to take such action, including
the terms and conditions of any Weyerhaeuser Takeover Proposal or Superior
Weyerhaeuser Proposal that is the basis of the proposed action by the
Weyerhaeuser Board (it being understood and agreed that any amendment to the
financial terms or any other material term of such Weyerhaeuser Takeover
Proposal or Superior Weyerhaeuser Proposal shall require a new
Weyerhaeuser Notice of Recommendation Change, except that references to the
five Business Day period above shall be deemed to be references to a three
Business Day period). In determining whether to make a Weyerhaeuser Adverse
Recommendation Change, the Weyerhaeuser Board shall take into account any
changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Plum Creek in response to a
Weyerhaeuser Notice of Recommendation Change or otherwise.

 



56 (c) In addition to the obligations of Weyerhaeuser set forth in Sections
5.02(a) and 5.02(b), Weyerhaeuser shall promptly (and in any event within one
Business Day of receipt thereof by Weyerhaeuser) advise Plum Creek in writing
of any Weyerhaeuser Takeover Proposal that may reasonably be expected to lead
to a Weyerhaeuser Takeover Proposal, the material terms and conditions of any
such Weyerhaeuser Takeover Proposal (including any changes thereto) and the
identity of the Person making any such Weyerhaeuser Takeover Proposal.
Weyerhaeuser shall (i) keep Plum Creek informed in all material respects of
the status and details (including any change to the terms thereof) of any
Weyerhaeuser Takeover Proposal and (ii) provide to Plum Creek as soon as
practicable after receipt or delivery thereof copies of all written and
electronic materials that describe any Weyerhaeuser Takeover Proposal and any
material amendments thereto exchanged between Weyerhaeuser or any of the
Weyerhaeuser Subsidiaries or any of its or their Representatives and any
Person who describes any of the terms or conditions of any Weyerhaeuser
Takeover Proposal.

(d) Nothing contained in this Section 5.02 shall prohibit Weyerhaeuser from
(i) complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange
Act or issuing a "stop-look-and-listen" communication pursuant to Rule
14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii) making any disclosure to
the shareholders of Weyerhaeuser if, in the good faith judgment of the
Weyerhaeuser Board (after consultation with outside counsel) failure to so
disclose would be inconsistent with its duties under applicable Law; 
_provided_ , _however_ , that (x) in no event shall Weyerhaeuser or the
Weyerhaeuser Board or any committee thereof take, or agree or resolve to take,
any action prohibited by Section 5.02(b) and (y) that any such
disclosure pursuant to clause (i) or (ii) that relates to a Weyerhaeuser
Takeover Proposal shall be deemed to be a Weyerhaeuser Adverse Recommendation
Change unless (1) the Weyerhaeuser Board expressly reaffirms the Weyerhaeuser
Recommendation in such disclosure or (2) such disclosure is a "stop-look-and-
listen" communication pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange
Act.

 

(e) For purposes of this Agreement:

 

" _Weyerhaeuser Takeover Proposal_ " means any proposal or offer (whether or
not in writing) made by any Person or Persons other than Plum Creek or any of
its Affiliates, with respect to any (i) merger, amalgamation, consolidation,
share exchange, other business combination, recapitalization or similar
transaction involving Weyerhaeuser or any Weyerhaeuser Subsidiary, (ii) sale,
lease, contribution or other disposition, directly or indirectly (including by
way of merger, amalgamation, consolidation, share exchange, other business
combination, recapitalization, partnership, joint venture, sale of capital
stock or

 



57  voting securities of, or other equity interests in, a Weyerhaeuser
Subsidiary or otherwise) of any business or assets of Weyerhaeuser or the
Weyerhaeuser Subsidiaries representing 15% or more of the consolidated
revenues, consolidated net income or consolidated assets of Weyerhaeuser or
securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for or representing
15% or more of the total outstanding voting power of Weyerhaeuser, (iii)
transaction in which any Person (or the stockholders of any Person) shall
acquire, directly or indirectly, beneficial ownership, or the right to acquire
beneficial ownership, or formation of any group which beneficially owns or has
the right to acquire beneficial ownership of, 15% or more of the total
outstanding voting power of Weyerhaeuser or (iv) combination of the foregoing
(in each case, other than the Merger). Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this definition, the Granite Sale, and any proposal or offer
relating thereto, shall not constitute a Weyerhaeuser Takeover Proposal.

 

" _Superior Weyerhaeuser Proposal_ " means any binding bona fide written offer
that did not result from a material breach of the non-solicitation provisions
of Section 5.02(a) made by a third party or group pursuant to which such third
party (or in a merger or consolidation involving such party, the stockholders
of such third party) or group would acquire, directly or indirectly, more
than 50% of the Weyerhaeuser Common Shares or all or substantially all of the
assets of Weyerhaeuser and the Weyerhaeuser Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
(i) on terms which the Weyerhaeuser Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with outside counsel and a financial advisor) to be more
favorable from a financial point of view to the holders of Weyerhaeuser Common
Shares than the Merger, taking into account all the material terms and
conditions of such offer (including the material legal, financial and
regulatory aspects of the proposal) and this Agreement (including any changes
proposed by Plum Creek to the terms of this Agreement) and (ii) that is
otherwise reasonably capable of being consummated on the terms proposed
taking into account all material legal, financial, regulatory and other
aspects of such proposal.

 

SECTION 5.03. _No Solicitation by Plum Creek; Plum Creek Board
Recommendation._ (a) Plum Creek shall, and shall instruct its Affiliates and
its and their respective Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be
terminated all existing discussions or negotiations with any Person conducted
heretofore with respect to any Plum Creek Takeover Proposal or any inquiry
or proposal that may reasonably be expected to lead to a Plum Creek Takeover
Proposal, request the prompt return or destruction of all confidential
information previously furnished to any such Person or its Representatives and
immediately terminate all physical and electronic data room access previously
granted to any such Person or its Representatives. From the date of this
Agreement until the earlier of the Effective Time or the date of the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with Article VIII, Plum Creek
shall not, nor shall it authorize

 



58  any of its Affiliates or any of its or their respective Representatives to,
(i) directly or indirectly solicit, initiate, or knowingly encourage or
facilitate any Plum Creek Takeover Proposal or any inquiry or proposal that
may reasonably be expected to lead to a Plum Creek Takeover Proposal or (ii)
enter into or participate in any discussions or negotiations with, or furnish
any information with respect to, or cooperate in any way with any Person who
is seeking to make or has made a Plum Creek Takeover Proposal with respect to
any Plum Creek Takeover Proposal or any inquiry or proposal that may
reasonably be expected to lead to a Plum Creek Takeover
Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to obtaining the
Plum Creek Stockholder Approval, in response to a bona fide written Plum Creek
Takeover Proposal that the Plum Creek Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with outside counsel and a financial advisor of nationally
recognized reputation) constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a
Superior Plum Creek Proposal, and which Plum Creek Takeover Proposal was made
after the date of this Agreement and did not otherwise result from a material
breach of the non-solicitation provisions of this Section 5.03(a), Plum Creek
may (and may authorize the Plum Creek Subsidiaries and its and their
respective Representatives to), subject to compliance with Section 5.03(c),
(x) furnish information with respect to Plum Creek and the Plum Creek
Subsidiaries to the Person making such Plum Creek Takeover Proposal (and its
Representatives) ( _provided_ that all such information has previously been
provided to Weyerhaeuser or is provided to Weyerhaeuser prior to or
substantially concurrent with the time it is provided to such Person) pursuant
to a customary confidentiality agreement not less restrictive of such Person
than the Confidentiality Agreement; _provided_ that such confidentiality
agreement shall not be required to contain standstill provisions (a " _Plum
Creek Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement_ ") and (y) participate in
discussions regarding the terms of such Plum Creek Takeover Proposal and the
negotiation of such terms with, and only with, the Person making such Plum
Creek Takeover Proposal (and such Persons Representatives). Without limiting
the foregoing, it is agreed that any violation of, or the taking of any
action inconsistent with, the restrictions set forth in this Section 5.03(a)
by (x) any controlled Affiliate of Plum Creek or (y) any other Affiliates of
Plum Creek or any of its or their Representatives which violation or action
was known or should have been known by Plum Creek, in each case shall
constitute a breach of this Section 5.03(a) by Plum Creek.

thereof shall (i) (A) withdraw (or modify in any manner adverse to
Weyerhaeuser), or propose publicly to withdraw (or modify in any manner
adverse to Weyerhaeuser), the Plum Creek Recommendation or (B) adopt, approve,
recommend or declare advisable, or propose publicly to adopt,
approve, recommend or declare advisable, any Plum Creek Takeover Proposal
(any action in this clause (i) being referred to as a " _Plum Creek Adverse
Recommendation Change_ ") or (ii) approve, recommend or declare advisable, or
propose publicly to approve, recommend or declare advisable, or allow Plum
Creek or any of its Affiliates to execute or enter into, any Acquisition

lead to, any Plum Creek Takeover Proposal, or requiring, or reasonably
expected to cause, Plum Creek to abandon, terminate, delay or fail to
consummate, or that would otherwise prevent or materially impede, interfere
with, hinder or delay the consummation of, or be inconsistent with, the Merger
or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or
requiring, or reasonably expected to cause, Plum Creek to fail to comply with
this Agreement in any material respect. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any
time prior to obtaining the Plum Creek Stockholder Approval, the Plum Creek
Board may make a Plum Creek Adverse Recommendation Change if Plum Creek
receives a Superior Plum Creek Proposal or the Plum Creek Board determines in
good faith (after consultation with outside counsel and a financial advisor of
nationally recognized reputation) that the failure to do so would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Plum Creek shall not be entitled to exercise its right to
make a Plum Creek Adverse Recommendation Change in connection with a Plum
Creek Takeover Proposal or a Superior Plum Creek Proposal until after the
fifth Business Day following Weyerhaeusers receipt of written notice (a "
_Plum Creek Notice of Recommendation Change_ ") from Plum Creek advising
Weyerhaeuser that the Plum Creek Board intends to take such action, including
the terms and conditions of any Plum Creek Takeover Proposal or Superior Plum
Creek Proposal that is the basis of the proposed action by the Plum
Creek Board (it being understood and agreed that any amendment to the
financial terms or any other material term of such Plum Creek Takeover
Proposal or Superior Plum Creek Proposal shall require a new Plum Creek Notice
of Recommendation Change, except that references to the five Business Day
period above shall be deemed to be references to a three Business Day period).
In determining whether to make a Plum Creek Adverse Recommendation Change, the
Plum Creek Board shall take into account any changes to the terms of this
Agreement proposed by Weyerhaeuser in response to a Plum Creek Notice of
Recommendation Change or otherwise.

 

(c) In addition to the obligations of Plum Creek set forth in Sections 5.03(a)
and 5.03(b), Plum Creek shall promptly (and in any event within one Business
Day of receipt thereof by Plum Creek) advise Weyerhaeuser in writing of any
Plum Creek Takeover Proposal that may reasonably be expected to lead to a Plum
Creek Takeover Proposal, the material terms and conditions of any such Plum
Creek Takeover Proposal (including any changes thereto) and the identity of
the Person making any such Plum Creek Takeover Proposal. Plum Creek shall (i)
keep Weyerhaeuser informed in all material respects of the status and
details (including any change to the terms thereof) of any Plum Creek
Takeover Proposal and (ii) provide to Weyerhaeuser as soon as practicable
after receipt or delivery thereof copies of all written and electronic
materials that describe any Plum Creek Takeover Proposal and any material
amendments thereto exchanged between Plum Creek or any of the Plum Creek
Subsidiaries or any of its or their Representatives and any Person who
describes any of the terms or conditions of any Plum Creek Takeover Proposal.

 



60 (d) Nothing contained in this Section 5.03 shall prohibit Plum Creek from (i)
complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act or
issuing a "stop-look-and-listen" communication pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f)
promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii) making any disclosure to
the stockholders of Plum Creek if, in the good faith judgment of the Plum
Creek Board (after consultation with outside counsel) failure to so disclose
would be inconsistent with its duties under applicable Law; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that (x) in no event shall Plum Creek or the Plum Creek Board or
any committee thereof take, or agree or resolve to take, any action prohibited
by Section 5.03(b) and (y) that any such disclosure pursuant to clause (i)
or (ii) that relates to a Plum Creek Takeover Proposal shall be deemed to be
a Plum Creek Adverse Recommendation Change unless (1) the Plum Creek Board
expressly reaffirms the Plum Creek Recommendation in such disclosure or (2)
such disclosure is a "stop-look-and-listen" communication pursuant to Rule
14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act.

(e) For purposes of this Agreement:

" _Plum Creek Takeover Proposal_ " means any proposal or offer (whether or not
in writing) made by any Person or Persons other than Weyerhaeuser or any of

agrees that its obligations pursuant to this Section 6.01 shall not be
affected by the commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or
communication to Plum Creek of any Plum Creek Takeover Proposal or by the
making of any Plum Creek Adverse Recommendation Change by the Plum Creek
Board. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
if Plum Creek reasonably believes, after consulting with its outside counsel
and Weyerhaeuser, that (i) it is necessary to postpone or adjourn the Plum

Plum Creek within a reasonable amount of time in advance of the Plum Creek
Stockholders Meeting or (ii) (A) it will not receive proxies sufficient to
obtain the Plum Creek Stockholder Approval, whether or not a quorum is

this Agreement and the Merger.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
provisions of this Section 6.03 shall not be construed to (i) require
Weyerhaeuser or any Weyerhaeuser Subsidiary or Plum Creek or any Plum Creek
Subsidiary or (ii) permit Plum Creek or any Plum Creek Subsidiary without the
prior written consent of Weyerhaeuser, to undertake any efforts or to take

before December 31, 2014 and that is outstanding as of immediately prior to

proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, with
respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective

asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time as provided in
Plum Creeks or such Plum Creek Subsidiarys respective certificates of
incorporation or by-laws (or comparable organizational documents) as in effect
on the date of this Agreement and any indemnification or other similar
agreements of Plum Creek or any Plum Creek Subsidiary, in each case as in
effect on the date of this Agreement and a true and

 



71  complete copy of which has been made available to Weyerhaeuser prior to the
date of this Agreement, shall be assumed by Weyerhaeuser in the Merger,
without further action as of the Effective Time, and shall continue in full

former directors and officers who are currently covered by the directors and
officers liability insurance coverage currently maintained by Plum Creek from
a carrier with comparable or better credit rating to Plum Creeks current
directors and officers liability insurance carrier on terms not less
favorable to the insured persons than the directors and officers liability
insurance coverage currently maintained by Plum Creek as of the date of this
Agreement with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred
on or before the Effective Time, except that in no event shall Weyerhaeuser be
required to pay with respect to such "tail" policy more than $1,800,000 (the "

insurance carrier with comparable or better credit rating as the current
insurer) that provides directors and officers liability insurance for
events, acts and omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time for an
aggregate period of no less than six years from the Effective Time that is
not materially less favorable than Plum Creeks existing policy or, if such
coverage is unavailable, the best available coverage; _provided_ , _however_ ,

an amount greater than the Maximum Amount.

due pursuant to Section 6.06(c) or 6.06(e) or Plum Creek fails promptly to
pay the amount due pursuant to Section 6.06(b) or 6.06(d), and, in order to

on the amount of such payment from the date such payment was required to be
made until the date of payment at the prime rate as published by _The Wall
Street Journal_ in effect on the date such payment was required to be made.
In no event shall either party be obligated to pay more than one termination
fee pursuant to this Section 6.06. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, in the event that the Weyerhaeuser

 



75  Termination Fee or the Plum Creek Termination Fee is payable and actually
paid to Weyerhaeuser or Plum Creek in accordance with this Section 6.06,
payment of such Weyerhaeuser Termination Fee or Plum Creek Termination Fee,
as applicable, shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the non-terminating
party and its Affiliates against any other party or such other partys
Affiliates and other Representatives, for any loss or damage based upon,
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the negotiation, execution or
performance hereof or the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
provisions of this Section 6.06(g) shall apply with respect to the payment of
the Termination Payment required to be made hereunder:

(i) If either Weyerhaeuser or Plum Creek, as applicable, (the " _Termination
Payor_ ") is required to pay the other (the " _Termination Payee_ ") the
Weyerhaeuser Termination Fee or the Plum Creek Termination Fee, as applicable,
(the " _Termination Payment_ "), such Termination Payment shall be paid into
escrow on the date such Termination Payment is required to be paid by the
Termination Payor pursuant to this Agreement by wire transfer of same-day
funds to an escrow account designated in accordance with this Section
6.06(g). In the event that the Termination Payor is obligated to pay the
Termination Payee the Termination Payment, the amount payable to the
Termination Payee in any tax year of the Termination Payee shall not exceed
the lesser of (A) the Termination Payment payable to the Termination Payee
and (B) the sum of (1) the maximum amount that can be paid to the Termination
Payee without causing the Termination Payee to fail to meet the requirements
of Sections 856(c)(2) and 856(c)(3) of the Code for the relevant tax year,
determined as if the payment of such amount did not constitute income
described in Section 856(c)(2) or 856(c)(3) of the Code (" _Qualifying Income_
") and the Termination Payee has $1,000,000 of income from unknown sources
during such year which is not Qualifying Income (in addition to any known or
anticipated income which is not Qualifying Income), in each case, as
determined by the Termination Payees independent accountants, plus (2) in
the event the Termination Payee receives either (x) a letter from the
Termination Payees counsel indicating that the Termination Payee has received
a ruling from the IRS as described below in this Section 6.06(g) or (y) an
opinion from the Termination Payees outside counsel as described below in
this Section 6.06(g), an amount equal to the excess of the Termination Payment
less the amount payable under clause (1) above.

(ii) To secure the Termination Payors obligation to pay these amounts, the
Termination Payor shall deposit into escrow an amount in cash equal to the
Termination Payment with a nationally recognized escrow agent selected by the
Termination Payor on such terms (subject to this Section 6.06(g)) as shall be
mutually agreed upon by the Termination Payor, the Termination Payee and the
escrow agent. The payment or deposit into escrow of the Termination Payment
pursuant to this Section 6.06(g) shall be made at the time the Termination
Payor is obligated to pay the 

 



76  Termination Payee such amount pursuant to Section 6.06 by wire transfer. The
escrow agreement shall provide that the Termination Payment in escrow or any
portion thereof shall not be released to the Termination Payee unless the
escrow agent receives any one or combination of the following: (A) a letter
from the Termination Payees independent accountants indicating the maximum
amount that can be paid by the escrow agent to the Termination Payee without
causing the Termination Payee to fail to meet the requirements of Sections
856(c)(2) and 856(c)(2)(3) of the Code determined as if the payment of such
amount did not constitute Qualifying Income and the Termination Payee has
$1,000,000 of income from unknown sources during such year which is not
Qualifying Income (in addition to any known or anticipated income which is not
Qualifying Income), in which case the escrow agent shall release such
amount to the Termination Payee, or (B) a letter from the Termination Payees
counsel indicating that (1) the Termination Payee received a ruling from the
IRS holding that the receipt by the Termination Payee of the Termination
Payment would either constitute Qualifying Income or would be excluded from
gross income within the meaning of Sections 856(c)(2) and 856(c)(3) of the
Code or (2) the Termination Payees outside counsel has rendered a legal
opinion to the effect that the receipt by the Termination Payee of the
Termination Payment should either constitute Qualifying Income or should be
excluded from gross income within the meaning of Sections 856(c)(2) and
856(c)(3) of the Code, in which case the escrow agent shall release the
remainder of the Termination Payment to the Termination Payee. The Termination
Payor agrees to amend this Section 6.06(g) at the reasonable request of the
Termination Payee in order to (x) maximize the portion of the Termination
Payment that may be distributed to the Termination Payee hereunder without
causing the Termination Payee to fail to meet the requirements of Sections
856(c)(2) and 856(c)(3) of the Code or (y) assist the Termination Payee in
obtaining a favorable ruling or legal opinion from its outside counsel, in
each case, as described in this Section 6.06(g). Any amount of the Termination
Payment that remains unpaid as of the end of a taxable year shall be paid as
soon as possible during the following taxable year, subject to the foregoing
limitations of this Section 6.06(g).

party knows is reasonably likely to prevent the Intended Tax Treatment, (ii)
executing such amendments to this Agreement as may be reasonably required in
order to obtain the Intended Tax Treatment (it being understood

determines in good faith materially adversely affects the value of the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement to such party or
its shareholders or stockholders, as applicable) and (iii) using reasonable
best efforts to obtain the opinions referred to in Sections 7.02(e) and
7.03(e), including by executing customary letters of representation.

Exchange Ratio and (2) in the case of Plum Creek, to holders of shares of Plum
Creek Common Stock, in an amount per share of Plum Creek Common Stock equal to

SECTION 6.16. _Employee Matters._  (a) During the period commencing at the

substantially comparable in the aggregate to the compensation opportunities
and benefits provided to Plum Creek Employees immediately prior to the
Effective Time.

 



81 (b) For purposes of determining (i) eligibility to participate and vesting
with respect to the benefit plans maintained by Weyerhaeuser or any
Weyerhaeuser Subsidiary (including the Weyerhaeuser 401(k) Plan) and (ii)
level of benefits under vacation and severance plans and arrangements (and not
any other plans or arrangements) maintained by Weyerhaeuser or any
Weyerhaeuser Subsidiary, service with Plum Creek or any Plum Creek Subsidiary
(or any predecessor employer of an employee of Plum Creek or any Plum Creek
Subsidiary, to the extent service with such predecessor employer is
recognized by Plum Creek or the applicable Plum Creek Subsidiary as of the
date of this Agreement) prior to the Effective Time shall be treated as
service with Weyerhaeuser or the Weyerhaeuser Subsidiaries; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that such service need not be recognized to the extent (A) that
such recognition would result in any duplication of benefits, (B) not
recognized by Plum Creek or a Plum Creek Subsidiary, as applicable, for
similar purposes or (C) that such recognition would apply for the purpose of
any plan, program or arrangement under which similarly situated employees of
Weyerhaeuser and the Weyerhaeuser Subsidiaries do not receive credit for prior
service (including prior service with predecessor employers) or that is
grandfathered or frozen, either with respect to eligibility to participate,
vesting or level of benefits. Weyerhaeuser and Plum Creek agree to take, or
cause to be taken, the actions described in Section 6.16(b) of the Plum Creek
Disclosure Letter.

(c) During the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending December 31
of the year in which the Effective Time occurs, with respect to any Plum Creek
Employee whose employment is terminated by Weyerhaeuser or any Weyerhaeuser
Subsidiary, Weyerhaeuser shall provide, or shall cause such
Weyerhaeuser Subsidiary to provide, severance benefits to such Plum Creek
Employee, which shall be determined and payable in accordance with the
severance benefit plan, agreement, practice or arrangement maintained by Plum
Creek or any of the Plum Creek Subsidiaries for the benefit of such Plum
Creek Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, to the extent set
forth on Section 6.16(c) of the Plum Creek Disclosure Letter, taking into
account all service with Plum Creek, Weyerhaeuser or any of their respective
Subsidiaries in determining eligibility for severance benefits and the amount
of severance benefits payable.

(d) For purposes of each benefit plan of Weyerhaeuser or the Weyerhaeuser
Subsidiaries, Weyerhaeuser and the Weyerhaeuser Subsidiaries shall use
reasonable best efforts to (i) cause all pre-existing condition exclusions and
actively-at-work requirements of such plans to be waived for employees of
Plum Creek and the Plum Creek Subsidiaries and their covered dependents (other
than limitations, including pre-existing conditions exclusions, or waiting
periods that are already in effect with respect to such employees and
dependents under the benefit plans of Plum Creek and the Plum Creek
Subsidiaries and that have not been satisfied as of the date such employees
and dependents commence participation in such benefit plans of Weyerhaeuser
and the Weyerhaeuser Subsidiaries) and (ii) give full credit for all co-
payments and deductibles

 



82  to the extent satisfied in the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs
(or the year in which employees of Plum Creek and the Plum Creek Subsidiaries
and their dependents commence participation in the benefit plans of
Weyerhaeuser and the Weyerhaeuser Subsidiaries, if later) as if there had been
a single continuous employer if such co-payments and deductibles are submitted
to the administrator of the benefit plans of the Weyerhaeuser and the
Weyerhaeuser Subsidiaries within 90 days following the Effective Time.

(e) This Section 6.16 shall be binding upon and shall inure solely to the
benefit of each of the parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this Section
6.16, express or implied, (i) is intended to confer upon any other person
(including any current or former directors, officers, consultants or
employees of any of Plum Creek or any Plum Creek Subsidiary or, on or after
the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation or any of its subsidiaries) any
rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever, (ii) is intended to be, shall
constitute or be construed as an amendment to or modification of any employee
benefit plan, program, policy, agreement or arrangement of Weyerhaeuser, Plum
Creek, the Surviving Corporation or any respective Subsidiary thereof

promulgated thereunder. The words "hereof", "hereto", "hereby", "herein" and

refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this
Agreement. The term "or" is not exclusive. The word "extent" in the phrase "to

Each of the parties has participated in the drafting and negotiation of this
Agreement. If an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises,
this Agreement must be construed as if it is drafted by all the parties, and
no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any
party by virtue of authorship of any of the provisions of this Agreement.

SECTION 9.05. _Severability._ If any term or other provision of this
Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any Law or by
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic and
legal substance of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is not
affected in any manner materially adverse to any party or such party waives
its rights under this Section 9.05 with respect thereto. Upon any
determination that any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid,
illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties shall negotiate in good
faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the
parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that
transactions contemplated by this Agreement are fulfilled to the extent
possible.

SECTION 9.06.  _Counterparts._ This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement, and

scan) to the other parties.

SECTION 9.07. _Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries._ (a) This

Creek Disclosure Letter and the Confidentiality Agreement, (i) constitutes the
entire agreement, and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings,
both written and oral, between the parties with respect to the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) except for Section
6.05, is not intended to confer, and does not confer, upon any Person other
than the parties any rights or remedies.

(b) Except for the representations and warranties contained in Article
III, Plum Creek acknowledges that none of Weyerhaeuser, the Weyerhaeuser
Subsidiaries or any other Person on behalf of Weyerhaeuser makes any other
express or implied representation or warranty in connection with the

Weyerhaeuser Subsidiaries nor any of

 



97  their respective Representatives or any other Person has made any express or
any implied representations or warranties to Plum Creek with respect to (i)
Weyerhaeuser or the Weyerhaeuser Subsidiaries, their respective businesses,
operations, assets, liabilities, financial condition, results of operations,
future operating or financial results, estimates, projections, forecasts,
plans or prospects (including the reasonableness of the assumptions
underlying such estimates, projections, forecasts, plans or prospects) or the
accuracy or completeness of any information regarding Weyerhaeuser or the
Weyerhaeuser Subsidiaries or (ii) any material, documents or
information relating to Weyerhaeuser or the Weyerhaeuser Subsidiaries
furnished or provided to Plum Creek or its Representatives or made available
to Plum Creek or its Representatives in any "data rooms," "virtual data
rooms," management presentations or in any other form in expectation of, or
in connection with, this Agreement or any other transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby, except as expressly and specifically covered by a
representation or warranty set forth in Article III. Plum Creek acknowledges
that it is not executing or authorizing the execution of this Agreement in
reliance upon any such representation or warranty not explicitly set forth in
Article III. Except for the representations and warranties contained in
Article IV, Weyerhaeuser acknowledges that none of Plum Creek, the Plum Creek
Subsidiaries or any other Person on behalf of Plum Creek makes any other
express or implied representation or warranty in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, Weyerhaeuser acknowledges that none of Plum Creek
or the Plum Creek Subsidiaries nor any of their respective Representatives or
any other Person has made any express or any implied representations or
warranties to Weyerhaeuser with respect to (i) Plum Creek or the Plum Creek
Subsidiaries, their respective businesses, operations, assets, liabilities,
financial condition, results of operations, future operating or financial
results, estimates, projections, forecasts, plans or prospects (including the
reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such estimates, projections,
forecasts, plans or prospects) or the accuracy or completeness of any
information regarding Plum Creek or the Plum Creek Subsidiaries or (ii) any
material, documents or information relating to Plum Creek or the Plum Creek
Subsidiaries furnished or provided to Weyerhaeuser or its Representatives or
made available to Weyerhaeuser or its Representatives in any "data rooms,"
"virtual data rooms," management presentations or in any other form in
expectation of, or in connection with, this Agreement or any other
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, except as expressly and
specifically covered by a representation or warranty set forth in Article IV.
Weyerhaeuser acknowledges that it is not executing or authorizing the
execution of this Agreement in reliance upon any such representation or
warranty not explicitly set forth in Article IV.

(c) For the avoidance of doubt, (i) in the event of Weyerhaeusers fraudulent
misrepresentation, intentional misrepresentation or intentional breach of this
Agreement, damages to Plum Creek shall include, to the extent proven, the loss
of the benefit of the bargain to Plum Creek and Plum Creeks stockholders and
(ii) in the event of Plum Creeks fraudulent misrepresentation, intentional
misrepresentation or

 



98  intentional breach of this Agreement, damages to Weyerhaeuser shall include,
to the extent proven, the loss of the benefit of the bargain to Weyerhaeuser
and Weyerhaeusers shareholders. 

SECTION 9.08. _GOVERNING LAW._ THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND
CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE, REGARDLESS
OF THE LAWS THAT MIGHT OTHERWISE GOVERN UNDER ANY APPLICABLE PRINCIPLES OF
CONFLICTS OF LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE.

 

SECTION 9.09. _Assignment._ Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned, in whole or
in part, by operation of Law or otherwise by any of the parties without the
prior written consent of the other parties. Any purported assignment without
such consent shall be void. Subject to the two immediately
preceding sentences, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the
benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties and their respective successors
and permitted assigns.

 

SECTION 9.10. _Specific Enforcement; Consent to Jurisdiction._ (a) The parties
acknowledge and agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that
any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or were otherwise breached, and that monetary damages,
even if available, would not be an adequate remedy therefor. It
is accordingly agreed that, prior to the termination of this Agreement
pursuant to Article VIII, the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the performance of terms and provisions of this Agreement in any court
referred to in clause (i) of the first sentence of Section 9.10(b), without
proof of actual damages (and each party hereby waives any requirement for the
securing or posting of any bond in connection with such remedy), this being
in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in
equity. The parties further agree not to assert that a remedy of specific
enforcement is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to Law or inequitable for any
reason, nor to assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an
adequate remedy for any such breach.

(b) Each of the parties (i) consents to submit itself to the personal
jurisdiction of any Delaware state court or any federal court located in the
State of Delaware in the event any dispute arises out of this Agreement, the
Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii)
agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction
by motion or other request for leave from any such court and (iii) agrees that
it will not bring any action relating to this Agreement, the Merger or any of
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any court other than
any Delaware state court or any federal court sitting in the State of
Delaware.

 



99 SECTION 9.11. _Waiver of Jury Trial._ Each party hereby waives, to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable Law, any right it may have to a trial by jury
in respect of any suit, action or other proceeding arising out of this
Agreement, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Each party (i) certifies that no representative, agent or attorney
of any other party has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such party
would not, in the event of any action, suit or other proceeding, seek to
enforce the foregoing waiver and (ii) acknowledges that it and the other
parties have been induced to enter into this Agreement by, among other things,
the mutual waiver and certifications in this Section 9.11.

 _Bylaw Amendment_

Fifth Amendment to the Amended and Restated By-Laws of Plum Creek Timber
Company, Inc.

The Amended and Restated By-Laws of Plum Creek Timber Company, Inc.,
as previously amended on February 7, 2007, February 5, 2008, February 9, 2010
and February 8, 2011 (the "By-Laws") are hereby amended, effective [●], 2015,
as set forth below.

 

Article VII of the By-Laws is hereby amended by adding the following section:

 

 _Article VII_

 

 _General Provisions_

 

Section 7.5. _Forum for Adjudication of Certain Disputes_. Unless the
Corporation consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum (an
"Alternative Forum Consent"), the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware
shall be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or
proceeding brought on behalf of the Corporation, (ii) any action asserting
a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer,
stockholder, employee or agent of the Corporation to the Corporation or the
Corporations stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim against the
Corporation or any director, officer, stockholder, employee or agent of the
Corporation arising out of or relating to any provision of the General
Corporation Law of the State of Delaware or the Certificate of Incorporation
or By-laws, or (iv) any action asserting a claim against the Corporation or
any director, officer, stockholder, employee or agent of the Corporation
governed by the internal affairs doctrine of the State of Delaware; provided,
however, that, in the event that the Court of Chancery in the State of
Delaware lacks subject matter jurisdiction over any such action or proceeding,
the sole and exclusive forum for such action or proceeding shall be another
state or federal court located within the State of Delaware, in each such
case, unless the Court of Chancery (or such other state or federal court
located within the State of Delaware, as applicable) has dismissed a prior
action by the same plaintiff asserting the same claims because such court
lacked personal jurisdiction over an indispensable party named as a defendant
therein. Failure to enforce the foregoing provisions would cause the
Corporation irreparable harm and the Corporation shall be entitled to
equitable relief, including injunctive relief and specific performance, to
enforce the foregoing provisions. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise
acquiring any interest in shares of capital stock of the Corporation shall be
deemed to have notice of and consented to the provisions of this Section 7.5
