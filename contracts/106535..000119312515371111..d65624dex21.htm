(an &#147;Alternative Forum Consent&#148;), the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware shall be the sole and exclusive forum for (i)&nbsp;any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Corporation, (ii)&nbsp;any action asserting a
claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer, stockholder, employee or agent of the Corporation to the Corporation or the Corporation&#146;s stockholders, (iii)&nbsp;any action asserting a claim against the Corporation or any
director, officer, stockholder, employee or agent of the Corporation arising out of or relating to any provision of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware or the Certificate of Incorporation or By-laws, or (iv)&nbsp;any action
asserting a claim against the Corporation or any director, officer, stockholder, employee or agent of the Corporation governed by the internal affairs doctrine of the State of Delaware; provided, however,&nbsp;that, in the event that the Court of
Chancery in the State of Delaware lacks subject matter jurisdiction over any such action or proceeding,&nbsp;the sole and exclusive forum for such action or proceeding shall be another state or federal court located within the State of Delaware, in
each such case, unless the Court of Chancery (or such other state or federal court located within the State of Delaware, as applicable) has dismissed a prior action by the same plaintiff asserting the same claims because such court lacked personal
jurisdiction over an indispensable party named as a defendant therein. Failure to enforce the foregoing provisions would cause the Corporation irreparable harm and the Corporation shall be entitled to equitable relief, including injunctive relief
and specific performance, to enforce the foregoing provisions.&nbsp;Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of capital stock of the Corporation shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to the provisions
of this Section&nbsp;7.5 of Article VII. If any action the subject matter of which is within the scope of this Section&nbsp;7.5 of Article VII is filed in a court other than the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware
