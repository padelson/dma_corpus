of such contest to Michelson within 30 days after notice of the Revised Attribution Product System List. If Michelson and the
Medtronic Parties cannot resolve this issue within 30 days after the Medtronic Parties&#146; notice that they are contesting
the Revised Attribution Product System List, the Parties shall submit the Dispute to arbitration pursuant to Section&nbsp;10

Michelson a description of each prospective New Product System along with any draft or non-draft Literature to date and reasonably
sufficient information, and at the request of Michelson a sample product or product system to examine for a reasonable period,

a determination by the Medtronic Parties or an agreement of the Parties that it is an Attribution Product System, the Medtronic
Parties shall, within 10 Business Days thereafter, deliver to Michelson a Revised Attribution Product List reflecting the determination

Parties acknowledge that the damages from a failure of any of them or their Affiliates to comply with the provisions of Section&nbsp;6.13
are difficult to calculate. Therefore, to avoid the difficulty and inconvenience of gathering the information necessary to
calculate the damages resulting from such a failure to comply, and to avoid future disputes about the amount of such damages,
the Parties agree that (except with respect to the power to issue an order with respect to any New Product System set forth
in Section 6.13(b)),<B> </B>Michelson&#146;s sole and exclusive remedy for any such failure to comply with the provisions of

to be a penalty) in the amount and nature specified opposite the applicable category of Literature in <U>Schedule 6.13(c)</U>.
No liquidated damages will be due with respect to any Literature where (i) an identical copy of it was sent to Michelson before
its dissemination with a request for a decision from Michelson as to whether the attribution or lack thereof is appropriate
and to which Michelson did not raise an objection within 15 days or (ii) such Literature did not include a trade, product,
product system or company name used by any of the Medtronic Parties or their Affiliates or any Person claiming rights as a
result of a Third Party Attribution Transfer. In all instances, the Medtronic Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts

any materials provided to such Third Party by Medtronic have the appropriate attribution as required by This Agreement and
(ii) request in any such agreement or understanding that the Third Party include the attribution as appropriate under This
Agreement. Medtronic shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that Third Party publishers who acknowledge contributions
from Medtronic also provide appropriate attribution as required by This Agreement in published articles and papers. Medtronic
shall have no affirmative obligation to enforce or ensure that such Third Party actually includes the Michelson Logo pursuant
to Section&nbsp;6.13(d)(ii) hereof and shall have no liability to Michelson under Section 6.13(d)(ii) for any act or omission
of a Third Party.</P>

a new form of dissemination of promotional or educational materials is developed during the Term upon notice by any of the
Parties, the Parties shall meet and confer within 30 days thereafter as to (i) whether such materials are of such a nature
that they should be excluded based on similar rationale to the exclusions in the definition of Literature, and (ii) if not,
the appropriate expression and mode of liquidated damages to be assessed in the future. If the Parties are not able to come
to terms during such 30-day period, then the Parties shall submit the Dispute to arbitration pursuant to Section&nbsp;10 (Arbitration).
In the event that the Arbitrator makes a final determination that the type of dissemination is to be treated as Literature
in the future, the Arbitrator shall decide upon an appropriate expression of name attribution and liquidated damages and injunctive
relief associated therewith.</P>

name attribution on a basis no less stringent, including at least all rights, obligations, and liquidated damages under Section
6.13, than if a Medtronic Party was providing any product, service, or Literature provided by or on behalf of the Third Party
or on behalf of any Person with rights through the Third Party, with the writing memorializing the Contractual Obligation expressly
identifying Michelson as a third-party beneficiary of the name attribution obligations with an independent right of enforcement
without the need to join any other Person. The immediately preceding sentence does not apply to the current term of any Assumed
Contract that is not amended after the Effective Date. If Michelson is unable to enforce any name attribution obligations under
an Assumed Contract without a Medtronic Party being part of an Action, then such Medtronic Party or an Affiliate of such Medtronic
Party shall voluntarily join or otherwise participate in an Action as necessary to enforce the name attribution obligations
of Third Parties; <U>provided</U>, that Michelson agrees in advance to reimburse such Medtronic Party for its reasonable fees,

that such Third Party actually includes the Michelson Logo pursuant to any Contractual Obligation or otherwise, and none of
the Medtronic Parties shall have any liability to Michelson for any act or omission of a Third Party. Notwithstanding anything
else in This Agreement, the Person granting the Third Party Attribution Transfer shall have (i) the right to agree with the
Third Party in good faith to determine which products and product systems require attribution under any Third Party Attribution
Transfer, which will be at least the products and product systems that practice or include a feature that is covered by an
issued and unexpired patent claim of a Patent Right in the Purchased Assets, Multi-Lock Patent Rights or Medtronic-Owned Patent
Rights and (ii) the right to grant one Third Party Attribution Transfer as part of a transaction that involves multiple business
segments of MDT without requiring any attribution as provided in This Agreement.</P>

with which the Sellers are generally familiar, and standards of quality and performance generally accepted in the industry,
(ii) meet or exceed standards of quality and performance of any applicable governmental agency, and (iii) comply with all applicable
laws, rules, and regulations. The Sellers&#146; sole and exclusive remedy for any failure of the Medtronic Parties and their
Affiliates to comply with the immediately preceding sentence is that Michelson may require that the name attribution under
this Section 6.13 not be made on any product system (and such product system is deemed removed from the then-current list of
Attribution Product Systems), and in response the Medtronic Parties and their Affiliates shall comply with the requirement
within 60 days on a rolling basis. Once a product or product system is removed from the list of Attribution Product Systems,
