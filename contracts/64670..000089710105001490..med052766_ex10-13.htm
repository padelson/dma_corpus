Following the Closing, Michelson shall not testify (whether by declaration, affidavit, or in person) and the Sellers shall not assist any Third Party in challenging the validity, enforceability or value (other than for Tax matters) of the Purchased Assets, in each case other than under subpoena or similar legal order. __ The Medtronic Parties and their Affiliates shall not assist any Third Party in asserting any Claim or Action relating to the Field (other than for Tax matters) against the Sellers or their Affiliates, other than under subpoena or similar order.

 

  

   
  
  6.11. _Patent Counsel; Return of Documents; Tangible Materials._ 

  

 (a) Based on the facts and circumstances existing as of the Effective Date, each of the Parties consents to any other Partys engagement of Martin and Ferraro LLP and agree that no conflict of interest exists with respect to Martin and Ferraro LLPs simultaneous patent prosecution representation of (i) the Medtronic Parties with respect to the Purchased Assets and the Medtronic-Owned Patent Rights and (ii) the Sellers with respect to the Patent Rights in the Excluded Intellectual Property. The Sellers agree that they will have no right to monitor the prosecution of Subject Intellectual Property after the Closing nor any right to have access to any non-public document or file pertaining to such prosecution without the prior consent of the Buyer. Following the Closing, the Sellers shall not initiate consultation with Martin and Ferraro LLP, directly or indirectly, on any prosecution, maintenance or enforcement matter related to the Subject Intellectual Property without the prior consent of the Buyer.

  

 (b) The Sellers shall cause Kirkland and Ellis LLP and Jeffer, Mangels, Butler and Marmaro LLP to deliver to the Document Custodian, within 90 days after the Closing, materials received or maintained in their files falling within Paragraph 36 of the Amended Protective Order in the Litigation other than (i) any Litigation materials that are protected by the attorney-client privilege, the work product doctrine or other applicable privileges, or (ii) materials falling within Paragraph 37 of the Amended Protective Order in the Litigation (the " _Protective Order Materials_ "). The Parties shall, within 90 days after the Closing, instruct Special Master Balaran to deliver to the Document Custodian the USB 2.0 hard drives and any other media containing the electronic files produced for inspection by the Medtronic Parties during the course of the Litigation (the " _Special Master Materials_ ") (the Special Master Materials and the Protective Order Materials are jointly referred to as the " _Litigation Materials_ "). The Parties shall instruct the Document Custodian to hold the Litigation Materials until the applicable statute of limitations expires relating to any Claim any of the Medtronic Parties or their respective Affiliates could assert for fraud in the inducement relating to This Agreement, to rescind This Agreement, or for material breach of This Agreement (the " _Retention Period_ "), at which time the Document Custodian shall, at the Buyers election, either destroy the Litigation Materials or deliver the Litigation Materials to the Buyer. During the Retention Period, the Document Custodian shall grant the Sellers and their Representatives access to such Litigation Materials that the Arbitrator determines is necessary for the Sellers and their Representatives to defend against any Action or Claim initiated by the Buyer or any of its Affiliates against any Seller for fraud in the inducement relating to This Agreement, to rescind This Agreement or for material breach of This Agreement, in which case the Retention Period shall be extended until final resolution of any such Action(s) or Claim(s). Prior to the expiration of the Retention Period, the Buyer may instruct the Document Custodian to either destroy the Litigation Materials or deliver the Litigation Materials to the Buyer if the Buyer delivers to the Sellers an acknowledgement by the Medtronic Parties on behalf of themselves and their respective Affiliates that all applicable statutes of limitation have expired and an unconditional release from the Medtronic Parties and their respective Affiliates of any and all Actions and Claims for fraud in the inducement relating to This Agreement, to rescind This Agreement, and for material breach of This Agreement. Notwithstanding any other provision in This Agreement, the United States District Court for the Western District of Tennessee shall retain exclusive jurisdiction to interpret, modify, or enforce the terms of the Amended Protective Order in the Litigation.

 

 (c) Upon reasonable request by the Buyer, the Sellers shall, at the Buyers cost and expense, as soon as reasonably practicable deliver an additional copy of any Tangible Materials that are in the possession of any of the Sellers or their Affiliates or Representatives.

 

 6.12. _Taxes._ The Buyer shall promptly pay all stamp Taxes, conveyance Taxes, transfer Taxes, use Taxes, sales Taxes, filing fees, recording fees, reporting fees and other similar taxes and fees, if any, imposed upon, or resulting from, the transfer of the Purchased Assets under This Agreement and the filing of any instruments relating to such transfer and all filing and recording fees payable to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (and similar foreign agencies) in connection with the transfer of the Purchased Assets. In no event shall this Section 6.12 or any other section of This Agreement be construed to impose upon the Buyer or any of its Affiliates the obligation to pay any income Taxes or 

   
  
  Taxes other than those transfer Taxes and filing and recording fees
specifically described in the preceding sentence of any of the Sellers or any
of their Affiliates relating to the transactions contemplated by This
Agreement.

 

 6.13. _Name Attribution._ 

  

 (a) Beginning 60 days after the Closing and ending upon the expiration of the Term, the Medtronic Parties shall include, or cause to be included, the Michelson Logo (or such other attribution agreed to in writing by the Parties) in all Literature for or referencing an Attribution Product System. During each October and each April during the Term, the Medtronic Parties shall provide Michelson with one original copy of each different item of Literature relating to the Field that any of the Medtronic Parties or their Affiliates, or any Person acting on behalf of any of them, disseminated or made available to a Third Party, or to any member of the sales, marketing, or advertising forces of any of the Medtronic Parties or their Affiliates, during the six previous calendar months (April  September for the October disclosure and October  March for the April disclosure, but the initial period will commence 60 days after the Closing). During the Term, Michelson may from time to time (but no more frequently than twice in any calendar year) provide to the Medtronic Parties a revised list of Attribution Product Systems (a " _Revised Attribution Product System List_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that each of the items on a Revised Attribution Product System List is a product or product system of any of the Medtronic Parties or their Affiliates that practices or includes a feature that is covered by any patent claim of a Patent Right in any of the Purchased Assets, Multi-Lock Patent Rights or Medtronic-Owned Patent Rights. The Medtronic Parties may contest a new item in a Revised Attribution Product System List by providing notice of such contest to Michelson within 30 days after notice of the Revised Attribution Product System List. If Michelson and the Medtronic Parties cannot resolve this issue within 30 days after the Medtronic Parties notice that they are contesting the Revised Attribution Product System List, the Parties shall submit the Dispute to arbitration pursuant to Section 10 (Arbitration). A Revised Attribution Product System List becomes controlling as to Attribution Product Systems (A) 60 days after notice of it by Michelson, with respect to items not contested as in the immediately preceding sentence, and (B) within 60 days after resolution of the Parties Dispute over an item by arbitration pursuant to Section 10 (Arbitration) or otherwise, with respect to items contested as in the immediately preceding sentence. Notwithstanding anything else in This Agreement, the Medtronic Parties cannot and shall not contest any item in a Revised Attribution Product System List that has previously appeared in _Schedule 6.13(a)_ , as such list is revised from time to time pursuant to Section 6.13(a) or Section 6.13(b).

 

 (b) Except for New Product Systems whose Commercial Launch occurred during the period from October 1, 2003 and ending 60 days prior to the Closing, at least 60 days prior to the Commercial Launch of a prospective New Product System the Medtronic Parties shall provide to Michelson a description of each prospective New Product System along with any draft or non-draft Literature to date and reasonably sufficient information, and at the request of Michelson a sample product or product system to examine for a reasonable period, to allow Michelson to review the New Product System and make a determination that it is an Attribution Product System. Upon a determination by the Medtronic Parties or an agreement of the Parties that it is an Attribution Product System, the Medtronic Parties shall, within 10 Business Days thereafter, deliver to Michelson a Revised Attribution Product List reflecting the determination or agreement. The Parties are considering use of Martin and Ferraro LLP as a neutral initial reviewing party. If Michelson provides notice within 30 days after receipt of the description and Literature referred to in the first sentence of this Section 6.13(b), that the New Product System is an Attribution Product System and if the Medtronic Parties disagree and this Dispute is not resolved within 30 days after Michelsons notice, or such other time frame that the Parties may agree in writing, the Parties shall submit the Dispute to arbitration pursuant to Section 10 (Arbitration) and the Medtronic Parties shall not be required to provide attribution on Literature relating to such New Product System unless and until a final determination by the Arbitrator with regard to that Dispute. The Parties acknowledge and agree that a New Product System will not require attribution under This Agreement until the Commercial Launch of such new or modified product or product system.

   
  
  (c) The Medtronic Parties shall ensure that the Michelson Logo (or such other attribution agreed to in writing by the Parties) appears, in the expression specified opposite the applicable category of Literature in _Schedule 6.13(c),_ on each item of Literature for or referencing an Attribution Product System. The Medtronic Parties or their Affiliates may also use a symbol, logo or trademark of the Medtronic Parties or their Affiliates or any other lawful means as an indication of origin for any Attribution Product System. The Medtronic Parties acknowledge that the damages from a failure of any of them or their Affiliates to comply with the provisions of Section 6.13 are difficult to calculate. Therefore, to avoid the difficulty and inconvenience of gathering the information necessary to calculate the damages resulting from such a failure to comply, and to avoid future disputes about the amount of such damages, the Parties agree that (except with respect to the power to issue an order with respect to any New Product System set forth in Section 6.13(b)), Michelsons sole and exclusive remedy for any such failure to comply with the provisions of Section 6.13 will be liquidated damages (which are not, will not be characterized by the Parties as, and will not be deemed to be a penalty) in the amount and nature specified opposite the applicable category of Literature in _Schedule 6.13(c)_. No liquidated damages will be due with respect to any Literature where (i) an identical copy of it was sent to Michelson before its dissemination with a request for a decision from Michelson as to whether the attribution or lack thereof is appropriate and to which Michelson did not raise an objection within 15 days or (ii) such Literature did not include a trade, product, product system or company name used by any of the Medtronic Parties or their Affiliates or any Person claiming rights as a result of a Third Party Attribution Transfer. In all instances, the Medtronic Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to make sure that the Michelson Logo is visible, unobstructed, not obscured, and fairly rendered.

 

 (d) Notwithstanding the exception in (iii) of the definition of Literature, neither the Medtronic Parties nor their Affiliates shall publish materials through a Third Party in order to attempt to avoid the obligations of Section 6.13. If any of the Medtronic Parties or their Affiliates provides materials or consideration to a Third Party publisher for use in a Third Party publication pursuant to a written agreement or understanding regarding the use of such materials, then the Medtronic Parties shall (i) ensure that any materials provided to such Third Party by Medtronic have the appropriate attribution as required by This Agreement and (ii) request in any such agreement or understanding that the Third Party include the attribution as appropriate under This Agreement. Medtronic shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that Third Party publishers who acknowledge contributions from Medtronic also provide appropriate attribution as required by This Agreement in published articles and papers. Medtronic shall have no affirmative obligation to enforce or ensure that such Third Party actually includes the Michelson Logo pursuant to Section 6.13(d)(ii) hereof and shall have no liability to Michelson under Section 6.13(d)(ii) for any act or omission of a Third Party.

 

 (e) The definition of "Literature" and the exclusions included in such definition are intended to encompass all currently known forms of promotional or educational materials disseminated or made available to Third Parties by any of the Medtronic Parties or their Affiliates. In the event a new form of dissemination of promotional or educational materials is developed during the Term upon notice by any of the Parties, the Parties shall meet and confer within 30 days thereafter as to (i) whether such materials are of such a nature that they should be excluded based on similar rationale to the exclusions in the definition of Literature, and (ii) if not, the appropriate expression and mode of liquidated damages to be assessed in the future. If the Parties are not able to come to terms during such 30-day period, then the Parties shall submit the Dispute to arbitration pursuant to Section 10 (Arbitration). In the event that the Arbitrator makes a final determination that the type of dissemination is to be treated as Literature in the future, the Arbitrator shall decide upon an appropriate expression of name attribution and liquidated damages and injunctive relief associated therewith.

 

 (f) Any materials distributed by the Medtronic Parties or their Affiliates prior to 60 days after the Closing will not be subject to liquidated damages or injunctive relief pursuant to This Agreement or otherwise. Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, the Medtronic Parties shall use good faith and reasonable commercial efforts to (i) cease dissemination of non-conforming 

   
  
  Literature after the Closing, and (ii) conform existing materials in
Medtronics central inventory in Memphis between the Effective Date and 60
days after the Closing. Notwithstanding anything else in This Agreement, the
Medtronic Parties shall not be liable for liquidated damages for errors in
conforming existing materials in Medtronics central inventory in Memphis at
the Closing that had appropriate attribution pursuant to the courts order in
the Litigation and are distributed within 180 days after the Closing.

 

 (g) The Medtronic Parties shall conspicuously display, or cause to be conspicuously displayed, the Michelson Logo (or such other attribution agreed to in writing by the Parties) in connection with any displays to Third Parties of the Tangible Materials that are part of the Purchased Assets identified in Section 2.1(e).

 

 (h) In any Third Party Attribution Transfer, the Person granting the Third Party Attribution Transfer shall require any Third Party receiving the benefit of the Third Party Attribution Transfer to agree, in a written Contractual Obligation against the Third Party, to provide name attribution on a basis no less stringent, including at least all rights, obligations, and liquidated damages under Section 6.13, than if a Medtronic Party was providing any product, service, or Literature provided by or on behalf of the Third Party or on behalf of any Person with rights through the Third Party, with the writing memorializing the Contractual Obligation expressly identifying Michelson as a third-party beneficiary of the name attribution obligations with an independent right of enforcement without the need to join any other Person. The immediately preceding sentence does not apply to the current term of any Assumed Contract that is not amended after the Effective Date. If Michelson is unable to enforce any name attribution obligations under an Assumed Contract without a Medtronic Party being part of an Action, then such Medtronic Party or an Affiliate of such Medtronic Party shall voluntarily join or otherwise participate in an Action as necessary to enforce the name attribution obligations of Third Parties; _provided_ , that Michelson agrees in advance to reimburse such Medtronic Party for its reasonable fees, costs and expenses relating thereto. None of the Medtronic Parties shall have any affirmative obligation to enforce or ensure that such Third Party actually includes the Michelson Logo pursuant to any Contractual Obligation or otherwise, and none of the Medtronic Parties shall have any liability to Michelson for any act or omission of a Third Party. Notwithstanding anything else in This Agreement, the Person granting the Third Party Attribution Transfer shall have (i) the right to agree with the Third Party in good faith to determine which products and product systems require attribution under any Third Party Attribution Transfer, which will be at least the products and product systems that practice or include a feature that is covered by an issued and unexpired patent claim of a Patent Right in the Purchased Assets, Multi-Lock Patent Rights or Medtronic-Owned Patent Rights and (ii) the right to grant one Third Party Attribution Transfer as part of a transaction that involves multiple business segments of MDT without requiring any attribution as provided in This Agreement.

 

 (i) The Medtronic Parties and their Affiliates shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that all product systems with which they use the Michelson Logo (i) meet or exceed the Medtronic Parties current standards of quality and performance relating to similar products, with which the Sellers are generally familiar, and standards of quality and performance generally accepted in the industry, (ii) meet or exceed standards of quality and performance of any applicable governmental agency, and (iii) comply with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations. The Sellers sole and exclusive remedy for any failure of the Medtronic Parties and their Affiliates to comply with the immediately preceding sentence is that Michelson may require that the name attribution under this Section 6.13 not be made on any product system (and such product system is deemed removed from the then-current list of Attribution Product Systems), and in response the Medtronic Parties and their Affiliates shall comply with the requirement within 60 days on a rolling basis. Once a product or product system is removed from the list of Attribution Product Systems, it cannot be replaced without the express, written consent of the Medtronic Parties.

 

 (j) Michelson may revise the Michelson Logo, temporarily or permanently, and with respect to some or all uses required or permitted under This Agreement, in response to any Claim that a use 

   
  
  of the Michelson Logo as required or permitted under This Agreement violates a
Legal Requirement. If Michelson so revises the Michelson Logo, or requests
that the Michelson Logo or other attribution not be used in a way required or
permitted by This Agreement, the Medtronic Parties shall use the new Michelson
Logo or comply with the request as promptly as commercially practicable. The
cessation of attribution or change of Michelson Logo may, for 30 days, be
accomplished through the use of stickers where possible, unless Michelson
determines in his reasonable discretion that such use of stickers would not
avoid liability based upon the asserted Legal Requirement.

 

 (k) Any disclosures by any of the Medtronic Parties or their Affiliates pursuant to this Section 6.13 shall be deemed to be Confidential Information of the Medtronic Parties.

 

 (l) In the event any of the Medtronic Parties or their Affiliates conduct or sponsor an IDE clinical study or other study that involves Subject Intellectual Property or Medtronic-Owned Patent Rights or MultiLock Patent Rights, such Medtronic Party or Medtronic Party Affiliate shall include within the materials sent to clinical sites a stand-alone notification describing Michelsons intellectual property contributions with a request that such clinical sites include a reference to Michelsons intellectual property contributions in any press releases, articles or other public information when referring to such studies.

 

 (m) The rights and obligations of the Parties pursuant to this Section 6.13 shall terminate upon expiration of the Term; _provided_ , that (i) the rights and obligations of the Parties pursuant to Section 6.13(k) shall survive the expiration of the Term and (ii) the Sellers rights to pursue Third Parties or to pursue liquidated damages remedies set forth in this Section 6.13 for any breach by the Medtronic Parties or their Affiliates occurring during the Term shall survive the expiration of the Term.

 

 6.14. _Confidentiality._ Each of the Parties acknowledges that the preservation of the confidentiality of the Confidential Information of the other Parties is an essential premise of the bargain between the Parties and that the Parties would be unwilling to enter into This Agreement in the absence of this Section 6.14. Accordingly, from and after the Closing, except as otherwise contemplated by This Agreement, each Party (the " _Bound Party_ ") shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates and Representatives not to, without the prior written consent of the other Parties to whom the Confidential Information belongs (the " _Other Parties_ "), disclose the Confidential Information of the Other Parties to any Person other than the Bound Partys Representatives who are informed of and bound by this confidentiality obligation or use the Confidential Information; _provided_ , that this Section 6.14 does not prohibit any disclosure (a) reasonably believed by the Bound Party to be required by any applicable Legal Requirement, provided that the Bound Party provides reasonable prior notice of the disclosure to the Other Parties to allow such Other Parties, if they desire, to contest the disclosure before it is made, (b) to Third Parties who are parties to any of the Assumed Contracts, to the extent reasonably necessary with respect to the Bound Partys rights or obligations under the Assumed Contracts, including informing the Third Parties that the Assumed Contracts have been assigned and assumed, or (c) made in furtherance of the enforcement or interpretation of any rights, remedy, or provision in, relating to or arising under This Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements or the transactions contemplated in This Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements.

 

 6.15. _Restricted Activities._   As a material inducement to the Buyers purchase of the Purchased Assets under This Agreement, including goodwill, each of the Sellers hereby covenants and agrees that from and after the Closing until the expiration of the Term, none of the Sellers will, either directly or indirectly, (a) engage in, or (b) own, manage, operate, control, be employed by, consult with, or assist, any Third Party or any Affiliate of any Seller engaged in, the practice, development, production, manufacture, sale, licensing, sublicensing or servicing of products, techniques or procedures in the Field in any geographic area in which the Buyer or any of its Affiliates conducts any business in the Field (collectively, the " _Restricted Field_ "); _provided_ , that this Section 6.15 does not prohibit (i) ownership of less than 10% of the outstanding stock of any publicly traded corporation or less than 20% of the equity interest of any hospital, medical clinic or center, or other provider of medical services, (ii) participating 

   
  
  in speaking engagements at, writing textbooks, treatises or articles for, or
teaching at colleges, universities, hospitals, charitable organizations or
trade or industry conferences, or the like, including with respect to devices
or methods that are the subject of the Restricted Field, (iii) practicing
medicine as a licensed physician or surgeon, including the use of devices or
methods that are the subject of the Restricted Field as part of such practice,
(iv) performance under consulting agreements set forth on _Schedule 6.15_ ,
as such agreements are in effect on the Effective Date, (v) licensing or
assigning the Excluded Intellectual Property, (vi) other commercial
exploitation of the Excluded Intellectual Property so long as such other
commercial exploitation does not infringe or misappropriate any Purchased
Assets, (vii) serving on any boards of directors of any not-for-profit
organizations or any other similar charitable foundations, (viii) serving as
an officer of any not-for-profit organizations or any other similar charitable
foundations so long as the activities or the results of the activities of
such organizations or foundations are not directed to the Field other than
solely due to their general application to the human body, (ix) making
unrestricted gifts of cash, securities or other property to not-for-
profit organizations or any other similar charitable foundations that are not
Affiliates of Michelson, including those engaged in research in the Field,
(x) making gifts of cash, securities or other property to not-for-profit
organizations or any other similar charitable foundations so long as the
activities or the results of the activities of such organizations or
foundations are not directed to the Field other than solely due to their
general application to the human body or (xi) consulting with or assisting
any Third Party or any Affiliate of any Seller in the Field solely with
respect to the Excluded Intellectual Property or consulting with or assisting
any Third Party or any Affiliate of any Seller outside the Field. The Sellers
agree that the covenants of this Section 6.15 are reasonable and valid. If
the final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction declares that any
term or provision of this Section 6.15 is invalid or unenforceable, the
Parties agree that the court making the determination of invalidity or
unenforceability will have the power to reduce the scope, duration or area of
the term or provision, to delete specific words or phrases or to replace any
invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a term or provision that is
valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of
the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and This Agreement will be
enforceable as so modified after the expiration of the time within which the
judgment may be appealed.

 

 6.16. _Use of Michelson Logo._   The Sellers shall not, and shall not permit any Affiliate or Third Party to, use the Michelson Logo (or any other logo confusingly similar thereto) in connection with any products other than products in the medical field that use or incorporate ideas conceived or developed by Michelson. All goodwill associated with use of the Michelson Logo shall inure to the benefit of Michelson.

 

 6.17. _Notice of Developments._   From the Effective Date until the Closing, the Sellers will give the Buyer prompt written notice upon becoming aware of any material development affecting the Purchased Assets and Excluded Intellectual Property (including claim amendments since March 7, 2005) or any event or circumstance that could reasonably be expected to result in a material breach of, or inaccuracy in, any of the Sellers representations and warranties; _provided_ , that no such disclosure will be deemed to prevent or cure any such breach of, or inaccuracy in, amend or supplement any Schedule to, or otherwise disclose any exception to, any of the representations and warranties set forth in This Agreement, unless, notwithstanding such disclosure, the Buyer consummates the Closing, in which case each such disclosed breach of, or inaccuracy in, the Sellers representations and warranties shall be deemed waived by the Buyer and shall not be a source of Losses for which the Sellers provide indemnification pursuant to Section 9 (Indemnification).

 

 6.18. _Corporate Existence._   For a period of two years following the Closing, KTI shall not dissolve or liquidate.

 

 6.19. _Revival and Reinstatement of Payment Obligations._ If any payment by the Buyer to the Sellers under This Agreement, in whole or in part, should for any reason subsequently be declared to be void or voidable under any state or federal law relating to creditors rights, including provisions of the Bankruptcy Code relating to fraudulent transfers, preferences, or other voidable or recoverable payments of money or transfers of property (collectively, a " _Voidable Transfer_ "), and if the Sellers are required to repay or restore, in whole or in part, any such Voidable Transfer, or elect to do so upon the reasonable advice of their counsel, then, to the extent of the amount of such Voidable Transfer that the 

   
  
  Sellers are required or elect to repay or restore, and as to reasonable costs,
expenses, and attorneys fees of the Sellers incurred with respect thereto,
the liability of the Buyer to the Sellers automatically shall be
revived, reinstated, and restored and shall exist as though such Voidable
Transfer had never been made.

 

 6.20. _Public Statements._   None of the Parties shall make any public statement, whether in a press release, interview, article, book, press conference, speaking engagement, or otherwise, relating to the terms of This Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements or the details of the discussions and drafts leading up to the execution of This Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements (each, a " _Public Statement_ ") without the prior consent of the other Parties, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld; _provided_ , that any Party may make such Public Statement it believes in good faith is required by applicable Legal Requirements or the requirements of any national securities exchange or quotation system on which such Partys securities are listed or quoted for trading, in which case the disclosing Party will provide the other Parties with the reasonable opportunity to review in advance such Public Statement, where practicable; _provided_ , _further_ , in the event that any Party makes a Public Statement in accordance with this Section 6.20, any Party may repeat any of the information set forth in such Public Statement. In addition, if any Party makes a Public Statement not in accordance with this Section 6.20, then any Party not Affiliated with the Party making such Public Statement may repeat any of the information set forth in such Public Statement.

 

 6.21. _FDA Applications._ Effective as of the Closing, the Sellers hereby assign any rights that they may have in any Food and Drug Administration or any similar U.S. or foreign regulatory agency application for or approval of the use or sale of products (e.g., FDA 510(k) applications) covered by one or more patent claims of the Subject Intellectual Property.

 

 6.22. _Post-Closing Reconciliation._   If, from time to time after the Closing, any of the Medtronic Parties or any of their Affiliates receives or collects any Assumed Contract Amounts, it shall promptly pay such Assumed Contract Amounts to the Sellers. If, from time to time after the Closing, any of the Sellers or any of their Affiliates receives or collects any amounts due under the Assumed Contracts that are attributable to the period from and after the Closing, he or it shall promptly pay such amounts to the Medtronic Parties.

 

 6.23. _Covenants Regarding Contractual Obligations._ After Closing, the Sellers shall continue honoring any remaining non-delegable obligations under the Assumed Contracts, including confidentiality obligations thereunder. The Medtronic Parties shall not interfere with the Sellers performance of such obligations.

 

 6.24. _Remedies._ Effective as of the Closing, the Sellers agree that the only remedy they may seek or obtain pursuant to the Excluded Equitable Rights and to the Excluded Indemnification Rights shall be the Specified Relief. Effective as of the Closing, the Sellers have no right to terminate any of the underlying agreements, alter any of the licenses thereunder, seek enjoinment or alteration of any other provision or otherwise disturb the Buyers benefit of the bargain of having been assigned the Sellers contracts identified in _Schedule 2.2(c)_ and _Schedule 2.2(d)_ , other than seeking the Specified Relief.

 

 6.25. _Third Party Confidentiality Agreements._ In the event there are any confidentiality agreements among any of the Parties and their Affiliates and any Third Party, the Parties agree that, to the extent permitted by law, any confidentiality obligations between the Parties and their Affiliates shall be superseded and replaced by This Agreement, effective at the Closing.

 (e) any Contractual Obligation of the Sellers to make any payments to any Third Party arising out of or relating to the payment to the Sellers of the Closing Payment or the Alternate Closing Payment, as applicable, or any of the Post-Closing Payments;

 

  _provided_ , _however_ , that (A) the Sellers shall not have any obligation
to indemnify, defend or hold harmless the Medtronic Parties or their

of the breach of any representation or warranty of the Sellers set forth in
Sections 4.4 (Consents), 4.5 (Litigation), 4.6 (Assumed Contracts), 4.7(a)

Agreement or the Sellers Closing Certificate. No Claim for indemnification
for breach by any Seller of any representation or warranty set forth in
Section 4.8(d)(i) may be brought unless such Claim arises from, and only to
the extent such Claim arises from, (i) a Third Party Claim (including a
defense to a Claim of infringement brought by any of the Medtronic Parties or
their Affiliates) or (ii) the failure by any Medtronic Party to bring an
Action for patent infringement against a Third Party due to an assessment by
such Medtronic Party that such Action cannot be brought because of a breach of
a representation or warranty by any of the Sellers set forth in Section
4.8(d)(i).

 

  

   
  
  9.2. _Indemnification by the Buyer._ From and after the Closing, the Medtronic Parties shall jointly and severally indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Sellers and their respective Affiliates and Representatives against all Losses relating to or arising out of:

 

 (a) the breach of any representation or warranty of the Medtronic Parties in Section 5 of This Agreement or in the closing certificate referenced in Section 7.2(f)(i) (the " _Medtronic Parties  Closing Certificate_") or the breach of any covenant or obligation of the Medtronic Parties in This Agreement or any of the Ancillary Agreements;

 (d) any Claims or Actions by any Third Party under any Assumed Contracts initiated after the Closing based on any acts or omissions of the Sellers occurring or existing before the Closing, except to the extent the circumstances giving rise to such Claims or Actions constitute a breach of any representation, warranty or covenant of any of the Sellers under This Agreement or the Sellers Closing Certificate (without regard to the expiration of the applicable survival period for such representations or warranties); or

 

 (e) any Claims or Actions by any Third Party for product liability, product warranty or similar Claim or Action arising out of or relating to the licensing or sublicensing by the Medtronic Parties of products, product systems or procedures in the Field or other products, product systems or procedures derived from or based on the Purchased Assets, the Medtronic-Owned Patent Rights or the Multi-Lock Patent Rights, except to the extent the circumstances giving rise to such Claims or Actions constitute a breach of any representation, warranty or covenant of any of the Sellers under This Agreement or the Sellers Closing Certificate (without regard to the expiration of the applicable survival period for such representations or warranties) or relate to alleged medical malpractice by Michelson;

 

  _provided_ , _however_ , that (A) the Medtronic Parties have no obligation
to indemnify, defend, or hold harmless the Sellers or their respective
Affiliates or Representatives against any Losses relating to or arising out of
the breach of any representation or warranty of the Medtronic Parties in This
Agreement or in the corresponding representations and warranties set forth in
the Medtronic Parties Closing Certificate unless and until the Sellers and
their respective Affiliates and Representatives, collectively, have suffered

amount of the Basket and not only to the extent such Losses exceed the
Basket), and (B) there will be a $300,000,000 aggregate ceiling on the
obligation of the Medtronic Parties to indemnify the Sellers and their
respective Affiliates and Representatives against Losses relating to or

and warranties set forth in Section 5 of This Agreement or in the Medtronic
Parties Closing Certificate.

 

 9.3. _Survival._ The terms of This Agreement and all provisions hereof, including all representations, warranties, promises, agreements and covenants, are contractual and not mere recitals and shall survive the execution and delivery of This Agreement and the Closing under This Agreement and, except as expressly stated herein, shall continue in full force and effect thereafter; _provided_ , that (i) the representations and warranties set forth in Sections 4.1 (Organization; Shareholders), 4.2 (Authorization), 4.3 (Noncontravention), 4.7 (Title), 4.8(d)(i) (Intellectual Property) and 4.10 (U.S. Taxpayer) (including, in each case, the corresponding representations and warranties set forth in the Sellers 

   
  
  Closing Certificate), and Sections 5.1 (Organization), 5.2 (Authorization) and
5.3 (Noncontravention) (including, in each case, the corresponding
representations and warranties set forth in the Medtronic Parties
Closing Certificate) shall only survive until the fifth anniversary of the
Closing and (ii) the other representations and warranties set forth in This
Agreement shall only survive until the third anniversary of the Closing;
_provided_ , _further_ , that if any Claim seeking indemnification has been
timely made in accordance with Section 9.4 (Time for Claims) but has not been
finally determined by the end of the applicable survival period set forth
above, the representations and warranties set forth in This Agreement shall,
for purposes of such Claim (and only such Claim), survive until final
determination of such Claim.

 

 9.4. _Time for Claims._ No Claim may be made seeking indemnification pursuant to This Agreement unless a written notice thereof is provided to the Indemnifying Party (i) at any time before the expiration of the applicable survival period set forth in Section 9.3 (Survival), in the case of any breach of any of the representations or warranties in This Agreement, and (ii) at any time, in the case of any other Claim seeking indemnification pursuant to This Agreement.

 

 9.5. _Notices._ If an Indemnified Party intends to seek indemnification pursuant to This Agreement, such Indemnified Party shall promptly notify the Indemnifying Party in writing of the Claim for which indemnification is sought, including any Third Party Claims in respect of which indemnification is sought under This Agreement, in each case within the applicable time periods specified in Section 9.4 (Time for Claims). Any such notice shall set forth in reasonable detail, in light of the circumstances then known to the Indemnified Party, the facts, circumstances and basis of the Claim and, if the Claim relates to a Third Party Claim, shall include copies of all papers served upon or received by the Indemnified Party relating thereto. Any delay in the provision of such notice and accompanying materials shall not affect any rights under This Agreement except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is actually and materially prejudiced thereby.

 

 9.6. _Third Party Claims._   The Indemnifying Party will be entitled to participate in the defense of any Third Party Claim that is the subject of a notice given by the Indemnified Party pursuant to Section 9.5 (Notices). In addition, the Indemnifying Party will have the right to defend the Indemnified Party against the Third Party Claim with counsel of the Indemnifying Partys choice reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party so long as:

 

 (a) the Indemnifying Party gives written notice to the Indemnified Party within 10 Business Days after the Indemnified Party has given notice of the Third Party Claim that the Indemnifying Party will indemnify the Indemnified Party against the entirety of any and all Losses the Indemnified Party may suffer resulting from, arising out of, relating to, in the nature of or caused by the Third Party Claim;

  

 (b) the Third Party Claim involves only money damages and does not seek an injunction or other equitable relief against the Indemnified Party;

 

 (c) the Indemnified Party has not been advised by counsel that an actual or potential conflict exists between the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party in connection with the defense of the Third Party Claim;

 

 (d) the Third Party Claim does not relate to or otherwise arise in connection with any criminal or regulatory enforcement Action; and

 

 (e) the Indemnifying Party conducts the defense of the Third Party Claim actively and diligently.

 

 If any of the foregoing conditions is not satisfied, the Indemnified Party may assume control of the defense of the Third Party Claim with counsel of its choice and the Indemnified Partys reasonable legal fees and expenses shall constitute part of the Losses indemnified under This Agreement, provided, that such Claim for indemnification is agreed by the Indemnifying Party or otherwise determined in the Indemnified Partys favor by the Arbitrator. The Indemnified Party may retain separate co-counsel at its sole cost and expense and participate in the defense of the Third Party Claim; _provided_ , that the Indemnifying Party will pay the fees and expenses of separate 

   
  
  co-counsel retained by the Indemnified Party that are incurred prior to
Indemnifying Partys assumption of control of the defense of the Third Party
Claim. The Indemnifying Party will not consent to the entry of any judgment
or enter into any compromise or settlement with respect to the Third Party
Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party unless such
judgment, compromise or settlement (i) provides for the payment by the
Indemnifying Party of money as sole relief for the claimant, (ii) results in
the full and general release of the Indemnified Party from all
Liabilities arising or relating to, or in connection with, the Third Party
Claim and (iii) involves no finding or admission of any violation of Legal
Requirements or the rights of any Person and no effect on any other Claims
that may be made against the Indemnified Party. If the Indemnifying Party
does not deliver the notice contemplated hereby within 10 Business Days after
the Indemnified Party has given notice of the Third Party Claim, or otherwise
at any time fails to conduct the defense of the Third Party Claim actively
and diligently, the Indemnified Party may defend, and may consent to the entry
of any judgment or enter into any compromise or settlement with respect to,
the Third Party Claim in any manner it may deem appropriate (and the
Indemnified Party need not consult with, or obtain any consent from, the
Indemnifying Party in connection therewith). If the Indemnifying Party
is entitled to assume control of the defense of the Third Party Claim
hereunder, and conducts the defense of the Third Party Claim actively and
diligently but any of the other conditions set forth in clauses (a) through
(e) of this Section 9.6 is or becomes unsatisfied, the Indemnified Party may
defend, and may consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any
compromise or settlement with respect to, the Third Party Claim; _provided_ ,
that the Indemnifying Party will not be bound by the entry of any such
judgment consented to, or any such compromise or settlement effected, without
its prior written consent (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in This Agreement, in the
event that a Third Party Claim is asserted against one or more Medtronic
Indemnified Parties and the potential for indemnification arises from or
relates to an actual or alleged breach of the Sellers representations and
warranties set forth in Section 4.8(d)(i) of This Agreement, then the
response to and defense of such Claim shall be managed as follows. The
Medtronic Indemnified Parties will have the sole and exclusive right to
defend, settle or agree to entry of judgment of such Third Party Claim
with counsel of its choice. However, any such judgment, settlement or finding
by any court or arbitral body shall not be dispositive or admissible evidence
with respect to determining whether the Sellers have breached any of their
representations or warranties in Section 4.8(d)(i) of This Agreement.

 

 9.7. _LIMITATION OF DAMAGES._   THE PARTIES SHALL ONLY BE LIABLE FOR ACTUAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING DIMINUTION OF VALUE OF THE PURCHASED ASSETS) AND SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES OF ANY KIND RELATING TO OR ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ANCILLARY AGREEMENTS, WHETHER OR NOT SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THE LIMITATION SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION SHALL NOT APPLY TO CLAIMS FOR AMOUNTS PAID WITH RESPECT TO INDEMNIFICATION FOR LOSSES ARISING FROM THIRD PARTY CLAIMS.

 

 9.8. _Exclusive Remedy._ Except as expressly stated otherwise in This Agreement, the indemnities set forth in this Section 9 shall be the exclusive remedy for any Claims, whether Third Party Claims or direct Claims between the Parties, relating to or arising out of This Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.

 

 9.9. _Knowledge and Investigation._   Except as expressly set forth in the proviso to Section 6.17 (Notice of Developments), the right of any Indemnified Party to indemnification pursuant to this Section 9 will not be affected by any investigation conducted or knowledge acquired (or capable of being acquired) at any time, whether before or after the execution and delivery of This Agreement or the Closing, with respect to the accuracy of any representation or warranty, or performance of or compliance with any covenant or agreement under This Agreement.

 

 9.10. _Letter of Credit._ For as long as any amounts are outstanding under the Closing Letter of Credit or any Post-Closing Letter of Credit (collectively, the " _LOCs_ "), or Escrow Account, as applicable, any and all amounts payable by the Sellers as Indemnifying Parties to a Medtronic Indemnified 

   
  
  Party shall be paid in cash first out of the LOCs or the Escrow Account, as
applicable, and thereafter by the Sellers in accordance with payment
instructions provided by the Buyer. The existence of the LOCs or the Escrow
Account, as applicable, shall not be deemed to limit the amount of any
allowable Claims by any Medtronic Indemnified Party pursuant to This
Agreement for Losses in excess of the outstanding amounts under the LOCs or
the Escrow Account, as applicable. The Sellers shall cause the principal
amounts under each of the LOCs or the Escrow Account, as applicable, to remain
outstanding until the earlier of (a) such time as the entire principal amount
of such LOC or the Escrow Account, as applicable, has been used to pay the
Medtronic Indemnified Parties in accordance with a decision of the Arbitrator
and (b) the fifth anniversary of the Closing and thereafter the funds in the
Escrow Account shall be released to the Sellers or the LOCs shall be
terminated, as the case may be; _provided_ , that if any Claim seeking
indemnification has been timely made in accordance with Section 9.4 (Time for
Claims) but has not been finally determined by the Arbitrator by the fifth
anniversary of the Closing, then the Sellers shall cause the principal
amounts under each of the LOCs or the Escrow Account, as applicable, to remain
outstanding until such final determination of each such Claim in an aggregate
principal amount sufficient to satisfy the aggregate amount of Losses to
which the Medtronic Indemnified Parties reasonably estimate (and provide the
Sellers prior notice of) they may be entitled to recover from the Sellers in
respect of all such Claims.

 

 9.11. _Duty to Mitigate._ The Parties acknowledge that in determining the amount of any Loss to which any Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification under this Section 9, the Arbitrator shall take into account the degree to which such Indemnified Party took or failed to take action to mitigate such Loss.

   10. | ARBITRATION.  
---|--- 
  

 10.1. _Agreement to Arbitrate._   To expedite the resolution of Disputes that may arise between the Parties, the Parties, on behalf of themselves and their respective Affiliates, agree that any and all Disputes shall be submitted to final and binding arbitration pursuant to the procedures set forth in this Section 10. The Parties consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Arbitrator to finally resolve any and all Disputes, including a Dispute under Section 8.1(f), and waive any and all resort to any court in connection with any and all Disputes, regardless of the legal or equitable theory upon which such Disputes may be based, except for the enforcement, vacation or remand of any arbitration award or arbitration order. Any dispute concerning whether any Dispute is arbitrable pursuant to This Agreement shall be resolved by the Arbitrator and not by any court.

 

 10.2. _Appointment and Replacement of Arbitrator._ MSD, on behalf of the Medtronic Parties, and the Sellers shall appoint an arbitrator pursuant to the provisions of this Section 10.2 promptly after the execution of This Agreement. That arbitrator or a replacement selected pursuant to this Section 10.2 (in either case, the " _Arbitrator_ ") shall be retained by the Medtronic Parties and the Sellers as the Arbitrator for the Term. The Arbitrator shall be appointed according to the following procedure: the Sellers shall provide to the Medtronic Parties a list of ten individuals (" _Potential Arbitrators_ ") who are all able and willing to fulfill the duties of the Arbitrator under this Section 10, who have not previously represented any of the Parties or their Affiliates, and who are either (i) former judges of a United States District Court or a United States Court of Appeals, or (ii) intellectual property attorneys with at least 20 years of experience in intellectual property litigation. Of the Potential Arbitrators, the Sellers will provide at least four suggestions from each category. MSD, on behalf of the Medtronic Parties, shall then have 30 days to select one name from the list of Potential Arbitrators and inform the Sellers of the selection. If the Medtronic Parties fail or refuse to select one name from the list of Potential Arbitrators, the Sellers shall have the power to select the Arbitrator from the list of Potential Arbitrators. Should the Arbitrator (including any replacement) at any time be unable or unwilling to fulfill his or her duties, or be disqualified pursuant to Section 10.13, the Parties will appoint a replacement (who will then be the "Arbitrator") following this same procedure.

 

 10.3. _Exclusive Dispute Resolution Procedure._ The arbitration procedure contained in this Section 10 shall be the exclusive dispute resolution procedure available to the Parties with respect to any and all Disputes.

 

  

   
  
  10.4. _Demand for Arbitration._ Any arbitration proceeding shall commence with the service by a Party or Parties (the " _Claimant_ ") of a demand for arbitration (the " _Demand_ "). The Demand shall be served on the Party or Parties against whom arbitration is sought (the " _Respondent_ ") and on the Arbitrator and shall specify in reasonable detail the nature of the claim or claims and the relief requested for each claim. The service of the Demand shall conform with the notice provisions of Section 12.7 (Notices). As used herein, " _Arbitration Parties_ " means the Claimant and Respondent.

 

 10.5. _Applicable Arbitration Procedures and Powers of the Arbitrator._ The Arbitrator shall conduct the arbitration proceeding in accordance with the provisions of This Agreement and the provisions of the Federal Arbitration Act (the " _Act_ "). Any procedure, rule or standard specified in This Agreement will control over any conflicting procedure, rule or standard in the Act. The Arbitrator shall have full power to make such orders, rules and regulations relating to the arbitration proceeding as he or she deems just and expedient, including the power to order any of the Parties to perform or refrain from any act within the scope of the Dispute, the power to enter and modify protective orders, the power to retain experts, and the power to appoint referees and special masters.

 

 10.6. _Service._ Unless otherwise agreed, the Respondent shall have 20 days from the date of service of the Demand to serve a response to the Demand (the " _Response_ ") and any counter-demand for arbitration (the " _Counter-Demand_ "), and the Claimant shall have 20 days from the date of service of the Counter-Demand to serve a response to the Counter-Demand. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure (" _FRCP_ ") 6(a) shall govern the computation of any period of time prescribed or allowed by this Section 10 or by the Arbitrator. Service of all papers in the arbitration proceeding shall be made on the Arbitration Parties and the Arbitrator by hand delivery, facsimile, electronic mail or overnight courier. Service by overnight courier shall add one day to the time for any required response.

 

 10.7. _Preliminary Meeting._   Counsel for Claimant and Respondent shall meet in person or by telephone with the Arbitrator within 10 days of the service of the Response or, if a Counter-Demand is served, within 10 days of the Claimants service of a response to the Counter-Demand (the " _Preliminary Meeting_ "). At the Preliminary Meeting, the Arbitrator shall consider and enter a scheduling order (the " _Scheduling Order_ ") containing (i) a schedule for discovery pursuant to Section 10.8, (ii) a schedule for the Arbitration Parties submission of proposed protective orders that the Arbitrator may enter as he or she deems appropriate, to apply to the arbitration proceeding consistent with Section 10.14 hereof, (iii) a schedule for the briefing of dispositive motions, (iv) a schedule for the exchange of lists of witnesses, including experts, that each Party intends to call at the arbitration hearing (the " _Hearing_ ") and the subjects of their testimony, and copies of all documents that the Arbitration Party intends to introduce at the Hearing to support its claims or defenses, (v) a date for a pre-Hearing meeting (the " _Pre-Hearing Meeting_ ") to discuss and define the order of proof and issues to be presented at the Hearing, and any related briefing, and (vi) a date for the commencement of the Hearing. At the Pre-Hearing Meeting, the Claimant and Respondent shall exchange offers to resolve the matters at issue in the Demand and Counter-Demand (each, an " _Arbitration Settlement Offer_ "). After a final arbitration award has been rendered, the Parties shall provide the Arbitrator with their respective Arbitration Settlement Offers.

 

 10.8. _Discovery._ The Arbitration Parties shall be entitled to discovery during the arbitration proceeding pursuant to (i) FRCP 34 (requests for the inspection and production of documents), (ii) FRCP 30 (depositions), (iii) FRCP 26(a)(2) (disclosure of expert reports), and (iv) FRCP 26(b)(4) (depositions of expert witnesses). Each side in the arbitration shall prepare and produce a privilege log. Each side in the arbitration proceeding shall be entitled to depose ten non-expert witnesses, for a maximum of eight hours each. Additional depositions may be permitted by the Arbitrator, in his or her discretion. In addition, the Arbitration Parties shall only be entitled to use the Litigation Materials in the arbitration to the extent permitted by Section 6.11(b). Every discovery dispute the Arbitration Parties are unable to resolve informally shall be submitted to the Arbitrator for decision, by the service of a written brief. Any response shall be served within five days thereafter and any reply shall be served within three days after service of the response. The Arbitrator shall rule promptly thereafter and may make such orders with respect to discovery disputes as he or she deems just and expedient. Any and all materials disclosed pursuant to any Dispute shall be returned to the producing Party or destroyed within thirty days of any final award with respect to a Dispute, _provided_ _,_   _however_ , if either Party provides 

   
  
  notice to the Arbitrator during such thirty day period, then the Arbitrator
may issue an order providing for retention of such materials by a Third Party
with access to such materials to be determined by the Arbitrator.

 

 10.9. _Hearing and Prior Proceedings._   The Hearing shall take place in Los Angeles, California, commencing as expeditiously as possible but in no event, without good cause shown to the satisfaction of the Arbitrator, later than 120 days after the Preliminary Meeting. The Hearing shall be held, to the extent possible, on consecutive days (excluding weekends). The Arbitrator may permit deposition testimony to be presented in lieu of oral testimony. The Hearing shall be recorded stenographically. Proceedings prior to the Hearing shall be held in person or by telephone.

 

 10.10. _Evidence._ The Arbitrator shall be the sole judge of the admissibility, relevance and materiality of the evidence offered, and conformity with the legal rules of evidence shall not be necessary.

 

 10.11. _Awards._ 

  

 (a) The Arbitrator shall have the power to award only the remedies or relief set forth in This Agreement, i.e., monetary damages, liquidated damages, injunctive relief and specific performance (including the power to exercise a power-of-attorney to execute confirmatory assignments on behalf of the Sellers in the event that the Arbitrator determines that it is appropriate to do so due to a failure of the Sellers to provide further assurances as required by Section 6.8 (Further Assurances)). In addition, the Arbitrator shall have the power to execute and deliver and file and record in the proper filing and recording places, all such instruments, including Uniform Commercial Code termination statements covering or purporting to cover any of the Sellers assets or properties that is not Collateral, and take all such other actions as the Arbitrator shall determine to be appropriate to terminate or otherwise release the Buyers security interest in any of the Sellers assets or properties that the Arbitrator determines is not Collateral under any applicable Legal Requirement. The Arbitrator shall award to the prevailing Arbitration Party or Arbitration Parties its or their reasonable attorneys fees and costs. For purposes of determining which Arbitration Party is the prevailing party and thus entitled to recover attorneys fees and costs, the Arbitrator must do so in the following manner. The Arbitrator shall determine which Arbitration Partys Arbitration Settlement Offer is closer to the Arbitrators final award and shall determine that such Arbitration Party is the prevailing party for purposes of awarding reasonable attorneys fees and costs.

 

 (b) The Arbitrators awards shall be accompanied by detailed findings of fact and conclusions of law, final and binding upon, and enforceable as to, the Parties. The Arbitrators final award shall be rendered no later than 30 days after the close of the Hearing. The Arbitrators rendered award shall be confidential and filed under seal in any recourse to the courts taken to enforce the award. 

 

 (c) The award rendered by the Arbitrator shall be collateral estoppel as to any issue found against a Party in any later arbitration.

 

 (d) Each of the Parties acknowledge and agree that the other Parties would be damaged irreparably in the event of any breach of or failure to perform the obligations of certain Sections of This Agreement in accordance with their specific terms, including Sections 2.9 (Sellers Covenant Not To Sue), 6.1 (Litigation), 6.2 (HSR Act), 6.3 (Closing), 6.5 (Covenants in Support of Assignment), 6.6 (Models and Prototypes), 6.7 (Disclosure of New Subject Invention and New Subject Intellectual Property), 6.8 (Further Assurances), 6.10 (Third Party Actions), 6.11 (Patent Counsel; Return of Documents; Tangible Materials), 6.13 (Name Attribution) with respect to New Product System designation, 6.14 (Confidentiality), 6.15 (Restricted Activities), 6.16 (Use of Michelson Logo), 6.18 (Corporate Existence), 6.20 (Public Statements), 6.23 (Covenants Regarding Contractual Obligations) and 6.24 (Remedies). Accordingly, each of the Parties agrees that, without posting bond or other undertaking, the other Parties will be entitled to seek an interim award from the Arbitrator seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches or violation of This Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of certain Sections of This Agreement and that the prevailing Party may seek to have such interim award immediately entered in any court of the United States or any state thereof having jurisdiction over the Parties and the matter. Each Party 

   
  
  further agrees that, in the event of any such entry of an interim award in any
court of the United States or any state thereof having jurisdiction over the
Parties and the matters, no Party will assert that a remedy at law would be
adequate as a defense to enforcement of the Arbitrators previously issued
interim award for specific performance.

 

 10.12. _Arbitrator s Fees._  The Arbitrator shall be paid an annual retainer of $50,000. The Arbitrator shall be entitled to additional compensation for services rendered and costs incurred in connection with any arbitration proceeding, as specified by the Arbitrator. The Arbitrators annual retainers shall be borne one half by the Medtronic Parties and one half by the Sellers. The Arbitrators additional compensation for services rendered and costs incurred in connection with any arbitration proceeding, and any administrative fees associated with the arbitration proceeding, shall initially be borne one half by the Medtronic Parties and one half by the Sellers, but the prevailing Party or Parties in the arbitration proceeding shall be entitled to recover its or their share of those amounts from the losing Party or Parties in accordance with Section 10.11 hereof.

 

 10.13. _Impartiality and Disqualification of Arbitrator; Ex Parte Contacts._ 

 

 (a) The Arbitrator shall be subject to disqualification if his or her impartiality or independence can reasonably be questioned, and shall be obligated to disclose to the Parties any circumstance likely to give rise to a reasonable doubt as to his or her impartiality or independence, including the acquisition of any financial interest in any of the Parties or their Affiliates. Any request for disqualification of the Arbitrator shall be made to the Arbitrator, who shall consider the request from the perspective of a reasonable observer who is informed of all the surrounding facts and circumstances, and if the Arbitrator determines that the impartiality or independence of the Arbitrator can reasonably be questioned, then (i) the Arbitrator shall no longer serve as Arbitrator of any Dispute that may arise between the Parties, including any pending Dispute and (ii) the Parties will select a new Arbitrator, as necessary, pursuant to Section 10.2 (Appointment and Replacement of Arbitrator). Upon the request of either party, the determination contemplated by this Section 10.13(a) can be submitted to a second arbitrator chosen in accordance with Section 10.2 (Appointment and Replacement of Arbitrator). In the event the second arbitrator determines that the impartiality or independence of the Arbitrator can reasonably be questioned, then the Parties will select a new Arbitrator, as necessary, pursuant to Section 10.2 (Appointment and Replacement of Arbitrator) from a list that shall not include the second arbitrator who made the determination. If the Arbitrator makes a determination that the impartiality or independence of the Arbitrator cannot reasonably be questioned, then the Arbitrator shall remain engaged as provided in This Agreement.

 

 (b) No Party or its Representative shall, unless the Parties agree, or if there is an arbitration proceeding pending, unless all of the parties to the arbitration proceeding agree, communicate ex parte with the Arbitrator, except that the Arbitrator may conduct any communication or proceeding on an ex parte basis if the Arbitrator determines that the non-appearing Party or Parties received reasonable advance notice thereof and did not provide reasonable justification for their failure to appear, or if the Arbitrator, upon notice to all Parties, deems such communication necessary.

 

 10.14. _Confidentiality._ All aspects of the arbitration shall be private and confidential. The Parties agree that all consultants and witnesses shall agree to treat their work and the proceedings as confidential. The Parties and the Arbitrator shall maintain the substance of any proceedings in confidence and make disclosures to others only as required by law.

Released Parties and from any and all Actions and Liabilities of any nature,
in each case whether known or unknown, against them that any of the Medtronic
Releasing Parties, or anyone claiming through or under them, ever had, now
has or hereafter can or may ever have for, based upon, arising out of, or in
connection with, any matter, act, fact, cause, or thing before the Closing,
including anything that was or could have been alleged or asserted in the
Litigation or any malicious prosecution or similar claim arising out of the
Litigation, _except_ in all cases for Encumbrances, Actions and Liabilities
based upon, arising out of, or in connection with This Agreement, including
any Losses. Each of the Medtronic Releasing Parties hereby jointly and
severally irrevocably, perpetually and forever releases and discharges each of
the Michelson Released Parties insurers with respect to any Encumbrances,
Actions and Liabilities to which the Medtronic Releasing Parties release the
Michelson Released Parties in this Section 11.1. This Agreement is not an
acknowledgement of liability of any Party but is entered into to resolve all
issues between the Medtronic Releasing Parties and the Michelson Released
Parties.

 

 11.2. _Sellers Release._ As of the Closing, and to the fullest extent allowed by law, each of the Sellers, on its own behalf and on behalf of each of its Affiliates, and, to the extent permitted by law, on behalf of each of their respective predecessors, heirs, beneficiaries, trustees, principals, agents, employees, representatives, contractors, successors, assigns, servants, attorneys and other professionals, officers, directors, members, partners, subsidiaries, stockholders (collectively, the " _Michelson Releasing Parties_ ") hereby jointly and severally irrevocably, perpetually and forever releases and discharges each of the Medtronic Parties and each of its Affiliates and their respective predecessors, principals, agents, employees, representatives, contractors, successors, assigns, servants, attorneys and other professionals, officers, directors, members, partners, subsidiaries, stockholders (collectively, the " _Medtronic Released Parties_ ") from any and all Encumbrances in favor of any of the Michelson Releasing Parties on the assets of the Medtronic Released Parties and from any and all Actions and Liabilities of any nature, in each case whether known or unknown, against them that any of the Michelson Releasing Parties, or anyone claiming through or under them, ever had, now has or hereafter can or may ever have for, based upon, arising out of, or in connection with, any matter, act, fact, cause, or thing before the Closing, including anything that was or could have been alleged or asserted in the Litigation or any malicious prosecution or similar claim arising out of the Litigation, _except_ in all cases for Encumbrances, Actions and Liabilities based upon, arising out of, or in connection with This Agreement, including any Losses. Each of the Michelson Releasing Parties hereby jointly and severally irrevocably, perpetually and forever releases and discharges each of the Medtronic Released Parties insurers with respect to any Encumbrances, Actions and Liabilities to which the Michelson Releasing Parties release the Medtronic Released Parties in this Section 11.2. This Agreement is not an acknowledgement of liability of any Party but is entered into to resolve all issues between the Michelson Releasing Parties and the Medtronic Released Parties.

 

 11.3. _Waiver._ As part of the consideration and as inducement for the execution of This Agreement, as of the Closing, the Parties and each of them, with full knowledge and with the specific intent to release Actions and Liabilities as set forth in Sections 11.1 and 11.2, hereby waive the provisions of Section 1542 of the California Civil Code (and any state statute or legal doctrine similar to California Civil Code § 1542). Section 1542 reads as follows: 

       | GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR
DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT IN HIS FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE,
WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS SETTLEMENT WITH THE
DEBTOR.  |   
---|---|--- 
     

Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 1542 (or any state statute or legal
doctrine similar to California Civil Code §1542) and for the purpose of
implementing a full and complete release of Actions and Liabilities as set
forth in Sections 11.1 and 11.2, the Parties, and each of them, expressly
acknowledge that This Agreement is intended to include in its effect, without
limitation, all Actions and Liabilities as set forth in Sections 11.1 and 11.2
and that This Agreement further contemplates the 

   
  
  extinction of all such Actions and Liabilities, except as otherwise specified
in such Sections. Each Party waives any right to assert that any such Action
or Liability has, through ignorance, oversight or otherwise, been
omitted from This Agreement, and further assumes full responsibility for any
injury, damages, losses or liability of any kind, that it has or may
hereafter incur from such waiver.

Subject to the foregoing, This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties named herein and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

 

 12.5. _Counterparts._ This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.

the provisions of Section 10 (Arbitration) shall be governed by the Act as
then in force.

 

 12.9. _Jurisdiction; Venue; Service of Process._ Any Action to enforce, vacate or remand any arbitration award or arbitration order pursuant to Section 10 (Arbitration) (each, an " _Arbitration Action_ ") shall be brought in the state courts of the State of New York or the United States District Court located in the Southern District of the State of New York.

 12.11. _Severability._ Any term or provision of This Agreement that is invalid or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions hereof or the validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in any other situation or in any other jurisdiction.
