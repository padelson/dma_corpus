 **ARTICLE III**

 



 

 **TREATMENT OF SHARES**

 



 

Section 3.1 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time of the Subsidiary
Merger, by virtue of the Subsidiary Merger and without any action on the part
of any stockholder of Merger Sub or stockholders of HGI:

 



 

(a) _Stock Owned by the Surviving Company_. Each share of common stock of HGI
owned by the Surviving Company issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time of the Subsidiary Merger shall remain outstanding and owned by
the Surviving Company.

 



 

(b) _Stock Not Owned by the Surviving Company_. Each issued and outstanding
share of common stock of HGI, excluding any restricted stock held by any
officer, director or employee of HGI pursuant to a HGI Stock Plan, which
restricted stock will be handled in accordance with _Section 3.2(b)_ hereof,
that is not owned by the Surviving Company immediately prior to the Effective
Time of the Subsidiary Merger shall be converted into the right to receive
$60.00 in cash (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). All such shares of HGI, when
converted shall no longer be considered outstanding and shall automatically be
cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each Certificate
previously evidencing such shares shall thereafter represent only the right to
receive the Merger Consideration. The holders of Certificates previously
evidencing shares of HGI outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
of the Subsidiary Merger shall cease to have any rights with respect to HGI
except as otherwise provided herein and, upon the surrender of such
Certificates, shall have only the right to receive for their shares of HGI the
Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon. Each share of common stock
of HGI held in the treasury of HGI immediately prior to the Effective Time of
the Subsidiary Merger shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall
cease to exist and no consideration shall be paid in exchange for such shares.

 



 

(c) _Stock of Merger Sub_. Each share of capital stock of Merger Sub issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Subsidiary
Merger shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist.

 



 

Section 3.2 _HGI Stock Options and Related Matters_.

 



 

(a) As of and subject to the occurrence of the Effective Time of the
Subsidiary Merger, each outstanding option, warrant, or similar right
(including any related stock appreciation right) (an " _Option_ ") issued,
awarded, or granted pursuant to any plan, agreement, or arrangement of HGI or
any Subsidiary of HGI and entitling the holder thereof to purchase one or more
shares of HGI or to acquire or purchase any restricted stock, restricted stock
unit,

 



      
 

 



 

performance stock unit, deferred stock unit or other right, contingent or
accrued, to acquire or receive shares or benefits measured by the value of
such shares under any stock incentive plans or stock award plan of HGI,
including those identified on _Section 3.2(a)_ of the HGI Disclosure Schedule
(the " _HGI Stock Plans_ ") shall, as of the Effective Time of the Subsidiary
Merger, become fully vested regardless of the vesting schedule contained in
any Option agreement or any of the HGI Stock Plans. At the Effective Time of
the Subsidiary Merger, after giving effect to any such vesting, each Option
shall be cancelled, and each holder of a cancelled Option shall be entitled to
receive, in consideration for the cancellation of such Option, an amount in
cash equal to the result obtained when the number of shares of HGI with
respect to which such cancelled Option has not been exercised as of the
cancellation of such Option is multiplied by the excess of the Merger
Consideration over the exercise price per share of such cancelled Option (such
result obtained, the " _Spread_ "). The total consideration to be paid for the
cancellation of all Options is hereinafter referred to as the " _Option
Cancellation Consideration_ ". The amount of Option Cancellation Consideration
to be delivered to the holder of any such Options shall be subject to
reduction to satisfy applicable withholding Tax obligations. With respect to
each such Option, HGI shall, in cooperation with Nationwide Mutual and its
Representatives, take, or cause to be taken, prior to the Effective Time of
the Subsidiary Merger, all such action so that each such Option shall be
automatically cancelled as of the Effective Time of the Subsidiary Merger and
the holders of each such Option shall be entitled to receive from the
Surviving Subsidiary, at the Effective Time of the Subsidiary Merger or as
soon as practicable thereafter, only an amount in cash equal to the Spread, if
any, in exchange for the cancellation of such Option, subject in each case to
applicable withholding Tax obligations.

 



 

(b) (i) Each restricted stock, restricted stock unit award, each performance
stock unit award, each deferred stock unit award, and each other right,
contingent or accrued, to acquire or receive shares or benefits measured by
the value of such shares, and each award of any kind consisting of shares that
may be held, awarded, outstanding, payable or reserved for issuance under any
HGI Stock Plan, other than Options (each, a " _Company Stock Award_ "), that
is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Subsidiary
Merger (for the avoidance of doubt, excluding any rights under the ESPP)
shall, to the extent then unvested, immediately vest and become
nonforfeitable, and (ii) each Company Stock Award that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Subsidiary Merger shall be
cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash, without
interest, equal to the product of (A) the aggregate number of shares in
respect of such Company Stock Award multiplied by (B) the Merger
Consideration, less any Taxes required to be withheld in accordance with
_Section 3.3(i)_ (the " _Stock-Based Consideration_ "). The Stock-Based
Consideration will be paid as promptly as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time of the Subsidiary Merger (and no later than fifteen (15)
Business Days after the Effective Time of the Subsidiary Merger), except, in
each case, as otherwise required under the applicable HGI Stock Plans or any
payment election made by an individual award holder in respect of the
applicable Company Stock Award. The Parties intend that all payments of Stock-
Based Consideration will comply with or be exempt from the provisions of
Section 409A of the Code.

 



 

(c) Following the date of this Agreement, no new offering period will be
commenced under the HGI Amended and Restated Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the
" _ESPP_ "). The offering period under the ESPP that is in effect as of the
date of this Agreement (the " _ESPP Current Offering Period_ ") will terminate
as set forth in the ESPP or, if earlier, immediately prior

 



       
 

 



 

to the Effective Time of the Subsidiary Merger (such earlier time, the " _ESPP
Termination Time_ "). Any funds accumulated under the ESPP during the ESPP
Current Offering Period will be used, as of the ESPP Termination Time, to
acquire shares of common stock of HGI in accordance with the terms of the
ESPP. As of the Effective Time, the ESPP will be terminated.

 



 

(d) Following the date of this Agreement, no new offering period will be
commenced under the HGI Agency Stock Purchase Plan (the " _ASPP_ "). The
offering period under the ASPP that is in effect as of the date of this
Agreement (the " _ASPP Current Offering Period_ ") will terminate as set forth
in the ASPP or, if earlier, immediately prior to the Effective Time (such
earlier time, the " _ASPP Termination Time_ "). Any funds accumulated under
the ASPP during the ASPP Current Offering Period will be used, as of the ASPP
Termination Time, to acquire shares of common stock of HGI in accordance with
the terms of the ASPP. As of the Effective Time, the ASPP will be terminated.

 



 

Section 3.3 _Payment for Shares of HGI_.

 



 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time of the Subsidiary Merger, Merger Sub shall
appoint a firm of national reputation to act as exchange agent (the "
_Exchange Agent_ "). At or prior to the Effective Time of the Subsidiary
Merger, Nationwide Mutual shall deposit, or Nationwide Mutual shall otherwise
take all steps necessary to cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent in
an account (the " _Exchange Fund_ ") the aggregate consideration to which
stockholders of HGI other than the Surviving Company, holders of Options, and
holders of Company Stock Awards shall be entitled at the Effective Time of the
Subsidiary Merger pursuant to _Section 3.1(b)_.

 



 

(b) Promptly after the Effective Time of the Subsidiary Merger, Merger Sub
shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each record holder (other than the
Surviving Company) of certificates (the " _Certificates_ ") that immediately
prior to the Effective Time of the Subsidiary Merger represented shares of
HGI, a form of letter of transmittal which shall specify that delivery shall
be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only
upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent. Prior to the
Effective Time, Merger Sub and HGI shall cooperate to establish procedures
with the Exchange Agent and the Depository Trust Company (" _DTC_ ") to ensure
that (i) if the Closing occurs at or prior to 11:30 a.m. (New York time) on
the Closing Date, the Exchange Agent will transmit to DTC or its nominees on
the Closing Date an amount in cash in immediately available funds equal to the
number of shares of HGI held of record by DTC or such nominee immediately
prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Merger Consideration (such
amount, the " _DTC Payment_ "), and (ii) if the Closing occurs after 11:30
a.m. (New York time) on the Closing Date, the Exchange Agent will transmit to
DTC or its nominees on the first (1st) Business Day after the Closing Date an
amount in cash in immediately available funds equal to the DTC Payment.

 



 

(c) In effecting the payment of the Merger Consideration with respect to
shares of HGI represented by Certificates entitled to payment of the Merger
Consideration pursuant to _Section 3.1(b)_ (the " _Cashed Shares_ "), upon
the surrender of each such Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall pay the
record holder of such Certificate the Merger Consideration multiplied by the
number of Cashed Shares, in consideration therefor. Upon such payment such
Certificate shall forthwith be cancelled.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) From and after the Effective Time of the Subsidiary Merger until
surrendered in accordance with _Section 3.3(c)_, each Certificate
representing shares of HGI (other than shares owned by the Surviving Company)
shall represent solely the right to receive the Merger Consideration relating
thereto. No interest or dividends shall be paid or accrued on the Merger
Consideration. If the Merger Consideration (or any portion thereof) is to be
delivered to any Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate
formerly representing shares of HGI surrendered therefor is registered, it
shall be a condition to the right to receive such Merger Consideration that
the Certificate so surrendered be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper
form for transfer and that the Person surrendering such shares of HGI shall
pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of
the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the record
holder of the Certificate surrendered, or shall establish to the satisfaction
of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable.

 



 

(e) Promptly following the date that is one hundred eighty (180) days after
the Effective Time of the Subsidiary Merger, the Exchange Agent shall deliver
to the Surviving Subsidiary all cash, Certificates and other documents in its
possession relating to the Transactions, and the Exchange Agents duties shall
terminate. Thereafter, each holder of a Certificate formerly representing
shares of HGI may surrender such Certificate to the Surviving Subsidiary and
(subject to applicable abandoned property, escheat, and similar Laws) receive
in consideration therefor the Merger Consideration relating thereto without
any interest or dividends thereon.

 



 

(f) After the Effective Time of the Subsidiary Merger, there shall be no
transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Subsidiary of any
shares of HGI that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time of
the Subsidiary Merger other than shares owned by the Surviving Company
immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Subsidiary Merger. If, after
the Effective Time of the Subsidiary Merger, Certificates formerly
representing shares of HGI are presented to the Surviving Subsidiary or the
Exchange Agent, they shall be surrendered and cancelled in return for the
payment of the Merger Consideration relating thereto, as provided in this
Article III.

 



 

(g) None of HGI, Merger Sub, or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any
Person in respect of any cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public
official in good faith pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat,
or similar Law.

 



 

(h) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen, or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to
be lost, stolen, or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Subsidiary,
the provision of reasonable and customary indemnity against any claim that may
be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall
issue in exchange for such lost, stolen, or destroyed Certificate the Merger
Consideration payable to such Person pursuant to this Agreement.

 



 

(i) The Surviving Subsidiary shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
Merger Consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any
holder of Options, Company Stock Awards or shares of HGI such amounts as the
Surviving Subsidiary is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the
making of such payment under the Code, or any

 



      
 

 



 

provision of state, local, or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are
so withheld by the Surviving Subsidiary, such withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder
of the shares of HGI with respect to which such deduction and withholding was
made by the Surviving Subsidiary.

 



 

Section 3.4 _Dissenting Shares_.

 



 

(a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, shares of
common stock of HGI that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time of the Subsidiary Merger and that are held by stockholders of HGI who
shall have neither voted in favor of the Subsidiary Merger nor consented
thereto in writing and who shall have demanded properly in writing appraisal
for such common stock of HGI in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL
(collectively, the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into, or
represent the right to receive, the Merger Consideration. Such stockholders of
HGI shall be entitled to receive payment of the appraised value of such shares
of common stock of HGI held by them in accordance with the provisions of such
Section 262 of the DGCL, except that all Dissenting Shares held by
stockholders of HGI who shall have failed to perfect or who effectively shall
have withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal of such shares of common
stock of HGI under such Section 262 of the DGCL shall thereupon be deemed to
have been converted into, and to have become exchangeable for, as of the
Effective Time of the Subsidiary Merger, the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, without any interest thereon, upon surrender, in the manner
provided in _Section 3.3_, of the Certificate or Certificates (or Book-Entry
Shares, as applicable) that formerly evidenced such shares of common stock of
HGI.

 



 

(b) HGI shall give Merger Sub (i) prompt notice of any demands for appraisal
received by HGI, withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments served
pursuant to the DGCL and received by HGI and (ii) the opportunity to direct
all negotiations and Proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under
the DGCL. HGI shall not, except with the prior written consent of Merger Sub,
make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal or offer to settle
or settle any such demands.

or profits of Harleysville Mutual or any Harleysville Mutual Subsidiary, nor
have Harleysville Mutual or any Harleysville Mutual Subsidiary marketed any of
their respective products in such a manner as could reasonably be expected to
create an expectation on the part of a policyholder to receive any such
dividends or distributions. Except as incurred in the Ordinary Course of
Business consistent with past practice, neither Harleysville Mutual nor any
Harleysville Mutual Subsidiary is liable to pay commissions upon the renewal
of any Insurance Contract nor is it a party to any agreement providing for the
collection of insurance premiums payable to Harleysville Mutual or any
Harleysville Mutual Subsidiary by any other Person;

 



 

(e) Harleysville Mutual has made available to Nationwide Mutual a copy of all

procedures in all material respects;

 



 

(f) No Harleysville Mutual Subsidiary is engaged in any activity that would
require registration by Harleysville Mutual or any Harleysville Mutual
Subsidiary as an investment company, broker-dealer, investment advisor or fund
administrator under any applicable state or federal Law, including the
Exchange Act, the Investment Company Act, and the Investment

(g) Neither Harleysville Mutual nor any Harleysville Mutual Subsidiary is
engaged in the business of serving as a custodian or transfer agent;

 



 

(h) Since January 1, 2008, Harleysville Mutual and each Harleysville Mutual
Subsidiary has duly and validly filed or caused to be filed all reports,
statements, documents, registrations, filings, or submissions that were
required by applicable insurance Laws to be filed; all such filings complied
with all applicable Laws when filed, and no material deficiencies have been
asserted with respect to any such filings which have not been satisfied in all
material respects, except to the extent that the failure to make any such
filing or submission would not, individually or in the aggregate, result in
any Liability to Harleysville Mutual or any Harleysville Mutual Subsidiary in
excess of $250,000;

 



 

(i) Harleysville Mutual has made available to Nationwide Mutual correct and
complete copies of all of the Harleysville Mutual Reinsurance Treaties and all
such Harleysville Mutual Reinsurance Treaties are in full force and effect,
and the consummation of the Transactions will not result in a violation or
breach of, or constitute (with or without notice or lapse of time or both) a
default (or give rise to any right of termination, cancellation or result in
the loss of any benefit) under, any of the terms, conditions or provisions of
any of the Harleysville Mutual Reinsurance Treaties. Harleysville Mutual has
reasonably concluded that all reinsurance, coinsurance or similar recoverable
amounts reflected in the Harleysville SAP Statements are collectible, and
Harleysville Mutual has no Knowledge of any material adverse change in the
financial condition of its reinsurers that might raise concern regarding their
ability to honor their reinsurance, coinsurance or similar commitments. No
party to any of the Harleysville Mutual Reinsurance Treaties has given notice
to Harleysville Mutual or any Harleysville Mutual Subsidiary that such party
intends to terminate, cancel or alter the pricing of any of the Harleysville
Mutual Reinsurance Treaties as a result of or following consummation of the
Transactions. With respect to each Harleysville Mutual Reinsurance Treaty,
there is no material default or claim of any material default thereunder by
Harleysville Mutual or any Harleysville Mutual Subsidiary that is a party
thereto or, to the Knowledge of Harleysville Mutual, by any other party
thereto, and no event has occurred that, with the passage of time or the
giving of notice or both would constitute a material default thereunder by
Harleysville Mutual or any Harleysville Mutual Subsidiary that is a party
thereto or, to the Knowledge of Harleysville Mutual, by any other party
thereto, or would permit material modification, acceleration or termination
thereof. No Harleysville Mutual Reinsurance Treaty contains any provision
providing that the other party thereto may terminate or alter the pricing of
the same by reason of the Transactions, or contains any other provision which
would be altered or otherwise become applicable by reason of the Transactions.
Since December 31, 2010, no Harleysville Mutual Reinsurance Treaty has been
cancelled. Since December 31, 2010, there have been no disputes under any
Harleysville Mutual Reinsurance Treaty other than disputes in the Ordinary
Course of Business for which adequate loss reserves have been established. Any
adjustment to any Tax that results in a Tax Liability to Harleysville Mutual
caused by an agreed or otherwise determined adjustment to the allocations made
in reinsurance treaties or agreements involving Harleysville Mutual or any
Subsidiary of Harleysville Mutual shall not constitute a breach of any
representation or warranty made in this Agreement with respect to Tax matters;

compliance with all applicable Environmental Laws and except as has not
created any material Liability with respect to any HGI Real Property, nor were
Hazardous Substances from any HGI Real Property disposed of by HGI or any

Subsidiary of HGI, nor have HGI or any Subsidiary of HGI marketed any of their
respective products in such a manner as could reasonably be expected to create
an expectation on the part of a policyholder to receive any such dividends or
distributions. Except as incurred in the Ordinary Course of Business
consistent with past practice, none of the Subsidiaries of HGI is liable to
pay commissions upon the renewal of any Insurance Contract nor are any of them
party to any agreement providing for the collection of insurance premiums
payable to any Subsidiary of HGI by any other Person;

 



 

(e) HGI has made available to Nationwide Mutual a copy of all written

(h) Since January 1, 2008, each Subsidiary of HGI has duly and validly filed
or caused to be filed all reports, statements, documents, registrations,
filings, or submissions that were required by applicable insurance Laws to be
filed; all such filings complied with all applicable Laws when filed, and no
material deficiencies have been asserted with respect to any such filings
which have not been satisfied in all material respects, except to the extent
that the failure to make any such filing or submission would not, individually
or in the aggregate, result in any Liability to HGI or any Subsidiary of HGI
in excess of $250,000;

 



 

(i) HGI has made available to Nationwide Mutual correct and complete copies of
all of the HGI Reinsurance Treaties and all such HGI Reinsurance Treaties are
in full force and effect, and the consummation of the Transactions will not
result in a violation or bleach of, or constitute (with or without notice or
lapse of time or both) a default (or give rise to any right of

 



      
 

 



 

termination, cancellation or result in the loss of any benefit) under, any of
the terms, conditions or provisions of any of the HGI Reinsurance Treaties.
HGI has reasonably concluded that all reinsurance, coinsurance or similar
recoverable amounts reflected in the HGI Statements are collectible, and HGI
has no Knowledge of any material adverse change in the financial condition of
its reinsurers that might raise concern regarding their ability to honor their
reinsurance, coinsurance or similar commitments. No party to any of the HGI
Reinsurance Treaties has given notice to HGI or any Subsidiary of HGI that
such party intends to terminate, cancel or alter the pricing of any of the HGI
Reinsurance Treaties as a result of or following consummation of the
Transactions. With respect to each HGI Reinsurance Treaty, there is no
material default or claim of any material default thereunder by HGI or any
Subsidiary of HGI that is a party thereto or, to the Knowledge of HGI, by any
other party thereto, and no event has occurred that, with the passage of time
or the giving of notice or both would constitute a material default thereunder
by HGI or any Subsidiary of HGI that is a party thereto or, to the Knowledge
of HGI, by any other party thereto, or would permit material modification,
acceleration or termination thereof. No HGI Reinsurance Treaty contains any
provision providing that the other party thereto may terminate or alter the
pricing of the same by reason of the Transactions, or contains any other
provision which would be altered or otherwise become applicable by reason of
the Transactions. Since December 31, 2010, no HGI Reinsurance Treaty has been
cancelled. Since December 31, 2010, there have been no disputes under any HGI
Reinsurance Treaty other than disputes in the Ordinary Course of Business for
which adequate loss reserves have been established. Any adjustment to any Tax

correct, and complete copies of any Benefit Plan and, in the case of any
unwritten Benefit Plan or statutory Benefit Plan, descriptions thereof, all
agreements, including insurance Contracts, all amendments thereto and, with
respect to any such plans or plan amendments, and if applicable, the most
recent determination letter issued by the IRS with respect to each Benefit
Plan subject to Section 401(a) of the Code, and, to the extent applicable, the

been revoked nor, to the Knowledge of HGI, has revocation been threatened, and
no Benefit Plan has been amended since the date of its most recent
determination letter or application therefor, which is reasonably likely to
adversely affect qualification of such Benefit Plan.

payable to any director or officer of HGI or any Subsidiaries of HGI under any

Nationwide Mutual Disclosure Schedule will be deemed to be disclosed for all
purposes of this Agreement and all other sections and subsections of the
Nationwide Mutual Disclosure Schedule

 



      
 

 



 

to which it is readily apparent that the matters so disclosed are applicable,
but will expressly not be deemed to constitute an admission by Nationwide
Mutual, or otherwise to imply, that any such matter rises to the level of a
Material Adverse Effect or is otherwise material for purposes of this
Agreement or the Nationwide Mutual Disclosure Schedule):

 



 

Section 6.1 _Representations and Warranties of Nationwide Mutual_.

 



 

(a) _Organization and Qualification_. Nationwide Mutual is a mutual insurance
company duly organized, validly existing, and in good standing under the Laws
of the State of Ohio and has the requisite corporate power and authority to
conduct its Business as it is currently being conducted. Nationwide Mutual is
duly qualified to do business, and is in good standing, in the jurisdictions
where the character of its Assets owned or leased or the nature of its
Business makes such qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so
qualified or in good standing would not, individually or in the aggregate, be
reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect. Nationwide Mutual
possesses an Insurance License in Ohio and in each other jurisdiction in which
Nationwide Mutual is required to possess an Insurance License. All such
Insurance Licenses, including authorizations to transact reinsurance, are in
full force and effect without amendment, limitation or restriction, and

renew, limitation, suspension or restriction of any such Insurance License.

this Agreement and the Transactions.

 



 

(ii) This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by
Nationwide Mutual and (assuming this Agreement is a valid and binding
obligation of the Harleysville Parties) constitutes a valid and binding
agreement of Nationwide Mutual enforceable against Nationwide Mutual in
accordance with its terms, except that: (A) such enforcement may be subject to
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, or other similar Laws now
or hereafter in effect relating to creditors rights generally, and (B) the
remedy of specific performance and injunctive relief may be subject to
equitable defenses and to the discretion of the court before which any
Proceeding therefor may be brought.

 



      
 

 



 

(iii) The Board of Directors of Nationwide Mutual has received the opinion of
Nationwide Mutuals financial advisor, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, to the
effect that the Parent Merger is fair to the policyholders of Nationwide
Mutual, taken as a group, from a financial point of view.

 



 

(c) _No Violation; Government Filings_.

 



 

(i) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by Nationwide
Mutual and the consummation by Nationwide Mutual of the Transactions will not:
(A) constitute a breach or violation of or default under the Articles of
Incorporation or the Code of Regulations (or similar organizational documents)
of Nationwide Mutual, (B) violate, conflict with, or result in a breach of any
provisions of, or constitute a default (or an event which, with notice or
lapse of time or both, would constitute a default) under, or result in the
termination or cancellation of, or accelerate the performance required by, or
result in a right of termination, cancellation or acceleration under, or
result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the Assets of Nationwide Mutual
under, any of the terms, conditions, or provisions of any Contract to which
Nationwide Mutual is a party or to which it or any of its Assets may be
subject, or (C) constitute a breach or violation of or default under any
Environmental Permit, Law, Order or License to which Nationwide Mutual is
subject other than, in the case of _clauses (B)_ and _(C)_ , for any such
breaches, violations, conflicts, terminations, defaults, accelerations, or
Liens that are not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably likely to
have a Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(ii) No Consent or Filing of or with any Person is required with respect to
Nationwide Mutual in connection with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement by Nationwide Mutual and the consummation by Nationwide Mutual of
the Transactions except for: (A) the approval of the Meeting Notice by the

Investment Company Act and the Investment Advisers Act, (H) such Consents and
Filings as may be required by any applicable state securities or blue sky
Laws, and (I) such other such Consents or Filings, the failure of which to
make or obtain would not, individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably
likely to prevent or be a material impediment to the consummation of the
Transactions or be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect.

(i) The Harleysville Parties shall not, and shall cause their Subsidiaries not
to, and shall not authorize or permit the directors, officers, employees, and
Representatives of the Harleysville Parties or any of their Subsidiaries to,
directly or indirectly, (A) solicit, initiate, or knowingly facilitate,

constitutes an Alternative Transaction Proposal, or (B) subject to _Section
7.2(b)_, enter into, continue, or otherwise participate in any discussions or
negotiations regarding, or furnish to any Person any information with respect
to, or cooperate in any way that would lead to, any Alternative Transaction
Proposal. Without limiting the foregoing, any violation of the restrictions
set forth in this _Section 7.2(a)_ by either of the Harleysville Parties or
any of their Subsidiaries or their respective directors, officers, employees,
or Representatives shall be deemed to be a

 



      
 

 



 

breach of this _Section 7.2(a)_ by Harleysville Mutual and HGI and shall be
cause for termination of this Agreement by the Nationwide Parties.

 



 

(ii) The Harleysville Parties will, and will cause each of their Subsidiaries
and each of the directors, officers, employees, and Representatives of the
Harleysville Parties and their Subsidiaries to, immediately cease and cause to
be terminated any and all existing activities, discussions, or negotiations
with any Person conducted heretofore with respect to any Alternative
Transaction Proposal and will not authorize or permit any of their
Representatives to engage in any activities, discussions, or negotiations with
any Person with respect to any Alternative Transaction Proposal. The
Harleysville Parties will, and will cause each of their Subsidiaries to,
enforce, and, except where the Harleysville Party determines, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and its financial advisors, that
failure to take such action would reasonably be likely to constitute a breach
of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, will not waive any provisions
of, any confidentiality or standstill agreement (or any similar agreement) to
which either of the Harleysville Parties or any of their Subsidiaries is a
party relating to any such Alternative Transaction Proposal. Harleysville
Mutual or HGI, as applicable, will promptly request each Person that has
heretofore executed a confidentiality agreement in connection with its
consideration of any Alternative Transaction Proposal to return or destroy all
Confidential Information furnished prior to the execution of this Agreement to
or for the benefit of such Person by or on behalf of such Harleysville Party
or any of its Subsidiaries. The Harleysville Parties agree that they will take
the necessary steps to promptly inform their directors, officers, employees,
and Representatives of the obligations undertaken in this _Section 7.2_.

 



 

(b) _Superior Proposal_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
_Section 7.2(a)_ or elsewhere in this Agreement, in the event that HGI
receives after the date of this Agreement and prior to obtaining the approval
of the stockholders contemplated by _Section 8.2_ an unsolicited, bona fide
written Alternative Transaction Proposal which the Board of Directors of HGI
reasonably determines (after consultation with its outside legal counsel and
its financial advisor) to be a Superior Proposal, HGI may then take the
following actions:

 



 

(i) Furnish any information with respect to HGI, Harleysville Mutual and their
Subsidiaries to the Person or group (and their respective Representatives)
making such Alternative Transaction Proposal; _provided_ , _that_ (A) prior to
furnishing any such information, it receives from such Person or group an
executed confidentiality agreement containing confidentiality terms at least
as restrictive as the terms contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, dated
as of March 21, 2011, among the Parties (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "),
and (B) contemporaneously with furnishing any such information to such Person
or group, it furnishes such information to Nationwide Mutual; and

 



 

(ii) Engage in discussions or negotiations with such Person or group (and
their Representatives) with respect to such Alternative Transaction Proposal.

 



 

Nothing contained herein shall prevent HGI from disclosing to the stockholders
of HGI a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated
under the Exchange Act

 



      
 

 



 

with regard to an Alternative Transaction Proposal if HGI determines, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel, that failure to disclose such
position would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with applicable Law.

 



 

(c) _Notification_. In addition to the obligations of the Harleysville Parties
set forth in _Sections 7.2(a)_ , _(b)_ , and _(d)_ , as promptly as
practicable (and in any event within one (1) Business Day) after receipt of
any Alternative Transaction Proposal, any request for nonpublic information,
or any inquiry relating in any way to, or that would reasonably be expected to
lead to, any Alternative Transaction Proposal, HGI and Harleysville Mutual
shall provide Nationwide Mutual with written notice of the material terms and
conditions of such Alternative Transaction Proposal, request, or inquiry, and
the identity of the Person or group making any such Alternative Transaction
Proposal, request, or inquiry, and a copy of all written materials provided to
it in connection with such Alternative Transaction Proposal, request, or
inquiry. In addition, HGI and Harleysville Mutual shall provide Nationwide
Mutual as promptly as practicable (and in any event within one (1) Business
Day) with all information as is reasonably necessary to keep Nationwide Mutual
fully informed of all material written communications regarding, and the
status and changes to the economic or other material terms of, any such
Alternative Transaction Proposal, request, or inquiry, and shall provide, as
promptly as reasonably practicable, to Nationwide Mutual a copy of all
material written materials (including material written materials provided by
email or otherwise in electronic format) provided by or to HGI, its, or any of
its Representatives or to Harleysville Mutual in connection with such
Alternative Transaction Proposal, request, or inquiry. Each of HGI and
Harleysville Mutual shall provide Nationwide Mutual with three (3) days prior
notice (or such lesser prior notice as is provided to the members of its Board
of Directors) of any meeting of its Board of Directors at which its Board of
Directors is reasonably expected to consider any Alternative Transaction
Proposal.

 



 

(d) _Changes of Recommendation; Termination_. Neither of the Boards of
Directors of HGI or Harleysville Mutual nor any committee thereof shall,
directly, or indirectly, (i) (A) withdraw or qualify (or amend or modify in a
manner adverse to Nationwide Mutual) or publicly propose to withdraw or
qualify (or amend or modify in a manner adverse to Nationwide Mutual), the
approval, recommendation, or declaration of advisability by such Board of
Directors or any committee thereof of this Agreement, the Mergers, or the
other Transactions, or (B) recommend, adopt, or approve, or propose publicly
to recommend, adopt, or approve, any Alternative Transaction Proposal, or (ii)
approve or recommend, or publicly propose to approve or recommend, or allow
HGI or Harleysville Mutual, any of their Subsidiaries, or any of their
Affiliates to execute or enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition
agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement,
or other similar agreement, arrangement or understanding (A) constituting, or
relating to, any Alternative Transaction Proposal, or (B) requiring it (or
that would require it) to abandon, terminate, or fail to consummate any of the
Mergers or any other Transaction (any of the foregoing actions being referred
to herein as an " _Adverse Recommendation Change_ "). Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary set forth in this _Section 7.2(d)_ or in any other provision
of this Agreement, the Board of Directors of HGI may, solely in response to a
Superior Proposal, terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 10.1(h)_ and
concurrently enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such Superior
Proposal and make

 



      
 

 



 

an Adverse Recommendation Change to its stockholders, if, and only if, all of
the following conditions in _clauses (i)_ through _(vi)_ are met:

 



 

(i) such Superior Proposal has been made and has not been withdrawn and
continues to be a Superior Proposal;

 



 

(ii) the approval of this Agreement and the Transactions by the stockholders
of HGI has not been obtained;

 



 

(iii) HGI has (A) provided to Nationwide Mutual five (5) Business Days prior
written notice that states (1) HGI has received a Superior Proposal, (2) the
material terms and conditions of the Superior Proposal (including the per
share value of the consideration offered therein and the identity of the
Person or group of Persons making the Superior Proposal) and copies of the
relevant proposed transaction agreements with the Person or group of Persons
making such Superior Proposal and other material documents, including the
definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal (it being
understood and agreed that any amendment to the financial terms or any other
material term of such Superior Proposal shall require a new notice and a new
five (5) Business Day period), and (3) it intends to terminate this Agreement,
and the manner in which it intends to do so, and (B) prior to terminating this
Agreement, to the extent requested by Nationwide Mutual, engaged in good faith
negotiations with Nationwide Mutual to amend this Agreement in such a manner
that the Alternative Transaction Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior
Proposal;

 



 

(iv) the Board of Directors of HGI has determined in good faith after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and its financial advisers, that,
in light of such Superior Proposal and taking into account any revised terms
offered by Nationwide Mutual, the failure to terminate this Agreement and
accept the Superior Proposal would reasonably be likely to constitute a breach
of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law;

 



 

(v) HGI and Harleysville Mutual shall have complied with _Section 7.2(a)_ and
shall not have breached any of the other provisions set forth in this _Section
7.2_ in any material respect; and

 



 

(vi) HGI pays all fees and expenses as required pursuant to _Section 10.3_.

herein provided, each of the Parties hereto agrees to use all reasonable best
efforts to promptly take, or cause to be taken, all action to do, or cause to
be done, and to assist and cooperate with each of the other Parties hereto in

consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the
Transactions, including (i) the actions set forth in Article VIII, (ii) the

disruption consistent with the past practice of each of the Parties, (v) the
defending of any Proceedings challenging this Agreement or the consummation of
the Transactions, the defense of which shall, at the request of any of the
Parties, be conducted jointly by the Nationwide Parties and the Harleysville

delisting of the shares of common stock of HGI from NASDAQ and terminating its
registration under the Exchange Act; provided that such delisting and
termination shall not be effective until after the Effective Time of the
Subsidiary Merger, (vii) subject to applicable Law, the developing of a joint
plan with respect to the retention of the Harleysville Parties, and their
respective Subsidiaries, customers, policyholders, Producers and employees,
(viii) the amendment, modification, or termination of any reinsurance,
pooling, cost or Tax allocation, services, management or other Contracts
between the Harleysville Parties and/or their respective Subsidiaries and
Affiliates effective as of the Effective Time, (ix) the response to inquiries
of, and presentations to, rating agencies, and (x) developing integration
plans; and each of the Parties hereto further agrees to refrain from taking

Approvals or the Transactions to be substantially conditioned or delayed.

permitted to be taken pursuant to _Section 7.2_.

Affiliates as Nationwide Mutual may reasonably request.

 



 

(b) Unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Parties, each of the Parties
agrees (i) except as required by Law, to keep all Confidential Information
confidential and not to disclose or reveal any Confidential Information to any
Person other than those Persons employed by it or on its behalf who are
actively and directly participating in the planning, negotiation, and
implementation of the Transactions or who otherwise need to know the

maintain or improve the philanthropic and charitable contributions and

Disclosure Schedule consistent with the historical practices of Harleysville

limitations, evidence of insurability, exclusions and waiting periods with

Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents to the same extent such
limitations are waived under any comparable plan of HGI; and (d) give each
Continuing Employee service credit based upon such Continuing Employees
service credit with HGI, Subsidiaries of HGI, Harleysville Mutual, and
Harleysville Mutual Subsidiaries for purposes of eligibility to participate
and vesting credit under each applicable Benefit Plan of the Nationwide
Parties or its Affiliates (but, for avoidance of doubt, excluding benefit
accrual under any defined benefit pension plan, cash-balance plan, or retiree
medical) and entitlement to benefits under each severance or vacation plan of
the Nationwide Parties or its Affiliates, in each case, as if such service had
been performed with the Nationwide Parties or its Affiliates. Without limiting
the generality of _Section 11.7_, this _Section 7.10_ shall be binding upon
and inure solely to the benefit of each of the Parties to this Agreement, and
nothing in it, expressed or implied, is intended to confer upon any other
Person any rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever and, specifically but
without limiting the generality of the foregoing, nothing in it will create
any third party beneficiary rights in any current or former employee, director
or individual independent contractor of the Harleysville Parties or any of
their Subsidiaries in respect of continued employment (or resumed employment)
or service or any other matter.

made, incentive compensation payments, to each employee eligible therefor and
who is an employee on the date such payment is made, in an amount equal to the
difference between (i) the 2011 target incentive compensation for such

any of its Affiliates (including, for this purpose, HGI) after the Closing

shall receive the payment contemplated by this _Section 7.11_ on the earlier
of the payment date or such termination date.

 



 

Section 7.12 _Retention of Executive Officers_. Between the date hereof and
the Closing, Nationwide Mutual will offer retention bonus arrangements to the
executive officers of HGI listed in, and on principal terms consistent with,
_Section 7.12_ of the Nationwide Mutual Disclosure Schedule.

 



 

Section 7.13 _Agreement to Defend; Stockholder and Policyholder Litigation_.
In the event any claim or Proceeding by any Governmental Entity or other
Person is commenced that questions the validity or legality of the
Transactions or seeks damages in connection therewith, the Parties agree to

thereto. The Harleysville Parties shall give Nationwide Mutual reasonable
opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any policyholder or

by any of the Nationwide Parties by written notice to the Harleysville Parties
if the Mergers shall not have been consummated as a result of the condition
set forth in _Section 9.1(c)_ failing to have been satisfied, but (i) the
extending Party reasonably believes that the relevant approvals will be
obtained during such extension period and (ii) each of the other conditions to
the consummation of the Mergers set forth in Article IX has been satisfied or
waived or remains reasonably capable of satisfaction; provided, further, that
the Outside Date shall, without any action on the part of any of the Parties,
be extended day-by-day for each day during which any Party shall at any time
after the date of this Agreement be subject to a non-final or appealable Order
that has the effect of making either of the Mergers or the acquisition of
shares of common stock of HGI by Merger Sub or any Affiliate thereof illegal
or otherwise preventing or prohibiting the consummation of the Transactions;
provided, further, that the right

 



       
 

 



 

to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _clause (b)_ shall not be
available to the Party seeking to terminate this Agreement if such Partys
breach of this Agreement has been the cause of the failure of the Effective
Time to occur; or

 



 

(c) by any of the Harleysville Parties or the Nationwide Parties if the number
of votes in favor of this Agreement cast by the Members of Nationwide Mutual
required for the consummation of the Parent Merger shall not have been
obtained at the meeting of its Members or at any adjournment thereof duly held
for such purpose; or

 



 

(d) by any of the Harleysville Parties or the Nationwide Parties if the number
of votes in favor of this Agreement cast by the Members of Harleysville Mutual
required for the consummation of the Parent Merger shall not have been
obtained at the meeting of its Members or at any adjournment thereof duly held
for such purpose; or

 



 

(e) by any of the Harleysville Parties or the Nationwide Parties if the number
of votes in favor of this Agreement cast by the stockholders of HGI required
for the consummation of the Subsidiary Merger shall not have been obtained at
the meeting of the stockholders of HGI or at any adjournment thereof duly held
for such purpose; or

 



 

(f) by either Harleysville Party if either Nationwide Party (i) breaches or
fails in any material respect to perform or comply with any of its material
covenants and agreements contained herein, or (ii) breaches its
representations and warranties in any material respect and such breach would
have, or is reasonably likely to have, a Material Adverse Effect, in each case
such that the conditions set forth in _Section 9.1_ or _Section 9.2_ would
not be satisfied; _provided_ , _however_ , that if any such breach is curable
by the Outside Date (as may be extended hereunder) by the Nationwide Parties
through the exercise of their reasonable best efforts and for so long as the
Nationwide Parties shall be so using their reasonable best efforts to cure
such breach, the Harleysville Parties may not terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this _Section 10.1(f)_; or

 



 

(g) by either Nationwide Party if either Harleysville Party (i) breaches or
fails in any material respect to perform or comply with any of its material
covenants and agreements contained herein, or (ii) breaches its
representations and warranties in any material respect and such breach would
have, or is reasonably likely to have, a Material Adverse Effect on the
Harleysville Parties and their Subsidiaries taken as a whole, in each case
such that the conditions set forth in _Section 9.1_ or _Section 9.3_ would
not be satisfied; _provided_ , _however_ , that if any such breach is curable
by the Outside Date (as may be extended hereunder) by the Harleysville Parties
through the exercise of their reasonable best efforts and for so long as the
Harleysville Parties shall be so using their reasonable best efforts to cure
such breach, the Nationwide Parties may not terminate this Agreement pursuant
to this _Section 10.1(g)_; or

 



 

(h) by the Board of Directors of HGI if all of the conditions set forth in
_Section 7.2(d)(i)_ through _(vi)_ have been met;

 



 

(i) by either Nationwide Party upon the occurrence of (i) a Harleysville
Material Adverse Change or (ii) a Material Adverse Effect with respect to the
Harleysville Parties taken as a whole; or

 



      
 

 



 

(j) by either Nationwide Party upon a knowing and intentional breach, in any
material respect, of _Section 7.2(a)(i)_ by either of the Harleysville
Parties.

 



 

Section 10.2 _Effect of Termination_.

 



 

In the event of the termination of this Agreement by any Party as provided in
_Section 10.1_, written notice thereof shall forthwith be given to the other
Parties specifying the provision hereof pursuant to which such termination is
made, this Agreement shall thereafter become void and, subject to _Section
10.3_, there shall be no Liability on the part of any Party hereto against any
other Party hereto, or on the part of their directors, officers, employees,
policyholders, stockholders, or agents (or those of any of their Subsidiaries
or Affiliates), except that (a) any such termination shall be without
prejudice to the rights of any Party hereto (or any of its Subsidiaries or
Affiliates) arising out of the willful and material breach by any other Party
of any covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement, (b) the obligations
pursuant to this _Section 10.2_, _Section 10.3_, ****_Section 7.6(b)_, and
Article XI, and (c) the Confidentiality Agreement shall survive termination.

 



 

Section 10.3 _Payments_.

 



 

(a) _Termination Fee and Expense Reimbursement_. In the event that:

 



 

(i) the Board of Directors of HGI terminates this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 10.1(h)_;

 



 

(ii) (A) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 10.1(b)_, _(d)_ ,
_(e)_ , or _(g)_ , as applicable, (B) prior to such termination, an
Alternative Transaction Proposal has been publicly announced, and (C) within
twelve (12) months of such termination, HGI enters into a definitive agreement
with any third party to consummate, or consummates, an Alternative
Transaction; or

 



 

(iii) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 10.1(j)_,

 



 

then HGI shall pay Nationwide Mutual a one-time fee equal to $29,588,535 ****
(the " _Termination Fee_ ") and shall reimburse Nationwide Mutual for its
Expenses in accordance with _Section 10.3(c)_. Any Termination Fee and
Expenses due under this _Section 10.3(a)_ shall be paid by wire transfer of
same-day funds to an account provided in writing by Nationwide Mutual to HGI
(A) in the case of termination pursuant to _clause (i)_ above, on the date of
termination of this Agreement, or (B) in the case of termination pursuant to
_clause (ii)_ above, within two (2) Business Days of the date of the first to
occur of (x) the execution of a definitive agreement relating to an
Alternative Transaction Proposal, and (y) the consummation of a transaction
relating to an Alternative Transaction.

 



 

(b) _Interest and Costs; Other Remedies_. Each of the Parties acknowledges
that the agreements contained in this _Section 10.3_ are an integral part of
the Transactions and that, without these agreements, none of the Parties would
have entered into this Agreement. Accordingly, in the event that HGI shall
fail to pay the Termination Fee and Expenses when due, and in order to obtain
such payment, Nationwide Mutual commences a suit which results in a judgment
against HGI for such fee, then HGI shall pay to Nationwide Mutual its costs
and

 



      
 

 



 

expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses of enforcement) in
connection with such suit, together with interest on the amounts owed at the
prime lending rate prevailing at such time, as published in the Wall Street
Journal, plus 2% per annum from the date such amounts were required to be paid
until the date actually received by Nationwide Mutual.

 



 

(c) _Expenses_. Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, each Party
shall bear its own Expenses in connection with this Agreement and the
Transactions, except that the Nationwide Parties and the Harleysville Parties
each shall bear and pay one-half of the filing fee paid to the FTC pursuant to
the HSR Act or to any foreign antitrust or competition Law. Furthermore, in
the event that (A) the Harleysville Parties terminate this Agreement pursuant
to _Section 10.1(f)_, then the Nationwide Parties shall reimburse the
Harleysville Parties for all of their Expenses, (B) the Nationwide Parties
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 10.1(g)_, then the Harleysville
Parties shall reimburse the Nationwide Parties for all of their Expenses, or
(C) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 10.1(h)_, then HGI, in
addition to any Termination Fee that HGI may be required to make to Nationwide
Mutual pursuant to _Section 10.3(a)_ in respect of such termination, shall
reimburse the Nationwide Parties for all of the Nationwide Parties Expenses.

 



 

For the purposes of this _Section 10.3_, " _Expenses_ " includes all
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including all reasonable fees and expenses
of counsel, accountants, financial advisors, experts and consultants to a
Party hereto and its Affiliates) incurred by a Party or on its behalf in
connection with or related to the authorization, preparation, negotiation,
execution, performance, approval by any Person, and enforcement of this
Agreement and the Transactions, including the preparation, printing, filing
and mailing of the respective Information Statements, the Proxy Statement, and
the solicitation of Member and stockholder approvals and all other matters
related to the Transactions.

Section 11.2 _Amendments_. Subject to applicable Law, this Agreement may be
amended by the Parties hereto at any time before or after the approval of this
Agreement by the Members of Nationwide Mutual or of Harleysville Mutual and
the stockholders of Merger Sub or of HGI, but after such approval, no
amendment or modification shall be made which materially adversely affects the

representations and warranties of the other Parties contained in this
Agreement or in any document delivered pursuant to this Agreement, or (c)

any of the agreements or conditions contained in this Agreement. Any agreement
on the part of a Party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if
set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such Party. Nothing
contained in this Agreement shall cause the failure of any of the Parties to
insist upon strict compliance with any covenant, obligation, condition, or
agreement contained herein to operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect
to, any such covenant, obligation, condition, or agreement by the Party
entitled to the benefit thereof.

 



 

Section 11.4 _Publicity_. So long as this Agreement is in effect, each of the
Parties hereto (a) shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, issue or
cause the publication of any press release or other announcement to any Person
with respect to this Agreement or the Transactions without the consent of the
other Parties, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed;
_provided_ , _however_ , that nothing contained in this Agreement shall (i)
limit the right of each of the Parties hereto and their Affiliates to make a
filing or communication required by

 



      
 

 



 

applicable Law, provided that such Party shall allow the other Parties a
reasonable opportunity to comment on such filing or communication in advance
thereof; (ii) prohibit any of the Parties hereto (or its Affiliates) from
initiating communications with, and making presentations to, any rating agency
or Governmental Entity relating to the Transactions if such Party gives prior
written notice thereof to the other Parties hereto, or (iii) prohibit any
Party or any of their respective Affiliates from communicating to any third
party information in any way relating to the Mergers that has been made known
to the general public, other than in violation of this Agreement, prior to the
time of such communication, (b) shall cooperate fully with the other Parties
hereto with respect to issuing or publishing any press release, or other
announcement or other written communication to any non-affiliated Person and
preparing written and oral communications to the employees and agents of each
Party hereto with the purpose of effectuating the Mergers in the best
interests of the respective Members and stockholders of the Parties, and (c)
shall promptly notify the other Parties of any communications received from
and responses provided to non-affiliated Persons, in either case, with respect
to this Agreement or the Transactions.

 



 

Section 11.5 _Headings_. The headings contained in this Agreement are for
reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement.

 



 

Section 11.6 _Non-Assignability_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the
rights, interests, or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any Party
hereto by operation of Law or otherwise without the prior written consent of
the other Parties hereto.

 



 

Section 11.7 _Beneficiaries_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure
solely to the benefit of the Parties hereto, and nothing in this Agreement,
expressed or implied, is intended to confer upon any other Person (including
any policyholder, shareholder, or Representative of any Party or their
Subsidiaries) any rights or remedies of any nature under or by reason of this
Agreement, except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement.

 



 

Section 11.8 _Duplicates; Counterparts_. This Agreement shall be executed in
duplicate and may be executed in counterparts, each of which shall be deemed
to constitute an original and constitute one and the same instrument. Delivery
of an executed counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by telecopier
or electronic mail via the portable document format (PDF) shall be as
effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement. In
proving this Agreement, it shall not be necessary to produce or account for
more than one such counterpart signed by the Party against whom enforcement is
sought.

 



 

Section 11.9 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed and enforced in accordance with the Laws of the State of Delaware
without regard to the conflict or choice of Laws rules thereof or of any other
jurisdiction.

 



 

Section 11.10 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, including the Voting
Agreement and schedules hereto and thereto, constitutes the entire agreement
between the Parties hereto and supersedes all prior agreements and
understandings, oral or written (except for the Confidentiality Agreement),
between the Parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and
thereof.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 11.11 _Severability_. If any provisions hereof shall be held invalid
or unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction or as a result of
future legislative action, such holding or action shall be strictly construed
and shall not affect the validity or effect of the remaining terms and
provisions hereof or the validity or enforceability of the offending term or
provision in any other situation or in any other jurisdiction. If the final
judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction or other authority declares that
any term or provision hereof is invalid, void or unenforceable, the Parties
agree that the court making such determination shall have the power to reduce
the scope, duration, area, or applicability of the term or provision, to
delete specific words or phrases, or to replace any invalid, void, or
unenforceable term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and
enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid
or unenforceable term or provision; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Parties
shall use reasonable efforts, including the amendment of this Agreement, to
ensure that this Agreement shall reflect as closely as practicable the intent
of the Parties hereto.

 



 

Section 11.12 _Specific Performance_. Each of the Parties hereto acknowledges
and agrees that the other Parties hereto would be irreparably damaged in the
event any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance
with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. Accordingly, each of the
Parties hereto agrees that each shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of the provisions of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically this Agreement and the terms and provisions thereof in
any action instituted in any forum specified in _Section 11.14_, in addition
to any other remedy to which any Party may be entitled, at Law, in equity, or
pursuant to this Agreement.

 



 

Section 11.13 _Counting_. If the due date for any action to be taken under
this Agreement (including the delivery of notices) is not a Business Day, then
such action shall be considered timely taken if performed on or prior to the
next Business Day following such due date.

 



 

Section 11.14 _Venue_. Each Party irrevocably agrees that any Proceeding
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or for recognition and
enforcement of any judgment in respect hereof brought by another Party or its
successors or assigns may be brought and determined exclusively in the Court
of Chancery of the State of Delaware **** (or, if such court lacks subject
matter jurisdiction, in any appropriate Delaware state or federal court), and
each of the Parties hereby irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction
of the aforesaid courts for itself and with respect to its property, generally
and unconditionally, with regard to any such Proceeding arising out of or
relating to this Agreement and the Transactions (and agrees not to commence
any Proceeding relating thereto except in such courts). Each Party further
agrees to accept service of process in any manner permitted by such courts.
Each Party hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives, and agrees not to
assert, by way of motion or as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any
Proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the Transactions,
(a) any claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the
above-named courts for any reason other than the failure lawfully to serve
process, (b) that it or its property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of
any such court or from any legal process commenced in such courts (whether
through service of notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of
execution of judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise), and (c) to the
fullest extent permitted by Law, that (i) the Proceeding in any such court is
brought in an inconvenient forum, (ii) the venue of such Proceeding is
improper, or (iii) this Agreement, or the subject matter hereof, may not be
enforced in or by such courts.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 11.15 _Joint Preparation_. The Parties have participated jointly in
the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. In the event any ambiguity or
question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed
as if drafted jointly by all Parties, and no presumption or burden of proof
shall arise favoring or disfavoring any Party by virtue of the authorship of
any provision of this Agreement.

 



 

Section 11.16 _Interpretation_.

 



 

(a) When a reference is made in this Agreement to a section or article, such
reference shall be to a section or article of this Agreement unless otherwise
clearly indicated to the contrary.

 



 

(b) Whenever the words "include," "includes," or "including" are used in this
Agreement they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without
limitation."

 



 

(c) The words "hereof," "herein," and "herewith" and words of similar import
shall, unless otherwise stated, be construed to refer to this Agreement as a
whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement, and article,
section, paragraph, exhibit, and schedule references are to the articles,
sections, paragraphs, exhibits, and schedules of this Agreement unless
otherwise specified.

 



 

(d) The plural of any defined term shall have a meaning correlative to such
defined term, and words denoting any gender shall include all genders. Where a
word or phrase is defined herein, each of its other grammatical forms shall
have a corresponding meaning.
