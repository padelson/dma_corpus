to correct any material omissions therefrom, and the Company further agrees to

ARTICLE 4

 

CONSIDERATION; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

 

SECTION 4.1. _Conversion of Merger Sub Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time,
by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger
Sub or the Company, each share of Merger Sub capital stock will be converted
into and become one fully paid and non-assessable share of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation.

 

SECTION 4.2. _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. At the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger
Sub, the Company or any Stockholder:

(a) Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than (i) any shares to be canceled
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 4.2(b)_ and (ii) any Appraisal Shares (each of
such shares described in _clauses (i)_ and _(ii)_ , an " _Excluded Share_ "
and collectively, the " _Excluded Shares_ ")) shall be canceled and shall be
converted automatically into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to
the Offer Price, without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). As of the
Effective Time, all such shares of Company Common Stock (other than the
Excluded Shares) shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of either a certificate
representing any such shares of Company Common Stock (each, a " _Certificate_
") or book-entry shares representing such shares of Company Common Stock ("
_Book-Entry Shares_ ") shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto,
except the right to receive, as the case may be, (i) the Merger Consideration
payable with respect to such shares of Company Common Stock upon surrender of
such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with  _Section_ __ _
4.3_, without interest or (ii) the payment referred to in _Section_ __ _
4.9_, in the case of each Certificate formerly representing shares of Company
Common Stock or Book-Entry Shares owned by dissenting stockholders.

(b) Each share of Company Common Stock held in the treasury of the Company and
each share of Company Common Stock owned by Parent or Merger Sub immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled without any conversion thereof
and shall cease to exist and no payment or distribution shall be made with
respect thereto.

 

SECTION 4.3. _Exchange of Certificates_.

 

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall enter into an
agreement with such bank or trust company as may be designated by Parent and
reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as agent (the " _Paying Agent_ ")
for the holders of shares of Company Common Stock to receive the funds to
which holders of such shares of Company Common Stock (other than the Excluded
Shares) shall become entitled pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 4.2_.

 



18

    

 At or immediately following (but no later than one Business Day after) the
Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with the
Paying Agent for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock
(other than Excluded Shares), a cash amount in immediately available funds
necessary for the Paying Agent to make payments under _Section_ __ _ 4.2(a)_
(such cash being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The
Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. The Exchange Fund
shall, pending its disbursement to the Stockholders, be invested by the Paying
Agent as directed by Parent; _provided_  that (i) no such investment or
losses thereon shall relieve Parent from making the payments required by
_Section_ __ _ 4.2_ or affect the amount of Merger Consideration payable in
respect of the shares of Company Common Stock and (ii) no such investment
shall have maturities that could prevent or delay payments to be made pursuant
to this Agreement. Any and all interest or other amounts earned with respect
to such funds shall become part of the Exchange Fund, and any amounts in
excess of the amounts payable under _Section_ __ _ 4.2_ shall be promptly
returned to Parent. The Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to) pay all charges and expenses of the Paying
Agent, in connection with the exchange of shares of Company Common Stock and
the payment of the Merger Consideration in respect of the shares of Company
Common Stock.

 

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. As promptly as practicable (but no later than two
Business Days) after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of Certificates
and to each holder of record of Book-Entry Shares, in each case whose shares
were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 4.2(a)_, (i) a letter of transmittal which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates
shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent
and which shall be in such form and have such other customary provisions as
Parent may reasonably specify and are reasonably acceptable to the Company
(ii) instructions for use in surrendering the Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration payable with respect thereto.
Upon surrender to the Paying Agent of a Certificate for cancelation, together
with a duly completed and validly executed letter of transmittal or receipt of
an "agents message" by the Paying Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of
transfer as the Paying Agent may reasonably request) in the case of Book-Entry
Shares, the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares shall receive in
exchange therefor the amount of cash which the shares of Company Common Stock
theretofore represented by such Certificate or book-entry entitle such holder
to receive pursuant to the provisions of this _Article 4_ and the Certificate
or Book-Entry Shares so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. Until so
surrendered or transferred, as the case may be, each such Certificate or Book-
Entry Share shall represent after the Effective Time for all purposes only the
right to receive the Merger Consideration. No interest shall be paid or shall
accrue on any cash payable to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
pursuant to the provisions of this _Article 4_. In the event of a transfer of
ownership of Company Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer
records of the Company, payment may be made to a Person other than the Person
in whose name the Certificate or Book-Entry Shares so surrendered are
registered if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in
proper form for transfer or such Book-Entry Shares shall be properly
transferred and the Person requesting such issuance shall pay any transfer or
other Taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the
registered holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares or establish to
the satisfaction of Parent that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable.

 



19

    

(c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. The Merger
Consideration paid upon the surrender or exchange of Certificates and Book-
Entry Shares in accordance with the terms of this _Article 4_ shall be deemed
to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares
of Company Common Stock theretofore represented by such Certificates or book
entries, and, after the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration
of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of the shares of
Company Common Stock which were outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent for any
reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this  _Article 4_
, except as otherwise provided by applicable Law.

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which
remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for
six months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent or one of its
Affiliates, upon demand, and any holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
who have not theretofore complied with this _Article 4_ shall thereafter look
only to Parent (subject to abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws, as
general creditors thereof) for payment of their claim for Merger
Consideration, without any interest thereon and subject to any withholding of
Taxes required by applicable Law, in respect of such holders surrender of
their Certificates or Book-Entry Shares and compliance with the procedures
in  _Section_ __ _ 4.3(b)_.

(e) _No Liability_. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation, the Paying Agent or their respective Affiliates shall be liable
to any Person in respect of any Merger Consideration or any cash from the
Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate or Book-Entry
Share shall not have been surrendered prior to the earlier of (i) two years
after the Effective Time and (ii) immediately prior to the date on which the
Merger Consideration payable with respect to the shares of Company Common
Stock represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share pursuant to this
_Article 4_ would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
Governmental Authority, then any such Merger Consideration shall, to
the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving
Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously
entitled thereto.

 

(f) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact
by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and,
if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable
amount as Parent may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall, subject
to such Persons compliance with the exchange procedures set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 4.3(b)_ (other than the surrender of a Certificate), issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger
Consideration payable with respect to the shares of Company Common Stock
represented by such Certificate in accordance with this _Article 4_.

 



20

    

SECTION 4.4. _Company Equity Awards_.

 

(a) _Treatment of Company Stock Options_. Immediately prior to the Effective
Time, each Company Stock Option under any Stock Plan shall, to the extent
unvested, become fully vested and exercisable effective immediately prior to,
and contingent upon, the Effective Time. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any further action on the part of the holders thereof
or the parties hereto, each Company Stock Option shall be canceled and, in
exchange therefor, each former holder of any such canceled Company Stock
Option shall be entitled to receive, in consideration of the cancelation of
such Company Stock Option and in settlement therefor, a payment in cash
(subject to any applicable withholding or other Taxes required by applicable
Law) of an amount equal to the product of (i) the total number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option immediately prior
to such cancelation and (ii) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration
over the exercise price per share subject to such Company Stock Option
immediately prior to such cancelation (such amounts payable hereunder being
referred to as the " _Option Payments_ "). No holder of a Company Stock Option
that, as of immediately prior to such cancelation, has an exercise price per
share that is equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration shall be
entitled to any payment with respect to such canceled Company Stock Option.
From and after the Effective Time, each Company Stock Option shall no longer
be exercisable by the former holder thereof, but shall only entitle such
holder to the payment of the corresponding Option Payment, if any. On the
first applicable payroll payment date following the Closing or, if such
payroll payment date is less than five days after the Closing, as promptly as
practicable thereafter (but in no event later than five days after such
payroll payment date), the Surviving Corporation shall make (or cause to be
made) by a payroll payment and subject to withholding, if any, as described in
_Section_ __ _ 4.8_, to each holder of Company Stock Options, such holders
Option Payment.

(b) _Treatment of Company RSUs_. Immediately prior to the Effective
Time, each Company RSU under any Stock Plan shall, to the extent unvested,
become fully vested effective immediately prior to, and contingent upon, the
Effective Time. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any
further action on the part of the holders thereof or the parties hereto, each
Company RSU shall be canceled and, in exchange therefor, each former holder of
any such canceled Company RSU shall be entitled to receive, in consideration
of the cancelation of such Company RSU and in settlement therefor, a payment
in cash (subject to any applicable withholding or other Taxes required by
applicable Law) of an amount equal to the product of (i) the total number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company RSU immediately prior
to such cancelation and (ii) the Merger Consideration (such amounts payable
hereunder being referred to as the " _RSU Payments_ "). On the first
applicable payroll payment date following the Closing or, if such payroll
payment date is less than five days after the Closing, as promptly as
practicable thereafter (but in no event later than five days after such
payroll payment date), the Surviving Corporation shall make (or cause to be
made) by a payroll payment and subject to withholding, if any, as described
in _Section_ __ _ 4.8_, to each holder of Company RSUs, such holders RSU
Payment.

 

(c) _Termination of Stock Plans_. As of the Effective Time, all Stock Plans
and equity awards shall be terminated and no further shares of Company Common
Stock, Company Stock Options, Company RSUs, equity interests or other rights
with respect to shares of stock of the Company shall be granted thereunder.

 



21

    

(d) _Board Actions_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board (or,
if appropriate, any committee thereof) shall adopt appropriate resolutions
and take all other actions necessary and appropriate (including obtaining any
required consents) to effect the transactions described in this  _Section_ __
_ 4.4_.

SECTION 4.5. _Employee Stock Purchase Plan_. The Company, the Company Board
and the Compensation Committee thereof, as applicable, shall take all actions
necessary to terminate the Companys 2016 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "
_ESPP_ ") and all outstanding rights thereunder as of the day immediately
prior to the Expiration Date, contingent upon the occurrence of the Closing,
and to otherwise effectuate the treatment of the ESPP as contemplated in this
_Section_ __ _ 4.5_. From and after the date hereof, the Company shall (a)
take all actions necessary to ensure that (i) no new participants are
permitted to participate in the ESPP and that participants may not increase
their payroll deductions or purchase elections from those in effect on the
date of this Agreement and (ii) except for the offering or purchase period
(if any) under the ESPP that is in effect on the date hereof (the _"_ _Final
Offering Period_ "), no offering or purchase period shall be authorized,
continued or commenced following the date hereof and (b) provide notice to
participants describing the treatment of the ESPP pursuant to this _Section_
__ _ 4.5_. If the Effective Time occurs during the Final Offering Period, the
Final Offering Period shall terminate no later than the day immediately prior
to the Expiration Date, and the Company shall cause the exercise date
applicable to the Final Offering Period to accelerate and occur on such
termination date with respect to any then-outstanding purchase rights.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, (x) all amounts allocated to
each participants account under the ESPP at the end of the Final Offering
Period shall thereupon be used to purchase whole shares of Company Common
Stock under the terms of the ESPP for such offering period, which shares of
Company Common Stock shall be canceled at the Effective Time in exchange for
the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with  _Section
4.2(a)_ as promptly as practicable following the purchase of shares of Company
Common Stock and (y) the Company shall return to each participant the funds,
if any, that remain in such participants account after such purchase.

SECTION 4.6. _Further Action_. The parties agree to take all necessary action
to cause the Merger to become effective as soon as practicable following the
Offer Closing without a meeting of the Stockholders, as provided in Section
251(h) of the DGCL.

 

SECTION 4.7. _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. Without limiting the other
provisions of this Agreement, in the event that, during the period between
the date hereof and the Effective Time, the number of outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock or securities convertible or exchangeable into or
exercisable for shares of Company Common Stock shall be changed into a
different number of shares or securities or a different class, including as a
result of a reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split),
stock dividend or distribution, recapitalization, merger, issuer tender or
exchange offer or other similar transaction, then the Offer Price, the Merger
Consideration and any other amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement shall
be equitably adjusted, without duplication, to reflect such change; _provided_
that, in any case, nothing in this  _Section_ __ _ 4.7_ shall be construed
to permit the Company to take any action with respect to its securities that
is prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

 

SECTION 4.8. _Withholding Rights_. Notwithstanding any provision contained
herein to the contrary, each of Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation
and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Agreement such
amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with 

 



22

    

 respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any provision of
state, local or foreign Tax Law. Any amounts so deducted and withheld by
Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as the
case may be and paid over to the appropriate Governmental Authority, shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person
in respect of which Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the
Paying Agent, as the case may be, made such deduction and withholding. Parent
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to notify the Company in writing at
least five Business Days prior to the Closing Date of any obligation to
withhold Tax on any payments with respect to Company Common Stock, other than
(a) with respect to U.S. backup withholding Taxes, (b) as a result of a
failure by any person to provide a U.S. federal withholding certificate on IRS
Form W-9 or the applicable IRS Form W-8, or of the Company to comply with
_Section_ __ _ 7.16(a)_ or (c) with respect to a payment in the nature
of compensation to be made to service providers or former service providers
of the Company. Parent and the Company shall each use commercially reasonable
efforts to cooperate with each other to mitigate and reduce such withholding
to the extent permitted by applicable Tax Law.

SECTION 4.9. _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock that are outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time and that are held by any Person who is entitled to
demand and properly demands appraisal of such shares (" _Appraisal Shares_ ")
pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, Section 262 of the DGCL
shall not be converted into the right to receive Merger Consideration and
shall entitle the holder only to payment for such Appraisal Shares in
accordance with and to the extent provided by Section 251(h) and Section 262
of the DGCL; _provided_ that if any such holder shall fail to perfect or
otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under Section
262 of the DGCL, then such Appraisal Shares shall automatically be deemed to
have been converted as of the Effective Time into, and become exchangeable
solely for the right to receive, Merger Consideration as provided in _Section_
__ _ 4.2(a)_. The Company shall serve notice to Parent within one Business
Day of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of any shares of
Company Common Stock, and Parent shall have the right to participate in and
direct ( _provided_ , that such direction may not result in a binding
obligation on the part of the Company that is effective prior to the Effective
Time) all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. The
Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, make any
payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands, or
agree to do any of the foregoing. Any cash deposited with the Paying Agent
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 4.3(a)_ with respect to shares of Company Common
Stock that become Appraisal Shares shall be returned to Parent upon demand
therefor.

in each jurisdiction where the nature of its business or the ownership,

qualified, licensed or in good standing has not had and would not reasonably
be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material
Adverse Effect. The Company has heretofore made available to Parent accurate
and complete copies of the Company Charter Documents as in effect on the date
hereof.

SECTION 5.2. _Capitalization_.

 

(a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of (i) 300,000,000

and complete list as of the date hereof of each outstanding Company Stock
Option and Company RSU, including, as applicable, the holder, date of grant,
exercise price, vesting schedule and number of shares of Company Common Stock

reasonable actions, consistent with current industry

 



42

the Transactions, or the performance by the Company or any Company Subsidiary
of its obligations hereunder conflict or will conflict with, alter or impair
any of the Companys or any Company Subsidiarys rights in, to and under any
Company Intellectual Property or the validity, enforceability, use, right to
use, ownership, registration, right to register, priority, duration, scope, or
effectiveness of any such Company Intellectual Property. Without limiting the

grant by Parent, the Company or any Company Subsidiary to any Person of, or
require Parent, the Company or any Company Subsidiary to grant to any Person,
any rights with respect to any Company Intellectual Property, (ii) subject
Parent, the Company or any Company Subsidiary to any increase in royalties or
other payments in respect of any Company Intellectual Property, (iii) diminish

Property, or (iv) permit any Person to terminate or modify any Contract

be disclosed or licensed, to any licensor of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary under any such Contract.

which any Continuing Employee is entitled pursuant to the personal, sick or
vacation policies applicable to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to
the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
as applicable (and without duplication of benefits), assume the liability for
such accrued personal, sick or vacation time and allow such Continuing
Employee to use such accrued personal, sick or vacation time in accordance
with the practice and policies of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as
they may be amended from time to time.

(g) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions necessary
to terminate each Stock Plan and the Companys 401(k) plan, if requested by
Parent at least 10 days prior to the Closing Date, such terminations to be
effective no later than the day immediately prior to the Closing Date, in
each case, in accordance with terms of such plan and applicable Law. All

of time (which need not exceed 48 hours if the Company believes in good faith
that such communication should be disseminated promptly) to review and comment
on each such communication (such review and comments not to be unreasonably
withheld or delayed), unless such communications are materially consistent
with prior formal communications previously reviewed and approved by Parent.
Any group oral presentations with respect to the above shall be materially
consistent with such formal written communications.

action (A) is necessary to obtain required clearances or waiting period
expirations or terminations as may be required under the HSR Act by or before
the Outside Date and (B) would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to be materially detrimental to the benefits to be
derived by Parent and its Subsidiaries as a result of the Transactions.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in no event shall
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries be obligated to litigate or participate in
any litigation brought by any Governmental Authority seeking any action Parent
and Merger Sub are not required to take pursuant to this _Section_ __ _

President and Chief Operating Officer or other Person designated by the
Company. The Company shall instruct its Representatives to cooperate with

66

    

(b) Nothing herein shall require the Company or any Company Subsidiary to
disclose any information to Parent if such disclosure would, in the Companys
reasonable discretion (i) jeopardize any attorney client or other legal
privilege ( _provided_ that the Company will nonetheless provide Parent and
the applicable Representatives of Parent with appropriate information
regarding the factual basis underlying any circumstances that resulted in the
preparation of such privileged analyses so long as such privilege will not be
jeopardized thereby) or (ii) contravene any applicable Law, fiduciary duty or

Subsidiaries in connection with, or otherwise cooperate with any Person with
respect to, any Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry, proposal or offer that
could reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal (other than,
solely in response to an inquiry that did not result from or arise in
connection with a breach of this _Section_ __ _ 7.8(a)_, to refer the
inquiring person to this _Section_ __ _ 7.8_ and to limit its communication
exclusively to such referral); (iii) grant any waiver, amendment or release of

or enter into any agreement, contract or commitment requiring the Company to
abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the Transactions; or that would
otherwise materially impede the ability of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate
the Offer Closing and the Merger or (v) resolve, propose or agree to do any
of the foregoing. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, if in response to a _bona fide_ written Acquisition Proposal 

 



67

    

 made by a Third Party after the date hereof (x) not resulting from a breach
and (y) in circumstances not involving a material breach of this _Section_ __
_ 7.8_, the Company Board or a committee thereof determines in good faith
(after consultation with outside legal counsel and a financial advisor of
nationally recognized reputation) that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes,
or could reasonably be expected to lead to, a Superior Proposal and, after
consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action
would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Company Board under
applicable Law, then the Company may, at any time prior to the Offer Closing
(but in no event after such time), enter into an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement with such Third Party making such an Acquisition Proposal and

made available to Parent. The Company shall ensure that its Representatives
are aware of the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 7.8(a)_. Without limiting
the foregoing, it is agreed that any violation of the foregoing restrictions
by any Company Subsidiary or any Representative of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary shall be deemed to be a breach of this _Section_ __ _ 7.8_ by the
Company; _provided_ , that solely for purposes of this sentence only, except
as otherwise set forth on _Section_ __ _ 7.8_ of the Company Disclosure
Letter, "Representative" shall not include any employee of the Company or any

the Companys employee census set forth in _Section_ __ _ 5.12(b)_ of the
Company Disclosure Letter) or any outside consultant of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary, in each case, who is not acting at the direction or
permission of the Company or any Representative who is aware of the provisions
of this _Section_ __ _ 7.8_ (such employees and contractors that are not
included, the " _Specified Persons_ "). The Company shall not terminate,
waive, amend, release or modify any material provision of any Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement.

 

(b) In addition to the other obligations of the Company set forth in this
_Section_ __ _ 7.8_, the Company shall as promptly as practicable, and in
any event no later than the earlier of 48 hours or one Business Day after
receipt thereof, notify Parent in writing of any Acquisition Proposal or any
inquiry, proposal or offer that expressly contemplates or could reasonably be
expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, which notification shall include
(i) a copy of the applicable written Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, proposal
or offer (or, if oral, a summary of the material terms and conditions of
such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, proposal or offer) and (ii) the identity
of the Third Party making such Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall
thereafter keep Parent reasonably informed on a reasonably current basis of
any material developments, discussions or negotiations regarding any such
Acquisition Proposal, and the material terms and conditions thereof (including

thereto), including by providing a copy of any proposed letter of intent,

from) the Schedule 14D-9, withdraw, qualify or modify), in a manner adverse to
Parent, the Company Recommendation, (ii) adopt, approve, recommend, submit to
the Stockholders or declare advisable or make any recommendation other than a
rejection of (or publicly propose to adopt, approve, recommend, submit to the
Stockholders or declare advisable, or make any recommendation other than a
rejection of), any Acquisition Proposal or (iii) take any action to exempt
any Person (other than Parent or its Subsidiaries) or any action taken by any

" _Company Adverse Recommendation Change_ ").

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, at
any time during the Pre-Closing Period, the Company Board may effect a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change or terminate this Agreement to enter into a
Specified Agreement, in each case if, and only if, (i) the Company has
complied with this _Section_ __ _ 7.8_ with respect to such Company Adverse
Recommendation Change or Specified Agreement or any Acquisition Proposal
relating thereto, (ii) the Company Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel, that the failure to
make the Company Adverse Recommendation Change or terminate this Agreement
to enter into a Specified Agreement would be inconsistent with the fiduciary
duties of the Company Board under applicable Law, (iii) the Company has given
Parent written notice of the Company Boards intention to make a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change or terminate this Agreement to enter into a
Specified Agreement not earlier than 11:59 p.m. Tokyo time on the fifth

Event pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.8(e)_, the decision to make a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change shall be in connection with an Acquisition
Proposal or with the Companys intent to terminate this Agreement to enter

proposed revisions to this Agreement or other proposals made by Parent, if
any, so that the Acquisition Proposal would no longer constitute a Superior

taking into account the proposals that Parent has committed to in writing
that are irrevocable until at least six hours after the expiration of the
five-Business Day period provided in the foregoing _clause (iii)_ of this
_Section_ __ _ 7.8(d)_, if any, after consultation with its outside legal
counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation, the
Company Board shall have determined in good faith that such Acquisition
Proposal remains a Superior Proposal, and, after consultation with its
outside legal counsel, that the failure to make the Company Adverse
Recommendation Change or terminate this Agreement to enter into a Specified
Agreement would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the 

 



69

    

 Company Board under applicable Law and (5) if the Company intends to
terminate this Agreement to enter into a Specified Agreement, the Company
shall have complied with  _Section_ __ _ 9.1(d)(i)_. For clarity, the

Adverse Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties
of the Company Board under applicable Law; (ii) Parent shall have received
from the Company written notice not later than 11:59 p.m. Tokyo time on the

Change, describing the Intervening Event in reasonable detail; (iii) during

Company shall have negotiated in good faith with Parent (and caused its
Representatives to negotiate with Parent), to the extent that Parent desires

other proposals made by Parent, if any, that would obviate the requirement to
make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change; and (iv) after considering the
results of negotiations with Parent and taking into account the proposals
that Parent has committed to in writing that are irrevocable until at least
six hours after the expiration of the five-Business Day period provided in the
foregoing _clause (ii)_ , if any, after consultation with its outside legal
counsel, the Company Board shall have determined in good faith that the
failure to make the Company Adverse Recommendation Change would be
inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Company Board under applicable

communication pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act;
_provided_ that this _Section_ __ _ 7.8(f)_ shall not permit the Company

SECTION 7.9. _Indemnification and Insurance_.

 

(a) After the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, fulfill and honor all rights and
obligations to indemnification by the Company (including advancement of
expenses) now existing in favor of each Person who is now, or has been at any
time prior to the date hereof or who becomes prior to the Effective Time an
officer or director of the Company or any Company Subsidiary (each an "
_Indemnified Party_ ") as provided in the Company Charter Documents, in each
case as in effect on the date hereof, or pursuant to any other agreements in
effect on the date hereof including as set forth on _Section_ __ _ 7.9_ of
the Company Disclosure Letter, accurate and complete copies of which have been
made available to Parent, shall be assumed by the Surviving Corporation in the
Merger, without further action, at the Effective Time and shall survive the
Merger and shall remain in full force and effect in accordance with their
terms.

 

(b) After the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, to the fullest extent permitted
under applicable Law, indemnify, defend and hold harmless each Indemnified
Party against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs, fees,
expenses (including fees and expenses of legal counsel, which shall be
advanced as they are incurred; _provided_ , that the Indemnified Party shall
have made an undertaking to repay such amounts advanced if, and only if and to
the extent that, it shall ultimately be determined that such Indemnified Party
was not entitled to indemnification under the agreements set forth on
_Section_ __ _ 7.9_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, the Company Charter
Documents and the DGCL), Judgments, fines, penalties or liabilities (including
amounts paid in settlement or compromise) in connection with or arising in
whole or in part out of actions, omissions, suits or other proceedings
(whether civil or criminal, and including any proceeding before any
administrative or legislative body) in which such Indemnified Party may be
involved or with which he or she may be threatened (regardless of whether as a
named party or as a participant other than as a named party, including,
without limitation, as a witness) (an " _Indemnified Proceeding_ ") by reason
of such Indemnified Partys being or having been such director or officer or
an employee or agent of the Company or otherwise in connection with any action
taken or not taken at the request of the Company, whether or not the
Indemnified Party continues in such position at the time such Indemnified
Proceeding is brought or threatened and at, or at any time prior to, the
Effective Time (including any Indemnified Proceeding relating in whole or in
part to the Transactions or relating to the enforcement of this provision or
any other indemnification or advancement right of any Indemnified Party). The
Surviving Corporation

 



71

    

 shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, pay all
expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees, that may be incurred by
Indemnified Parties in connection with their enforcement of their rights
under this _Section_ __ _ 7.9_. The Surviving Corporations obligations under
_Section_ __ _ 7.9(a)_ and this _Section_ __ _ 7.9(b)_ shall continue in
full force and effect for a period of six years from the Effective Time;
_provided_ , _however_ , that all rights to indemnification, exculpation and
advancement of expenses in respect of any claim asserted or made within such
period shall continue until the final disposition of such claim.

(c) The Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, maintain the officers and directors liability insurance in
respect of acts or omissions occurring on or prior to the Effective Time
covering each such Person currently covered by the Companys officers and
directors liability insurance policy on terms with respect to coverage and
amount no less favorable than those of such policy in effect on the date
hereof; _provided_ that in satisfying its obligation under this _Section_ __ _
7.9(c)_, the Surviving Corporation shall not be obligated to pay an amount
per year (the " _Maximum Amount_ ") in excess of 250% of the annual premium
the Company paid in its most recent renewal prior to the date of this
Agreement and if such premiums for such insurance would at any time exceed
the Maximum Amount, then the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be
maintained policies of insurance that, in the Surviving Corporations good
faith judgment, provide the maximum coverage available at an annual premium
equal to the Maximum Amount. The provisions of the immediately preceding
sentence shall be deemed to have been satisfied if prepaid "tail" or "runoff"
policies have been obtained by the Company prior to the Effective Time, which
policies provide such directors and officers with coverage for an aggregate
period of six years with respect to claims arising from acts or omissions that
occurred on or before the Effective Time, including, in respect of the
Transactions; _provided_ , _however_ , that the amount paid for such prepaid
policies does not exceed the Maximum Amount. If such prepaid policies have
been obtained prior to the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall,
and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain such policies in
full force and effect for their full term, and continue to honor the
obligations thereunder.

 

(d) The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 7.9_ are (i) intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, his or her
heirs and his or her representatives and (ii) in addition to, and not in
substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any
such individual may have under any certificate of incorporation or bylaws, by
contract or otherwise. The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation
under this _Section_ __ _ 7.9_ shall survive the Offer Closing and the
consummation of the Merger and shall not be terminated or modified in such a
manner as to adversely affect any Indemnified Party to whom this _Section_ __
_ 7.9_ applies without the consent of such affected Indemnified Party (it
being expressly agreed that the Indemnified Parties to whom this _Section_ __
_ 7.9_ applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this _Section_ __ _
7.9_, each of whom may enforce the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 7.9_).

 

(e) In the event that the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all its properties and
assets to any Person, or if Parent dissolves the Surviving Corporation,
then, and in each such case, Parent shall cause proper provision to be made
so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation assume the
obligations set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 7.9_.

 



72

    

SECTION 7.10. _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
and the Company Board shall take all such steps as may be required to cause
any dispositions of equity securities of the Company (including derivative
securities) in connection with this Agreement by each Company director or
officer who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the
Exchange Act with respect to the Companys equity securities to be exempt
under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

Litigation, and (b) consult with counsel to the Company regarding the
defense, prosecution, settlement or compromise with respect to any such
Transaction Litigation. For purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 7.11_,
"participate" means that Parent will be kept reasonably apprised of proposed
strategy and other significant decisions with respect to the Transaction
Litigation (to the extent that the attorney-client privilege between the
Company and its counsel is not undermined or otherwise adversely affected),
and Parent may offer comments or suggestions with respect to such Transaction
Litigation which the Company shall consider in good faith; _provided_ that the
Company shall not settle or compromise or agree to settle or compromise any
Transaction Litigation without Parents prior written consent (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), except (i) to the
extent such settlement is fully covered by the Companys insurance policies
(other than any applicable deductible) or (ii) such settlement relates solely
to the provision of additional disclosure in the Schedule 14D-9, but in each
case of clauses (i) and (ii) only if such settlement would not result in the
imposition of any restriction on the business or operations of the Company or
its affiliates and contains a full and unconditional release of and covenant
not to sue all parties and their Representatives.

SECTION 7.12. _Deregistration; Stock Exchange Delisting_. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall cooperate with Parent and use its
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do or

Time.

 

SECTION 7.13. _Takeover Provisions_. If any Takeover Provision becomes or is
deemed to be applicable to the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, the Offer, the
Merger or any other Transaction, then each of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub,
and their respective Boards of Directors shall grant such approvals and take
such actions as are necessary so that the Transactions may be consummated
as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act
to render such Takeover Provision inapplicable to the foregoing.

covenants, obligations, agreements and undertakings made or required to be
performed by Merger Sub in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the
Offer, the Merger, and the other Transactions.

SECTION 7.15. _Rule 14d-10 Matters_. Prior to the Offer Closing, the
Company (acting through the compensation committee of the Company Board)

compensation, severance or other employee benefit arrangement" within the
meaning of Rule 14d-10(d)(1) under the Exchange Act (a) each Stock Plan, (b)
the treatment of Company Stock Options and Company RSUs in accordance with the

accordance with Treasury Regulation Section 1.897-2(h); _provided_ , _however_
, that Parents only recourse for the Companys failure to provide such

be the ability to withhold Tax from the Merger Consideration as required by
applicable Law.

(b) The Company shall cause any material Tax Sharing Agreement to which the
Company or any Company Subsidiary is party (other than any Tax Sharing
Agreement to which only the Company and Company Subsidiaries are party) to be

SECTION 8.2. _Frustration of Closing Conditions_. Neither Parent nor Merger
Sub may rely on the failure of any Offer Condition or any condition set forth

any of its material obligations under this Agreement.

 

ARTICLE 9

TERMINATION

 

SECTION 9.1. _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated and the Merger
may be abandoned at any time prior to the Acceptance Time: 

(a) by mutual written consent of Parent and the Company;

 

(b) by either the Company or Parent by written notice to the other, if:

 

(i) the Acceptance Time shall not have occurred on or prior to June 2, 2020
(as such date may be extended pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 9.1(b)(i)_,
the " _Outside Date_ "); _provided_ that the Company or Parent may extend the
Outside Date to September 2, 2020 upon written notice to the other party no
earlier than the fifth Business Day prior to the initial Outside Date and no
later than the initial Outside Date if (1) the Offer Condition set forth in
_paragraph (b)_ of _Annex I_ shall not have been satisfied as of the initial
Outside Date and (2) the Offer Conditions set forth in paragraphs (c)(iii),
(c)(iv) and (c)(v) shall have been satisfied as of the initial Outside Date;
_provided_ , _further_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant
to this  _Section_ __ _ 9.1(b)(i)_ shall not be available to any party whose
failure in any material respect to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement
has been the primary cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the Acceptance
Time to have occurred on or prior to the Outside Date;

(ii) any final, non-appealable Judgment preventing the consummation of the
Offer or the Merger shall have been issued by any Governmental Authority of
competent jurisdiction and remain in effect or there shall be any Law enacted
or deemed applicable to the Offer or the Merger that makes consummation of
the Offer or the Merger illegal; _provided_ that the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 9.1(b)(ii)_ shall not be available
to any party if the issuance of such Judgment was primarily caused by or the
result of the failure of such party to perform in any material respect any of
its obligations under this Agreement;

 

(iii) if the Offer shall have expired (and not been extended) without the
acceptance for payment of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the
Offer; _provided_ that a party shall not be permitted to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 9.1(b)(iii)_ if a breach in any
material respect by such party of any provision of this Agreement shall have
primarily caused the failure of the acceptance for payment of the shares of
Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer;

 



75

    

(c) by Parent by written notice to the Company, if:

 

(i) (1) a Company Adverse Recommendation Change shall have occurred, (2) at
any time after receipt or public announcement of an Acquisition Proposal, the
Company Board shall have failed to reaffirm the Company Recommendation as
promptly as practicable (but in any event within five Business Days (or, if
the Outside Date is fewer than five Business Days after the Companys receipt
of such request, by the close of business on the Business Day immediately
preceding the Outside Date)) after receipt of any written request to do so by
Parent ( _provided_ that Parent is only allowed to make two
such reaffirmation requests with respect to each such public announcement
prior to the Acceptance Time, and other than in connection with the
commencement of a tender offer or exchange offer) or (3) a tender offer or
exchange offer subject to Regulation 14D under the Exchange Act relating to
the Company Common Stock shall have been commenced by a Third Party and the
Company shall not have sent to the Stockholders pursuant to Rule 14e-2 under
the Exchange Act, within five Business Days after the commencement of such
tender offer or exchange offer, a statement on Schedule 14D-9 reaffirming the
Company Recommendation and recommending that the Stockholders reject such
tender or exchange offer;

(ii) a breach of any representation or warranty or failure to perform any
covenant or agreement on the part of the Company set forth in this Agreement
shall have occurred that would cause the Offer Conditions set forth in
_paragraph (c)(iii)_ or _paragraph (c)(iv)_ of _Annex I_ (other than in the
case of a breach of the covenants or agreements set forth in _Section_ __ _
7.8_), as applicable, not to be satisfied; _provided_ that, for purposes of
this _Section_ __ _ 9.1(c)(ii)_, if such a breach is curable by the Company
within the earlier of the Outside Date and 20 Business Days of the date Parent
gives the Company notice of such breach and the Company is continuing to use
its reasonable best efforts to cure such breach, then Parent may not
terminate this Agreement under this _Section_ __ _ 9.1(c)(ii)_ on account of
such breach unless such breach shall remain uncured upon the earlier of the
Outside Date and the expiration of such 20 Business Day period; _provided_ ,
_ further_ , that Parent shall not be entitled to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 9.1(c)(ii)_ if either Parent or Merger Sub is
in breach of its obligations under this Agreement such that the Company
would be entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _
9.1(d)(ii)_; or

(iii) the Company shall have Willfully Breached its obligations under
_Section_ __ _ 7.8_;

(d) by the Company by written notice to Parent; 

(i) in order to accept a Superior Proposal and enter into the Specified
Agreement relating to such Superior Proposal, if (1) such Superior Proposal
shall not have resulted from any breach of _Section_ __ _ 7.8_ with respect
to such Superior Proposal and any Acquisition Proposal that was a precursor
thereto, (2) the Company Board, after satisfying all of the requirements set
forth in _Section_ __ _ 7.8(d)_, shall have authorized the Company to enter
into a binding written definitive acquisition agreement providing for the
consummation of a transaction constituting a Superior Proposal (a "
_Specified_ _Agreement_ ") and (3) the Company shall have paid the Termination
Fee concurrently, and have entered into the Specified Agreement concurrently
with, the termination of this Agreement pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
9.1(d)(i)_;

 



76

    

(ii) if a breach of any representation or warranty or failure to perform
any covenant or agreement on the part of Parent or Merger Sub set forth in
this Agreement shall have occurred, which breach or failure to perform has
had, or would reasonably be expected to have, a Parent Material Adverse
Effect; _provided_ that, for purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 9.1(d)(ii)_, if
such a breach is curable by Parent within the earlier of the Outside Date and
20 Business Days of the date the Company gives Parent notice of such breach
and Parent is continuing to use its reasonable best efforts to cure such
breach, then the Company may not terminate this Agreement under this _Section_
__ _ 9.1(d)(ii)_ on account of such breach unless such breach shall remain
uncured upon the earlier of the Outside Date and the expiration of such 20
Business Day period; _provided_ _further_ that the Company shall not be
entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
9.1(d)(ii)_ if the Company is in breach of its obligations under this
Agreement such that Parent would be entitled to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.1(c)(ii)_; or

 

(iii) if Merger Sub fails to commence the Offer in accordance with _Section_
__ _ 2.1(a)_ or if the Merger Sub fails to consummate the Offer in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement and, in each case, such failure
remains uncured at the expiration of five Business Days after the date the
Company gives Parent notice of such failure; _provided_  that the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 9.1(d)(iii)_ shall
not be available to the Company if the Companys breach of its obligations
under _Section_ __ _ 2.2_ is the primary cause of, or resulted in, Merger
Subs failure to commence the Offer in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement.

Any written notice of termination pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 9.1_ shall
specify the provision of this _Section_ __ _ 9.1_ pursuant to which such
termination is being effected.

 

SECTION 9.2. _Effect of Termination_. If terminated pursuant to _Section_ __ _
9.1_, this Agreement shall be of no further force or effect without liability
of any party (or any stockholder or Representative of such party) to each
other party hereto; _provided_ that the provisions of this _Section_ __ _
9.2_,  _Section_ __ _ 7.7(c)_, _Section_ __ _ 9.3_ and _Article 10_ shall
survive any termination hereof pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.1_.
Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, none of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company shall be relieved or
released from any liabilities or damages arising out of any fraud or Willful
Breach of any provision of this Agreement or any other agreement delivered
in connection herewith. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Willful Breach_ "
means an intentional and willful material breach, or an intentional and
willful material failure to perform, in each case that is the consequence of
an act or omission by a party with the knowledge that the taking of such act
or failure to take such act would cause a breach of this Agreement; _provided_
that (1) for purposes of this "Willful Breach" definition, all
Representatives (excluding Specified Persons) shall be deemed to have been
made aware of the requirements of _Section_ __ _ 7.8(a)_ and (2) the failure
of Parent or Merger Sub to accept for payment and pay for the Tendered Shares
promptly following the Expiration Date after all Offer Conditions have been
satisfied or waived in accordance with the terms of this Agreement shall
constitute a Willful Breach by Parent and Merger Sub, and Parent shall be
liable to the Company for such Willful Breach as provided herein
notwithstanding any termination of this Agreement. The Confidentiality
Agreement shall survive the termination of this Agreement and shall remain in
full force and effect in accordance with its terms.

 



77

    

SECTION 9.3. _Termination Fee and Expenses_.

 

(a) Except as otherwise set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 9.3_, all costs and
Expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions
shall be paid by the party incurring such costs or Expenses, whether or not
the Transactions are consummated; _provided_ that Parent shall pay all filing
fees payable pursuant to the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Laws.

(b) In the event that:

 

(i) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section_ __ _
9.1(c)(i)_ or  _Section_ __ _ 9.1(c)(iii)_;

(ii) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to  _Section_ __ _
9.1(d)(i)_; or

(iii) (1) this Agreement is terminated by Parent, Merger Sub or the Company
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.1(b)(_ _i_ _)_ (solely if, at the final
expiration date of the Offer, the conditions set forth in clauses _(b)_ and
_(c)(_ _i_ _)_ of _Annex I_ shall have been satisfied; _provided_ that if the
Companys breach of its obligations under _this Agreement_ is the principal
cause of the failure of the foregoing conditions to be satisfied, such
conditions will deemed to have been satisfied for the purposes of this
_Section_ __ _ 9.3(b)(iii)(1)_), _Section_ __ _ 9.1(b)(iii)_ (solely if, at
the final expiration date of the Offer, the conditions set forth in clauses
_(b)_ and  _(c)(_ _i_ _)_ of _Annex I_ shall have been satisfied; _provided_
that if the Companys breach of its obligations under _this Agreement_ is the
principal cause of the failure of the foregoing conditions to be satisfied,
such conditions will deemed to have been satisfied for the purposes of this
_Section_ __ _ 9.3(b)(iii)(1)_) or _Section_ __ _ 9.1(c)(ii)_ as a result of
a breach of a covenant in this Agreement by the Company, (2) after the date
of this Agreement an Acquisition Proposal shall have been made to the Company
or shall have been publicly made directly to the Stockholders, in each case,
not withdrawn prior to the date of termination of this Agreement pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 9.1_, and (3) the Company or any Company Subsidiary (A)
consummates an Acquisition Proposal within 12 months after such termination or
(B) the Company or any Company Subsidiary enters into a definitive agreement
to effect an Acquisition Proposal within 12 months after such termination that
(x) is subsequently consummated (regardless of the timing of such
consummation) or (y) was proposed or publicly announced prior to the
termination of this Agreement, in each case in this _Section_ __ _
9.3(b)(iii)_, replacing "15%" in the definition of Acquisition Proposal with
"50%";

 

(iv) then, in any such event under _clause (i)_ , _(ii)_ or _(iii)_ of this 
_Section_ __ _ 9.3(b)_, the Company shall pay to Parent, in cash at the time
specified in the next sentence, a nonrefundable termination fee of
$104,100,000.00 (the " _Termination Fee_ "). Any payment of the Termination
Fee required to be made pursuant to: (1) _ Section_ __ _ 9.3(b)(i)_ shall be
made to Parent within one Business Day after termination of this Agreement by
Parent or

  



78

    

 the Company as set forth in _Section_ __ _ 9.3(b)(i)_; (2) _Section_ __ _
9.3(b)(ii)_ shall be made to Parent immediately prior to and as a condition to
such termination of this Agreement by the Company as set forth in _Section_
__ _ 9.3(b)(ii)_; and (3) _ Section_ __ _ 9.3(b)(iii)_ shall be made to
Parent concurrently with the occurrence of the applicable event described in
_clause (3)_ of _Section_ __ _ 9.3(b)(iii)_. All payments under this
_Section_ __ _ 9.3(b)_ shall be made by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account to be designated by Parent. In the event that
Parent receives full payment pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 9.3(b)_, then,
receipt of the Termination Fee shall be deemed to be liquidated damages for
any and all losses or damages suffered or incurred by Parent, Merger Sub, any
of their respective Affiliates or any other Person in connection with this
Agreement (and the termination hereof), the Transactions (and the abandonment
thereof) or any matter forming the basis for such termination, and none of
Parent, Merger Sub, any of their respective Affiliates or any other Person
shall be entitled to bring or maintain any claim, action or proceeding against
the Company or any of its Affiliates for damages or any equitable relief
arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, any of the Transactions
or any matters forming the basis for such termination. For the avoidance of
doubt, any payment made by the Company under this _Section_ __ _ 9.3(b)_
shall be payable only once with respect to this _Section_ __ _ 9.3(b)_ and
not in duplication even though such payment may be payable under one or more
provisions hereof.

 

(c) The Company and Parent acknowledge that the agreements contained in
_Section_ __ _ 9.3(b)_ are an integral part of the Transactions, and that,
without those agreements, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub would not enter
into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company fails to make payment of any
amount payable under _Section_ __ _ 9.3(b)_ within the applicable time
period specified in _Section_ __ _ 9.3(b)_, as the case may be, and Parent
commences a Proceeding to collect such amount that results in a judgment
against the Company, the Company shall reimburse Parent for its fees and
expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) incurred in
connection with such Proceeding and shall pay interest on the amount of the
payment at the prime rate as published in The Wall Street Journal in effect on
the date the amount was payable pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.3(b)_, with
such interest to accrue beginning on the date such amount first was payable
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.3(b)_, to the date of payment.

or waiver is in writing and is signed, in the case of an amendment, by each
party to this Agreement or, in the case of a waiver, by each party against
whom the waiver is to be effective.

 

(b) No failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, power or

warranties contained in this Agreement and in any certificate or other
writing delivered pursuant hereto shall not survive the Effective Time.

this Agreement or the Transactions (whether brought by any party or any of its
Affiliates or against any party or any of its Affiliates) shall be brought in
the Delaware Chancery Court or, if such court shall not have jurisdiction, any
federal court located in the State of Delaware or other Delaware state court,
and each of the parties irrevocably consents to the exclusive jurisdiction
of such courts (and of the appropriate appellate courts therefrom) (the "
_Delaware Courts_ ") in any such suit, action or proceeding and irrevocably
waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, any objection that it may now
or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such suit, action or
proceeding in any such court or that any such suit, action or proceeding

except that Parent or Merger Sub may transfer or assign, (i) all (but not less
than all) of its rights and obligations under this Agreement to any direct or
indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent, provided such Subsidiary of Parent
is a Delaware corporation and that such assignment shall not impair, delay or
prevent the consummation of the Merger and (ii) after the Effective Time, its
rights and obligations under this Agreement, in whole or from time to time in
part, to any Person; _provided_ that such transfer or assignment shall not
relieve Parent or Merger Sub of its obligations hereunder or enlarge, alter
or change any obligation of any other party or due to Parent or Merger Sub.

(b) Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, is intended to confer on
any Person other than the parties hereto or their respective heirs,

shall inure to the benefit of such Persons or holders, as applicable,
benefiting therefrom who shall be third-party beneficiaries thereof and who
may enforce the covenants contained therein. The representations and
warranties in this Agreement are the product of negotiations among the parties
hereto. Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are subject to
waiver by the parties hereto in accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 10.3_
without notice or liability to any other Person. In some instances, the
representations and warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation
among the parties hereto of risks associated with particular matters
regardless of the knowledge of any of the parties hereto. Consequently,
Persons other than the parties hereto may not rely upon the representations
and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of actual facts or
circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any other date.

 



82

    

SECTION 10.8. _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction
of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other
Governmental Authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of
the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall
remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or
invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance of the Transactions is
not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such a

Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as
possible in an acceptable manner in order that the Transactions be consummated
as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

warranties contained in _Article 5_ (as modified by the Company Disclosure

disclaims any other representations or warranties made by itself or any of
its Representatives, with respect to the execution and delivery of this
Agreement or the Transactions, notwithstanding the delivery or disclosure to
any other party or any other partys Representatives of any document or other
information with respect to any one or more of the foregoing, including, in
the case of the Company, any projections, forecasts, estimates, plans or
budgets or future revenues, expenses or expenditures, future results of

SECTION 10.10. _Enforcement_. The parties agree that irreparable damage would
occur and that the parties would not have any adequate remedy at law in the
event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached, except as
expressly provided in the following sentence. It is accordingly agreed that
the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement in the Delaware Courts and, in any
action for specific performance, each party waives the defense of adequacy of
a remedy at law and waives any requirement for the securing or posting of any
bond in connection with such remedy, this being in addition to any other
remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity (subject to the
limitations set forth in this Agreement). The parties hereto further agree
that (i) by seeking the remedies provided for in this _Section_ __ _ 10.10_,
a party shall not in any respect waive its right to seek any other form of
relief that may be available to a party under this Agreement (including
monetary damages) for breach of any of the provisions of this Agreement or in
the event that this Agreement has been terminated or in the event that the
remedies provided for in this _Section_ __ _ 10.10_ are not available or
otherwise are not granted, and (ii) nothing set forth in this _Section_ __ _
10.10_ shall require any party hereto to institute any Proceeding for (or
limit any partys right to institute any Proceeding for) specific performance
under this _Section_ __ _ 10.10_ prior or as a condition to exercising any
termination right under _Article 9_  (and pursuing damages after such
termination).

SECTION 10.11. _Remedies_. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, any
and all remedies expressly conferred upon a party to this Agreement will be
cumulative with, and not exclusive of, any other remedy contained in this
Agreement, at law or in equity. The exercise by a party to this Agreement of
any one remedy will not preclude the exercise by it of any other remedy.

Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Offer, but subject to the terms
and conditions set forth in the Agreement, in addition to Merger Subs right
to extend, amend or terminate the Offer in accordance with the provisions of
this Agreement, neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall be required to accept for
payment or, subject to any applicable rules and regulations of the
SEC, including Rule 14e-1(c) under the Exchange Act (relating to Merger Subs
obligation to pay for or return Tendered Shares promptly after termination or
withdrawal of the Offer), pay for any Tendered Shares, if immediately prior
to the Expiration Date (as it may have been extended pursuant to _Section_ __
_ 2.1(e)_):

 

(a) there shall not have been validly tendered and not validly withdrawn that
number of shares of Company Common Stock (excluding shares irrevocably
accepted for purchase pursuant to the Offer that have not yet been "received"
by the "depository", as such terms are defined by Section 251(h) of the DGCL)
that, when added to the shares of Company Common Stock then owned by Parent
and its controlled Affiliates, would represent one share more than one half of
all shares of Company Common Stock outstanding at the Expiration Date (such
condition in this _paragraph (a)_ , the " _Minimum Condition_ ");

(b) any waiting period (and any extension thereof) applicable to the
consummation of the Offer and the Merger under the HSR Act shall not have
been terminated or shall not have expired;

(c) any of the following events, conditions, circumstances, state of facts or
developments shall exist or has occurred and be continuing:

(i) any Judgment preventing the consummation of the Offer or the Merger shall
have been issued by any Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction and
remain in effect, or there shall be any Law enacted or deemed applicable to
the Offer or the Merger that makes consummation of the Offer or the Merger
illegal;

(ii) the Company and Parent shall have agreed in writing that the Offer or the
Agreement be terminated, or the Agreement shall have been terminated in
accordance with its terms;

(iii) (1) any of the representations and warranties of the Company set forth
in _Section_ __ _ 5.1_, _Section_ __ _ 5.2(f)_, _Section_ __ _ 5.3(a)_,
_Section_ __ _ 5.3(b)(i)_, _Section_ __ _ 5.4_,  _Section_ __ _ 5.10_,
_Section_ __ _ 5.13_ or _Section_ __ _ 5.23_ shall not be true and correct
in all material respects as of the date of the Agreement and as of the
Expiration Date as though made on and as of such date (except to the extent
expressly made as of an earlier date, in which case as of such earlier date),
(2) any of the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 5.2(a)_,  _(c)_ or _(d)_ shall not be true and correct in
all respects (other than _de minimis_ inaccuracies) as of the date of the
Agreement and as of the Expiration Date as though made on and as of such date
(except to the extent expressly made as of an earlier

 date, in which case as of such earlier date), (3) any of the representations
and warranties of the Company set forth in _Section_ __ _ 5.7(a)_ shall not
be true and correct in all respects as of the date of the Agreement and as of
the Expiration Date as though made on and as of such date (except to the
extent expressly made as of an earlier date, in which case as of such earlier
date) or (4) any representations and warranties of the Company set forth in
the Agreement (other than those listed in the preceding _clause_ __ _
(c)(iii)(1)_, _clause (c)(iii)(2)_ or _clause (c)(iii)(3)_ ) shall not be true
and correct (without giving effect to any limitation on any representation or
warranty indicated by the words "Company Material Adverse Effect," "in all
material respects," "in any material respect," "material" or "materially") as
of the date of the Agreement and as of the Expiration Date as though made on
and as of such date (except to the extent expressly made as of an earlier
date, in which case as of such earlier date), except, in the case of this 
_clause_ __ _ (c)(iii)(4),_ where the failure of any such representations and
warranties to be so true and correct would not, and would not be reasonably
expected to, have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect;

(iv) the Company shall have failed to perform or comply in any material
respect with any obligation, agreement or covenant required to be performed
or complied with by it under the Agreement prior to the Expiration Date and
such failure remains uncured; or

 

(v) since the date of the Agreement, there shall have occurred any event,
condition, change, occurrence or development of a state of facts that has
had, or would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect; or

 

(d) Parent shall not have received a certificate signed on behalf of the
Company by the chief executive officer or chief financial officer of the
Company to the effect that none of the conditions in _paragraphs (c)(iii)_ ,
_(c)(iv)_ , and _(c)(v)_ of this _Annex I_ shall have occurred and be
continuing.

 

The foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of Parent and Merger Sub,
may be asserted by Parent or Merger Sub regardless of the circumstances
giving rise to any such conditions, and may be waived by Parent or Merger Sub
in whole or in part at any time and from time to time in their sole
discretion; _provided_ that the Minimum Condition may be waived by Parent and
Merger Sub only with the prior written consent of the Company, which may be
granted or withheld in the Companys sole discretion. The failure by Parent or
Merger Sub at any time to exercise any of the foregoing rights shall not be
deemed a waiver of any such right and each such right shall be deemed an
ongoing right which may be asserted at any time and from time to time. All
capitalized terms used but not defined in this _Annex I_ shall have the
meanings ascribed to them in the Agreement to which this _Annex I_ is
attached.
