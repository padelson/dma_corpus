 CONSIDERATION AND EXCHANGE PROCEDURES

  



  

3.01 _Conversion of Shares_. At the Effective Time, automatically by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of any holder
of shares of Seller Capital Stock:

  



  

(a) _Purchaser Bank Common Stock_. Each share of Purchaser Bank
Common Stock that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall remain issued and outstanding upon and after the
Effective Time and shall be unchanged by the Merger.

  



  

(b) _Seller Capital Stock_. Subject to _Sections 3.02_ , _3.04_ ,
_3.05_ , _3.06, 3.07 and 3.08:_

  



  

(i) each share of Seller Common Stock issued and outstanding (for
purposes of clarity, excluding shares held in treasury by Seller) immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into, and shall be canceled in
exchange for, the right to receive 0.9000 of a share of Purchaser Parent
Common Stock (the " _Exchange Ratio_ "); and

  



  

(ii) Each share of Seller Preferred Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into, and shall be
canceled in exchange for, the right to receive that number of shares of
Purchaser Parent Common Stock equal to the product of (X) the number of
shares of Seller Common Stock into which such share of Seller Preferred Stock
is convertible in connection with, and as a result of, the Merger, and (Y)
the Exchange Ratio.

  



  

3.02 _Exchange Procedures_.

  



  

(a) _Mailing of Transmittal Material_. As promptly as practicable,
but in no event later than five (5) Business Days prior to the
Effective Time, Seller will deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the agent
designated by Purchaser Parent (who, if different than Purchaser Parent's or
Seller's then serving registrar and transfer agent, is reasonably acceptable
to Seller) (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") all information which is reasonably
necessary for the Exchange Agent to perform its obligations as
specified herein. As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, but in
no event later than three (3) Business Days following the Effective Time,
Purchaser Parent shall cause, the Exchange Agent to mail and otherwise make
available to each holder of record of Seller Capital Stock, a notice and a
form of letter of transmittal, in a form reasonably acceptable to Seller
(which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to such Certificate(s) theretofore representing shares of Seller
Capital Stock shall pass, only upon proper delivery of such Certificate(s) to
the Exchange Agent or transfer of Book-Entry Shares to the Exchange Agent),
advising such holder of the effectiveness of the Merger and the instructions
and procedure for surrendering to the Exchange Agent such Certificate(s) or
Book-Entry Shares in exchange for book-entry shares representing the number
of whole shares of Purchaser Parent Common Stock and any cash in lieu of
fractional shares which the shares of Seller Common Stock represented by such
Certificate(s) or Book-Entry Shares shall have been converted into the right
to receive pursuant to this Agreement as well as any dividends or
distributions to be paid in respect of such shares pursuant to this Agreement.
A letter of transmittal will be properly completed only if accompanied by a
Certificate or Certificates or instructions to transfer Book-Entry Shares
representing all shares of Seller Capital Stock covered thereby, subject to
the provisions of _Section 3.02(d)_.

  



  

   

 | 13| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) _Purchaser Parent Deliveries_. At the Effective Time, for the
benefit of the holders of Certificates and/or Book-Entry Shares,
Purchaser Parent shall deliver to the Exchange Agent, to be given to the
holders of Seller Capital Stock in exchange for their Certificates and Book-
Entry Shares as provided for in this _Article III_, (i) evidence of shares in
book entry form, representing the number of whole shares of Purchaser Parent
Common Stock issuable to the holders of Seller Capital Stock as the Merger
Consideration and (ii) an amount in cash equal to the amount due in lieu of
fractional shares pursuant to _Section 3.04_. The Exchange Agent shall not
be entitled to vote or exercise any rights of ownership with respect to the
shares of Purchaser Parent Common Stock held by it from time to time
hereunder, except that it shall receive and hold all dividends or other
distributions paid or distributed with respect to such shares of Purchaser
Parent Common Stock for the account of the Persons entitled thereto.

  



  

(c) _Issued Shares_. All shares of Purchaser Parent Common Stock
to be issued pursuant to the Merger shall be deemed issued and outstanding as
of the Effective Time and whenever a dividend or other distribution is
declared by Purchaser Parent in respect of the Purchaser Parent Common Stock,
the record date for which is at or after the Effective Time, that declaration
shall include dividends or other distributions in respect of all shares of
Purchaser Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to this Agreement. No
dividends or other distributions in respect of the Purchaser Parent Common
Stock shall be paid to any holder of any unsurrendered Certificate or Book-
Entry Shares until such Certificate (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the
Certificate as provided in _Section 3.02(e)_ ) or Book-Entry Shares are
surrendered for exchange in accordance with this _Article III_. Subject to
the effect of applicable laws, following the surrender of any such
Certificate (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the Certificate as provided in
_Section 3.02(e)_ ) or Book-Entry Shares, there shall be issued and/or paid
to the holder of the book-entry shares representing whole shares of Purchaser
Parent Common Stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (A) at the
time of such surrender, the dividends or other distributions with a record
date at or after the Effective Time theretofore payable with respect to such
whole shares of Purchaser Parent Common Stock and not paid and (B) at the
appropriate payment date, the dividends or other distributions payable with
respect to such whole shares of Purchaser Parent Common Stock with a record
date at or after the Effective Time but with a payment date subsequent to
surrender.

  



  

(d) _Exchange Agent Deliveries_.

  



  

(i) Each holder of an outstanding Certificate or Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares who has surrendered such Certificate or Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares to the Exchange Agent will, upon acceptance thereof by the
Exchange Agent, be entitled to evidence of issuance in book entry form, the
number of whole shares of Purchaser Parent Common Stock and the amount of
cash, if any, into which the aggregate number of shares of Seller Capital
Stock previously represented by such Certificate or Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares surrendered shall have been converted pursuant to this Agreement
and any other distribution theretofore paid with respect to Purchaser Parent
Common Stock issuable in the Merger, in each case, without interest. The
Exchange Agent shall accept such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares upon
compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Exchange Agent
may impose consistent with the notice and form of letter of transmittal to
effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal exchange
practices.

  



  

(ii) Each outstanding Certificate or Book-Entry Share which prior
to the Effective Time represented Seller Capital Stock and which is
not surrendered to the Exchange Agent in accordance with the procedures
provided for herein shall, except as otherwise herein provided, until duly
surrendered to the Exchange Agent, be deemed to evidence ownership of the
number of shares of Purchaser Parent Common Stock and the amount of cash, if
any, into which such Seller Capital Stock shall have been converted. After the
Effective Time, there shall be no further transfer on the records of Seller
of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares representing shares of Seller Capital
Stock and, if such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to Seller
for transfer, they shall be cancelled against delivery of book entry shares
representing Purchaser Parent Common Stock and cash as hereinabove provided.

  



  

   

 | 14| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(e) _Lost or Destroyed Certificates; Issuances of Purchaser Parent
Common Stock in New Names_. The Exchange Agent shall not be obligated to
deliver book-entry shares representing shares of Purchaser Parent Common Stock
to which a holder of Seller Capital Stock would otherwise be entitled as a
result of the Merger until such holder surrenders the Certificate or
Certificates representing the shares of Seller Capital Stock for exchange as
provided in this _Section 3.02_, or, in default thereof, an appropriate
affidavit of loss and indemnity agreement and/or a bond in an amount as may be
reasonably required in each case by Purchaser Parent. If any book entry
shares of Purchaser Parent Common Stock are to be issued in a name other than
that in which the Certificate evidencing Seller Capital Stock surrendered in
exchange therefore is registered, it shall be a condition of the issuance
thereof that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or
accompanied by an executed form of assignment separate from the Certificate
and otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such
exchange pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other Tax required by
reason of the issuance of book entry shares of Purchaser Parent Common
Stock in any name other than that of the registered holder of the Certificate
or Book-Entry Shares surrendered or otherwise establish to the satisfaction
of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.

  



  

(f) _Unclaimed Merger Consideration_. The exchange of shares of
Seller Capital Stock for the Merger Consideration as provided in this 
_Section 3.02_ shall be administered by the Exchange Agent until such time as
any unclaimed portion thereof is required to be delivered to a public
official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.
Neither the Exchange Agent nor any party to this Agreement shall be liable to
any holder of stock represented by any Certificate or Book-Entry Share
for any consideration paid to a public official pursuant to applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar laws. The Exchange Agent shall be
entitled to rely upon the stock transfer books of Seller to establish the
identity of those Persons entitled to receive the consideration specified in
this Agreement, which books shall be conclusive (absent manifest error) with
respect thereto. In the event of a dispute with respect to ownership of stock
represented by any Certificate or Book-Entry Share, the Exchange Agent shall
be entitled to deposit any consideration represented thereby in escrow with an
independent third party and thereafter be relieved with respect to any claims
thereto.

  



  

3.03 _Rights as Shareholders_. At the Effective Time, holders of
Seller Capital Stock shall cease to be, and shall have no rights as,
shareholders of Seller other than to receive the consideration provided for
under this _Article III_.

  



  

3.04 _No Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement, neither certificates nor scrip for fractional shares of
Purchaser Parent Common Stock shall be issued in the Merger. Each holder of
Seller Capital Stock who otherwise would have been entitled to a fraction of
a share of Purchaser Parent Common Stock (after taking into account all
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares delivered by such holder) shall receive in
lieu thereof cash (without interest) in an amount determined by multiplying
the fractional share interest to which such holder would otherwise be
entitled by the Purchaser Parent Average Share Price, rounded to the
nearest whole cent. No such holder shall be entitled to dividends, voting
rights or any other rights in respect of any fractional share.

  



  

   

 | 15| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

3.05 _Dissenting Shares._ Each outstanding share of Seller Preferred
Stock the holder of which has perfected his, her or its right to
dissent pursuant to Chapter 13 of the CGCL, including making a demand of
Seller to purchase his, her or its shares pursuant to Section 1301 of Chapter
13 of the CGCL and submitting his, her or its shares for endorsement pursuant
to Section 1302 of Chapter 13 of the CGCL, and has not effectively withdrawn
or lost such right as of the Effective Time (the " _Dissenting Shares_
"), shall not be converted into or represent a right to receive the Merger
Consideration hereunder, and the holder thereof shall be entitled only to
such rights as are granted by the CGCL. Seller shall give Purchaser Parent
prompt notice upon receipt by Seller of any such written demands for payment
of the fair value of such shares of Seller Preferred Stock and of withdrawals
of such demands and any other instruments provided pursuant to the CGCL. If
any holder of Dissenting Shares shall have effectively withdrawn or lost the
right to dissent (through failure to perfect or otherwise), the Dissenting
Shares held by such holder shall be converted on a share by share basis into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with the
applicable provisions of this Agreement. Any payments made in respect of
Dissenting Shares shall be made by Purchaser Parent or the Surviving Bank
within the time period set forth in the CGCL.

  



  

3.06 _Anti-Dilution Provisions_. If, between the date hereof and the
Effective Time, the shares of Purchaser Parent Common Stock shall be
increased, decreased or changed into a different number or class of shares by
reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, split-up, combination,
exchange of shares or readjustment, stock dividend or distribution, stock
split (including a reverse stock split), issuer tender or exchange offer or
other transaction in Purchaser Parent Common Stock having such an effect, the
Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted accordingly; provided that a bona fide
offering or sale of Purchaser Parent Common Stock for fair value
received shall not be deemed a reclassification, recapitalization, split-up,
combination, exchange of shares or readjustment, stock dividend or
distribution, stock split (including a reverse stock split), issuer tender or
exchange offer or other transaction in Purchaser Parent Common Stock having
such an effect.

  



  

3.07 _Withholding Rights_. Purchaser Parent (through the Exchange
Agent, if applicable) shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any
amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares
of Seller Capital Stock or Seller Equity Awards such amounts as Purchaser
Parent reasonably determines is required under the Code or any state, local or
foreign Tax law or regulation thereunder to deduct and withhold with respect
to the making of such payment, and to collect any necessary Tax forms or other
necessary information. Except for any withholding required as the result of
any failure to deliver any certificates or forms requested for purposes
of federal backup withholding, in the event Purchaser Parent reasonably
determines that it is so required to deduct or withhold an amount for or on
account of any Tax from any consideration payable or otherwise deliverable
pursuant to this Agreement, Purchaser Parent shall use reasonable efforts to
notify Seller of its determination and the parties shall cooperate in good
faith to minimize to the extent permissible the amount of any such deduction
or withholding, including providing any certificates or forms that are
reasonably requested to establish and exemption from (or reduction in) any
deduction or withholding. Any amounts so withheld shall be timely remitted to
the applicable Governmental Authority and shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Seller Capital Stock or
Seller Equity Award, as applicable, in respect of which such deduction
and withholding was made by Purchaser Parent.

3.08 _Seller Options, Seller Restricted Stock and Seller Restricted
Stock Units_.

  



  

(a) At the Effective Time, each vested Seller Option which is
outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
cancelled in exchange for the right to receive (without interest) from Seller
immediately prior to the Effective Time, a single lump sum cash payment equal
to the product of (i) the number of shares of Seller Common Stock subject to
such Seller Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) the
excess, if any, of (A) the Purchaser Parent Average Share Price multiplied by
the Exchange Ratio over (B) the exercise price per share of such Seller Option
(the " _Option Merger Consideration_ "), less any applicable Taxes required
to be withheld with respect to such payment. If the exercise price per share
of any such Seller Option is equal to or greater than the Purchaser Parent
Average Share Price multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, such Seller
Option shall be canceled without any cash payment being made in respect
thereof. Seller shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the written
acknowledgement of each holder of a then outstanding Seller Option with regard
to the cancellation of such Seller Option and the payment therefor in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Subject to the foregoing, the
Seller Equity Plans and all Seller Options issued thereunder shall terminate
at the Effective Time.

  



  

(b) With respect to each outstanding award of restricted shares of
Seller Common Stock granted pursuant to a Seller Equity Plan (the "
_Seller Restricted Stock_ "), Seller shall take all necessary action, if any,
and without any action on the part of the holder thereof and consistent with
the terms of the Seller Equity Plans, to cause each such outstanding award of
Seller Restricted Stock to become fully vested effective immediately prior to
the Effective Time and, as a result of such vesting, a number of shares of
Seller Common Stock equal to (i) the number of shares of Seller Restricted
Stock (including the number of shares of Seller Common Stock contemplated by
such award to cover dividends) held by such holder minus (ii) a number of
shares of Seller Common Stock having a fair market value, based on the
closing price of Seller Common Stock on the second trading day prior to the
Closing Date, equal to any applicable Taxes required to be withheld (if any)
with respect to such vesting (such amount being referred to as the " _Net
Vested Seller Shares_ "), shall be deemed issued in the name of such holder
and outstanding as of the Effective Time. At the Effective Time, each Net
Vested Seller Share shall be converted into, and shall be canceled in
exchange for, the right to receive a number of shares of Purchaser Parent
Common Stock equal to the Exchange Ratio and any accrued dividends that are
payable in cash pursuant to the terms of such Seller Equity Award; _provided_
that any fractional shares of Purchaser Parent Common Stock shall be treated
as set forth in _Section 3.04_.

  



  

(c) (i) With respect to each outstanding award of time-
based restricted stock units granted pursuant to a Seller Equity Plan (the "
_Seller RSUs_ ") (other than 2020 Seller RSUs held by Continuing Employees),
Seller shall take all necessary action, if any, and without any action on the
part of the holder thereof and consistent with the terms of the Seller Equity
Plans, to cause each such outstanding award of Seller RSUs to become fully
vested effective immediately prior to the Effective Time and, as a result of
such vesting, a number of shares of Seller Common Stock equal to (x) the
number of shares of Seller Common Stock subject to the Seller RSUs (including
the number of shares of Seller Common Stock contemplated by such award to
cover dividend equivalents) held by such holder minus (y) a number of shares
of Seller Common Stock having a fair market value, based on the closing price
of Seller Common Stock on the second trading day prior to the Closing Date,
equal to any applicable Taxes required to be withheld with respect to such
vesting and settlement (such amount being referred to as the " _Net Vested
Seller RSU Shares_ "), shall be deemed issued in the name of such holder and
outstanding as of the Effective Time. At the Effective Time, each Net
Vested Seller RSU Share shall be converted into, and shall be canceled in
exchange for, the right to receive a number of shares of Purchaser Parent
Common Stock equal to the Exchange Ratio and any accrued dividend equivalents
that are payable in cash pursuant to the terms of such Seller Equity Award;
_provided_ that any fractional shares of Purchaser Parent Common Stock shall
be treated as set forth in _Section 3.04_.

(ii) With respect to each outstanding award of performance-based
restricted stock units granted pursuant to a Seller Equity Plan (the "
_Seller PRSUs_ ") (other than 2020 Seller PRSUs held by Continuing
Employees), Seller shall take all necessary action, if any, and without any
action on the part of the holder thereof and consistent with the terms of the
Seller Equity Plans, to cause (x) with respect to Seller PRSUs (excluding
2020 PRSUs) held by a Continuing Employee, a Pro Rata Portion of each
outstanding Seller PRSU award held by such Continuing Employee, and (y) with
respect to Seller PRSUs (including 2020 PRSUs) held by a holder who is not a
Continuing Employee, the greater of the Shortened Period RSU (as such term is
defined in the applicable award agreement) and the target number of Seller
PRSUs subject to such outstanding Seller PRSU (in each case, the " _Vested
Seller PRSUs_ "), to become vested effective immediately prior to the
Effective Time and, as a result of such vesting, a number of shares of
Seller Common Stock equal to (A) the number of shares of Seller Common Stock
subject to the Vested Seller PRSUs (including the number of shares of Seller
Common Stock contemplated by such award to cover dividend equivalents) held by
such holder minus (B) a number of shares of Seller Common Stock having a fair
market value, based on the closing price of Seller Common Stock on the second
trading day prior to the Closing Date, equal to any applicable Taxes required
to be withheld with respect to such vesting and settlement (such amount being
referred to as the " _Net Vested Seller PRSU Shares_ "), shall be deemed
issued in the name of such holder and outstanding as of the Effective Time.
At the Effective Time, each Net Vested Seller PRSU Share shall be
converted into, and shall be canceled in exchange for, the right to receive a
number of shares of Purchaser Parent Common Stock equal to the Exchange Ratio
and any accrued dividend equivalents that are payable in cash pursuant to the
terms of such Seller Equity Award;  _provided_ that any fractional shares of
Purchaser Parent Common Stock shall be treated as set forth in _Section
3.04_. For purposes of this Section 3.08(c)(ii), " _Pro Rata Portion_ " means
the pro rata portion of the total number of shares of Seller Common Stock
subject to an award of Seller PRSUs (i.e., a pro rata portion of the target
number of Seller PRSUs subject to the award) based on the portion of the
performance period completed as of the Closing Date or, if greater, based on
Seller's actual performance based on a shortened performance period which
extends through the end of the fiscal quarter immediately preceding the
Closing Date.

  



  

(iii) At the Effective Time, each 2020 Seller RSU held by a
Continuing Employee shall, automatically and without any action on the part
of the holder thereof, cease to represent a restricted stock unit denominated
in shares of Seller Common Stock and shall be substituted with a restricted
stock unit denominated in shares of Purchaser Parent Common Stock (a "
_Purchaser Parent RSU_ ") with terms substantially similar to the terms and
conditions (including the same vesting terms) as were applicable to the
applicable 2020 Seller RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time. The number
of shares of Purchaser Parent Common Stock subject to each such Purchaser
Parent RSU shall be equal to the product (rounded to the nearest whole number)
of (x) the number of shares of Seller Common Stock subject to such 2020
Seller RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (y) the
Exchange Ratio.

(iv) At the Effective Time, each 2020 Seller PRSU held by a
Continuing Employee shall, automatically and without any action on the
part of the holder thereof, cease to represent a performance stock unit
denominated in shares of Seller Common Stock and shall be substituted with a
Purchaser Parent RSU with terms substantially similar to the terms and
conditions (including the same service-based vesting terms but excluding
performance-based vesting terms) as were applicable to the applicable 2020
Seller PRSU immediately prior to the Effective Time. The number of shares of
Purchaser Parent Common Stock subject to each such Purchaser Parent RSU shall
be equal to the product (rounded to the nearest whole number) of (x) the
number of shares of Seller Common Stock subject to such 2020 Seller PRSU
immediately prior to the Effective Time, determined based on the greater of
the Shortened Period RSUs (as such term is defined in the award agreement
applicable to the Seller PRSUs) and the target number of 2020 Seller PRSUs,
multiplied by (y) the Exchange Ratio.

  



  

(d) At or prior to the Effective Time, Seller, the Seller Board and
the Compensation Committee of the Seller Board, as applicable, shall adopt
any resolutions and take any actions which are necessary to effectuate the
provisions of this _Section 3.08_ , and shall take all actions that may be
necessary or required to ensure that from and after the Effective Time
neither Purchaser Parent nor its Subsidiaries will be required to deliver
shares of Seller Common Stock to any Person pursuant to or in settlement of
Seller Equity Awards.

  



  

(e) Purchaser Parent shall take all actions reasonably necessary to
issue the shares of Purchaser Parent Common Stock (and cash in lieu of
fractional shares as contemplated by _Section 3.04_ and cash in respect of
any dividends or dividend equivalents) to holders of Net Vested Seller
Shares, Net Vested Seller RSU Shares, and Net Vested Seller PRSU Shares in
accordance with this _Section 3.08 _ as soon as reasonably practicable after
the Effective Time (and, for the avoidance of doubt, such shares of Purchaser
Parent Common Stock and cash shall be delivered through the Exchange Agent
procedures contemplated by Section 3.02). Purchaser Parent shall take all
actions that are necessary for the substitution of Seller Equity Awards
pursuant to _Section 3.08(c)(iii) _and _Section 3.08(c)(iv)_ including the
reservation, issuance and listing of Purchaser Parent Common Stock as
necessary to effect the transactions contemplated by such _Sections_. If
registration of shares of Purchaser Parent Common Stock issuable under the
Purchaser Parent RSUs and Purchaser Parent PRSUs is required under the
Securities Act, then Purchaser Parent shall file with the SEC on the Closing
Date a registration statement on Form S-8 with respect to such Purchaser
Parent Common Stock, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to maintain
the effectiveness of such registration statement.

  



  

3.09 _Seller Warrants_.

  



  

(a) Seller shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain from each
holder of a then-outstanding Seller Warrant, no later than five (5) Business
Days prior to the Closing, either (x) a written acknowledgement with regard to
the cancellation of such Seller Warrant immediately prior to the Effective
Time and the payment therefor in accordance with the terms of _Section
3.09(a)(i)_ below (a " _Warrant Cancellation Notice_ "), or (y) a written
notice of providing for the exercise (for cash or cashless) effective
immediately prior to the Effective Time of such Seller Warrant holder's Seller
Warrant in accordance with the terms of _Section 3.09(a)(ii)_ below (a "
_Warrant Exercise Notice_ ").

---|---|--- 

 



    



   



  

(i)  Each outstanding Seller Warrant for which a Warrant
Cancellation Notice has been received pursuant to _Section 3.09(a)_ above
shall be canceled in exchange for the right of the holder of such Seller
Warrant to receive from Purchaser Parent a single lump sum cash payment,
equal to the product of (x) the number of shares of Seller Common Stock
subject to such Seller Warrant (on an as-converted basis in the case of
Seller Preferred Stock Warrants) immediately prior to the Effective Time,
and (y) the excess, if any, of (A) the Purchaser Parent Average Share Price
multiplied by the Exchange Ratio over (B) the exercise price per share of
Seller Common Stock of such Seller Warrant (on an as-converted basis in the
case of Seller Preferred Stock Warrants), less any applicable Taxes required
to be withheld with respect to such payment. If the exercise price per share
of any such Seller Warrant (on an as-converted basis, in the case of Seller
Preferred Stock Warrant) is equal to or greater than the Purchaser
Parent Average Share Price multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, such Seller
Warrant shall be canceled without any cash payment being made in respect
thereof.

  



  

(ii)  Each outstanding Seller Warrant for which a Warrant Exercise
Notice has been received pursuant to _Section 3.09(a)_  above shall be deemed
exercised, and the shares of Seller Capital Stock issuable upon exercise of
such Seller Warrant shall be deemed issued immediately prior to the Effective
Time. At the Effective Time, the shares of Seller Capital Stock issued
pursuant to this _Section 3.09(a)(ii)_ shall be converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 3.01(b)_.

  



  

(b) In the event that, for any outstanding Seller Warrant, Seller has
not received a Warrant Cancellation Notice or a Warrant Exercise Notice at
least five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing, then in accordance with the
terms of such Seller Warrant, Purchaser Parent shall assume such Seller
Warrant and shall be obligated to pay the Merger Consideration to the
holder of such Seller Warrant upon exercise thereof in accordance with its
terms.

  



  

3.10   _Reservation of Shares_. Prior to the Closing, the Purchaser
Parent Board shall reserve for issuance a sufficient number of shares of
Purchaser Parent Common Stock for the purpose of issuing its shares in
exchange for shares of Seller Capital Stock in the Merger or upon the
exercise of Seller Warrants, if any, assumed by Purchaser Parent in accordance
with _Section 3.09(b)_ above.

one or more representations or warranties contained in _Sections 5.03_ or
_5.04_ or to one or more of its covenants contained in _Article IV_ or _VI_ ;
provided, however, that the mere inclusion of an item in a Disclosure

deemed an admission by a party that such item represents a material exception
or fact, event or circumstance or that, absent such inclusion in the

Documents (A) complied or will comply in all material respects with the
applicable requirements under the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of

will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading, except that information as of a later date shall be
deemed to modify information as of an earlier date; and each of the
consolidated balance sheets contained in or incorporated by reference into any
of Seller's Annual Reports on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q
(including the related notes and schedules thereto) fairly presents, or will
fairly present, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position
of Seller and its Subsidiaries as of its date, and each of the consolidated
statements of operations and comprehensive income, changes in stockholders'
equity, and cash flows or equivalent statements in Seller's Annual Reports on
Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q (including any related notes and
schedules thereto) fairly presents, or will fairly present, the consolidated
results of operations, changes in stockholders' equity and other
comprehensive income (loss) and cash flows, as the case may be, of Seller and
its Subsidiaries for the periods to which they relate, in each case in
accordance with GAAP consistently applied during the periods involved, except
in each case as may be noted therein and subject, in the case of unaudited
consolidated financial statements that are part of the Seller
Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, to normal year-end adjustments. The books and
records of Seller and its Subsidiaries have been, and are being, maintained
in all material respects in accordance with GAAP and any other applicable
legal and accounting requirements and reflect only actual transactions.

  



  

(ii)  Except as set forth on the unaudited consolidated balance
sheet of Seller dated as of September 30, 2019 and included in Seller's
Securities Documents filed prior to the date hereof, neither Seller nor any of
its Subsidiaries has any liability (whether absolute, contingent or accrued
or otherwise and whether due or to become due) that would be required to be
reflected on a balance sheet or in notes thereto prepared in accordance with
GAAP, other than liabilities (A) incurred after September 30, 2019 in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice, or (B) incurred
pursuant to or provided for in this Agreement and that, individually or in
the aggregate, are not and would not reasonably be expected to be material to
Seller and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

  



  

   

31

 



    



  

(iii)  Since September 30, 2019, (A) Seller and its Subsidiaries
have conducted their respective businesses in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice, (B) neither Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries
has taken nor permitted or entered into any contract with respect to, or
otherwise agreed or committed to do or take, any action that, if taken after
the date hereof, would constitute a breach of any of the covenants in
_Section 4.01_ and (C) no event has occurred or circumstance arisen
that, individually or taken together with all other facts, circumstances and
events (described in any paragraph of this _Section 5.03_  or otherwise), has

Seller and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

  



  

(iv)  No agreement pursuant to which any Loans or other assets
have been or shall be sold by Seller or its Subsidiaries entitled the buyer
of such Loans or other assets, unless there is material breach of a
representation or covenant by Seller or its Subsidiaries, to cause Seller or
its Subsidiaries to repurchase such Loan or other asset or the buyer to pursue
any other form of recourse against Seller or its Subsidiaries. _Section
5.03(g)(iv)_ of Seller's Disclosure Schedule sets forth all cash, stock or
other dividend or any other distribution with respect to the capital stock of
Seller or its Subsidiaries that has been declared, set aside or paid since
December 31, 2015, as well as all shares of capital stock of Seller or its
Subsidiaries that have been purchased, redeemed or otherwise acquired,

whether computerized or not) that are under the exclusive ownership and
direct control of Seller or its Subsidiaries or its accountants (including all
means of access thereto and therefrom), except for any non-exclusive
ownership and non-direct control that, would not reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect on Seller and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole. Seller (A) has implemented and maintains disclosure controls and
procedures, as defined by Rule 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, to
ensure that material information relating to Seller and its Subsidiaries is
made known to the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of
Seller by others within Seller or its Subsidiaries and (B) has disclosed,
based on its most recent evaluation prior to the date hereof, to Seller's
outside auditors and the audit committee of the Seller Board (x) any
significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation
of internal controls over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to
adversely affect Seller's ability to record, process, summarize and report
financial information and (y) to the knowledge of Seller, any fraud, whether
or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a
significant role in Seller's internal controls over financial
reporting. These disclosures, if any, were made in writing by management to
Seller's auditors and audit committee and a copy has previously been made
available to Purchaser Parent. The disclosure controls and procedures
discussed above are effective to ensure that information required to be
disclosed by Seller is recorded and reported on a timely basis to the
individuals responsible for the preparation of Seller's filings with the FDIC
and other public disclosure documents. Seller's internal control over
financial reporting is effective in providing reasonable assurance regarding
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP and
includes policies and procedures that (A) pertain to the maintenance of
records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of Seller, (B) provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and
expenditures of Seller are being made only in accordance with authorizations
of management and directors of Seller and (C) provide reasonable assurance
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or
disposition of Seller's assets that could have a material effect on its
financial statements.

respect to the Transaction, other than fees to be paid to Piper Sandler and
Co., which are set forth in _Section 5.03(l)_ of Seller's

(ii)  Each Benefit Plan has been established and administered to
date in all material respects in accordance with the applicable provisions of
ERISA, the Code and applicable law and with the terms and provisions of all
documents, contracts or agreements pursuant to which such Benefit Plan is
maintained. Each Benefit Plan that is intended to qualify under Section 401(a)
of the Code, has received a current determination letter (or is the subject
of a current opinion letter in the case of any prototype plan) from the IRS
on which Seller can rely that it is so qualified, and nothing has occurred
with respect to the operation of any such plan which would cause the loss of
such qualification or exemption or the imposition of any material liability.
There is no pending or, to Seller's Knowledge, threatened proceeding, lawsuit
or claim (other than a routine claim for benefits) as of the date hereof and
with respect to which the amount in controversy exceeds $100,000 relating to
the Benefit Plans. Neither Seller nor its Subsidiaries have received any
correspondence from a Governmental Authority or any participant or beneficiary
of a Benefit Plan that brings into questions the qualification of any such
plan. Neither Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries is subject to or could
reasonably be likely to be subject to a material liability, fine or penalty
of any kind with respect to any Benefit Plan under either the Code or ERISA.
No assets of Seller or any Subsidiary are subject to an encumbrance or lien
that may be imposed under ERISA or the Code with respect to the operation,
administration or funding of any Benefit Plan. Since January 1, 2017, no
Benefit Plan or related trust has been the subject of an audit, investigation
or examination or other proceeding by the IRS, the DOL or other Governmental
Authority. There have been no nonexempt "prohibited transactions" within the
meaning of Section 4975 of the Code or Section 406 of ERISA and no breach of
fiduciary duty has occurred with respect to any Benefit Plan in connection
with which Seller or any Subsidiary reasonably could be subject to either a
civil penalty assessed pursuant to Section 409 or 502(i) of ERISA or a tax
imposed pursuant to Section 4975, 4976, 4980D, 4980H or 49801 of the Code or
under any applicable provision of the Health Care and Education
Reconciliation Act of 2010 (the " _ACA_ "). With respect to each Benefit
Plan, as applicable, all reports and disclosures required to be filed or
delivered under ERISA and the Code have been accurate in all material respects
as of the date filed, have been filed or distributed in a timely manner, and
any Taxes due in connection with such filings have been paid. Seller and any
ERISA Affiliate that sponsors, maintains or contributes to a group health
plan (within the meaning of Section 5000(b) of the Code) has complied with
the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, the ACA and the requirements
of Section 4980B of the Code and the regulations promulgated under each such
law, including applicable reporting, tax deposits and fee payment obligations.

  



  

(iii)  Neither Seller nor any entity considered to be a single
employer with Seller under Section 4001(b)(1) of ERISA or Section 414(b),
(c), (m) or (o) of the Code (" _ERISA Affiliate_ ") maintains or contributes,
or has, within the past six (6) years, maintained or contributed to, any
pension plan subject to Title IV of ERISA, any multiple employer plan
(as defined in Section 413(c) of the Code), any multiemployer plan (as
defined in 4001(a)(3) of ERISA), any "voluntary employee's beneficiary
association" within the meaning of Section 501(c)(9) of the Code, any
"multiple employer welfare arrangement" within the meaning of Section 3(40)
of ERISA or any Retiree Welfare Plan.

  



  

(iv)  Except as set forth in _Section 5.03(m)(iv)_ of Seller's
Disclosure Schedule, all contributions required to be made under the terms of
any Benefit Plan (including any amounts withheld from employees' paychecks
with respect to a Benefit Plan) and premiums required to be paid have been
timely made or paid when due in accordance with the terms of the
applicable Benefit Plan and applicable law. All contributions for any period
ending on or before the Closing Date that are not yet due have been made or
have been reflected appropriately in the Seller's financial statements
included in Seller's Securities Documents. Benefits under each Benefit Plan
that is an "employee welfare benefit plan" (within the meaning of
Section 3(1) of ERISA), with the exception of any flexible spending
arrangements subject to Sections 125 and 105 of the Code and health savings
accounts, are provided exclusively through insurance contracts or policies
issued by an insurance company, health maintenance organization, or similar
organization unrelated to Seller or any of its Subsidiaries, the premiums for
which are paid directly by Seller or any of its Subsidiaries, from its
general assets or partly from its general assets and partly from contributions
by its employees. No insurance policy or contract relating to a Benefit Plan
requires or permits a retroactive increase to premiums or payments due
thereunder. No event has occurred or condition exists that would reasonably be
likely to result in a material increase in the level of amounts paid or
accrued or benefits or premiums paid by the Seller under the Seller's health
and welfare benefit plans for 2020 as compared to 2019.

account in the performance of such calculations or deemed necessary by

or excise Taxes under Section 409A or Section 4999 of the Code.

provisions of any real property lease, (B) give any Person the right to
declare a default with respect to, or exercise any remedy under any material
provision of, any real property lease, (C) give any Person the right to

of the party making such Acquisition Proposal) and furnish to Purchaser
Parent all the material terms and conditions of such proposal; and

  



  

(v)  prior to effecting such a Change in Recommendation, Seller
shall, and shall cause its financial and legal advisors to, during the period
following Seller's delivery of the notice referred to in clause (iv) above,
negotiate with Purchaser Parent in good faith for a period of up to five (5)
Business Days (to the extent Purchaser Parent desires to negotiate) to
make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that
such Acquisition Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal.

  



  

(c)  Purchaser Parent agrees to take, in accordance with applicable
law and the Purchaser Parent Certificate and Purchaser Parent Bylaws, all
action necessary to convene as soon as reasonably practicable a meeting of its
shareholders to consider and vote upon the approval of the issuance of the
Purchaser Parent Common Stock in the Merger and any other matters required to
be approved by Purchaser Parent's shareholders for consummation of the
Transaction (including any adjournment or postponement, the " _Purchaser
Parent Meeting_ ") and will in any event use reasonable best efforts to
convene such meeting no later than sixty (60) calendar days after the
Registration Statement is declared effective. The Purchaser Parent Board shall
at all times prior to and during the Purchaser Parent Meeting recommend
approval of the issuance of the Purchaser Parent Common Stock in the Merger
and any other matters required to be approved by Purchaser Parent's
shareholders for consummation of the Transaction and shall take all
reasonable lawful action to solicit such approval by its shareholders.

6.03   _Registration Statement_.

  



  

(a)  Purchaser Parent agrees to prepare a registration statement on
Form S-4 or other applicable form (the " _Registration Statement_ ") to be
filed by Purchaser Parent with the SEC in connection with the issuance of the
shares of Purchaser Parent Common Stock to the Seller shareholders, including
holders of Net Vested Seller Shares, Net Vested Seller RSU Shares, and Net
Vested Seller PRSU Shares, as the Merger Consideration in the Merger
(including the joint proxy statement for the Purchaser Parent Meeting and the
Seller Meeting and prospectus and other proxy solicitation materials of
Purchaser Parent and Seller constituting a part thereof (the " _Proxy
Statement_ ") and all related documents). Seller shall prepare and furnish
such information relating to it, its Subsidiaries and their respective
directors, officers and shareholders as may be reasonably required in
connection with the above referenced documents based on its knowledge of and
access to the information required for said documents, and Seller, and its
legal, financial and accounting advisors, shall have the right to review in
advance and comment on such Registration Statement prior to its filing.
Seller agrees to cooperate with Purchaser Parent and Purchaser Parent's
counsel and accountants in requesting and obtaining appropriate opinions,
consents and letters from its financial advisor and independent auditor in
connection with the Registration Statement and the Proxy Statement. Purchaser
Parent shall use its best efforts to file, or cause to be filed, the
Registration Statement with the SEC within forty-five (45) calendar days of
the date of this Agreement. Each of Seller and Purchaser Parent agrees to use
its reasonable best efforts to cause the Registration Statement to be declared
effective under the Securities Act as promptly as reasonably practicable
after the filing thereof. Purchaser Parent also agrees to use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain all necessary state securities law or "Blue
Sky" permits and approvals required to carry out the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. After the Registration Statement is declared
effective under the Securities Act, Seller and Purchaser Parent shall
promptly mail at each party's own expense the Proxy Statement to all of their
respective shareholders.

  



  

(b) Each of Seller and Purchaser Parent agrees that none of the
information supplied or to be supplied by it for inclusion or incorporation
by reference in (i) the Registration Statement shall, at the time the
Registration Statement and each amendment or supplement thereto, if any,
becomes effective under the Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, (ii) the
Proxy Statement and any amendment or supplement thereto shall, at the date(s)
of mailing to Seller's and Purchaser Parent's respective shareholders and the
time(s) of the Seller Meeting and the Purchaser Parent Meeting, contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein,
in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
Each of Seller and Purchaser Parent further agrees that if such party shall
become aware prior to the date of effectiveness of the Registration Statement
of any information furnished by such party that would cause any of the
statements in the Registration Statement or the Proxy Statement to be false or
misleading with respect to any material fact, or to omit to state any
material fact necessary to make the statements therein not false
or misleading, to promptly inform the other parties thereof and to take the
necessary steps to correct the Registration Statement or the Proxy Statement.

  



  

(c) Purchaser Parent agrees to advise Seller promptly in writing
after Purchaser Parent receives notice thereof, of the time when the
Registration Statement has become effective or any supplement or amendment has
been filed, of the issuance of any stop order or the suspension of the
qualification of Purchaser Parent Common Stock for offering or sale in any
jurisdiction, of the initiation or, to the extent Purchaser Parent is aware
thereof, threat of any proceeding for any such purpose, or of any request by
the SEC for the amendment or supplement of the Registration Statement or for
additional information.

6.04   _Regulatory Filings_.

  



  

(a) Each of Purchaser Parent, Purchaser Bank and Seller and their
respective Subsidiaries shall cooperate and use their respective reasonable
best efforts to prepare all documentation, to effect all filings and to obtain
as promptly as practicable all permits, consents, approvals and
authorizations of all Governmental Authorities necessary to consummate the
Transaction; and Purchaser Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to
make any initial application filings with Governmental Authorities
within thirty (30) calendar days of the date of this Agreement. Each of
Purchaser Parent and Seller shall have the right to review in advance, and to
the extent practicable, each shall consult with the other, in each case
subject to applicable laws relating to the exchange of information, with
respect to all applications, notices and other written information submitted
to any Governmental Authority in connection with the Transaction, provided
that Purchaser Parent shall not be required to provide Seller with
confidential portions of any filing with a Governmental Authority. In
exercising the foregoing right, each of such parties agrees to act
reasonably and as promptly as practicable. Each party hereto agrees that it
shall consult with the other party hereto with respect to the obtaining of
all permits, consents, approvals, waivers and authorizations of all
Governmental Authorities necessary or advisable to consummate the
Transaction, and each party shall keep the other party apprised of the status
of material matters relating to completion of the Transaction. Each party
hereto further agrees to the extent permitted by applicable law, regulation or
policies imposed by any Governmental Authority, to provide the other party
with a copy of all correspondence to or from any Governmental Authority in
connection with the Transaction and descriptions of any material or
significant oral communications with any Governmental Authority in connection
with the Transaction, provided that Purchaser Parent shall not be required to
provide Seller with confidential portions of any filing or other
communication with a Governmental Authority.

  



  

(b)  Each party agrees, upon request, to furnish the other party
with all information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers

made by or on behalf of such other party or any of their Subsidiaries to any
Governmental Authority.

  



  

6.05   _Press Releases_. Seller and Purchaser Parent shall consult
with each other before issuing any press release with respect to the
Transaction or this Agreement and shall not issue any such press release or
make any such public statements without the prior consent of the other party,
which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; provided,
however, that Purchaser Parent or Seller may, without the prior consent of
the other party (but after such consultation, to the extent practicable under
the circumstances), issue such press release or make such public statements as
may, upon the advice of outside counsel, be required by law or the rules or
regulations of the SEC, the FDIC, the DBO, DORA or Nasdaq. Seller and
Purchaser Parent shall cooperate to develop all public announcement materials
and make appropriate management available at presentations related to the
Transaction as reasonably requested by the other party.

other information concerning the business, properties and personnel of Seller

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller shall not be required to provide access
to or disclose information where such access or disclosure would jeopardize
the attorney-client privilege of Seller or any other Person in possession or
control of such information (after giving due consideration to the existence
of any common interest, joint defense or similar agreement between the
parties) or contravene any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment, decree,
fiduciary duty or agreement entered into prior to the date of this Agreement
(including without limitation, restrictions on sharing confidential
supervisory information), provided that in any such event, Seller will work
in good faith with Purchaser Parent to make appropriate substitute disclosure
arrangements.

  



  

(b) During the period from the date of this Agreement to the
Effective Time, Seller shall, upon the request of Purchaser Parent, cause one

will work in good faith with Seller to make appropriate substitute disclosure

(f) No investigation by any of the parties or their respective
representatives shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements of the other parties set forth herein.

  



  

6.07   _Acquisition Proposals_.

  



  

(a) Seller agrees that it shall, and shall direct and use its
reasonable best efforts to cause its Affiliates, directors, officers,
employees, agents and representatives (including, without limitation, any
investment banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other
representative retained by it) (all of the foregoing, collectively, "
_Representatives_ ") to, immediately cease any discussions or negotiations
with any other parties that may be ongoing with respect to the possibility
or consideration of any Acquisition Proposal, and will use its reasonable
best efforts to enforce any confidentiality or similar agreement relating to
any Acquisition Proposal, including by requesting the other party to promptly
return or destroy any confidential information previously furnished by or on
behalf of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries thereunder and by specifically
enforcing the terms thereof in a court of competent jurisdiction. From the
date of this Agreement through the Effective Time, neither Seller nor any of
its Subsidiaries shall, and each of the foregoing shall cause their
respective directors, officers or employees or any Representative retained by
them not to, directly or indirectly through another Person, (i) solicit,
initiate or knowingly encourage (including by way of furnishing information
or assistance), or take any other action designed to facilitate or that is
likely to result in, any inquiries or the making of any proposal or offer
that constitutes, or is reasonably likely to lead to, any Acquisition
Proposal, (ii) provide any confidential information or data to any Person
relating to any Acquisition Proposal, (iii) participate in any discussions or
negotiations regarding any Acquisition Proposal, (iv) waive, terminate, modify
or fail to enforce any provision of any contractual "standstill" or similar
obligations of any Person other than Purchaser Parent or its Affiliates, (v)
approve or recommend, propose to approve or recommend, or execute or enter
into, any letter of intent, agreement in principle, merger agreement, asset
purchase agreement or share exchange agreement, option agreement or other
similar agreement related to any Acquisition Proposal or propose to do any of
the foregoing, or (vi) make or authorize any statement, recommendation
or solicitation in support of any Acquisition Proposal; provided, however,
that at any time prior to the date of the Seller Meeting, if the Seller Board
determines in good faith, after consulting with its outside legal and
financial advisors, that the failure to do so would be more likely than not
to be inconsistent with the Seller Board's fiduciary duties under applicable
law, Seller may, in response to a bona fide, written Acquisition Proposal not
solicited in violation of this _Section 6.07(a)_ that the Seller Board
determines in good faith constitutes a Superior Proposal (1) furnish
information with respect to itself to any Person making such a Superior
Proposal pursuant to a confidentiality agreement on terms that are in all
material respects no less restrictive to such Person than the terms contained
in the Confidentiality Agreements are to Purchaser Parent, and (2)
participate in discussions or negotiations regarding such a Superior
Proposal. Seller agrees that it shall concurrently provide to
Purchaser Parent any information (whether such information is confidential,
nonpublic or otherwise) concerning Seller that may be provided to any other
Person in connection with any Superior Proposal which has not previously been
provided to Purchaser Parent. For purposes of this Agreement, the term "
_Acquisition Proposal_ " means any inquiry, proposal or offer, filing of any
regulatory application or notice or disclosure of an intention to do any of
the foregoing from any Person relating to any (w) direct or indirect
acquisition or purchase of a business that constitutes 25% or more of the
total revenues, net income, assets or deposits of Seller and its Subsidiaries
taken as a whole, (x) direct or indirect acquisition or purchase of any class
of Equity Securities representing 25% or more of the voting power of Seller,
(y) tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would result in any
person beneficially owning 25% or more of any class of Equity Securities of
Seller or (z) merger, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization,
liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving Seller, other than
the Transaction contemplated by this Agreement. For purposes of this
Agreement, the term " _Superior Proposal_ " means any bona fide
written proposal made by a third party to acquire, directly or indirectly,
including pursuant to a tender offer, exchange offer, merger, consolidation,
business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar
transaction, for consideration consisting of cash and/or securities, more
than 50% of the combined voting power of the shares of Seller Common Stock
then outstanding or all or substantially all of Seller's consolidated assets,
which the Seller Board determines in good faith, after taking into account
all legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of the proposal and the
person making the proposal (including any break-up fees, expense
reimbursement provisions and conditions to consummation), and after consulting
with Seller's financial advisor (which shall be a recognized investment
banking firm) and outside counsel, (i) is more favorable from a financial
point of view to its shareholders than the Merger, (ii) is reasonably likely
to be consummated on the terms set forth, and (iii) for which financing, to
the extent required, is then committed or which, in the good faith judgment of
the Seller Board, is reasonably likely to be obtained by such third party.

(b) In addition to the obligations of Seller set forth in this
_Section 6.07_, Seller shall promptly (within 24 hours) advise Purchaser
Parent orally and in writing of its receipt of any Acquisition Proposal.

  



  

(c) Seller agrees that any violation of the restrictions set forth
in this _Section 6.07_ by any Representative of Seller or its Subsidiaries
shall be deemed a breach of this _Section 6.07_ by Seller.

  



  

(d)  Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent Seller or the
Seller Board from complying with Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange Act with
respect to an Acquisition Proposal.

  



  

6.08   _Certain Policies_. Effective as of the Effective Time, and
provided that each party has confirmed in writing that all conditions to its
obligations to effect the Merger have been satisfied or waived and that it is
prepared to effect the Merger, upon the request of Purchaser Parent, Seller
shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, consistent with GAAP and
applicable banking laws, regulations or policies imposed by any Governmental
Authority, use their commercially reasonable efforts to modify or change
their Loan, OREO, accrual, reserve, Tax, litigation and real estate valuation
policies and practices (including loan classifications and levels of
reserves) so as to be applied on a basis that is consistent with that of
Purchaser Parent; provided, however, no such modification or change made by
Seller or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to this _Section 6.08_ shall
constitute or be deemed to be a breach, violation of or failure to satisfy
any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement, condition or other
provision of this Agreement or otherwise be considered in determining whether
any such breach, violation or failure to satisfy shall have occurred. The
recording of any such adjustments shall not be deemed to imply any
misstatement of previously furnished financial statements or information and
shall not be construed as concurrence of Seller or its management with any
such adjustments.

6.09   _Nasdaq Listing_. Purchaser Parent shall, as promptly as
practicable, file all documents, take all actions reasonably necessary and
otherwise use its reasonable best efforts to cause the shares of Purchaser
Parent Common Stock to be issued to the Seller shareholders and holders of
Net Vested Seller Shares, Net Vested Seller RSU Shares, and Net Vested PRSU
Shares as the Merger Consideration in the Merger to be approved for quotation
on Nasdaq prior to the Effective Date.

  



  

6.10   _Indemnification_.

  



  

(a) From and after the Effective Time through the sixth anniversary
of the Effective Time, the Surviving Bank (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ")
shall indemnify and hold harmless each present and former director, officer
and employee of Seller or a Seller Subsidiary, as applicable, determined as
of the Effective Time (the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") against any and
all costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees), judgments,
fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, arising out of matters existing or occurring
at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or
after the Effective Time, arising in whole or in part out of or pertaining to
the fact that he or she was a director, officer, employee, fiduciary or agent
of Seller or any Seller Subsidiary or is or was serving at the request of
Seller or any Seller Subsidiary as a director, officer, employee, fiduciary
or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other
enterprise, including, without limitation, matters related to the
negotiation, execution and performance of this Agreement or consummation of
the Transaction, to the fullest extent which such Indemnified Parties would be
entitled under the Seller Articles and the Seller Bylaws or any agreement,
arrangement or understanding which has been set forth in _Section 6.10_ of
Seller's Disclosure Schedule, in each case as in effect on the date hereof.
The Surviving Bank shall advance expenses as incurred by such
Indemnified Parties to the same extent as such persons are entitled to
advancement of expenses as of the date of this Agreement by Seller
pursuant to the Seller Articles and the Seller Bylaws or any agreement,
arrangement or understanding which has been set forth in _Section 6.10_ of
Seller's Disclosure Schedule, in each case as in effect on the date hereof.

  



  

(b) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under
this _Section 6.10_, upon learning of any such claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, shall promptly notify the Indemnifying Party, but
the failure to so notify shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of any
liability it may have to such Indemnified Party except to the extent such
failure actually and materially prejudices the Indemnifying Party. In the
event of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether
arising before or after the Effective Time), (i) the Indemnifying Party shall
have the right to assume the defense thereof and the Indemnifying Party shall
not be liable to such Indemnified Parties for any legal expenses of other
counsel or any other expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified
Parties in connection with the defense thereof, except that if the
Indemnifying Party elects not to assume such defense or counsel for the
Indemnified Parties advises that there are issues which raise conflicts of
interest between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Parties that make
joint representation inappropriate, the Indemnified Parties may retain
counsel which is reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnifying Party, and the
Indemnifying Party shall pay, promptly as statements therefor are received,
the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified Parties
(which may not exceed one firm in any jurisdiction unless the Indemnified
Parties have conflicts of interest), (ii) the Indemnified Parties
will reasonably cooperate in the defense of any such matter, (iii) the
Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any settlement effected without
its prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed and (iv) the Indemnifying Party shall have no
obligation hereunder in the event that a federal or state banking agency or a
court of competent jurisdiction shall determine by final, non-appealable
written order that indemnification of an Indemnified Party in the manner
contemplated hereby is prohibited by applicable law, regulation or policies
imposed by any Governmental Authority.

---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(c)  Prior to the Effective Time, Seller shall, and if Seller is
unable to, Purchaser Parent (and the Surviving Bank) shall as of the
Effective Time obtain and fully pay for a "tail" liability insurance policy
(or provide a policy providing comparable coverage and amounts on terms no
less favorable to the persons currently covered by Seller's existing
policy, including Purchaser Parent's existing policy if it meets the
foregoing standard) covering persons who are currently covered by such
insurance for a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time from an
insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as Seller's current
insurance carrier with respect to directors' and officers' liability insurance
and fiduciary liability insurance with benefits and levels of coverage at
least as favorable as Seller's existing policies with respect to matters
existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including in
connection with this Agreement and the Transaction); provided, however, that
in no event shall Seller be permitted nor shall Purchaser Parent be obligated
to expend, in order to maintain or provide insurance coverage pursuant to
this _Section 6.10(c)_ , an amount in excess of 300% of the annual premiums
paid by Seller as of the date hereof for such insurance (" _Maximum Insurance
Amount_ "); provided further, that if the amount of the annual premiums
necessary to maintain or procure such insurance coverage exceeds the
Maximum Insurance Amount, Purchaser Parent shall obtain the most advantageous
coverage obtainable for an annual premium equal to the Maximum Insurance
Amount. Purchaser Parent shall provide proof of such coverage to Seller no
later than three (3) Business Days prior to the Effective Time.

  



  

(d)  The obligations of Purchaser Parent and the Surviving Bank under
this _Section 6.10_ shall not be terminated or modified by such parties in a
manner adverse to any Indemnified Party or any other Person entitled to the
benefits of this _Section 6.10_ , or to whom this _Section 6.10_ applies,
without the written consent of the affected Indemnified Party or
Parties and/or such other Person, as the case may be. If Purchaser Parent or
the Surviving Bank or any of their respective successors or assigns shall
consolidate with or merge into any other entity and shall not be the
continuing or surviving entity of such consolidation or merger or shall
transfer all or substantially all of its assets to any other entity, then and
in each case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of Purchaser Parent or the Surviving Bank shall assume the obligations
set forth in this _Section 6.10_.

  



  

(e) The provisions of this _Section 6.10_ are (i) intended to be for
the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and his or
her heirs and his or her Representatives, as set forth in _Section 9.07_
herein, and (ii) in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other
rights to indemnification or contribution that any such Person may have by
contract or otherwise.

6.11   _Benefit Plans_.

  



  

(a) As soon as administratively practicable after the Effective
Time, Purchaser Parent shall transition each employee of Seller and
its Subsidiaries at the Effective Time who continues to remain employed with
Seller or its Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Continuing Employees_ ")
from the Benefit Plans of Seller and its Subsidiaries to the corresponding
Purchaser Parent Benefit Plans (and any other Purchaser Parent Benefit Plans
in which similarly situated employees of Purchaser Parent and its Subsidiaries
participate) and take all reasonable action so that such Continuing Employee
of Seller and its Subsidiaries shall be entitled to participate in each
Purchaser Parent Benefit Plan to the same extent as similarly-situated
employees of Purchaser Parent and its Subsidiaries (it being understood that
inclusion of the Continuing Employees of Seller and its Subsidiaries in the
Purchaser Parent Benefit Plans may occur at different times with respect to
different plans), provided that coverage shall be continued under the
corresponding Benefit Plans of Seller and its Subsidiaries until such
Continuing Employees are permitted to participate in the Purchaser
Parent Benefit Plans and provided further, however, that nothing contained
herein shall require Purchaser Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to make any
grants to any former employee of Seller and its Subsidiaries under any
discretionary equity compensation plan of Purchaser Parent. Purchaser Parent
shall cause each Purchaser Parent Benefit Plan in which employees of Seller
and its Subsidiaries are eligible to participate to recognize, for purposes
of determining eligibility to participate in, the vesting of benefits and
for all other purposes (but not for accrual of pension benefits) under the
Purchaser Parent Benefit Plans, the service of such Continuing Employees with
Seller and its Subsidiaries to the same extent as such service was credited
for such purpose by Seller and its Subsidiaries, provided, however, that such
service shall not be recognized to the extent that such recognition would
result in a duplication of benefits. Nothing herein shall limit the ability
of Purchaser Parent to amend or terminate any of the Purchaser Parent Benefit
Plans or the Seller Benefit Plans in accordance with their terms at any time.

  



  

(b) At and following the Effective Time, Purchaser Parent shall
honor, and the Surviving Bank shall continue to be obligated to perform, in
accordance with their terms, all agreements and plans of Seller and its
Subsidiaries to the extent that each of the foregoing (including amounts
accrued or otherwise payable pursuant thereto) are expressly set forth in
_Section 6.11(b)_ of Seller's Disclosure Schedule.

  



  

(c) In the event Purchaser Parent transitions Continuing
Employees of Seller and its Subsidiaries from the group medical, dental,
health, life or long-term disability plan of Seller and its Subsidiaries to
the corresponding Purchaser Parent Benefit Plan at any time prior to the end
of the applicable plan year of the group medical, dental, health, life or
long-term disability plan of Seller and its Subsidiaries, at such time as
Continuing Employees become eligible to participate in such corresponding
Purchaser Parent Benefit Plan, Purchaser Parent shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause each such Purchaser Parent Benefit Plan to
(i) waive any preexisting condition limitations to the extent such conditions
are covered under the applicable Purchaser Parent Benefit Plan, (ii) provide
full credit under medical, health and dental plans for any deductibles, co-
payment and out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Continuing Employees and
their beneficiaries during the portion of the calendar year prior to such
participation and (iii) waive any waiting period limitation or evidence of
insurability requirement which would otherwise be applicable to such employee
on or after the Effective Time to the extent such employee had satisfied any
similar limitation or requirement under a corresponding Seller Benefit Plan
prior to the Effective Time, provided, however, that such waiver shall not be
required to the extent that such waiver would result in a duplication of
benefits.

(d) Seller and Purchaser Parent shall cooperate in good faith
to determine a mutually agreed communications plan with respect to
employment decisions regarding current Employees. Within forty-five (45)
calendar days from the date of this Agreement (or such later date as mutually
agreed among the Parties), Purchaser Parent shall identify the Continuing
Employees. On or before the Effective Date, Seller shall, or shall cause a
Subsidiary to, extinguish and pay in full any remaining obligations of Seller
or its Subsidiaries under an existing severance agreement to cover, reimburse
a former service provider for, other otherwise pay for premiums for continued
health coverage. Effective as of, and subject to, the Closing, Seller and its
Subsidiaries shall terminate the employment of those Employees who are not
Continuing Employees and Seller and its Subsidiaries, or Purchaser Parent and
its Subsidiaries, as applicable, shall pay when due any severance, retention,
change in control, accrued and unused paid time off, the Option
Merger Consideration payable pursuant to _Section 3.08(a)_ hereof, or other
similar payments, in each case, which have been Previously Disclosed by
Seller to Purchaser Parent, obtain an executed general release of claims that
has not been revoked (to the extent required as a condition to any such
payments), and pay to the proper taxing authorities any income and employment
Tax withholding as well as the employer portions of any applicable employment
Taxes. For the avoidance of doubt, the Option Merger Consideration will be
paid by Seller to all Employees (including Employees who are not Continuing
Employees) with respect to all outstanding vested Seller Options in
accordance with _Section 3.08_ of this Agreement. Purchaser Parent shall
remain responsible for payment (x) to any Continuing Employee of any
severance or similar compensation and benefits payable following a
termination of employment and (y) of the Merger Consideration to all holders
of Net Vested Seller Shares, Net Vested Seller RSU Shares and Net Vested
Seller PRSU Shares. Those employees of Seller and its Subsidiaries who do not
continue their employment with Purchaser Parent or its Subsidiaries following
the Effective Time who are not a party to an employment agreement or other
severance agreement and are not otherwise entitled to severance benefits
under Seller's existing severance plan as described on _Section 6.11(d) _ of
Seller's Disclosure Schedule, and who sign and deliver a release of claims (in
a form to be agreed by Purchaser Parent and Seller), shall be entitled to
receive a single lump sum payment of severance equal to (a) two weeks of base
salary (based on a 52-week year) for those employees who have completed less
than one year of service, and (b) two weeks of salary (based on a 52-week
year) for each completed year of service, up to a maximum of 26 weeks, for
those employees who have completed at least one year of service. For purposes
of the foregoing, any severance benefits payable in accordance with the
immediately preceding sentence pursuant to a timely delivered release of
claims shall be paid on the later to occur of (i) the Purchaser Parent
payroll date for the Purchaser Parent payroll period during which the former
employee delivers to the Surviving Bank his or her executed release, or (ii)
the Purchaser Parent payroll date for the Purchaser Parent payroll period
during which the former employee's release becomes effective following the
expiration of any revocation period afforded under applicable law, in each
case taking into consideration administrative cutoff dates for payroll
processing purposes. If Seller or any of its Subsidiaries has any
other severance pay plan or arrangement, then any amounts paid to an employee
pursuant to that plan or arrangement shall reduce the amount that such
employee will receive under this _Section 6.11(d)_ and in no event shall there
be any duplication of severance pay. Nothing contained in this _Section
6.11(d)_ hereof shall be construed or interpreted to limit or modify in any
way Purchaser Parent's or its Subsidiaries' at will employment policy or
provide any third party beneficiary rights to employees of Seller or any of
its Subsidiaries. In no event shall severance pay be taken into account in
determining the amount of any other benefit (including but not limited to, an
individual's benefit under any retirement plan or policy).

(e)  Prior to the Closing, Seller and its Subsidiaries shall
have timely paid into the Opus Bank 401(K) Plan (the " _Seller Retirement
Plan_ ") all employer contributions, including any employer matching
contributions, profit sharing contributions or other non-elective
contributions relating to any employee deferrals or with respect to any
service accrued prior to the Closing. Prior to the Closing, Seller shall
provide adequate notice to any service provider to the Seller Retirement Plan
of such termination to the extent required by applicable law and in
accordance with the applicable service provider agreement and shall pay any
associated termination fees to the extent then due and not otherwise
satisfied by the Seller Retirement Plan in accordance with applicable law.
Prior to the Closing, Seller shall (i) adopt written resolutions (or take such
other necessary or appropriate action), in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to Purchaser Parent, to terminate the Seller Retirement Plan in
compliance with its terms and requirements of applicable law, effective no
later than the Business Day preceding the Closing Date and (ii) provide for
full vesting of all non-elective contributions under the Seller Retirement
Plan for all participants who currently maintain an account under the Seller
Retirement Plan, such termination and vesting to be effective no later than
the Business Day preceding the Closing Date. Seller shall provide Purchaser
Parent with evidence of the termination of the Seller Retirement Plan and
Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with Purchaser
Parent in preparing a determination letter request to the IRS with respect to
the termination of the Seller Retirement Plan.

  



  

(f)  Each of Seller and Purchaser Parent acknowledges and
agrees that all provisions contained within this _Section 6.11_ with respect
to Employees are included for the sole benefit of Seller and nothing contained
in this _Section 6.11_  shall confer upon any other Person any rights or
remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this _Section
6.11_. Nothing contained herein (i) shall be construed to establish, amend or
modify any benefit plan, program or arrangement or (ii) alter or limit the
ability of Purchaser Parent to amend, modify or terminate any benefit plan,
program or arrangement at any time established, sponsored or maintained by
Purchaser Parent or any of its Subsidiaries. Each of Seller and Purchaser
Parent agrees that the terms of this _Section 6.11_ do not and shall not
create any right in any Person to continued employment with Seller, Purchaser
Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries or to any compensation or
benefit.

  



  

6.12 _Resignation and Appointment of Directors; Officers_. Purchaser
Parent and Purchaser Bank agree that effective no later than
immediately prior to the Effective Time, Purchaser Parent and Purchaser Bank
shall cause two existing directors of Purchaser Parent and Purchaser Bank to
resign and Purchaser Parent and Purchaser Bank agree to take all action
necessary to appoint or elect, effective as of the Effective Time, two new
directors, each of whom shall be selected from Seller's existing directors and
mutually agreeable to Seller, Purchaser Parent and Purchaser Bank, as
directors of Purchaser Parent and Purchaser Bank. Each individual shall
serve until the first annual meeting of shareholders of Purchaser Parent
following the Effective Time and until his or her successor is elected and
qualified. Purchaser Parent shall include such individuals on the list of
nominees for director presented by the Purchaser Parent Board and for which
the Purchaser Parent Board shall solicit proxies at the first annual meeting
of stockholders of Purchaser Parent following the Effective Time, provided,
that such nomination and solicitation would not violate the fiduciary duties
of the Purchaser Parent Board. The executive officers of the Surviving Bank
immediately after the Merger shall be the executive officers of Purchaser
Bank immediately prior to the Merger.

Parent shall give prompt written notice to the other of any fact, event or
circumstance known to it that (a) is reasonably likely, individually or taken
together with all other facts, events and circumstances known to it, to
result in any Material Adverse Effect with respect to it or (b) would cause
or constitute a failure of any of the conditions provided for in _Article
VII_.

  



  

6.14 _Estoppel Letters_. Seller shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to take the actions set forth on _Section 6.14_ of
Seller's Disclosure Schedule with respect to the real estate (i) owned or
leased by Seller or a Seller Subsidiary (ii) leased by Seller or a Seller
Subsidiary.

reasonably required to make such assumption effective.

  



  

6.16 _Antitakeover Statutes_. Each of Purchaser Parent and Seller and
their respective Boards of Directors shall, if any state antitakeover statute
or similar statute becomes applicable to this Agreement and the Transaction,
take all action reasonably necessary to ensure that the Transaction may be
consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and
otherwise to minimize the effect of such statute or regulation on this
Agreement and the Transaction.

  



  

6.17 _Consents_. Seller shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to,

advisable pursuant to the terms of the Material Contracts as a result of the
Transaction.

  



  

6.18 _Exemption from Liability Under Section 16(b)_. Prior to the
Effective Time, each of Purchaser Parent and Seller shall take all steps as
may be necessary or appropriate to exempt the conversion of shares of Seller

terms of this Agreement by employees of Seller who may become an officer or
director of Purchaser Parent subject to the reporting requirements of Section
16(a) of the Exchange Act.

8.02 _Effect of Termination and Abandonment._

  



  

(a)  In the event of termination of this Agreement and the
abandonment of the Merger pursuant to this _Article VIII_, no party to this
Agreement shall have any liability or further obligation to any other party
hereunder except that (i) this _Section 8.02_ , _Section 6.06(e)_ and
_Article IX_ shall survive any termination of this Agreement and (ii)
notwithstanding anything to the contrary, neither Purchaser Parent nor Seller
shall be relieved or released from any liabilities or damages to the other
party hereto resulting from any knowing and intentional breach of this
Agreement.

  



  



  

(b)  In the event that (i) an Acquisition Proposal has been made
(whether or not conditional) to Seller or its shareholders or any Person has
publicly announced an intention (whether or not conditional) to make an
Acquisition Proposal (and such Acquisition Proposal or publicly announced
intention shall not have been publicly withdrawn without qualification) and
thereafter (A) this Agreement is terminated by Purchaser Parent pursuant to
_Section 8.01(b)_ , by Purchaser Parent or Seller pursuant to
_Section 8.01(c)_ or by Purchaser Parent pursuant to _Section 8.01(g)_ and
(B) prior to the date that is 12 months after such termination, (1) Seller or
any of its Subsidiaries enters into a binding and definitive agreement with
respect to any Acquisition Proposal (an " _Acquisition Agreement_ ") or (2)
any Acquisition Proposal is consummated (solely for purposes of this
_Section 8.02(b)(i)(B)_ , the term " _Acquisition Proposal_ " shall have the
meaning set forth in the definition of Acquisition Proposal contained in
_Section 6.07(a)_ except that all references to 25% shall be deemed references
to 50%), then Seller shall pay to Purchaser Parent a fee equal to $38,658,859
(the " _Termination Fee_ ") by wire transfer of next day funds on the earlier
of the date of execution of such Acquisition Agreement and the consummation of
such Acquisition Proposal. In the event that (i) this Agreement is terminated
by Purchaser Parent pursuant to _Section 8.01(e)_ or (ii) this Agreement is
terminated by Seller pursuant to _Section 8.01(f)_ , then, in each such case,
Seller shall pay Purchaser Parent the Termination Fee by wire transfer of
same-day funds (x) in the case of a termination by Purchaser Parent pursuant
to _Section 8.01(e)_ , within two Business Days after such termination, and
(y) in the case of a termination by Seller pursuant to _Section 8.01(f)_ , no
later than the time of such termination. If the Termination Fee becomes
payable pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, payment of the Termination
Fee shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Purchaser Parent against Seller
and any of its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives with respect
to the breach of any covenant or agreement giving rise to such payment.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the maximum aggregate amount
of fees, liabilities or damages payable by Seller under this Agreement shall
be equal to the Termination Fee and any amounts payable under this _Section
8.02(b)_. In no event shall Seller be obligated to pay the Termination Fee on
more than one occasion.

  



  

(c)  Each party acknowledges that the agreements contained in
this _Section 8.02_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and that, without these agreements, the other party would not
have entered into this Agreement. Accordingly, if Seller fails promptly to
pay the amounts due pursuant to this _Section 8.02_ and, in order to
obtain such payment, Purchaser Parent commences a suit that results in a
judgement against Seller for the amounts set forth in this _Section
8.02_, Seller shall pay to Purchaser Parent its reasonable costs and expenses
(including attorneys' fees and expenses) in connection with such suit and any
appeal relating thereto, together with interest on the amounts set forth in
this _Section 8.02_ at the prime lending rate as published in the _Wall
Street Journal_ in effect on the date such payment was required to be made.

Article IX

  



  

MISCELLANEOUS

  



  

9.01 _Survival_. No representations, warranties, agreements and
covenants contained in this Agreement shall survive the Effective Time (other
than agreements or covenants contained herein that by their express terms are
to be performed after the Effective Time) or the termination of this
Agreement if this Agreement is terminated prior to the Effective Time (other
than _Sections 6.06(e)_ , _8.02_ and this _Article IX_, which shall survive
any such termination).

  



  

9.02 _Waiver; Amendment_. Prior to the Effective Time, any provision
of this Agreement may be (i) waived, by the party benefited by the provision
or (ii) amended or modified at any time, by an agreement in writing among the
parties hereto executed in the same manner as this Agreement; provided,
however, that after the approval of the principal terms of this Agreement by
the Seller shareholders, there may not be, without further approval of
Seller's shareholders, any amendment of this Agreement that requires further
approval under applicable law. For purposes of clarification, an amendment of
any date in _Section 8.01(c)_  shall not require further approval by any
shareholders and if such amendment were deemed by law to require further
approval by the shareholders of Seller, the approval of the principal terms
of this Agreement by the Seller shareholders will be deemed to have granted
Seller the authority to amend such dates without such further approval.

9.07   _Entire Understanding; Limited Third Party Beneficiaries_.
This Agreement, the Agreement of Merger, the Shareholder Agreements and the
Confidentiality Agreements represent the entire understanding of the parties
hereto and thereto with reference to the Transaction, and this Agreement, the
Agreement of Merger, the Shareholder Agreements and the Confidentiality
Agreements supersede any and all other oral or written agreements heretofore
made. Except for the Indemnified Parties' right to enforce Purchaser Parent's
obligation under _Section 6.10_ , which are expressly intended to be for the
irrevocable benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party
and his or her heirs and Representatives, nothing in this Agreement,
expressed or implied, is intended to confer upon any Person, other than the
parties hereto or their respective successors, any rights,
remedies, obligations or liabilities under or by reason of this Agreement.

  



  

9.08   _Severability_. Except to the extent that application of this
_Section 9.08_ would have a Material Adverse Effect on Seller or Purchaser
Parent, any term or provision of this Agreement which is invalid or
unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction, be
ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability without
rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this
Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of any of the terms or
provisions of this Agreement in any other jurisdiction. If any provision of
this Agreement is so broad as to be unenforceable, the provision shall be
interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable. In all such cases, the
parties shall use their reasonable best efforts to substitute a valid, legal
and enforceable provision which, insofar as practicable, implements the
original purposes and intents of this Agreement.

  



  

9.09   _Enforcement of the Agreement_. The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of
this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or
were otherwise breached. Except as provided in _Section 8.02_, it is
accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction
or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof in the Court of Chancery of the
State of Delaware and the federal courts of the United States of America
located in the State of Delaware, this being in addition to any other remedy
to which they are entitled at law or in equity. In the event attorneys' fees
or other costs are incurred to secure performance of any of the obligations
herein provided for, or to establish damages for the breach thereof, or to
obtain any other appropriate relief, whether by way of prosecution or defense,
the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover reasonable attorneys' fees
and costs incurred therein.

9.10   _Interpretation_. When a reference is made in this Agreement
to Sections, Exhibits or Schedules, such reference shall be to a Section of,
or Exhibit or Schedule to, this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The
table of contents and headings contained in this Agreement are for reference
purposes only and are not part of this Agreement. Whenever the words
"include,"  "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall
be deemed to be followed by the words  "without limitation." Whenever the
words "as of the date hereof" are used in this Agreement, they shall be
deemed to mean the day and year first above written.

  



  

9.11   _Assignment_. No party may assign either this Agreement or any
of its rights, interests or obligations hereunder without the prior written
approval of the other party. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement
shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto
and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

  



  

9.12   _Alternative Structure_. Subject to the proviso in the first
sentence of _Section 9.02_, Purchaser Parent may at any time modify the
structure of the acquisition of Seller set forth herein, provided that (a) the
Merger Consideration to be paid to the holders of Seller Capital Stock is not
thereby changed in kind or reduced in amount as a result of such
modification, (b) such modifications will not adversely affect the tax
treatment to Seller's shareholders, including holders of Net Vested Seller
Shares, Net Vested Seller RSU Shares and Net Vested Seller PRSU Shares, as a
result of receiving the Merger Consideration and (c) such modification will
not and, are not reasonably expected to, jeopardize, impede or delay any (1)
receipt of any required approvals of Governmental Authorities, (2) approval
by the requisite vote of the holders of outstanding shares of Seller
Common Stock and outstanding shares of Seller Preferred Stock, voting as
separate classes, of the Merger, and of the holders of outstanding shares of
Purchaser Parent Common Stock of the issuance of the shares of Purchaser
Parent Common Stock in the Merger or (3) consummation of the Transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

9.13   _Confidential Supervisory Information_. Notwithstanding any
other provision of this Agreement, no disclosure, representation or warranty
shall be made (or other action taken) pursuant to this Agreement that would
involve the disclosure of confidential supervisory information (including
confidential supervisory information as defined in 12 C.F.R. § 261.2(c)
and as identified in 12 C.F.R. § 309.5(g)(8)) of a Governmental Authority by
any party to this Agreement to the extent prohibited by applicable law. For
purposes of clarity, a representation relating to receipt of regulatory
approvals on a timely basis shall not be given, or continue to be given, to
the extent the reason for it no longer continuing to be accurate involves such
confidential supervisory information. To the extent legally permissible,
appropriate substitute disclosures or actions shall be made or taken under
circumstances in which the limitations of the preceding sentences apply.

Annex A

  



  

FORM OF SHAREHOLDER AGREEMENT

  



  

SHAREHOLDER AGREEMENT (this " _Agreement_ "), dated as of January 31, 2020,
between the Person(s) executing this Agreement as a "Shareholder" or
"Shareholders" on the signature pages hereto (collectively, the "
_Shareholders_ "), Pacific Premier Bancorp, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("
_Purchaser Parent_ "), Pacific Premier Bank, a California-chartered
commercial bank and wholly-owned bank subsidiary of Purchaser Parent ("
_Purchaser Bank_ "), and, solely for purposes of the last sentence of
_Section 9_, Opus Bank, a California-chartered commercial bank (" _Seller_
"). All terms used herein and not defined herein shall have the meanings
assigned thereto in the Merger Agreement (defined below).

  



  

WHEREAS, Seller, Purchaser Parent and Purchaser Bank are simultaneously
herewith entering into an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization, dated as of
the date hereof (the " _Merger Agreement_ "), pursuant to which Seller will
merge with and into Purchaser Bank on the terms and conditions set forth
therein (the " _Merger_ ") and, in connection therewith, outstanding
shares of Seller Capital Stock will be converted into shares of Purchaser
Parent Common Stock and cash in lieu of fractional shares in the manner set
forth therein;

  



  

WHEREAS, each Shareholder owns the shares of Seller Capital Stock identified
on _Exhibit I_ hereto (such shares, together with all shares of Seller
Capital Stock subsequently acquired by Shareholder during the term of this
Agreement (as contemplated in _Section 8_ ), being referred to as the "
_Shares_ "); and

  



  

WHEREAS, in order to induce Purchaser Parent and Purchaser Bank to enter into
the Merger Agreement, each Shareholder, solely in such Shareholder's capacity
as a shareholder of Seller and not in any other capacity, has agreed to enter
into and perform its obligations arising under this Agreement.

  



  

NOW, THEREFORE, for good and valuable consideration, the receipt, sufficiency
and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as
follows:

  



  

1.   _Agreement to Vote Shares_. Each Shareholder agrees during the term of this Agreement (as contemplated in _Section 8_ ) that at any meeting of the shareholders of Seller, or in connection with any written consent of the shareholders of Seller, to the extent that the matters set forth in Section 1(b)(x)-(z) are presented at a meeting of Seller's shareholders and such Shareholder is entitled to vote on such matters, each such Shareholder shall:

  



  

(a)  appear at each such meeting or otherwise cause the Shares
to be counted as present thereat for purposes of calculating a quorum; and

  



  

   

 | A-1| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b)  vote (or cause to be voted), in person or by proxy, or
deliver a written consent (or cause a consent to be delivered) covering, all
the Shares (whether acquired heretofore or hereafter) that are beneficially
owned by such Shareholder or as to which such Shareholder has, directly or
indirectly, the right to vote or direct the voting, (x) in favor of approval
of the Merger, the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated
thereby; (y) against any action or agreement that, to the knowledge of
such Shareholder, would result in a breach of any covenant, representation or
warranty or any other material obligation or agreement of Seller contained in
the Merger Agreement or of the Shareholder contained in this Agreement; and
(z) against any Acquisition Proposal or any other action, agreement or
transaction that is intended, or, to the knowledge of the Shareholder, would
reasonably be expected, to materially and adversely impede, interfere or be
inconsistent with, or materially and adversely delay, postpone, discourage or
affect the consummation of the Merger or the performance by Seller of its
obligations under the Merger Agreement;  _provided_ , that if there is any
amendment, waiver or modification to the Merger Agreement that is effected
after the date hereof that (x) reduces or has the effect of reducing the
Exchange Ratio, (y) changes the form of all or any portion of the
Merger Consideration and/or (z) imposes any material condition to the receipt
of Merger Consideration (any such amendment, waiver or modification, a "
_Material Merger Agreement Change_ "), this _Section 1_ shall be inapplicable.

  



  

2. _Transfer of Shares_.

  



  

(a)   _Prohibition on Transfers of Shares; Other Actions_. Each
Shareholder hereby agrees that, during the term of this Agreement (as
contemplated in _Section 8_ ), such Shareholder shall not, (i) sell, transfer,
pledge, encumber, distribute by gift or donation, or otherwise dispose of any
of the Shares (or any securities convertible into or exercisable or
exchangeable for Shares) or any interest therein, whether by actual
disposition, physical settlement or effective economic disposition
through hedging transactions, derivative instruments or other means, (ii)
enter into any agreement, arrangement or understanding with any Person, or
take any other action, that violates or conflicts with or would reasonably be
expected to violate or conflict with such Shareholder's representations,
warranties, covenants and obligations under this Agreement, or (iii) except as
otherwise permitted by this Agreement or by order of a court of competent
jurisdiction, take any other action that would reasonably be expected
to adversely impair or otherwise affect, in any material respect, such
Shareholder's power, authority and ability to comply with and perform his,
her or its covenants and obligations under this Agreement.

  



  

(b)   _Transfer of Voting Rights_. Each Shareholder hereby
agrees that such Shareholder shall not deposit any Shares in a voting trust,
grant any proxy or enter into any voting agreement or similar agreement or
arrangement with respect to any of the Shares.

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding the terms of _Section 2(a)_ and _2(b)_ , no
Shareholder shall be prohibited from engaging in any hedging,
derivative, securities lending or similar agreements, arrangements and
understandings with respect to the Shares, including those pursuant to any
sale of any option or contract to purchase, purchase of any option or contract
to sell, grant of any option, right or warrant to purchase, or entry into any
swap or other agreement that transfers, in whole or in part, any of the
economic consequences of ownership of the Shares, whether any such
transaction is settled by delivery of Shares, in cash or otherwise, so long as
such agreements, arrangements and understandings do not limit such
Shareholder's ability to comply with its obligations under _Section 1_.

  



  

   

 | A-2| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

3. _Representations and Warranties of Shareholders_. Each Shareholder represents and warrants to and agrees with Purchaser Parent as follows:

  



  

(a)   _Capacity_. Such Shareholder has all requisite capacity
and authority to enter into and perform his, her or its obligations under
this Agreement.

  



  

(b)   _Binding Agreement_. This Agreement has been duly executed
and delivered by such Shareholder and, assuming this Agreement constitutes a
valid and legally binding obligation of the other parties hereto (other than
the other Shareholders), constitutes the valid and legally binding obligation
of such Shareholder, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer,
reorganization, moratorium and similar laws of general applicability relating
to or affecting creditors' rights and to general equity principles.

  



  

(c)   _Non-Contravention_. The execution and delivery of this
Agreement by such Shareholder does not, and the performance by such
Shareholder of his, her or its obligations hereunder and the consummation by
such Shareholder of the transactions contemplated hereby will not, violate or
conflict with, or constitute a default under, any agreement, instrument,
contract or other obligation or any order, arbitration award, judgment or
decree to which such Shareholder is a party or by which such Shareholder is
bound, or any statute, rule or regulation to which such Shareholder is
subject or, in the event that such Shareholder is a corporation, partnership,
trust or other entity, any charter, bylaw or other organizational document of
such Shareholder, in each case, except for any of the foregoing as would not
reasonably be expected, either individually or in the aggregate, to materially
impair the ability of such Shareholder to perform his, her or its obligations
under this Agreement or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby on
a timely basis.

  



  

(d)   _Ownership_. Such Shareholder's Shares are, and, except as
otherwise provided for in _Section 2_  hereof, during the term of this
Agreement (as contemplated in _Section 8_ ) will be, owned beneficially and of
record solely by such Shareholder, except as (x) otherwise disclosed on
_Exhibit I_ hereto or (y) to the extent such Shares are transferred after the
date hereof to any other shareholder of Seller who has executed a copy of this
Agreement on the date hereof or a separate agreement with Purchaser Parent,
Purchaser Bank and Seller with terms substantially similar to those contained
herein. Shareholder has title to the Shares, free and clear of any lien,
pledge, mortgage, security interest or other encumbrance, except as
otherwise disclosed on _Exhibit I_ hereto or arising under applicable
securities Laws. As of the date hereof, the Shares identified on _Exhibit I_
hereto constitute all of the shares of Seller Capital Stock owned beneficially
or of record by Shareholder. Shareholder has and, except as otherwise
provided for in _Section 2_ and _Section 9_ , will have at all times during
the term of this Agreement (as contemplated in _Section 8_ ) (i) sole voting
power and sole power to issue instructions with respect to the matters set
forth in _Section 1_ hereof, (ii) sole power of disposition and (iii) sole
power to agree to all of the matters set forth in this Agreement, in each
case, with respect to all of the Shares owned by such Shareholder on the
date of this Agreement and all of the Shares hereafter acquired by such
Shareholder and owned beneficially or of record by him, her or it during the
term of this Agreement (as contemplated in _Section 8_ ). For purposes of this
Agreement, the term "beneficial ownership" shall be interpreted in accordance
with Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act, _provided_ that a Person shall be
deemed to beneficially own any securities which may be acquired by such Person
pursuant to any binding agreement, arrangement or understanding or upon the
exercise of conversion rights, exchange rights, warrants or options, or
otherwise (irrespective of whether the right to acquire such securities is
exercisable immediately or only after the passage of time, including the
passage of time within 60 calendar days, the satisfaction of any conditions,
the occurrence of any event or any combination of the foregoing).

  



  

   

 | A-3| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(e)   _Consents and Approvals_. The execution and delivery of
this Agreement by such Shareholder does not, and the performance by such
Shareholder of his, her or its obligations under this Agreement and the
consummation by him, her or it of the transactions contemplated hereby will
not, require such Shareholder to obtain any consent, approval, authorization
or permit of, or to make any filing with or notification to, any Governmental
Authority.

  



  

(f)   _Absence of Litigation_. As of the date hereof, there is
no suit, action, investigation (in the case of investigations, to the
knowledge of such Shareholder) or proceeding pending or, to the knowledge of
such Shareholder, threatened against such Shareholder or any of his, her or
its affiliates before or by any Governmental Authority that would reasonably
be expected to materially impair the ability of such Shareholder to perform
his, her or its obligations hereunder or to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby on a timely basis.

  



  

4. _Representations and Warranties of Purchaser Parent and Purchaser Bank_. Purchaser Parent represents and warrants to and agrees with the Shareholders as follows:

  



  

(a)   _Capacity_. Each of Purchaser Parent and Purchaser Bank
has all requisite capacity and authority to enter into and perform his, her
or its obligations under this Agreement.

  



  

(b)   _Binding Agreement_. This Agreement has been duly executed
and delivered by Purchaser Parent and Purchaser Bank and, assuming this
Agreement constitutes a valid and legally binding obligation of the other
parties hereto (other than Purchaser Parent and Purchaser Bank), constitutes
the valid and legally binding obligation of Purchaser Parent and Purchaser
Bank, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization,
moratorium and similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting
creditors' rights and to general equity principles.

  



  

(c)   _Non-Contravention_. The execution and delivery of this
Agreement by Purchaser Parent and Purchaser Bank does not, and the
performance by each of Purchaser Parent and Purchaser Bank of his, her or its
obligations hereunder and the consummation by each of Purchaser Parent and
Purchaser Bank of the transactions contemplated hereby will not, violate or
conflict with, or constitute a default under, any agreement, instrument,
contract or other obligation or any order, arbitration award, judgment or
decree to which Purchaser Parent or Purchaser Bank is a party or by which
Purchaser Parent or Purchaser Bank is bound, or any statute, rule or
regulation to which Purchaser Parent or Purchaser Bank is subject or any
charter, bylaw or other organizational document of Purchaser Parent or
Purchaser Bank, in each case, except for any of the foregoing as would not
reasonably be expected, either individually or in the aggregate, to
materially impair the ability of Purchaser Parent or Purchaser Bank to perform
his, her or its obligations under this Agreement or to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby on a timely basis.

  



  



   

 | A-4| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

5. _No Solicitation_. Each Shareholder hereby agrees that during the term of this Agreement (as contemplated in  _Section 8_ ) he, she or it shall not, and shall not knowingly instruct any investment banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other representative retained by him, her or it to (on its behalf), (a) meet or otherwise communicate with any Person that makes or is considering making an Acquisition Proposal after becoming aware that the Person has made or is considering making an Acquisition Proposal, or (b) participate in, directly or indirectly, a "solicitation" of "proxies" (as such terms are used in the rules of the SEC) or powers of attorney or similar rights to vote, or knowingly and intentionally seek to influence any Person to vote, any shares of Seller Capital Stock (x) against the adoption or approval of the Merger Agreement and the Merger or (y) in favor of any Acquisition Proposal or proposal that would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, unless in the case of clause (b) above, the Shareholder is a director of Seller's Board of Directors or an officer of Seller and Seller's Board of Directors has effected a Change in Recommendation (as defined in the Merger Agreement), in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, and in such case, such Shareholder's activities are solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of Seller. Each Shareholder agrees immediately to cease and cause to be terminated any activities, discussions or negotiations conducted before the date of this Agreement with any Persons (other than Seller, Purchaser Parent, Purchaser Bank and any of their respective representatives) with respect to any Acquisition Proposal and will take all reasonably necessary steps to inform any investment banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other representative retained by him, her or it of the obligations undertaken by Shareholder pursuant to this _Section 5_. Nothing contained in this _Section 5_ shall prevent any officer of Seller or a member of the Seller Board from discharging his or her fiduciary duties solely in his or her capacity as an officer of Seller or a member of the Seller Board.

  



  



  

6. _Notice of Acquisitions; Proposals Regarding Prohibited Transactions_. Each Shareholder hereby agrees to notify Purchaser Parent promptly (and in any event within two (2) Business Days) in writing of the number of any additional shares of Seller Capital Stock or other securities of Seller of which Shareholder acquires beneficial or record ownership on or after the date hereof. Each Shareholder shall promptly advise Seller of each contact such Shareholder may receive from any Person relating to any Acquisition Proposal or proposal that would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal.

  



  



  

7. _Specific Performance and Remedies_. Each party hereto acknowledges that (a) it will be impossible to measure in money the damage to the other parties hereto if such first party fails to comply with its obligations imposed by this Agreement and (b) in the event of any such failure, the other parties hereto will not have an adequate remedy at law. Accordingly, each party hereto agrees that injunctive relief or other equitable remedy, in addition to remedies at law or in damages, is the appropriate remedy for any such failure and will not oppose the granting of such relief on the basis that the other parties hereto may have an adequate remedy at law. Each party hereto agrees that it will not seek, and agrees to waive any requirement for, the securing or posting of a bond in connection with the other parties hereto seeking or obtaining such equitable relief.

  



  

   

 | A-5| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



   



  

8.   _Term of Agreement; Termination_.

Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby at the Seller Meeting.
Upon such termination, no party shall have any further obligations or
liabilities hereunder; _provided_ ,  _however_ , such termination shall not
relieve any party from liability for any willful and intentional breach of
this Agreement prior to such termination.

  



  

9.   _Stop Transfer Order_.

Seller agrees that it shall comply with such stop transfer instructions.

This Agreement may not be amended, supplemented or modified, and no provisions hereof may be modified or waived, except by an instrument in writing signed by each party hereto.
