</FONT></FONT>Each Benefit Plan has been established and administered to date in all material respects in accordance with the applicable
provisions of ERISA, the Code and applicable law and with the terms and provisions of all documents, contracts or agreements pursuant
to which such Benefit Plan is maintained. Each Benefit Plan that is intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code, has received
a current determination letter (or is the subject of a current opinion letter in the case of any prototype plan) from the IRS on
which Seller can rely that it is so qualified, and nothing has occurred with respect to the operation of any such plan which would
cause the loss of such qualification or exemption or the imposition of any material liability. There is no pending or, to Seller&rsquo;s
Knowledge, threatened proceeding, lawsuit or claim (other than a routine claim for benefits) as of the date hereof and with respect
to which the amount in controversy exceeds $100,000 relating to the Benefit Plans. Neither Seller nor its Subsidiaries have received
any correspondence from a Governmental Authority or any participant or beneficiary of a Benefit Plan that brings into questions
the qualification of any such plan. Neither Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries is subject to or could reasonably be likely to be
subject to a material liability, fine or penalty of any kind with respect to any Benefit Plan under either the Code or ERISA. No
assets of Seller or any Subsidiary are subject to an encumbrance or lien that may be imposed under ERISA or the Code with respect
to the operation, administration or funding of any Benefit Plan. Since January 1, 2017, no Benefit Plan or related trust has been
the subject of an audit, investigation or examination or other proceeding by the IRS, the DOL or other Governmental Authority.
There have been no nonexempt &ldquo;prohibited transactions&rdquo; within the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code or Section 406
of ERISA and no breach of fiduciary duty has occurred with respect to any Benefit Plan in connection with which Seller or any Subsidiary
reasonably could be subject to either a civil penalty assessed pursuant to Section 409 or 502(i) of ERISA or a tax imposed pursuant
to Section 4975, 4976, 4980D, 4980H or 49801 of the Code or under any applicable provision of the Health Care and Education Reconciliation
Act of 2010 (the &ldquo;<U>ACA</U>&rdquo;). With respect to each Benefit Plan, as applicable, all reports and disclosures required
to be filed or delivered under ERISA and the Code have been accurate in all material respects as of the date filed, have been filed
or distributed in a timely manner, and any Taxes due in connection with such filings have been paid. Seller and any ERISA Affiliate
that sponsors, maintains or contributes to a group health plan (within the meaning of Section 5000(b) of the Code) has complied
with the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, the ACA and the requirements of Section 4980B of the Code and the regulations
promulgated under each such law, including applicable reporting, tax deposits and fee payment obligations.</P>

</FONT></FONT>Except as set forth in <U>Section 5.03(m)(iv)</U> of Seller&rsquo;s Disclosure Schedule, all contributions required
to be made under the terms of any Benefit Plan (including any amounts withheld from employees&rsquo; paychecks with respect to
a Benefit Plan) and premiums required to be paid have been timely made or paid when due in accordance with the terms of the applicable
Benefit Plan and applicable law. All contributions for any period ending on or before the Closing Date that are not yet due have
been made or have been reflected appropriately in the Seller&rsquo;s financial statements included in Seller&rsquo;s Securities
Documents. Benefits under each Benefit Plan that is an &ldquo;employee welfare benefit plan&rdquo; (within the meaning of Section
3(1) of ERISA), with the exception of any flexible spending arrangements subject to Sections 125 and 105 of the Code and health
savings accounts, are provided exclusively through insurance contracts or policies issued by an insurance company, health maintenance
organization, or similar organization unrelated to Seller or any of its Subsidiaries, the premiums for which are paid directly
by Seller or any of its Subsidiaries, from its general assets or partly from its general assets and partly from contributions by
its employees. No insurance policy or contract relating to a Benefit Plan requires or permits a retroactive increase to premiums
or payments due thereunder. No event has occurred or condition exists that would reasonably be likely to result in a material increase
in the level of amounts paid or accrued or benefits or premiums paid by the Seller under the Seller&rsquo;s health and welfare
benefit plans for 2020 as compared to 2019.</P>

to any other Person in connection with any Superior Proposal which has not previously been provided to Purchaser Parent. For purposes
of this Agreement, the term &ldquo;<U>Acquisition Proposal</U>&rdquo; means any inquiry, proposal or offer, filing of any regulatory
application or notice or disclosure of an intention to do any of the foregoing from any Person relating to any (w)&nbsp;direct
or indirect acquisition or purchase of a business that constitutes 25% or more of the total revenues, net income, assets or deposits
of Seller and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole, (x)&nbsp;direct or indirect acquisition or purchase of any class of Equity Securities
representing 25% or more of the voting power of Seller, (y)&nbsp;tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would result
in any person beneficially owning 25% or more of any class of Equity Securities of Seller or (z)&nbsp;merger, consolidation, business
combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving Seller, other than the Transaction contemplated
by this Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, the term &ldquo;<U>Superior Proposal</U>&rdquo; means any bona fide written
proposal made by a third party to acquire, directly or indirectly, including pursuant to a tender offer, exchange offer, merger,
consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction, for consideration consisting
of cash and/or securities, more than 50% of the combined voting power of the shares of Seller Common Stock then outstanding or
all or substantially all of Seller&rsquo;s consolidated assets, which the Seller Board determines in good faith, after taking into
account all legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of the proposal and the person making the proposal (including any break-up
fees, expense reimbursement provisions and conditions to consummation), and after consulting with Seller&rsquo;s financial advisor
(which shall be a recognized investment banking firm) and outside counsel, (i)&nbsp;is more favorable from a financial point of
view to its shareholders than the Merger, (ii) is reasonably likely to be consummated on the terms set forth, and (iii)&nbsp;for
which financing, to the extent required, is then committed or which, in the good faith judgment of the Seller Board, is reasonably
likely to be obtained by such third party.</P>

Consideration will be paid by Seller to all Employees (including Employees who are not Continuing Employees) with respect to all
outstanding vested Seller Options in accordance with <U>Section 3.08</U> of this Agreement. Purchaser Parent shall remain responsible
for payment (x) to any Continuing Employee of any severance or similar compensation and benefits payable following a termination
of employment and (y) of the Merger Consideration to all holders of Net Vested Seller Shares, Net Vested Seller RSU Shares and
Net Vested Seller PRSU Shares. Those employees of Seller and its Subsidiaries who do not continue their employment with Purchaser
Parent or its Subsidiaries following the Effective Time who are not a party to an employment agreement or other severance agreement
and are not otherwise entitled to severance benefits under Seller&rsquo;s existing severance plan as described on <U>Section 6.11(d)
</U>of Seller&rsquo;s Disclosure Schedule, and who sign and deliver a release of claims (in a form to be agreed by Purchaser Parent
and Seller), shall be entitled to receive a single lump sum payment of severance equal to (a) two weeks of base salary (based
on a 52-week year) for those employees who have completed less than one year of service, and (b) two weeks of salary (based on
a 52-week year) for each completed year of service, up to a maximum of 26 weeks, for those employees who have completed at least
one year of service. For purposes of the foregoing, any severance benefits payable in accordance with the immediately preceding
sentence pursuant to a timely delivered release of claims shall be paid on the later to occur of (i) the Purchaser Parent payroll
date for the Purchaser Parent payroll period during which the former employee delivers to the Surviving Bank his or her executed
release, or (ii) the Purchaser Parent payroll date for the Purchaser Parent payroll period during which the former employee&rsquo;s
release becomes effective following the expiration of any revocation period afforded under applicable law, in each case taking
into consideration administrative cutoff dates for payroll processing purposes. If Seller or any of its Subsidiaries has any other
severance pay plan or arrangement, then any amounts paid to an employee pursuant to that plan or arrangement shall reduce the
amount that such employee will receive under this <U>Section 6.11(d)</U> and in no event shall there be any duplication of severance
pay. Nothing contained in this <U>Section 6.11(d)</U> hereof shall be construed or interpreted to limit or modify in any way Purchaser
Parent&rsquo;s or its Subsidiaries&rsquo; at will employment policy or provide any third party beneficiary rights to employees
of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries. In no event shall severance pay be taken into account in determining the amount of any other
benefit (including but not limited to, an individual&rsquo;s benefit under any retirement plan or policy).</P>
