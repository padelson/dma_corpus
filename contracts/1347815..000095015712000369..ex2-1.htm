Effect on the Share Capital of the Constituent Entities;

  

Payment of Consideration

  


 

  

Section 2.01 Effect of First-Step Merger on the Share Capital of the Company
and Flagstone Bermuda. At the First-Step Effective Time, by virtue of the
occurrence of the First-Step Merger, and without any action on the part of the
Company, Flagstone Bermuda or any holder of any shares, par value $0.01 per
share, of the Company ("Company Shares") or any shares, par value $0.01 per
share, of Flagstone Bermuda ("Flagstone Bermuda Shares"):

  


 

  

(a) Share Capital of Flagstone Bermuda. Each issued and outstanding Flagstone
Bermuda Share that is owned by the Company immediately prior to the First-Step
Effective Time shall be canceled and shall cease to exist and no consideration
shall be delivered or deliverable in exchange therefor.

  


 

  

(b) Cancelation of Treasury Shares. All Company Shares that are owned by the
Company as treasury shares immediately prior to the First-Step Effective Time

(c) Conversion of Company Shares. Subject to Section 2.01(b), each Company
Share that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the First-Step
Effective Time shall be converted automatically into and become one duly
authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable common share, par
value $0.01 per share, of the Intermediate Company ("Intermediate Company
Shares"). As of the First-Step Effective Time, all such Company Shares shall
no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease
to exist. Each certificate previously evidencing any Company Shares (each, a
"Certificate") or uncertificated Company Shares represented by book-entry
(each, a "Book-Entry Share") immediately prior to the First-Step Effective
Time shall thereafter represent, without the requirement of any exchange
thereof, that number of Intermediate Company Shares into which such Company
Shares represented by such Certificate or book-entry, as applicable, have been
converted pursuant to this Section 2.01(c) and the right to receive dividends
and other distributions in accordance with Section 2.01(d), in each case
without interest.

  


 

  

(d) Transfer Books; Dividends. The Intermediate Company Shares resulting from
the conversion of Company Shares pursuant to Section 2.01(c) shall be deemed
to have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such
Company Shares previously outstanding, subject, however, to the Intermediate
Company's obligation to pay any dividends or make any other distributions with
a record date prior to the First-Step Effective Time that may have been
declared by the Company on Company Shares not in violation of the terms of
this Agreement or prior to the date of this Agreement and which remain unpaid
at the First-Step Effective Time. At the First-Step Effective Time, the share
transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no
further registration of transfers on the share transfer books of the
Intermediate Company of the Company Shares that were outstanding immediately
prior to the First-Step Effective Time.

Section 2.02 Effect of Second-Step Merger on the Share Capital of Merger Sub
and the Intermediate Company. At the Final Effective Time, by virtue of the
occurrence of the Second-Step Merger, and without any action on the part of
the Intermediate Company, Parent, Merger Sub or any holder of any Intermediate
Company Shares or any shares, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub
("Merger Sub Shares"):

  


 

  

(a) Share Capital of Merger Sub. Each issued and outstanding Merger Sub Share
shall be converted into and become one duly authorized, validly issued, fully
paid and nonassessable common share, par value $0.01 per share, of the
Surviving Company (the "Surviving Company Shares").

  


 

  

(b) Cancelation of Treasury Shares and Parent-Owned Shares; Treatment of
Shares Held by Intermediate Company Subsidiaries. All Intermediate Company
Shares that are owned by the Intermediate Company as treasury shares and any
Intermediate Company Shares owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any other direct or
indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent immediately prior to the Final
Effective Time shall be canceled and shall cease to exist and no consideration
shall be delivered or deliverable in exchange therefor. Each Intermediate
Company Share owned by any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the
Intermediate Company shall be converted automatically into and shall
thereafter represent the right to receive the Merger Consideration.

  


 

  

(c) Conversion of Intermediate Company Shares. Subject to Section 2.02(b) and
Section 2.03(d), each Intermediate Company Share that is issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Final Effective Time shall be converted

0.1935 (the "Exchange Ratio") duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and
non-assessable voting common shares, par value $0.175 per share, of Parent
(such shares, "Parent Shares", and such share consideration, the "Merger Share
Consideration") and (ii) an amount in cash equal to $2.00, without interest
(such cash consideration, the "Merger Cash Consideration" and, together with
the Merger Share Consideration and any cash paid in lieu of fractional Parent
Shares in accordance with Section 2.03(d), the "Merger Consideration"). As of
the Final Effective Time, all such Intermediate Company Shares shall no longer
be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist,
and each holder of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall cease to have any
rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger
Consideration pertaining to the Intermediate Company Shares represented
thereby to be paid in consideration therefor, in accordance with Section
2.03(b), and the right to receive dividends and other distributions in
accordance with this Article II, in each case without interest.

  


 

  

Section 2.03 Exchange Fund.

  


 

  

(a) Exchange Agent. Prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall designate a bank
or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as agent (the
"Exchange Agent") for the payment and delivery of the aggregate Merger
Consideration in accordance with this Article II and, in connection therewith,
shall prior to the Closing Date enter into an agreement with the Exchange
Agent in a form reasonably acceptable to the Company. At or prior to the Final
Effective Time, Parent shall deposit or cause to be deposited with the
Exchange Agent (i) a number of certificates or shares in book-entry form
sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Share Consideration and (ii) an amount
in cash sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Cash Consideration and, to the
extent then determinable, cash payable in lieu of fractional shares pursuant
to Section 2.03(d) (such shares, cash and cash referred to in the immediately
following sentence being hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Fund"). From
time to time as necessary and determinable, Parent shall promptly deposit or
cause to be deposited with the Exchange Agent additional cash sufficient to
pay the cash payable in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.03(d)
and any dividends and other distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.03(e).
Pending its disbursement in accordance with this Section 2.03, any cash in the
Exchange Fund shall be invested by the Exchange Agent as directed by Parent in
(i) short-term direct obligations of the United States of America, (ii) short-
term obligations for which the full faith and credit of the United States of
America is pledged to provide for the payment of principal and interest, (iii)
short-term commercial paper rated the highest quality by either Moody's
Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poor's Ratings Services or (iv)
certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or banker's acceptances of
commercial banks with capital exceeding $5 billion. Any interest or other
income resulting from such investments shall be paid over promptly to Parent
and any amounts in excess of the amounts payable under Section 2.02(c) shall
be promptly returned to Parent. Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving
Company to promptly replace or restore the cash in the Exchange Fund so as to
ensure that the cash in the Exchange Fund is at all times maintained at a
level sufficient for the Exchange Agent to make all payments of Merger Cash
Consideration, cash payable in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section
2.03(d) and any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to Section
2.03(e) in accordance herewith. No investment losses resulting from investment
of the funds deposited with the Exchange Agent shall diminish the rights of
any former holder of Intermediate Company Shares to receive the Merger Cash
Consideration, cash payable in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section
2.03(d) and any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to Section
2.03(e) pertaining thereto as provided herein.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

6  

  

 

 

 

  


 

  

(b) Letter of Transmittal; Exchange of Certificates. As soon as practicable
after the Final Effective Time (but in no event later than three business days
after the Final Effective Time), the Surviving Company or Parent shall cause
the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share
a form of letter of transmittal (which (i) may specify that delivery of a
Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be effected, and risk of loss and title
to such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall pass, only upon delivery of such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share to the Exchange Agent and (ii) shall be in
such form and have such other customary provisions (including customary
provisions with respect to delivery of an "agent's message" with respect to
Book-Entry Shares) as the Surviving Company may specify, subject to the
Company's reasonable approval (to be obtained prior to the Final Effective
Time)), together with instructions thereto, setting forth, inter alia, the
procedures by which holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares may receive
the Merger Consideration and any dividends or other distributions to which
they are entitled pursuant to this Article II. Upon the completion of such
applicable procedures by a holder and the surrender of such holder's
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, the Exchange Agent shall deliver to such
holder (A) a certificate or book-entry representing that number of whole
Parent Shares (rounded down to the nearest whole Parent Share (taking into
account all certificates held by such holder)) that such holder has the right
to receive pursuant to the provisions of this Article II and (B) cash in an
amount (after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings, as provided in
Section 2.03(i)) equal to (x) the number of Intermediate Company Shares

  

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

7  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

  

represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares immediately prior to the
Final Effective Time multiplied by the Merger Cash Consideration plus (y) cash
in lieu of fractional shares that such holder has the right to receive
pursuant to Section 2.03(d) plus (z) any dividends or other distributions that
such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.03(e), and such
surrendered Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall forthwith be canceled. If
payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the
Person in whose name a Certificate surrendered is registered, it shall be a
condition of payment that (x) the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly
endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer and (y) the Person
requesting such payment (1) shall have paid any transfer and other Taxes
required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person
other than the registered holder or (2) shall have established to the
reasonable satisfaction of the Surviving Company that such Tax either has been
paid or is not applicable. Until satisfaction of the applicable procedures
contemplated by this Section 2.03, each Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall
be deemed at any time after the Final Effective Time to represent only the
right to receive the Merger Consideration and any dividends or other
distributions such Certificate or Book-Entry Share is entitled to pursuant to
this Article II pertaining to the Intermediate Company Shares formerly
represented thereby as contemplated by this Article II. No interest shall be
paid or shall accrue on the cash payable pursuant to this Article II.

  


 

  

(c) Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Intermediate Company
Shares. The Merger Consideration paid and payments (if any) made pursuant to
Section 2.03(e) in respect of each Intermediate Company Share upon surrender
of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with the terms of this
Article II shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to such Intermediate Company Shares previously represented
by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, subject, however, to the Surviving
Company's obligation to pay any dividends or make any other distributions with
a record date prior to the First-Step Effective Time that may have been
declared by the Company on Company Shares not in violation of the terms of
this Agreement or prior to the date of this Agreement and which remain unpaid
at the First-Step Effective Time. At the Final Effective Time, the share
transfer books of the Intermediate Company shall be closed and thereafter
there shall be no further registration of transfers on the share transfer
books of the Surviving Company of Intermediate Company Shares that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Final Effective Time. From and after the
Final Effective Time, the holders of Intermediate Company Shares formerly
represented by Certificates or Book-Entry Shares immediately prior to the
Final Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such
underlying Intermediate Company Shares, except as otherwise provided for
herein or by applicable Law. Subject to the last sentence of Section 2.03(g),
if, at any time after the Final Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares are presented to the Surviving Company for any reason, they shall be
canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article II.

  

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

8  

  

 

 

 

  


 

  

  

(d) No Fractional Shares. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, no fraction of a Parent Share may be issued in connection with the
Second-Step Merger and no dividends or other distributions with respect to
Parent Shares shall be payable on or with respect to any fractional share and
no such fractional share will entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any
rights of a shareholder of Parent. In lieu of the issuance of any such
fractional share, any holder of Intermediate Company Shares or Share Units who
would otherwise have been entitled to a fraction of a Parent Share shall be
paid cash, without interest, in an amount equal to the product of (i) the
fractional share interest to which such holder would otherwise be entitled
under this Article II multiplied by (ii) the Average Parent Share Price.

  


 

  

(e) Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares. No dividends or other
distributions with respect to Parent Shares with a record date after the Final
Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate or
Book-Entry Share with respect to any Parent Shares that the holder thereof has
the right to receive upon the surrender thereof until the holder of such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall surrender such Certificate or Book-Entry
Share in accordance with this Article II. Subject to any applicable foreign,
state, federal or other abandoned property, escheat or similar Law, following
surrender of any such Certificate or Book-Entry Share, there shall be paid to
the holder thereof, without interest, (i) at the time of such surrender, in
addition to all other amounts to which such holder is entitled under this
Article II, the amount of dividends or other distributions payable with
respect to such whole shares of Parent Shares that such holder is entitled to
pursuant to this Article II with a record date after the Final Effective Time
and paid with respect to Parent Shares prior to such surrender and (ii) at the
appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with
a record date after the Final Effective Time but prior to such surrender and a
payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to such whole
shares of Parent Shares that such holder is entitled to pursuant to this
Article II.

  


 

  

(f) Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been
lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Surviving Company, the posting by such Person of a bond, in
such reasonable amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim
that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange
Agent will pay, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate,
the applicable Merger Consideration and any dividends or other distributions
to be paid in respect of the Intermediate Company Shares formerly represented
by such Certificate as contemplated by this Article II.

  


 

  

(g) Termination of Exchange Fund. At any time following the first anniversary
of the Closing Date, the Surviving Company shall be entitled to require the
Exchange Agent to deliver to it any portion of the Exchange Fund (including
any interest received with respect thereto) that had been made available to
the Exchange Agent and which has not been disbursed to former holders of
Intermediate Company Shares, and thereafter such holders shall be entitled to
look only to Parent and the Surviving Company for, and, subject to applicable
Law, Parent and the Surviving Company shall remain liable, for, payment of
their claims of the Merger Consideration and any dividends or other
distributions that such holders have the right to receive pursuant to this
Article II pertaining to their former Intermediate Company Shares pursuant to
the provisions of this Article II. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by such
holders at such time at which such amounts would otherwise escheat to or
become property of any Governmental Authority shall become, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, the property of Parent or its designee, free and
clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

  

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

9  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

  

(h) No Liability. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, none of Parent, the Company, Flagstone Bermuda, Merger Sub, the
Intermediate Company, the Surviving Company or the Exchange Agent shall be
liable to any Person for Merger Consideration delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable foreign, state, federal or other abandoned
property, escheat or similar Law.

  


 

  

(i) Withholding Taxes. Parent, the Surviving Company and the Exchange Agent
(without duplication) shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as are
required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such
payment under the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"),
or under any provision of other applicable Tax Law. To the extent amounts are
so withheld and paid over to the appropriate Governmental Authority, the
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made.

  


 

  

Section 2.04 Company Equity Awards.

  


 

  

(a) Share Unit Consideration. Prior to the First-Step Effective Time, the
Board of Directors of the Company (or, if appropriate, any duly-authorized
committee thereof administering the Company Share Plans) shall adopt such
resolutions and take such other actions as may be required to provide that,
immediately following the Final Effective Time, (i) each restricted share unit
in respect of Company Shares granted under a Company Share Plan or otherwise
(a "Company RSU") and each performance share unit in respect of Company Shares
granted under a Company Share Plan or otherwise (a "Company PSU") (whether
time-based or performance-based) that is outstanding immediately prior to the
First-Step Effective Time (each, a "Share Unit") shall be converted into (x) a
number of fully vested Parent Shares equal to (1) the Exchange Ratio
multiplied by (2) the number of Company Shares subject to such Share Unit
immediately prior to the First-Step Effective Time (provided that the total
number of Parent Shares that each holder of Share Units is entitled to receive
(taking into account all Share Units held by such holder) shall be rounded
down to the nearest whole Parent Share and such holder shall be entitled to
cash in lieu of any fractional Parent Shares pursuant to Section 2.03(d)) and
(y) the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the sum of (1) the Merger
Cash Consideration multiplied by the number of Company Shares subject to such
Share Unit immediately prior to the First-Step Effective Time and (2) the
cumulative dividends declared by the Company in respect of the number of
Company Shares subject to such Share Unit immediately prior to the First-Step
Effective Time from the beginning of the applicable vesting period (in the
case of a Company RSU) or performance period (in the case of a Company PSU)
through immediately prior to the First-Step Effective Time, in the case of
each of clauses (x) and (y), determined assuming, in the case of any Company
PSU, attainment of all applicable performance goals at the maximum level for
payout and (ii) the holder of each Company PSU that is outstanding on the date
of this Agreement and that vests pursuant to its terms prior to the First-Step
Effective Time (each such Company PSU, a "Pre-Closing Vested PSU") shall be
entitled to receive the Merger Consideration with respect to the Additional
Pre-Closing Vested PSUs (all amounts payable pursuant to this Section 2.04(a),
the "Share Unit Consideration"). All Pre-Closing Vested PSUs shall be settled
only in Company Shares.

  

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

10  

  

 

 

 

  

  


 

  

(b) Withholding. Payment of the Share Unit Consideration shall be subject to
withholding in accordance with Section 2.03(i); provided, however, that, for
the avoidance of doubt, at the election of any holder of Share Units, any such
withholding may be satisfied by delivery of shares of Parent Common Stock to
Parent.

  


 

  

(c) Board Actions. The Board of Directors of the Company (or, if appropriate,
any duly-authorized committee thereof administering the Company Share Plans)
shall take all actions necessary to effectuate the provisions of this Section
2.04.

  


 

  

Section 2.05 Payments with Respect to Company Equity Awards. Promptly after
the Final Effective Time (but in any event, no later than the second payroll
date after the Final Effective Time), the Surviving Company shall pay through
its payroll systems the amounts due pursuant to Section 2.04 to the holders of
Share Units, including Pre-Closing Vested PSUs.

  


 

  

Section 2.06 Adjustments. Notwithstanding any provision of this Article II to
the contrary, if between the date of this Agreement and the Final Effective
Time, subject to compliance with the terms of this Agreement, the outstanding
Parent Shares or Company Shares (or Intermediate Company Shares, as
applicable) shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a
different class by reason of the occurrence or record date of any stock
dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination,
exchange of shares or similar transaction, the Merger Consideration shall be
appropriately adjusted to reflect such stock dividend, subdivision,
reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination, exchange of shares or
similar transaction.

  


 

  

Section 2.07 Warrant. At the Final Effective Time, the Amended and Restated
Share Purchase Warrant, dated June 25, 2010 (the "Warrant"), shall be amended
such that, upon payment of the per share exercise price in effect immediately
prior to the Final Effective Time, the Warrant shall be converted into the
right to receive (on a per share basis and based on the number of Company
Shares subject to the Warrant immediately prior to the Final Effective Time)
(i) the Merger Share Consideration, subject to adjustments (if any) pursuant
to the terms of the amended warrant, and (ii) the Merger Cash Consideration.
The total number of Parent Shares to be issued to such holder under the terms
of the amended warrant upon exercise of such warrant and payment of the
applicable exercise price shall be rounded down to the nearest whole Parent
Share, and Parent shall pay an amount in cash equal to any fraction of a
Parent Share that would otherwise be issuable to such holder. All other terms
of the Warrant will continue to apply to the amended warrant agreement (to the
extent applicable), and Parent and the Company shall take all actions required
to amend the Warrant pursuant to this Section 2.07. The amended Warrant will
reflect only such terms and provisions as are in the current Warrant or as are
required to be amended by the terms thereof.

The Company and Flagstone Bermuda jointly and severally represent and warrant
to Parent and Merger Sub that, as of the date of this Agreement and as of the
Closing Date, except as (A) set forth in the disclosure schedule delivered by
the Company to Parent and Merger Sub on the date of this Agreement (the
"Company Disclosure Schedule") (it being understood that any information set
forth on one section or subsection of the Company Disclosure Schedule shall be
deemed to apply to and qualify the section or subsection of this Article III
to which it corresponds in number and each other section or subsection of this
Article III to the extent that it is reasonably apparent on the face thereof
that such information is relevant to such other section or subsection) or (B)
disclosed in any report, schedule, form, statement or other document
(including exhibits) filed with, or furnished to, the SEC by the Company and
publicly available prior to the date of this Agreement (the "Company Filed SEC
Documents"), other than disclosure contained in the "Risk Factors" or
"Forward-Looking Statements" sections in such Company Filed SEC Documents:

  


 

  

Section 3.01 Organization; Standing.

  


 

  

(a) The Company is a joint stock corporation (societe anonyme) duly
incorporated and validly existing under the laws of Luxembourg and Flagstone
Bermuda is an exempted company duly incorporated, validly existing and in good
standing under the Laws of Bermuda. Each of the Company and Flagstone Bermuda
has all requisite power and authority necessary to carry on its business as it
is now being conducted, except (other than with respect to the due
incorporation and valid existence of the Company or Flagstone Bermuda) as
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect. Each of the Company and Flagstone Bermuda is duly
licensed or qualified to do business and is in good standing (where such
concept is recognized under applicable Law) in each jurisdiction in which the
nature of the business conducted by it or the character or location of the
properties and assets owned or leased by it makes such licensing or
qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so licensed, qualified
or in good standing would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. A true, correct and complete copy
of the Company Charter is included in the Company Filed SEC Documents.

  

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

12  

  

 

 

 

  

  


 

  

(b) Each of the Company's Subsidiaries is duly organized, validly existing and
in good standing (where such concept is recognized under applicable Law) under
the Laws of the jurisdiction of its organization, except where the failure to
be so organized, existing and in good standing would not, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

  


 

  

Section 3.02 Capitalization.

  


 

  

(a) The authorized share capital of the Company is set at $3,000,000, divided
into 300,000,000 Company Shares. At the close of business on August 24, 2012
(the "Capitalization Date"), (i) 71,058,922 Company Shares were issued and
outstanding, (ii) 13,405,337 Company Shares were held by the Company and its
Subsidiaries as treasury shares (which number of Company Shares includes
8,469,642 Company Shares held by Flagstone (Bermuda) Holdings Limited), (iii)
2,289,800 Company Shares were issuable in respect of outstanding Company PSUs
(assuming attainment of all applicable performance goals at the maximum level
for payout pursuant to the Amended and Restated Flagstone Performance Share
Unit Plan), (iv) 523,165 Company RSUs were outstanding pursuant to the Amended
and Restated Flagstone Employee Restricted Share Unit Plan (293,565 of which
were vested) and (v) 630,194 Company Shares were subject to the Warrant
(exercisable solely during the month of December 2013, with an exercise price
of $14.00 per Company Share as of the date of this Agreement). Since the
Capitalization Date through the date of this Agreement, other than in
connection with the vesting, settlement or exercise of Share Units, neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has (1) issued any Company Securities
or incurred any obligation to make any payments based on the price or value of
any Company Securities or dividends paid thereon that were outstanding as of
the Capitalization Date or (2) established a record date for, declared, set
aside for payment or paid any dividend on, or made any other distribution in
respect of, any shares of the Company's capital stock.

  


 

  

(b) Except as described in this Section 3.02, as of the Capitalization Date,
there were (i) no outstanding shares of capital stock of, or other equity or

Company that, as of the date of this Agreement and as of the Closing Date,
except as (A) set forth in the disclosure schedule delivered by Parent to the
Company on the date of this Agreement (the "Parent Disclosure Schedule") (it
being understood that any information set forth on one section or subsection
of the Parent Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to apply to and qualify the
section or subsection of this Article IV to which it corresponds in number and
each other section or subsection of this Article IV to the extent that it is
reasonably apparent on the face thereof that such information is relevant to
such other section or subsection) or (B) disclosed in any report, schedule,

Bermuda. Each of Parent and Merger Sub has all requisite power and authority
necessary to carry on its business as it is now being conducted, except (other

Merger Sub) as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Each of Parent and Merger
Sub is duly licensed or qualified to do business and is in good standing
(where such concept is recognized under applicable Law) in each jurisdiction
in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the character or
location of the properties and assets owned or leased by it makes such
licensing or qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so
licensed, qualified or in good standing would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. A
true, correct and complete copy of each of Parent's Memorandum of Association
(the "Parent Charter") and Parent's Amended and Restated Bye-laws (the "Parent
Bye-laws") is included in the Parent Filed SEC Documents.

  


 

  

(b) Each of Parent's Subsidiaries is duly organized, validly existing and in
good standing (where such concept is recognized under applicable Law) under
the Laws of the jurisdiction of its organization, except where the failure to

the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse
Effect.

of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries may vote are issued and outstanding.

  


 

  

(e) All of the outstanding shares of capital stock of, or other equity or
voting interests in, each Subsidiary of Parent (except for directors'
qualifying shares or the like) are owned, directly or indirectly, beneficially
and of record, by Parent free and clear of all Liens and material transfer
restrictions, except for such Liens and transfer restrictions of general
applicability as may be provided under the Securities Act or other applicable
securities Laws (including any restriction on the right to vote, sell or
otherwise dispose of such shares of capital stock or other equity or voting
interests). Each outstanding share of capital stock of each Subsidiary of
Parent that is held, directly or indirectly, by Parent, is duly authorized,
validly issued, fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive rights, and
there are no subscriptions, options, warrants, rights, calls, contracts or
other commitments, understandings, restrictions or arrangements relating to

Proposal, which Takeover Proposal did not result from any breach of this
Section 5.02, and (ii) the Board of Directors of the Company determines in
good faith after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal
counsel that the failure to do so would violate or result in a breach of the
directors' fiduciary duties under the laws of Luxembourg, then the Company may
enter into an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement with the Person or group of
Persons making the Takeover Proposal and, after execution and delivery of such
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, (x) furnish pursuant thereto information
(including non-public information) with respect to the Company and its
Subsidiaries to the Person or group of Persons making such Takeover Proposal;
provided that the Company shall promptly provide to Parent any information
(including non-public information) concerning the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries that is provided to any Person given such access, to the extent
such information was not previously provided to Parent or its Representatives
and (y) engage in or otherwise participate in discussions or negotiations with
the Person or group of Persons making such Takeover Proposal. For the
avoidance of doubt, the execution and delivery of an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement between the Company and the Person or group of
Persons making the applicable Takeover Proposal shall be a condition to the
Company or its Subsidiaries or their respective Representatives taking any
action described in clauses (x) and (y) of the preceding sentence, regardless
of whether the Person or group of Persons making the Takeover Proposal is
subject to a pre-existing confidentiality, standstill or similar agreement
with the Company at the time such Takeover Proposal is made.

  


 

  

(c) The Company shall promptly (but in no event later than 24 hours after
receipt by, or communication to, the Company (including from any of its
Subsidiaries or any of its or their Representatives) notify Parent in the
event that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or its or their
Representatives receives a Takeover Proposal, the submission of any inquiries
or requests for information regarding, or the making of any proposal or offer
that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, a Takeover
Proposal, and shall disclose to Parent the material terms and conditions of
any such Takeover Proposal, inquiry or request and the identity of the Person
or group of Persons making such Takeover Proposal, inquiry or request, and the
Company shall keep Parent informed in reasonable detail on a prompt basis of
any material developments with respect to any such Takeover Proposal, inquiry
or request (including notifying Parent within 24 hours after any material
changes or other action with respect thereto and providing all material
correspondence or other written material within 24 hours after receipt
thereof). For the avoidance of doubt, all information provided to Parent
pursuant to this Section 5.02 will be subject to the terms of the Parent
Confidentiality Agreement.

  


 

  

(d) Neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor any committee thereof
shall (i)(A) withhold or withdraw (or modify or qualify in a manner adverse to
Parent), or publicly propose to withhold or withdraw (or modify or qualify in
a manner adverse to Parent), the Company Board Recommendation or fail to
include the Company Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement, (B) recommend
the approval or adoption of, or approve or adopt, or publicly propose to
recommend, approve or adopt, any Takeover Proposal, or (C) resolve, agree or
publicly propose to take any actions in clause (A) or (B) above (any action
described in this clause (i) being referred to as an "Adverse Recommendation
Change") or (ii) authorize, cause or permit, or resolve, agree or publicly
propose to authorize, cause or permit, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
to execute or enter into any letter of intent, confidentiality agreement,
memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement,
acquisition agreement or other similar agreement related to any Takeover
Proposal, other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement entered into
pursuant to, and in compliance with the terms of, Section 5.02(b).
Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, prior to the time the Company Shareholder Approval is obtained, the
Board of Directors of the Company may make an Adverse Recommendation Change if
(and only if) the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith,
after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that
failure to make an Adverse Recommendation Change would violate or result in a
breach of the directors' fiduciary duties under the laws of Luxembourg;
provided, however, neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor any
committee thereof may make any Adverse Recommendation Change unless (1) the
Company has given Parent at least five business days' prior written notice of
its intention to take such action (such period, the "Adverse Recommendation
Change Period"), specifying the reasons therefor, and (2) if the decision of
the Board of Directors to make an Adverse Recommendation Change relates to a
Superior Proposal, (A) the notice provided by the Company specifies the
identity of the party making such Superior Proposal and the material terms and
conditions thereof, and the Company contemporaneously furnishes to Parent a
copy of the Superior Proposal and any other material documentation and (B)
prior to the expiration of such five business day period, Parent does not make
a proposal to adjust the terms and conditions of this Agreement that the Board
of Directors of the Company determines in good faith to be at least as
favorable as the Superior Proposal after giving effect to, among other things,
the payment of the Company Termination Fee, such that the Board of Directors
of the Company determines, after consultation with its financial advisors and
outside legal counsel, that an Adverse Recommendation Change is no longer
required by its fiduciary duties under the laws of Luxembourg. During the five
business day period prior to its effecting an Adverse Recommendation Change,
the Company shall, and shall cause its financial advisors and outside legal
counsel to, make itself and themselves, as applicable, available and
participate in negotiations with Parent (to the extent that Parent seeks to
negotiate) regarding any revisions to the terms of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement that may be proposed by Parent; provided,
further, that if at any time during the five business day period described in
the foregoing proviso, the Superior Proposal is amended or modified in any
material respect, then the Company shall notify Parent thereof in accordance
with the Company's obligations pursuant to Section 5.02(b), and the Board of
Directors of the Company shall not make any Adverse Recommendation Change
without again complying with this Section 5.02(c) (replacing five business
days with three business days). Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing
contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to relieve the Company of its
obligation pursuant to Section 5.03 to submit to a vote of the Company's
shareholders the approval of this Agreement, the First-Step Merger and the
First-Step Statutory Merger Agreement, in order to obtain the Company
Shareholder Approval at the Company Shareholders Meeting; provided, however,
that if the Board of Directors of the Company has made an Adverse
Recommendation Change in accordance with this Section 5.02(c), then in
submitting such matters to the Company Shareholders Meeting, the Board of
Directors of the Company may submit such matters without recommendation, in
which event the Board of Directors of the Company shall communicate the basis
for its lack of a recommendation in the Proxy Statement or an appropriate
amendment or supplement thereto if the Board of Directors of the Company
determines, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that such lack
of recommendation and communication is required in order to comply with the
directors' fiduciary duties under the laws of Luxembourg.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

53  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(e) Nothing in this Section 5.02 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall prohibit
the Company or the Board of Directors of the Company or any committee thereof
from (i) taking and disclosing to shareholders of the Company a position or
communication contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of
Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii) making any
disclosure or communication to shareholders of the Company that the Board of
Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after consultation with its
outside legal counsel, is required in order to comply with its directors'
fiduciary duties under the laws of Luxembourg or federal securities Laws;
provided, however, that in any event the Board of Directors of the Company
shall not make an Adverse Recommendation Change except in accordance with
Section 5.02(c). Any disclosure by the Company or the Board of Directors of
the Company or any committee thereof relating to a Takeover Proposal shall be
deemed to be an Adverse Recommendation Change by the Board of Directors of the
Company, unless the Board of Directors of the Company reaffirms the Company
Board Recommendation in such disclosure.

  


 

  

(f) The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to cause all Persons, other
than Parent and its Affiliates, who have been furnished confidential
information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection
with the solicitation of or discussions regarding an actual or possible
Takeover Proposal within the 12 months prior to the date of this Agreement to
return or destroy such information promptly.

  


 

  

(g) As used in this Agreement, "Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement" shall
mean a confidentiality and standstill agreement in the form set forth in
Section 5.02(g) of the Company Disclosure Letter, which shall include (i)
standstill provisions identical to those set forth in Section 5.02(g) of the
Company Disclosure Letter and (ii) such other terms and provisions as are
either identical to, or no less favorable in the aggregate than, those set
forth in Section 5.02(g) of the Company Disclosure Letter.

  


 

  

(h) As used in this Agreement, "Takeover Proposal" shall mean any inquiry,
proposal or offer from any Person or group (other than Parent and its
Subsidiaries) relating to, in a single transaction or series of related
transactions, any direct or indirect (i) acquisition of 10% or more of the
consolidated assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries (based on the fair
market value thereof, as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of
the Company), (ii) acquisition of 10% or more of the outstanding Company
Shares, (iii) tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would result
in any Person or group beneficially owning 10% or more of the outstanding
Company Shares or (iv) merger, amalgamation, consolidation, share exchange,
business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar
transaction involving the Company, in each case, other than the Transactions.

  

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

54  

  

 

 

 

  

  


 

  

(i) As used in this Agreement, "Superior Proposal" shall mean any bona fide
written Takeover Proposal that did not result from a breach of this Section
5.02 that the Board of Directors of the Company has determined in its good
faith judgment, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside
legal counsel, and taking into account all relevant legal, regulatory,
financial and other aspects of such proposal (including value and other
financial considerations, financing and legal and regulatory considerations,
expense reimbursement requirements and any conditions to, and expected timing
and risks of, completion, as well as any changes to the terms of the this
Agreement proposed by Parent in response to such Superior Proposal) would be
more favorable to the Company's shareholders than the Mergers; provided that
for purposes of the definition of "Superior Proposal", the references to "10%"
in the definition of Takeover Proposal shall be deemed to be references to
"80%".

  


 

  

Section 5.03 Preparation of the Proxy Statement and Registration Statement;
Shareholders Meeting.

  


 

  

(a) Subject to Section 5.03(b), the Company shall take all necessary actions
in accordance with applicable Law, the Company Charter and the rules of the
New York Stock Exchange to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a
meeting of its shareholders (including any adjournment, recess, reconvening or
postponement thereof, the "Company Shareholders Meeting") for the purpose of
obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval, as soon as reasonably practicable,
and in any event (subject to applicable Luxembourg law) within 45 days,
following the effectiveness of the Registration Statement. Subject to Section
5.02, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Company
Shareholder Approval. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, the Company may adjourn, recess, reconvene or postpone the
Company Shareholders Meeting (i) after consultation with Parent, to the extent
necessary to ensure that any required supplement or amendment to the Proxy
Statement is provided to the shareholders of the Company within a reasonable
amount of time in advance of the Company Shareholders Meeting, (ii) after
consultation with Parent, if as of the time for which the Company Shareholders
Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy Statement) there
are insufficient Company Shares present (either in person or by proxy) to
constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the Company
Shareholders Meeting or (iii) in its sole discretion, until the third business
day after the expiration of any Adverse Recommendation Change Period. For the
avoidance of any doubt, no Adverse Change Recommendation shall obviate or
otherwise affect the obligation of the Company to duly call, give notice of,
convene and hold the Company Shareholders Meeting for the purpose of obtaining
the Company Shareholder Approval in accordance with this Section 5.03(a).

  

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

55  

  

 

 

 

  

  


 

  

(b) As promptly as reasonably practicable after the execution of this
Agreement, the Company and Parent shall prepare, and shall cooperate and
provide assistance to each other in the preparation of, and file with the SEC
the Proxy Statement and the Registration Statement (of which the Proxy
Statement shall form a part). Each of Parent and the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to have the Registration Statement declared effective
under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after such filing and to
keep the Registration Statement effective as long as is necessary to
consummate the Second-Step Merger. Subject to Section 5.02, the Board of
Directors of the Company shall make the Company Board Recommendation to the
Company's shareholders and shall include such recommendation in the Proxy
Statement. Parent shall provide to the Company all information concerning
Parent and Merger Sub as may be reasonably requested by the Company in
connection with the Proxy Statement, and the Company shall provide to Parent
all information concerning the Company and Flagstone Bermuda as may be
reasonably requested by Parent in connection with the Registration Statement.
Each of the Company, Flagstone Bermuda, Parent and Merger Sub shall promptly
correct any information provided by it for use in the Proxy Statement or the
Registration Statement, as applicable, if and to the extent such information
shall have become false or misleading in any material respect. The parties
shall notify each other promptly upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC
and of any request by the SEC for amendments or supplements to the Proxy
Statement or the Registration Statement or for additional information and
shall supply each other with copies of all written correspondence between the
applicable party or any of its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC,
on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement or the Registration
Statement. The parties shall use their reasonable best efforts to respond as
promptly as reasonably practicable to any comments received from the SEC
concerning the Proxy Statement and the Registration Statement and to resolve
such comments with the SEC. Each of Parent and the Company (i) will provide
the other with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any amendment
or supplement to the Registration Statement or the Proxy Statement, as
applicable, and any communications (including any responses to any comments of
the SEC) prior to filing such with the SEC, (ii) will include in such document
or communications all comments reasonably proposed by the other and reasonably
acceptable to the other and (iii) will not file such document or communication
with the SEC prior to receiving the approval of the other (which will not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

  


 

  

(c) The Company hereby acknowledges that, pursuant to the Voting Agreements,
each of the shareholders of the Company party thereto has irrevocably granted
to and appointed Parent and up to two of Parent's designated representatives
as such shareholder's proxy to vote all of the Company Shares (subject to the
limitations on voting rights set forth in Section 51A of the Company Charter)
held by such shareholder at the Company Shareholders Meeting, solely on the
matters and in the manner specified in the Voting Agreements (the "Company
Shareholder Proxies"). The Company further agrees that during the Voting
Period and, if applicable, the Tail Period (each, as defined in the applicable
Voting Agreement), it shall recognize the grant of any such Company
Shareholder Proxy and the exercise thereof by Parent or one of its designated
representatives in accordance with its terms at any meeting of the
shareholders of the Company (including the Company Shareholders Meeting and
any adjournment, reconvenement or postponement thereof), subject to applicable
Law.

Section 5.04 Reasonable Best Efforts.

  


 

  

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the parties
hereto shall cooperate with the other parties and use (and shall cause their
respective Subsidiaries to use) their respective reasonable best efforts
(unless, with respect to any action, another standard of performance or timing
is expressly provided for herein) to promptly (i) take, or cause to be taken,
all actions, and do, or cause to be done, and assist and cooperate with the
other parties hereto in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to
cause the conditions to Closing to be satisfied as promptly as reasonably
practicable and to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious
manner reasonably practicable, the Transactions, including (A) taking all such
actions contemplated by the terms of the Statutory Merger Agreements, (B)
otherwise preparing and filing promptly all documentation to effect all
necessary filings, notices, petitions, statements, registrations, submissions
of information, applications and other documents and (C) executing and
delivering any additional instruments necessary to consummate the

permits, authorizations, orders and other confirmations from any Governmental
Authority or third party necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the

to the Material Contracts, Company Insurance Approvals, the Parent Insurance
Approvals and under applicable Antitrust Laws, (iii) take all steps that are
necessary, proper or advisable to avoid any Actions by any Governmental
Authorities with respect to this Agreement or the Transactions and (iv) defend
or contest in good faith any Action by any third party (including any
Governmental Authority), whether judicial or administrative, challenging this
Agreement or that would otherwise prevent or impede, interfere with, hinder or
delay in any material respect the consummation of the Transactions, including
by seeking to have any stay or temporary restraining order entered by any
court or other Governmental Authority vacated or reversed.

  


 

  

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, the Company and
Parent shall each use its reasonable best efforts to (i) take all action
necessary to ensure that no Takeover Law is or becomes applicable to any of
the Transactions and refrain from taking any actions that would cause the
applicability of such Laws and (ii) if the restrictions of any Takeover Law
become applicable to any of the Transactions, take all action necessary to
ensure that the Transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on
the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise lawfully minimize the
effect of such Takeover Law on the Transactions.

  


 

  

(c) Without limiting the general applicability of Section 5.04(a), each of the
Company and Parent shall, in consultation and cooperation with the other and
as promptly as practicable, following the date of this Agreement, file (i) all
appropriate documents, forms, filings or submissions required under any
non-U.S. Antitrust Laws and (ii) with applicable Insurance Regulators, all
documents, forms, filings or other submissions required under applicable
Insurance Laws with respect to the Transactions. Any such filings shall be in
substantial compliance with the requirements of applicable Law. Each of the
parties shall, in connection with the efforts referenced in Section 5.04(a),
(A) furnish to the other party such necessary information and reasonable
assistance as the other party may request in connection with its preparation
of any documents, forms, filings or submissions contemplated by the first
sentence of this Section 5.04(c), (B) give the other party reasonable prior
notice of any such filings or submissions and, to the extent reasonably
practicable and subject to applicable Law, of any material communication with,
and any material inquiries or material requests for additional information
from, any Governmental Authority regarding the Transactions, and permit the
other party to review and discuss in advance, and consider in good faith the
views of, and to the extent practicable and subject to applicable Law, secure
the participation of, the other party in connection with, any such filings,
submissions, communications, inquiries or requests, (C) unless prohibited by
applicable Law or by the applicable Governmental Authority, and to the extent
reasonably practicable, (1) not participate in or attend any meeting, or
engage in any substantive conversation, with any Governmental Authority in
respect of the Transactions without the other party, (2) give the other party
reasonable prior notice of any such meeting or conversation, (3) in the event
one party is prohibited by applicable Law or by the applicable Governmental
Authority from participating in or attending any such meeting or engaging in
any such conversation, keep such party reasonably apprised with respect
thereto to the extent permitted by applicable Law, (4) cooperate in the filing
of any substantive memoranda, white papers, filings, correspondence or other
written communications explaining or defending this Agreement or any of the
Transactions, articulating any regulatory or competitive argument or
responding to requests or objections made by any Governmental Authority and
(5) furnish the other party with copies of all filings, submissions,
correspondence and communications (and memoranda setting forth the substance
thereof) between it and its Affiliates and their respective Representatives,
on the one hand, and any Governmental Authority or members of any Governmental
Authority's staff, on the other hand, with respect to this Agreement and the
Transactions except to the extent containing Trade Secrets or personally
identifiable information and (D) respond to any inquiry or request from any
Governmental Authority as promptly as reasonably practicable. The parties
agree not to extend, directly or indirectly, any waiting period under any
applicable Antitrust Law or enter into any agreement with a Governmental
Authority to delay or not to consummate the First-Step Merger, the Second-Step
Merger or any of the other Transactions, except with the prior written consent
of the other parties hereto, which consent may not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed by a party.

Section 5.05 Transfer Taxes. Subject to the consummation of the Second-Step
Merger, all share transfer, real estate transfer, documentary, stamp,
recording and other similar Taxes (including interest, penalties and additions
to any such Taxes) ("Transfer Taxes") incurred in connection with the
Transactions shall be paid by Parent or the Surviving Company, and, prior to
the First-Step Effective Time, the Company shall cooperate with Parent in
preparing, executing and filing any applicable Tax Returns with respect to
such Transfer Taxes.

Section 5.06 Public Announcements. Parent and the Company shall consult with
each other before issuing, and give each other the opportunity to review and
comment upon, any press release or other public statements with respect to the
Transactions, and shall not issue any such press release or make any such
public statement prior to such consultation, except as may be required by
applicable Law, court process or the rules and regulations of any national
securities exchange or national securities quotation system and except for any
matters referred to in Section 5.02. The parties hereto agree that the initial
press releases to be issued with respect to the Transactions following
execution of this Agreement shall be in the forms heretofore agreed to by the
parties hereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties shall have no
consultation or other obligation pursuant to this Section 5.06 with respect to
any press release or other public statements related to any actual or
contemplated litigation between or among the parties to this Agreement.

  


 

  

Section 5.07 Access to Information; Confidentiality. Subject to applicable
Law, upon reasonable notice, the Company shall afford to Parent and Parent's
Representatives reasonable access during normal business hours to the
Company's officers, employees, agents, properties, books, Contracts and
records and the Company shall furnish promptly to Parent and Parent's
Representatives such information concerning its business, personnel, assets,
liabilities and properties as Parent may reasonably request; provided that
Parent and its Representatives shall conduct any such activities in such a
manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the business or operations of the
Company; provided further, however, that the Company shall not be obligated to
provide such access or information if the Company determines, in its
reasonable judgment, that doing so would violate applicable Law or a Contract
having an express confidentiality provision, or waive the protection of an
attorney-client privilege or other legal privilege. Without limiting the
foregoing, in the event that the Company does not provide access or
information in reliance on the immediately preceding sentence, it shall
provide notice to Parent that it is withholding such access or information and
shall use its reasonable best efforts to communicate, to the extent feasible,
the applicable information in a way that would not violate the applicable Law
or a Contract having an express confidentiality provision or risk waiver of
such privilege. All requests for information made pursuant to this Section
5.07 shall be directed to the Person designated by the Company. Until the
Final Effective Time, the information provided will be subject to the terms of
the letter agreement dated as of March 7, 2012, by and between the Company and
Parent (as amended from time to time, the "Parent Confidentiality Agreement")
and the letter agreement dated as of July 12, 2012, by and among the Company
and Parent (as amended from time to time, together with the Parent
Confidentiality Agreement, the "Confidentiality Agreements").

  


 

  

Section 5.08 Indemnification and Insurance.

  


 

  

(a) From and after the Final Effective Time, the Surviving Company shall (i)
indemnify and hold harmless each individual who at the Final Effective Time
is, or at any time prior to the Final Effective Time was, a director or
officer of the Company, the Intermediate Company or of a Subsidiary of the
Company (each, an "Indemnitee" and, collectively, the "Indemnitees") with
respect to all claims, liabilities, losses, damages, judgments, fines,
penalties, costs (including amounts paid in settlement or compromise) and
expenses (including fees and expenses of legal counsel) in connection with any
Action (whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative), whenever
asserted, based on or arising out of, in whole or in part, (A) the fact that
an Indemnitee was a director or officer of the Company, the Intermediate
Company or such Subsidiary or (B) acts or omissions by an Indemnitee in the
Indemnitee's capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent of the
Company, the Intermediate Company or such Subsidiary or taken at the request
of the Company, the Intermediate Company or such Subsidiary (including in
connection with serving at the request of the Company, the Intermediate
Company or such Subsidiary as a director, officer, employee, agent, trustee or
fiduciary of another Person (including any employee benefit plan)), in each
case under clause (A) or (B), at, or at any time prior to, the Final Effective
Time (including any Action relating in whole or in part to the Transactions or
relating to the enforcement of this provision or any other indemnification or
advancement right of any Indemnitee), to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable Law, but only to the extent that such Indemnitees are entitled to
indemnification pursuant to the Company Charter and the organizational
documents of the Company and its Subsidiaries as in effect on the date of this
Agreement or in any written agreement in existence as of the date of this
Agreement providing for indemnification between the Company and any Indemnitee
and (ii) assume all obligations of the Company, the Intermediate Company and
such Subsidiaries to the Indemnitees in respect of indemnification and
exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to
the Final Effective Time as provided in the Company Charter and the
organizational documents of the Intermediate Company or such Subsidiaries as
in effect on the date of this Agreement or in any written agreement in
existence as of the date of this Agreement providing for indemnification
between the Company and any Indemnitee. Without limiting the foregoing,
Parent, from and after the Final Effective Time, shall cause, unless otherwise
required by Law, the memorandum of association and bye-laws of the Surviving
Company to contain provisions no less favorable to the Indemnitees with
respect to limitation of liabilities of directors and officers and
indemnification than are set forth as of the date of this Agreement in the
Company Charter, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise
modified in a manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of the
Indemnitees. In addition, from the Final Effective Time, Parent shall cause
the Surviving Company to advance any expenses (including fees and expenses of
legal counsel) of any Indemnitee under this Section 5.08(a) (including in
connection with enforcing the indemnity and other obligations referred to in
this Section 5.08(a)) as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable Law; provided that the individual to whom expenses are advanced
provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it shall be determined that
such person is not entitled to be indemnified pursuant to this Section
5.08(a).

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

59  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

(b) For the six-year period commencing immediately after the Final Effective
Time, the Surviving Company shall maintain in effect the Company's current
directors' and officers' liability insurance covering acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Final Effective Time with respect to those
individuals who are currently (and any additional individuals who prior to the
Final Effective Time become) covered by the Company's directors' and officers'
liability insurance policies on terms and scope with respect to such coverage,
and in amount, no less favorable to such individuals than those of such policy
in effect on the date of this Agreement (or Parent may substitute therefor
policies, issued by reputable insurers, of at least the same coverage with
respect to matters existing or occurring prior to the Final Effective Time,
including a "tail" policy); provided, however, that, if the annual premium for
such insurance shall exceed 250% of the current annual premium (such 250%
threshold, the "Maximum Premium"), then Parent shall provide or cause to be
provided a policy for the applicable individuals with the best coverage as
shall then be available (as determined by Parent in its reasonable discretion)
at an annual premium not in excess of the Maximum Premium. The Company may
prior to the Final Effective Time purchase, for an aggregate amount not to
exceed the aggregate Maximum Premium for six years, a six-year prepaid "tail
policy" on terms and conditions providing at least substantially equivalent
benefits as the current policies of directors' and officers' liability
insurance maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to
matters existing or occurring prior to the Final Effective Time, covering
without limitation the Transactions. If such prepaid "tail policy" has been
obtained by the Company, it shall be deemed to satisfy all obligations to
obtain insurance pursuant to this Section 5.08(b) and the Surviving Company
shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause such policy to be maintained in
full force and effect, for its full term, and to honor all of its obligations
thereunder.

  

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

60  

  

 

 

 

  

  


 

  

(c) The provisions of this Section 5.08 are (i) intended to be for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnitee, his or her heirs and his or
her representatives and (ii) in addition to, and not in substitution for, any
other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such individual may
have under the Company Charter, by contract or otherwise. The obligations of
Parent and the Surviving Company under this Section 5.08 shall not be
terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect the rights of
any Indemnitee to whom this Section 5.08 applies unless (x) such termination
or modification is required by applicable Law or (y) the affected Indemnitee
shall have consented in writing to such termination or modification (it being
expressly agreed that the Indemnitees to whom this Section 5.08 applies shall
be third-party beneficiaries of this Section 5.08).

  


 

  

(d) In the event that Parent, the Surviving Company or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates, amalgamates with or merges into any
other Person and is not the continuing or Surviving Company or entity of such
consolidation, amalgamation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of Parent or the Surviving Company shall assume all of the obligations
thereof set forth in this Section 5.08.

  


 

  

(e) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall
release, waive or impair any rights to directors' and officers' insurance
claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any of their respective directors,
officers or other employees, it being understood and agreed that the
indemnification provided for in Section 5.08(a) is not prior to or in
substitution for any such claims under such policies.

Section 5.09 Rule 16b-3. Prior to the Final Effective Time and in consultation
with Parent, the Company shall be permitted to take such steps as may be
reasonably necessary or advisable to cause dispositions of Company or
Intermediate Company equity securities (including derivative securities)
pursuant to the Transactions by each individual who is a director or officer
of the Company subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act to be exempt under
Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

  


 

  

Section 5.10 Employee Matters.

  


 

  

(a) For a period of one year following the Final Effective Time (or, other
than with respect to post-termination benefits and payments, if shorter, until
an employee is no longer employed by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries),
Parent shall provide, or shall cause the Surviving Company (or in the case of
a transfer of all or substantially all the assets and business of the
Surviving Company, its successors and assigns) to provide, each individual who
is employed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the
First-Step Effective Time (each, a "Company Employee") with compensation and
benefits that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to such
compensation and benefits provided to the Company Employees immediately prior
to the First-Step Effective Time.

  


 

  

(b) Without limiting the generality of Section 5.10(a), from and after the
Final Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Company to,
honor in accordance with their respective terms, each Company Plan set forth
in Schedule 3.11(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule (including with respect
to any payments, benefits or rights arising thereunder as a result of the
Transactions (either alone or in combination with any other event)), as each
such Company Plan is in effect on the date hereof or is amended after the date
hereof consistent with Section 5.01(a)(vii) hereof and each Company Plan that
is entered into after the date hereof consistent with Section 5.01(a) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule.

  


 

  

(c) With respect to all employee benefit plans of the Surviving Company and
its Subsidiaries, including any "employee benefit plan" (as defined in Section
3(3) of ERISA) (including any vacation, paid time-off and severance plans),
for all purposes, including determining eligibility to participate, level of
benefits, vesting, benefit accruals and early retirement subsidies each
Company Employee's service with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (as
well as service with any predecessor employer of the Company or any such
Subsidiary, to the extent service with the predecessor employer was recognized
by the Company or such Subsidiary) shall be treated as service with the
Surviving Company or any of its Subsidiaries (or in the case of a transfer of
all or substantially all the assets and business of the Surviving Company, its
successors and assigns); provided, however, that such service need not be
recognized (i) to the extent that such recognition would result in any
duplication of benefits for the same period of service or (ii) for purposes of
benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension plan.

  


 

  

(d) Without limiting the generality of Section 5.10(a), Parent shall, or shall
cause the Surviving Company to, waive, or cause to be waived, any pre-existing
condition limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and waiting
periods under any welfare benefit plan maintained by the Surviving Company or
any of its Subsidiaries in which Company Employees (and their eligible
dependents) will be eligible to participate from and after the Final Effective
Time, except to the extent that such pre-existing condition limitations,
exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and waiting periods would not have
been satisfied or waived under the comparable Company Plan immediately prior
to the First-Step Effective Time. Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Company to, recognize the dollar amount of all co-payments, deductibles and
similar expenses incurred by each Company Employee (and his or her eligible
dependents) during the calendar year in which the Final Effective Time occurs
for purposes of satisfying such year's deductible and co-payment limitations
under the relevant welfare benefit plans in which they may be eligible to
participate from and after the Final Effective Time.

  

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

62  

  

 

 

 

  

  


 

  

(e) For the avoidance of doubt, for purposes of any Company Plan containing a
definition of "change in control" or "change of control", the consummation of
the Mergers shall be deemed to constitute a "change in control" or "change of
control".

  


 

  

(f) The provisions of this Section 5.10 are solely for the benefit of the
parties to this Agreement, and no provision of this Section 5.10 is intended
to, or shall, (i) constitute the establishment or adoption of or an amendment
to any employee benefit plan for purposes of ERISA or otherwise, (ii) create
any right in any Company Employee to continued employment by Parent, the
Company, the Surviving Company, or any Affiliate thereof, or limit the ability
of Parent, the Company, the Surviving Company, or any Affiliate thereof, to
terminate the employment of any Company Employee for any reason, (iii) require
the Company, Parent, the Surviving Company, or any Affiliate thereof to
continue any Company Plan or prevent the amendment, modification, or
termination thereof after the Final Effective Time, or (iv) confer upon or
vest in any Company Employee or other person any rights or remedies. No
current or former employee or any other individual associated therewith shall
be regarded for any purpose as a third-party beneficiary of this Agreement or
have the right to enforce the provisions hereof.

  


 

  

(g) With respect to the First-Step Merger and the Second-Step Merger, any
notice to or consultation with any employee representative required under any
collective bargaining agreement or other agreement with a labor union, works
council or like organization or applicable Law has been, or prior to the
Closing will be, timely completed by the Company and its Subsidiaries.

  


 

  

Section 5.11 Notification of Certain Matters; Shareholder Litigation. Prior to
the Final Effective Time, Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company, and
the Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, (a) of any Actions commenced
or, to such party's Knowledge, threatened against such party which relates to
this Agreement or the Transactions, and (b) any matter (including a breach of
any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this
Agreement) that would reasonably be expected to lead to the failure to satisfy
any of the conditions to the Closing in Article VI, or would trigger a right
of termination pursuant to Article VII. The Company shall give Parent the
opportunity to participate in the defense and settlement of any shareholder
litigation against the Company or its directors relating to this Agreement or
the Transactions, and no such settlement shall be agreed to without Parent's
prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed
or conditioned).

Junior Subordinated Indenture, dated as of August 23, 2006, between the

(b) In connection with the Second-Step Merger, concurrently with or

Company Shares beneficially owned by it or any of its Subsidiaries or with
respect to which it or any of its Subsidiaries has the power (by agreement,
proxy or otherwise) to cause to be voted or to provide a consent, in favor of
the approval of this Agreement, the First-Step Statutory Merger Agreement and
the First-Step Merger at any meeting of shareholders of the Company at which
this Agreement, the First-Step Statutory Merger Agreement and the First-Step
Merger shall be submitted for approval and at all adjournments or
postponements thereof (or, if applicable, by any action of shareholders of the
Company by consent in lieu of a meeting).

  

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

64  

  

 

 

 

  

  


 

  

(b) Immediately following the execution of this Agreement, Parent shall
execute and deliver, in accordance with Section 106 of the Bermuda Companies

written consent to the Company immediately following the execution of this
Agreement.

  


 

  

Section 5.14 Flagstone Bermuda Shareholder Approval. Immediately following the

Section 5.15 Stock Exchange Listing. Parent shall cause the Parent Shares to
be issued in the Second-Step Merger to be approved for listing on the New York

Section 5.16 Stock Exchange De-listing. Parent shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause the Company's securities to be de-listed from the New York

Section 5.17 Book Value Calculation.

  


 

  

(a) Parent and the Company may, by written notice (a "Book Value Procedures
Notice") to the other party delivered no more than two days following the
Measurement Date, request that the other party prepare an estimate of its Book
Value, determined as of the Measurement Date (the "Measurement Date Book
Value"). With respect to any Non-Requesting Party, the Measurement Date Book
Value hereunder shall be (i) based on the consolidated interim unaudited
balance sheet of such party as of the last day of the month immediately
preceding the Measurement Date, but adjusted to account for any and all
subsequent events occurring through and including the Measurement Date and
(ii) calculated in accordance with the historical accounting methodologies,
practices and procedures of the applicable party, consistently applied. For
purposes of this Agreement, the "Requesting Party" shall mean the party
delivering the Book Value Procedures Notice and the "Non-Requesting Party"
shall mean the party receiving the Book Value Procedures Notice. For the
avoidance of doubt, both Parent and the Company may submit a Book Value
Procedures Notice hereunder, in which case each such party shall become both a
Requesting Party with respect to the Book Value Procedures Notice that it
delivers and a Non-Requesting Party with respect to the Book Value Procedures
Notice that it receives.

  

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

65  

  

 

 

 

  

  


 

  

(b) The Non-Requesting Party shall, no later than ten business days after its
receipt of the Book Value Procedures Notice, prepare and deliver to the
Requesting Party its calculation in reasonable detail of the Non-Requesting
Party's Measurement Date Book Value. With respect to Non-Requesting Party, the
Measurement Date Book Value hereunder shall (i) be based on the consolidated
interim unaudited balance sheet of such party as of the last day of the month
immediately preceding the Measurement Date, but adjusted to account for any
and all subsequent events occurring through and including the Measurement Date
and (ii) be calculated in accordance with the historical accounting
methodologies, practices and procedures of the applicable party, consistently
applied. Following the delivery by the Non-Requesting Party of its calculation
of its Measurement Date Book Value in accordance with this Section 5.17(b),
the Non-Requesting Party shall give the Requesting Party prompt access to such
information and personnel as the Requesting Party may reasonably request in
connection with its review of the Non-Requesting Party's calculation of the
Non-Requesting Party's Measurement Date Book Value. The Requesting Party shall
have five days from and after the date of delivery of the Non-Requesting
Party's calculation of its Measurement Date Book Value to review such
calculation (such period, the "Requesting Party Review Period"). The
Requesting Party and the Non-Requesting Party shall seek in good faith to
resolve any disagreements with respect to the Non-Requesting Party's
calculation of its Measurement Date Book Value within five days following the
expiration of the Requesting Party Review Period. If the Requesting Party and
the Non-Requesting Party agree on the calculation of the Non-Requesting
Party's Measurement Date Book Value, then such Measurement Date Book Value as
so agreed shall become final and binding on the parties. If the parties are
unable to agree on the Non-Requesting Party's Measurement Date Book Value
within such five day period and the Requesting Party reasonably believes in
good faith that the items remaining in dispute would, if resolved in the
Requesting Party's favor, result in the failure of the condition set forth in
Section 6.02(d), in the case that Parent is the Requesting Party, or Section
6.03(d), in the case that the Company is the Requesting Party, to be
satisfied, then each of the Requesting Party and the Non-Requesting Party
shall use its reasonable best efforts to engage an independent accounting
firm, to act as an independent expert and not as an arbitrator, that is
mutually acceptable to the Requesting Party and the Non-Requesting Party (the
"Accounting Firm") within five days and shall refer the determination of the
Non-Requesting Party's Measurement Date Book Value to the Accounting Firm;
provided, however, that if the Requesting Party and the Non-Requesting Party
are unable to select such accounting firm within such five day period, then
either party may request the American Arbitration Association's International
Centre for Dispute Resolution to appoint, within three days from the date of
such request or as soon as practicable thereafter, an internationally
recognized accounting firm that is not the auditor or independent accounting
firm of any of the parties, and who is independent and impartial, to act as
the Accounting Firm, and the accounting firm selected thereby shall be the
Accounting Firm. Each of the Requesting Party and the Non-Requesting Party
agree to enter into a customary engagement letter with the Accounting Firm.

  

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

66  

  

 

 

 

  

  


 

  

(c) The Requesting Party shall, no later than ten business days after its
delivery of the Book Value Procedures Notice, prepare and deliver to the Non-
Requesting Party the Requesting Party's calculation in reasonable detail of
its Measurement Date Book Value. Following the delivery by the Requesting
Party of the Requesting Party's calculation of its Measurement Date Book Value
in accordance with this Section 5.17(c), the Requesting Party shall give the
Non-Requesting Party prompt access to such information and personnel as the
Non-Requesting Party may reasonably request in connection with the Non-
Requesting Party's review of the Requesting Party's calculation of its
Measurement Date Book Value. The Non-Requesting Party shall have until the
expiration of the Requesting Party Review Period to review such calculation.
The Requesting Party and the Non-Requesting Party shall seek in good faith to
resolve any disagreements with respect to the Requesting Party's calculation
of its Measurement Date Book Value within five days following the expiration
of the Requesting Party Review Period. If the Requesting Party and the Non-
Requesting Party agree on the calculation of the Requesting Party's
Measurement Date Book Value, then such Measurement Date Book Value as so
agreed shall become final and binding on the parties. If the parties are
unable to agree on the Requesting Party's Measurement Date Book Value within
such five day period and the Non-Requesting Party reasonably believes in good
faith that the items remaining in dispute would, if resolved in the Non-
Requesting Party's favor, result in the satisfaction of the condition set
forth in Section 6.02(d), in the case that Parent is the Requesting Party, or
Section 6.03(d), in the case that the Company is the Requesting Party, then
each of the Requesting Party and the Non-Requesting Party shall use its
reasonable best efforts to engage the Accounting Firm within five days and
shall refer the determination of the Requesting Party's Measurement Date Book
Value to the Accounting Firm.

  


 

  

(d) (i) If the determination of the Measurement Date Book Value of the
Requesting Party and/or the Non-Requesting Party is referred to the Accounting
Firm, each of the Requesting Party and the Non-Requesting Party shall within
five days after the engagement of the Accounting Firm submit to the Accounting
Firm their respective final proposals with respect to the disputed Measurement
Date Book Value calculations (and each such final proposal shall specify any
items as to which the parties have been able to agree, each party's proposal
as to the items in dispute and each party's proposed calculation of the
applicable Measurement Date Book Value or Values). Each of Parent and the
Company shall cooperate and assist the Accounting Firm in its review of the
disputed items and the parties' respective calculations, including by
providing the Accounting Firm reasonable access to all relevant information
and personnel within its control, and each shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause the Accounting Firm to issue its determination within 15 days
after the submission of such final proposals to the Accounting Firm.

  


 

  

(ii) The Accounting Firm shall determine, based on the applicable final
proposals of the Non-Requesting Party and the Requesting Party, the
Measurement Date Book Value or Values in dispute, and such determination shall
be final, binding and conclusive on Parent and the Company absent manifest
error, and, subject to Article VIII, may be enforced as a judgment in any
court having jurisdiction. The fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall
be borne in their entirety by (A) in the event that the Accounting Firm's
determination is such that Section 6.02(d), in the case that Parent is the
Requesting Party, or Section 6.03(d), in the case that the Company is the
Requesting Party, is satisfied, the Requesting Party or (B) in the event that
the Accounting Firm's determination is such that Section 6.02(d), in the case
that Parent is the Requesting Party, or Section 6.03(d), in the case that the
Company is the Requesting Party, is not satisfied, the Non-Requesting Party.

  

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

67  

  

 

 

 

  

  


 

  

(e) If the Walk-Away Date occurs during the pendency of any determination of
Measurement Date Book Value pursuant to this Section 5.17, the Walk-Away Date
shall automatically be extended for the period during which such determination
is pending, plus five business days.

  


 

  

Section 5.18 Reorganization Treatment. The parties intend that the First-Step
Merger and the Second-Step Merger qualify as a "reorganization" within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, and each of the parties will not, and
will not permit any of their respective Subsidiaries to, unless otherwise
required by applicable Law, take any action, or fail to take any action, that
would reasonably be expected to jeopardize the qualification of the First-Step
Merger or the Second-Step Merger as a "reorganization" within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code.

  


 

  

Section 5.19 Tax Representation Letters. Parent will use its reasonable best
efforts to deliver to Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP, counsel to
Parent ("Parent's Counsel"), and Cravath, Swaine and Moore LLP, counsel to the
Company ("Company's Counsel"), a tax representation letter dated as of the
Closing Date (and, if requested, dated as of the date the Registration
Statement will have been declared effective by the SEC) and signed by an
officer of Parent and Merger Sub, containing representations of Parent and
Merger Sub. The Company and Flagstone Bermuda will each use its reasonable
best efforts to deliver to Parent's Counsel and Company's Counsel tax
representation letters dated as of the Closing Date (and, if requested, dated
as of the date the Registration Statement will have been declared effective by
the SEC) and signed by an officer of the Company and Flagstone Bermuda,
containing representations of the Company and Flagstone Bermuda, in each case
as reasonably necessary or appropriate to enable Parent's Counsel to render
the opinion described in Section 6.02(e) and Company's Counsel to render the
opinion described in Section 6.03(e).

  


 

  

Section 5.20 Treatment of Company Credit Facilities. In the event that Parent
determines in its reasonable discretion that it is necessary or desirable to
obtain amendments to one or more of the Company Credit Facilities on or prior
to the Closing Date in order to, among other things, permit the consummation
of the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated hereby, then the
Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, use commercially
reasonable efforts to cooperate, and to cause its Representatives to
cooperate, with Parent in connection with the arrangement and consummation of
such amendments to the Company Credit Facilities; provided that (a) such
requested cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing
operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the Closing Date and
(b) the Company shall not be required to incur any liability under any such
amendments to the Company Credit Facilities prior to the Closing Date unless
contingent upon the occurrence of the Closing.

counsel may require and rely upon representations contained in tax
representation letters of Parent, the Company and others.

  


 

  

(f) Parent shall have received a copy of the Company Tax Opinion.

  


 

  

Section 6.03 Conditions to Obligations of the Company. The respective
obligations of (i) the Company and Flagstone Bermuda to effect the First-Step
Merger and (ii) the Intermediate Company to effect the Second-Step Merger, in
each case, are further subject to the satisfaction (or waiver, if permissible
under applicable Law) on or prior to the Closing Date of the following
conditions:

  


 

  

(a) Representations and Warranties. The representations and warranties of
Parent and Merger Sub (i) set forth in Section 4.07(d) shall be true and
correct as of the date of this Agreement, (ii) set forth in Section 4.02(a),
Section 4.02(b) and Section 4.11 shall be true and correct in all respects
(except for de minimus inaccuracies) as of the date of this Agreement and as
of the Closing Date with the same effect as though made as of the Closing Date
(except to the extent expressly made as of an earlier date, in which case as
of such date), and (iii) set forth in this Agreement, other than those
Sections specifically identified in clause (i) or (ii) of this Section
6.03(a), shall be true and correct (disregarding all qualifications or
limitations as to "materiality", "Parent Material Adverse Effect" and words of
similar import set forth therein) as of the date of this Agreement and as of
the Closing Date with the same effect as though made as of the Closing Date
(except to the extent expressly made as of an earlier date, in which case as
of such date), except, in the case of this clause (iii), where the failure to
be true and correct has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect. The
Company shall have received a certificate signed on behalf of Parent and
Merger Sub by an executive officer of Parent to such effect.

  


 

  

(b) Performance of Obligations of Parent and Merger Sub. Parent and Merger Sub
shall have performed or complied in all material respects with their
respective obligations required to be performed or complied with by them under
this Agreement at or prior to the First-Step Effective Time, and the Company

71  

  

 

 

 

  

  


 

  

(c) No Parent Material Adverse Effect. Since the date of this Agreement, there
shall not have been any effect, change, event or occurrence that has had or
would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Parent Material Adverse Effect.

  


 

  

(d) Parent Book Value. If (and only if) the Company has timely delivered a
Book Value Procedures Notice in accordance with Section 5.17, (i) Parent's
Measurement Date Book Value (as finally determined in accordance with Section
5.17) shall be equal to or greater than 50% of the Parent Year-End Book Value
Amount, and (ii) (A) the decline (if any), on a percentage basis, in Parent's
Measurement Date Book Value (as finally determined pursuant to Section 5.17)
from the Parent Year-End Book Value Amount shall not be more than 20
percentage points greater than (B) the decline (if any), on a percentage
basis, in the Company's Measurement Date Book Value (as finally determined
pursuant to Section 5.17) from the Company Year-End Book Value Amount (it
being understood that if the Company's Measurement Date Book Value (as finally
determined pursuant to Section 5.17) is greater than or equal to the Company
Year-End Book Value Amount, then the decline for purposes of this clause
(ii)(B) shall be deemed to be 0%).

  


 

  

(e) Opinion of Counsel. The Company shall have received an opinion of
Company's Counsel, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the
Company, based on facts, representations and assumptions set forth in such
opinion that are consistent with the state of facts existing at the Final
Effective Time, to the effect that (i) the First-Step Merger will be treated
for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code and each of the Company and Flagstone Bermuda will
be a party to such reorganization, (ii) the Second-Step Merger will be treated
for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code and each of Parent and Flagstone Bermuda will be a
party to such reorganization, and (iii) Parent will be treated, in respect of
any shareholder who will own after the Second-Step Merger less than five
percent of the issued and outstanding Parent Shares (as determined under
Treasury Regulation Section 1.367(a)-3(b)(1)(i)), as a corporation under
Section 367(a) of the Code (the "Company Tax Opinion"). In rendering such
opinion, the Company's counsel may require and rely upon representations
contained in tax representation letters of Parent, the Company and others.

  


 

  

(f) The Company shall have received a copy of the Parent Tax Opinion.

  


 

  

Section 6.04 Frustration of Closing Conditions.Neither the Company nor
Flagstone Bermuda may rely on the failure of any condition set forth in
Section 6.01 or Section 6.03 to be satisfied if such failure was primarily
caused by the failure of the Company or Flagstone Bermuda to perform in all
material respects its obligations under this Agreement, including pursuant to
Sections 5.02 and 5.03, or to use its reasonable best efforts to consummate
the Transactions as required by and subject to Section 5.04. Neither Parent
nor Merger Sub may rely on the failure of any condition set forth in Section
6.01 or Section 6.02 to be satisfied if such failure was primarily caused by
the failure of Parent or Merger Sub to perform in all material respects its
obligations under this Agreement or to use its reasonable best efforts to
consummate the Transactions as required by and subject to Section 5.04.

ARTICLE VII

  


 

  

Termination

  


 

  

Section 7.01 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated and the
Transactions abandoned at any time prior to the First-Step Effective Time,
whether before or after receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval (except as
otherwise expressly noted):

  


 

  

(a) by the mutual written consent of the Company and Parent duly authorized by
each of their respective Boards of Directors;

  


 

  

(b) by either of the Company or Parent:

  


 

  

(i) if the Mergers shall not have been consummated on or before March 31, 2013
(as such date may be extended pursuant to Section 5.17(e) or Section 8.08, the
"Walk-Away Date"); provided that the right to terminate this Agreement under
this Section 7.01(b)(i) shall not be available to any party if the failure of
such party to perform in all material respects its obligations under this
Agreement, including, in the case of the Company, pursuant to Sections 5.02
and 5.03, or to use its reasonable best efforts to consummate the Transactions
as required by and subject to Section 5.04, has been the primary cause of the
failure of the Mergers to be consummated on or before such date (it being
understood that Parent and Merger Sub shall be deemed a single party for
purposes of the foregoing proviso);

  


 

  

(ii) if any Restraint having the effect set forth in Section 6.01(c) shall be
in effect and shall have become final and nonappealable; provided that the
party seeking to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.01(b)(ii)
shall have performed in all material respects its obligations under this
Agreement and used its reasonable best efforts as required by and subject to
Section 5.04, to prevent the entry of and to remove such Restraint; or

  


 

  

(iii) if the Company Shareholder Approval shall not have been obtained at the
Company Shareholders Meeting duly convened therefor or at any adjournment,
reconvenement or postponement thereof at which the vote was taken;

  

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

73  

  

 

 

 

  

  


 

  

(c) by Parent:

  


 

  

(i) if the Company or Flagstone Bermuda shall have breached any of its
representations or warranties or failed to perform any of its covenants or
agreements (other than Section 5.02 or 5.03) set forth in this Agreement,
which breach or failure to perform (A) would give rise to the failure of a
condition set forth in Section 6.02(a) or 6.02(b) and (B) is incapable of
being cured prior to the Walk-Away Date, or if capable of being cured, shall
not have been cured within 30 calendar days following receipt by the Company
or Flagstone Bermuda of written notice of such breach or failure to perform
from Parent stating Parent's intention to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
this Section 7.01(c)(i) and the basis for such termination (or in any event
has not been cured by the Walk-Away Date); provided that Parent shall not have
the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.01(c)(i) if
Parent or Merger Sub is then in material breach of any of its representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements hereunder;

  


 

  

(ii) prior to receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval, if (A) the Board of
Directors of the Company shall have effected an Adverse Recommendation Change
or (B) there shall have occurred any willful and material breach of Section
5.02 or 5.03 by the Company, any Subsidiary of the Company or any
Representative of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company; or

  


 

  

(iii) if Parent is a Requesting Party and has complied with Section 5.17, and,
after final determination in accordance with Section 5.17, the condition set
forth in Section 6.02(d) is not satisfied;

  


 

  

(d) by the Company:

  


 

  

(i) if Parent or Merger Sub shall have breached any of its representations or
warranties or failed to perform any of its covenants or agreements set forth
in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (A) would give rise to
the failure of a condition set forth in Section 6.03(a) or 6.03(b) and (B) is
incapable of being cured prior to the Walk-Away Date, or if capable of being
cured, shall not have been cured within 30 calendar days following receipt by
Parent or Merger Sub of written notice of such breach or failure to perform
from the Company stating the Company's intention to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 7.01(d)(i) and the basis for such termination (or in
any event has not been cured by the Walk-Away Date); provided that the Company
shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section
7.01(d)(i) if the Company or Flagstone Bermuda is then in material breach of
any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements hereunder; or

  

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

74  

  

 

 

 

  

  


 

  

(ii) if the Company is a Requesting Party and has complied with Section 5.17,
and, after final determination in accordance with Section 5.17, the condition
set forth in Section 6.03(d) is not satisfied.

  


 

  

Section 7.02 Effect of Termination. In the event of the termination of this
Agreement as provided in Section 7.01, written notice thereof shall be given
to the other party or parties hereto, specifying the provision hereof pursuant
to which such termination is made, and this Agreement shall forthwith become
null and void (other than Sections 7.02 and 7.03, Article VIII and the
Confidentiality Agreements, all of which shall survive termination of this
Agreement), and there shall be no liability on the part of Parent, Merger Sub,
the Company or Flagstone Bermuda or their respective directors, officers and
Affiliates, except (a) as liability may exist pursuant to the sections
specified in the immediately preceding parenthetical that survive such
termination and (b) that no such termination shall relieve any party from
liability for any willful and material breach by such party of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement set forth in this Agreement or
fraud. For purposes of this Agreement, "willful and material breach" shall
mean a deliberate act or a deliberate failure to act, which act or failure to
act constitutes in and of itself a material breach of this Agreement,
regardless of whether such breach was the conscious object of the act or
failure to act.

  


 

  

Section 7.03 Termination Fee.

  


 

  

(a) In the event that:

  


 

  

(i) (A) a bona fide Takeover Proposal shall have been publicly made or
proposed or otherwise communicated to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
or any of their respective Representatives on or after the date of this
Agreement and prior to the Company Shareholders Meeting (or prior to the
termination of this Agreement if there has been no Company Shareholders
Meeting), (B) following the occurrence of an event described in the preceding
clause (A), this Agreement is terminated by the Company or Parent pursuant to
Section 7.01(b)(i) (prior to obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval) or
Section 7.01(b)(iii) and (C) within twelve months after the date on which this
Agreement is terminated, the Company enters into a definitive agreement with
respect to a Takeover Proposal or a Takeover Proposal is consummated (whether
or not such Takeover Proposal was the same Takeover Proposal referred to in
clause (A)); provided, that for purposes of clause (C) of this Section
7.03(a)(i), the references to "10%" in the definition of Takeover Proposal
shall be deemed to be references to "35%"; or

  


 

  

(ii) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 7.01(c)(ii);

  

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

75  

  

 

 

 

  

  


 

  

then, in any such event the Company shall pay the Company Termination Fee to
Parent or its designee by wire transfer of same-day funds (x) in the case of
Section 7.03(a)(ii), within two business days after such termination or (y) in
the case of Section 7.03(a)(i), concurrently upon the earlier of the entering
into or consummation of a Takeover Proposal; it being understood that in no
event shall the Company be required to pay an aggregate amount pursuant to
this Section 7.03(a) of greater than the Company Termination Fee. As used
herein, "Company Termination Fee" shall mean a cash amount equal to $24.16
million; provided, however, that if the Company makes the $6 million payment
provided for in Section 7.03(b) and the Company subsequently is required to
pay the Company Termination Fee to Parent pursuant to Section 7.03(a)(i), then
the Company shall pay Parent, concurrently upon the earlier of the entering
into or consummation of such Takeover Proposal, an amount equal to the Company
Termination Fee minus $6 million. In the event that Parent or its designee
shall receive full payment pursuant to this Section 7.03(a), together with any
reimbursement of applicable expenses pursuant to Section 7.03(c), the receipt
of the applicable Company Termination Fee and the expenses referred to in
Section 7.03(c) shall be the sole and exclusive remedy for any and all losses
or damages suffered or incurred by Parent, Merger Sub, any of their respective
Affiliates or any other Person in connection with this Agreement (and the
termination hereof), the Transactions (and the abandonment thereof) or any
matter forming the basis for such termination, and none of Parent, Merger Sub,
any of their respective Affiliates or any other Person shall be entitled to
bring or maintain any claim, action or proceeding against the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective former, current or future
officers, directors, partners, shareholders, managers, members or Affiliates
arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, any of the Transactions
or any matters forming the basis for such termination.

  


 

  

(b) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company or Parent
pursuant to Section 7.01(b)(iii) and Parent is not then in willful and
material breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements hereunder then the Company shall pay to Parent or its designee an
amount equal to $6 million by wire transfer of same-day funds, within two
business days after such termination.

  


 

  

(c) Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that the agreements contained in
this Section 7.03 are an integral part of the Transactions, and that without
these agreements, the other parties hereto would not enter into this
Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails to timely pay any amount due
pursuant to this Section 7.03, and, in order to obtain the payment, Parent
commences an Action which results in a judgment against the Company for the
payment set forth in this Section 7.03, the Company shall pay Parent for its
reasonable and documented costs and expenses (including reasonable and
documented attorneys' fees) in connection with such Action, together with
interest on such amount at the prime rate as published in The Wall Street
Journal in effect on the date such payment was required to be made through the
date such payment was actually received.

ARTICLE VIII

  


 

  

Miscellaneous

  


 

  

Section 8.01 No Survival of Representations and Warranties. This Article VIII
and the agreements of the Company, Flagstone Bermuda, Parent and Merger Sub
contained in Article II and Section 5.08 shall survive the Final Effective
Time. No other representations, warranties, covenants or agreements in this
Agreement shall survive the Final Effective Time.

  


 

  

Section 8.02 Amendment or Supplement. At any time prior to the First-Step
Effective Time, this Agreement may be amended or supplemented in any and all
respects, whether before or after receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval,
by written agreement of the parties hereto, by action taken by their
respective Boards of Directors; provided, however, that following approval of
the First-Step Merger and this Agreement by the shareholders of the Company,
there shall be no amendment or change to the provisions hereof which by Law
would require further approval by the shareholders of the Company without such
approval.

  


 

  

Section 8.03 Extension of Time, Waiver, Etc. At any time prior to the First-
Step Effective Time, Parent and the Company may, subject to applicable Law,
(a) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other
party, (b) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or
acts of the other party or (c) subject to the requirements of applicable Law,
waive compliance by the other party with any of the agreements contained
herein or, except as otherwise provided herein, waive any of such party's
conditions (it being understood that Parent and Merger Sub, on the one hand,
and the Company and Flagstone Bermuda, on the other hand, each shall be deemed
a single party for purposes of the foregoing). Notwithstanding the foregoing,
no failure or delay by the Company, Flagstone Bermuda, Parent or Merger Sub in
exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any
single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise
thereof or the exercise of any other right hereunder. Any waiver shall be
effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which
given, and shall not constitute a waiver to any subsequent or other exercise
of any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder. Any agreement on the part
of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set
forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party.

  


 

  

Section 8.04 Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by
operation of Law or otherwise, by any of the parties hereto without the prior
written consent of the other parties hereto. No assignment by any party shall
relieve such party of any of its obligations hereunder. Subject to the
immediately preceding two sentences, this Agreement shall be binding upon,
inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns. Any purported assignment not
permitted under this Section 8.04 shall be null and void.

  

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

77  

  

 

 

 

  

  


 

  

Section 8.05 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts (including by facsimile or electronic mail), each of which shall
be deemed to be an original but all of which taken together shall constitute
one and the same agreement, and shall become effective when one or more
counterparts have been signed by each of the parties hereto and delivered to
the other parties hereto.

  


 

  

Section 8.06 Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement,
including the Company Disclosure Schedule and the Parent Disclosure Schedule,
together with the Voting Agreements, Confidentiality Agreements, the First-
Step Statutory Merger Agreement and the Second-Step Statutory Merger
Agreement, (a) constitute the entire agreement, and supersede all other prior
agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties and
their Affiliates, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof
and thereof and (b) except for: (i) if the Final Effective Time occurs, (A)
the right of the holders of Intermediate Company Shares (as holders of Company
Shares immediately prior to the First-Step Effective Time) to receive the
Merger Consideration payable in accordance with Article II and (B) the right
of holders of Share Units and Pre-Closing Vested PSUs to receive the Share
Unit Consideration payable in accordance with Article II and (ii) the
provisions set forth in Section 5.08 of this Agreement, are not intended to
and shall not confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto any rights
or remedies hereunder.

  


 

  

Section 8.07 Governing Law; Jurisdiction.

  


 

  

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the
laws of the State of New York applicable to contracts executed in and to be
performed entirely within that State, regardless of the laws that might
otherwise govern under any applicable conflict of laws principles, except to
the extent the provisions of the laws of Luxembourg or Bermuda are mandatorily
applicable to the Mergers.

  


 

  

(b) All actions and proceedings arising out of or relating to the
interpretation and enforcement of the provisions of this Agreement and in
respect of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (except to the
extent any such proceeding mandatorily must be brought in Luxembourg or
Bermuda) shall be heard and determined in the United States District Court for
the Southern District of New York and any federal appellate court therefrom
(or, if United States federal jurisdiction is unavailable over a particular
matter, the Supreme Court of the State of New York, New York County or any
appellate court therefrom) and the parties hereto hereby irrevocably submit to
the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of such courts in any such action or
proceeding and irrevocably waive the defense of an inconvenient forum or lack
of jurisdiction to the maintenance of any such action or proceeding. Each
party hereto irrevocably consents to and grants any such court jurisdiction
over the Person of such party and, to the extent legally effective, over the
subject matter of such dispute and proceeding. The consents to jurisdiction
and venue set forth in this Section 8.07(b) shall not constitute general
consents to service of process in the State of New York and shall have no
effect for any purpose except as provided in this paragraph and shall not be
deemed to confer rights on any Person other than the parties hereto. Each
party hereto agrees that service of process upon such party in any action or
proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be effective if
notice is given by overnight courier at the address set forth in Section 8.10
of this Agreement. The parties hereto agree that a final judgment in any such
action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other
jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by
applicable Law; provided, however, that nothing in the foregoing shall
restrict any party's rights to seek any post-judgment relief regarding, or any
appeal from, a final trial court judgment.

  

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

78  

  

 

 

 

  

  


 

  

Section 8.08 Specific Enforcement. The parties hereto agree that irreparable
damage for which monetary relief, even if available, would not be an adequate
remedy, would occur in the event that any provision of this Agreement is not
performed in accordance with its specific terms or is otherwise breached,
including if the parties hereto fail to take any action required of them
hereunder to consummate this Agreement. The parties acknowledge and agree that
(a) the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions, specific
performance or other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement
and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in the courts
described in Section 8.07(b) without proof of damages or otherwise, this being
in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled under this
Agreement and (b) the right of specific enforcement is an integral part of the
Transactions and without that right, neither the Company nor Parent would have
entered into this Agreement. The parties hereto agree not to assert that a
remedy of specific enforcement is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to Law or
inequitable for any reason, and not to assert that a remedy of monetary
damages would provide an adequate remedy or that the parties otherwise have an
adequate remedy at law. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that any
party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement in accordance with this Section 8.08 shall not be required to
provide any bond or other security in connection with any such order or
injunction. If, prior to the Walk-Away Date, any party hereto brings any
action, in each case, in accordance with Section 8.07, to enforce specifically
the performance of the terms and provisions hereof by any other party, the
Walk-Away Date shall automatically be extended until a decision is issued on
such party's request for a preliminary injunction or temporary restraining
order (or equivalent under applicable Law); provided that the parties hereto
shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to cause the hearing for
such request to be held as soon as reasonably practicable.

  


 

  

Section 8.09 WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY
CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE
COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY
RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES
AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER
PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD
NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (B) IT
UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVER, (C) IT MAKES
SUCH WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND (D) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS
AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVER AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS
SECTION 8.09.

Section 8.14 Interpretation.

  


 

  

(a) When a reference is made in this Agreement to an Article, a Section,
Exhibit or Schedule, such reference shall be to an Article of, a Section of,
or an Exhibit or Schedule to, this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The
table of contents and headings contained in this Agreement are for reference
purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of
this Agreement. Whenever the words "include", "includes" or "including" are
used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words
"without limitation". The words "hereof", "herein" and "hereunder" and words
of similar import when used in this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as
a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement. The terms "or",
"any" and "either" are not exclusive. The word "extent" in the phrase "to the
extent" shall mean the degree to which a subject or other thing extends, and
such phrase shall not mean simply "if". The word "will" shall be construed to
have the same meaning and effect as the word "shall". The phrase "ordinary
course of business" shall be construed to be followed by the phrase
"consistent with past practice" regardless of whether such phrase is
expressed. All terms defined in this Agreement shall have the defined meanings
when used in any document made or delivered pursuant hereto unless otherwise
defined therein. The definitions contained in this Agreement are applicable to
the singular as well as the plural forms of such terms and to the masculine as
well as to the feminine and neuter genders of such term. Any agreement,
instrument or statute defined or referred to herein or in any agreement or
instrument that is referred to herein means such agreement, instrument or
statute as from time to time amended, modified or supplemented, including (in
the case of agreements or instruments) by waiver or consent and (in the case
of statutes) by succession of comparable successor statutes and references to
all attachments thereto and instruments incorporated therein. Unless otherwise
specifically indicated, all references to "dollars" or "$" shall refer to the
lawful money of the United States. References to a Person are also to its
permitted assigns and successors. Each representation, warranty, covenant,
agreement and condition contained in this Agreement shall have independent
significance.

  


 

  

(b) The parties hereto have participated jointly in the negotiation and
drafting of this Agreement and, in the event an ambiguity or question of
intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as jointly
drafted by the parties hereto and no presumption or burden of proof shall
arise favoring or disfavoring any party hereto by virtue of the authorship of
any provision of this Agreement.

accordance with the Luxembourg Company Law and the Companies Act, the Company
and Flagstone Bermuda shall, by means of a merger by absorption, merge
pursuant to article 259 of the Luxembourg Company Law and section 104A of the
Companies Act with Flagstone Bermuda surviving as the Intermediate Company, a
Bermuda exempted company, and, as a result, the Company shall cease to exist.
As a result of the First-Step Merger, (a) the Company will be dissolved
without liquidation and all assets and liabilities of the Company shall be
transferred to the Intermediate Company and (b) the shareholders of the
Company shall receive shares in the Intermediate Company.

   
    
  

2.2

  |  

The First-Step Merger shall be conditional on:

   
    
  

  |  

2.2.1

  |  

the approval of this Agreement and the First-Step Merger by the shareholders
of the Company and Flagstone Bermuda;

   
    
  

  |  

2.2.2

  |  

as set out in the Agreement and Plan of Merger, the timely satisfaction (or,
if capable of waiver, waiver in accordance with the terms of the Agreement and
Plan of Merger and applicable law) of all of the merger conditions applicable
to the First-Step Merger; and

   
    
   | 2.2.3 |  

the issuance of a certificate of merger with respect to the First-Step Merger
(the "Certificate of First-Step Merger") by the Bermuda Registrar of Companies
(the "Registrar").

   
  

  |  

   
  

2.3

  |  

The First-Step Merger shall become effective at the time and date shown on the
Certificate of First-Step Merger issued by the Registrar (such time, the
"First-Step Effective Time").

   
   |  |  |   
  

2.4

  |  

At the First-Step Effective Time:

   
 

  

 

  

  

  

 

 

  

 

4  

  

 

 

  

  

  

 

  

    

  |  

2.4.1

  |  

All of the assets and liabilities of the Company and Flagstone Bermuda shall
become the assets and liabilities of the Intermediate Company. The Company
shall be dissolved without liquidation and shall cease to exist pursuant to
the laws of Luxembourg.

   
---|---|--- 
   |  |  |   
  

  |  

2.4.2

  |  

Each issued and outstanding share, par value $0.01 per share, of Flagstone

shall be delivered or deliverable in exchange therefor.

   
   |  |  |   
  

  |  

2.4.3

  |  

All shares, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (each a "Company Share")

consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

   
   |  |  |   
   |  

2.4.4

  |  

Subject to section 2.4.3, each Company Share that is issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the First-Step Effective Time shall be converted
automatically into and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable
common share, of par value $0.01 per share, of the Intermediate Company (each
an "Intermediate Company Share"). As of the First-Step Effective Time, all
such Company Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
canceled and shall cease to exist. Each certificate previously evidencing any
Company Shares (each, a "Certificate") or, if any, uncertificated Company
Shares represented by book-entry immediately prior to the First-Step Effective
Time shall thereafter represent, without the requirement of any exchange
thereof, that number of Intermediate Company Shares into which such Company
Shares represented by such Certificate or book-entry, as applicable, have been
converted pursuant to this section 2.4.4 and the right to receive dividends
and other distributions in accordance with section 2.4.5, in each case without
interest.

   
   |  |  |   
  

  |  

2.4.5

  |  

The Intermediate Company Shares resulting from the conversion of the Company
Shares pursuant to section 2.4.4 shall be deemed to have been issued in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Company Shares previously
outstanding, subject, however, to the Intermediate Company's obligation, if
applicable, to pay regular quarterly cash dividends, if any, not to exceed
$0.04 per Company Share, with a record date prior to the First-Step Effective
Time that may have been declared by the Company on Company Shares not in
violation of the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger or prior to the
date of the Agreement and Plan of Merger and which remain unpaid at the First-
Step Effective Time. At the First-Step Effective Time, the share transfer
books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the share transfer books of the Intermediate
Company of the Company Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the
First-Step Effective Time.

EFFECT OF THE FIRST-STEP MERGER FOR EMPLOYEES

RIGHTS OF CREDITORS OF THE MERGING COMPANIES

   
   |  |  |   
  

10.1

  |  

Creditors of the Company may exercise their rights in accordance with article
268 of the Luxembourg Company Law. This article provides that within two
months of the publication in the Luxembourg government gazette (the Memorial C
Recueil des Societes et Associations) of the notarial deed recording the
resolutions passed at the Extraordinary General Meeting approving this
Agreement and the First-Step Merger, creditors of the merging companies, whose
claims predate the date of such publication, may apply to the chamber of the
district court in Luxembourg (Tribunal d'Arrondissement de et a Luxembourg)
dealing with commercial matters and sitting as in urgent matters to obtain
adequate security for matured or unmatured debts whether they can readily
demonstrate that due to the First-Step Merger the satisfaction of their claims
is at stake and that no adequate security has been obtained from the debtor
company. Such request may be rejected by the court if it finds that the
creditors' rights are already adequately protected or on account of the
financial position of the Company after the First-Step Merger. The merging
companies may cause the application to be refused by paying the creditor, even
if the debt has not yet matured. If the security is not provided within the
time limit prescribed, the debt shall immediately fall due.

   
   |  |  |   
  

10.2

  |  

For further information, creditors of the Company may contact its registered
office where more detailed information may be obtained free of charge.
