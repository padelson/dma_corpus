 ** _PURCHASE AGREEMENT_**

  

This PURCHASE AGREEMENT (this " _Agreement_ "), dated as of October 20, 2015
(the " _Agreement Date_ "), is by and among SCS Secure Holdings LLC, a
Delaware limited liability company (the " _Company_ "), MCSC LLC (the "
_Seller_ "), and Benchmark Electronics, Inc., a Texas corporation ("
_Purchaser_ ").  Certain capitalized terms set forth in this Agreement shall
have the respective meanings ascribed thereto in _Section 9.1_ hereof.

  

WHEREAS, the Seller owns all of the membership interests of the Company
(collectively, the " _Membership Interests_ ");

  

WHEREAS, the Seller desires to sell, and Purchaser desires to purchase, the
Membership Interests;

  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements set forth in this Agreement and for
other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which
are hereby acknowledged, the Seller, the Company and Purchaser, intending to
be legally bound, agree as follows:

  

 **ARTICLE I** ** 
 PURCHASE AND SALE**

  

1.1   _Purchase and Sale_.  Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, at the Closing, the Seller shall sell, transfer, convey, assign
and deliver to Purchaser, and Purchaser shall purchase, acquire and accept
from the Seller, all right, title and interest of the Seller in and to the
Membership Interests, free and clear of all Liens (other than Liens created
by or through the Purchaser, its financing sources, or any of their
respective Affiliates).

  

1.2 _Aggregate Purchase Price; Cash Consideration_.  For purposes of this
Agreement, the term " _Cash Consideration_ " means an amount equal to the
result of (i) Two Hundred Thirty Million Dollars ($230,000,000) (" _Aggregate
Purchase Price_ "), (ii) minus the Estimated Closing Debt, (iii) plus the
Estimated Closing Cash, (iv) minus the amount (if any) by which the Net
Working Capital Lower Target exceeds the Estimated Closing Net Working
Capital or plus the amount (if any) by which the Estimated Closing Net
Working Capital exceeds the Net Working Capital Upper Target (for clarity, if
the Estimated Closing Net Working Capital is within the Net Working Capital
Collar Range, then there shall be no adjustment to the Cash Consideration
pursuant to this _subclause (iv)_ ), (v) minus the Estimated Closing

" _Net Working Capital Upper Target_ " shall mean an amount equal to Forty
Million Eight Hundred One Thousand Nine Hundred Thirty Eight Dollars
($40,801,938), and " _Net Working Capital Lower Target_ " shall mean an

Hundred Thirty Eight Dollars ($38,801,938). The Cash Consideration shall be

1.3 _Payment of Cash Consideration_.  At the Closing, in consideration of
the sale, assignment, transfer and delivery of the Membership Interests to
Purchaser, Purchaser shall pay the Cash Consideration as follows:

  

(a)  Purchaser shall pay to Bank of America National Association (the "
_Escrow Agent_ ") the Escrow Amount, to be held in an account (the " _Escrow
Account_ ") established pursuant to the terms of an escrow agreement by and
among Purchaser, Seller and the Escrow Agent in substantially the form
attached hereto as _Exhibit 1_ (the " _Escrow Agreement_ "); and

  

(b) After paying the Escrow Amount out of the Cash Consideration pursuant to
_clause (a)_ , Purchaser shall pay to the Seller the remainder of the Cash
Consideration (such net remainder, the " _Closing Cash Payment_ ").

  

1.4   _Payment of Certain Company Indebtedness and Transaction Expenses_. At
least two (2) days prior to the Closing, the Company shall cause each of the
lenders or other payees under the Debt Arrangements to have delivered to
Purchaser customary payoff letters in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to Purchaser and the Company (each, a " _Debt Payoff Letter_ ")
stating that, upon payment of the amount provided in the applicable Debt
Payoff Letter (each, a " _Debt Payoff Amount_ "), the Acquired Companies will
have satisfied all obligations of such Acquired Companies to such payee with
respect to such Debt Arrangements (except for customary contingent
obligations for which no claim has been made) including the payment of all
Indebtedness contemplated by or other amounts then owing under such Debt
Arrangements. At the Closing, in addition to paying the Cash Consideration
pursuant to _Section 1.3_ , the Purchaser shall also pay or cause to be paid
(i) the Debt Payoff Amounts as provided in the Debt Payoff Letters and (ii)
the Estimated Closing Transaction Expenses in accordance with wire

employees as soon as practicable following the Closing.

  

1.5   _Release of Escrow Amount_.  As soon as reasonably practicable (but in
any event within three (3) Business Days) following the twelve (12)-month
anniversary of the Closing (such anniversary, the " _Escrow Release Date_ "),
the Purchaser shall direct the Escrow Agent to release to the Seller all of
the remaining Escrow Amount, if any, in excess (such excess amount as of the
Escrow Release Date, the " _Retained Amount_ ") of the aggregate maximum
amount of the losses then being claimed by the Purchaser from all Claims made
pursuant to _Section 7.1(f)_ that are unresolved as of the Escrow Release
Date (such unresolved claims, the " _Open Claims_ "). The Retained Amount
instead shall be retained in the Escrow Account, and, as soon as reasonably
practicable (but in any event within three (3) Business Days) following
resolution of each Open Claim (it being understood that after resolution of
an Open Claim, then such Claim shall no longer be an Open Claim), Purchaser
and the Seller shall direct the Escrow Agent to release to the Seller the
remaining Escrow Amount, if any, in excess of the aggregate maximum amount of
the losses then being claimed by the Purchaser from all then-existing Open
Claims.

(a) No later than two (2) Business Days prior to the anticipated Closing
Date, the Company shall prepare and deliver to Purchaser:

  

(i) a written estimate of the Net Working Capital as of the Effective Time
(but without giving effect to the Closing) (the " _Estimated Closing Net
Working Capital_ "), prepared in good faith and in accordance with _Schedule
1_ ;

  

(ii) a written estimate of the Closing Debt (the " _Estimated Closing Debt_
"), prepared in good faith and in accordance with GAAP, and to the extent
consistent with GAAP, in accordance with the Balance Sheet;

  

(iii) a written estimate of the Closing Cash (the " _Estimated Closing Cash_
"), prepared in good faith and in accordance with GAAP, and to the extent
consistent with GAAP, in accordance with the Balance Sheet; and

  

(iv)  a written estimate of the Closing Transaction Expenses (the "
_Estimated Closing Transaction Expenses_ "), prepared in good faith.

  

The statements of the Estimated Closing Net Working Capital, the Estimated
Closing Debt, the Estimated Closing Cash and the Estimated Closing
Transaction Expenses are referred to herein collectively as the " _Pre-
Closing Statements_."  The Pre-Closing Statements shall be accompanied by (or
include) a certification executed by a senior financial officer of the
Company to the effect that the Pre-Closing Statements have been prepared in
good faith in accordance with this  _Section 1.6_.

  

(b) As soon as practicable, but in any event not more than sixty (60) days
after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall prepare and deliver to the Seller:

  

(i)  a statement of the Net Working Capital as of the Effective Time (but
without giving effect to the Closing) (the " _Closing Net Working Capital_
"), prepared in accordance with _Schedule 1_ ;

  

(ii)  a statement of the Closing Debt, prepared in accordance with GAAP, and
to the extent consistent with GAAP, in accordance with the Balance Sheet;

  

(iii) a statement of the Closing Cash, prepared in accordance with GAAP, and

(iv)  a statement of the Closing Transaction Expenses.

  

The statements of the Closing Net Working Capital, the Closing Debt, the
Closing Cash and the Closing Transaction Expenses are referred to herein
collectively as the " _Closing Statements_." The Closing Statements shall
be accompanied by (or include) a certification executed by a senior
financial officer of Purchaser to the effect that the Closing Statements have
been prepared in good faith in accordance with this _Section 1.6_. All costs
and expenses incurred

 

   

-3-    



   

 

by Purchaser in connection with the preparation and delivery of the
Closing Statements shall be borne by Purchaser.

  

(c)  The Seller may dispute any amounts reflected on a Closing Statement;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that the Seller shall notify Purchaser in writing
(the " _Dispute Notice_ ") of each disputed item, specifying the amount
thereof in dispute and setting forth, in reasonable detail, the basis for
such dispute, within sixty (60) days of the Seller's receipt of the Closing
Statements (the " _Review Period_ ").  If the Seller does not deliver a
Dispute Notice within the Review Period, the Closing Statements delivered by
Purchaser to the Seller shall be deemed to be final, conclusive and binding
on the parties. In the event the Seller delivers to Purchaser a Dispute
Notice within the Review Period, Purchaser and the Seller shall attempt to
reconcile their differences, and any resolution by them as to any disputed
amounts shall be final, binding and conclusive. If Purchaser and the Seller
are unable to reach a resolution with such effect within sixty (60) days of
the receipt by Purchaser of the Dispute Notice, on the written demand of
Purchaser or the Seller, the items remaining in dispute shall be submitted
within fifteen (15) days for resolution to a nationally-recognized public
accounting firm mutually agreed upon by the Seller and the Purchaser (and, if
they are unable to agree within such 15-day period, then the accounting firm
that the Purchaser selected and the accounting firm that the Seller selected
shall mutually select a different nationally recognized public accounting
firm that does not then represent and has not in the prior three years
represented Purchaser or Seller or their respective Affiliates) (the "
_Accounting Expert_ ") who shall resolve any such disputes. The Accounting
Expert shall act as an expert and not as an arbitrator, and it is the intent
of the parties that the process set forth in this _clause (c)_ and the
activities of the Accounting Expert in connection herewith are not intended
to be and, in fact, are not arbitration and that no formal arbitration rules
shall be followed (including rules with respect to procedures and discovery).
The scope of the Accounting Expert's engagement shall be limited to resolving
the disputed items in accordance with, and by application of the terms
(including the applicable definitions) of, this Agreement, and the Accounting
Expert shall have no authority over any other disagreement (including
questions of Law, interpretation of contract, and fraud). Within sixty (60)
days after appointment, the Accounting Expert shall make a final written
determination upon such remaining disputed items, and such determination
shall be final, binding and conclusive on the parties hereto; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that the final written determination of the Accounting
Expert shall not be outside the range of disputed amounts for each item in
dispute, as each such range existed immediately prior to the submission of
each such disputed item to the Accounting Expert. All fees and expenses of
the Accounting Expert in resolving the dispute shall be allocated
between Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Seller, on the other hand, such
that the amount paid by the Seller bears the same proportion that the
aggregate dollar amount unsuccessfully disputed by the Seller bears to the
total dollar amount of the disputed items that were submitted for resolution
to the Accounting Expert, and Purchaser shall pay the balance. For purposes
of illustration only, if Closing Cash is disputed to be $1,000 by Seller and
$900 by Purchaser and is determined by the Accounting Expert to be $960, then
Seller would bear 40% of the fees and expenses of the Accounting Expert
because the amount disputed was $100 and the amount unsuccessfully disputed
by Seller was $40. The Accounting Expert shall also determine whether any
notices required to be given pursuant to this _Section 1.6_ have been timely
given. Any time period contained herein may be extended by mutual agreement
of the parties. Any amount payable following resolution of a matter specified
in a Dispute Notice shall be paid within five (5) Business Days following the
resolution thereof pursuant to _clause (e)_  below.

(d)  Subject to _Section 1.6(c)_ and after the final determination of
the Closing Net Working Capital, the Closing Debt, the Closing Cash and the
Closing Transaction Expenses in accordance therewith, the Seller and
Purchaser agree that the Cash Consideration shall be adjusted as set forth
below:

  

(i) The adjustment to the Cash Consideration computed in _Section 1.2(iv)_
shall be recomputed using the Closing Net Working Capital as finally
determined pursuant to _Section 1.6(c)_ in lieu of the Estimated Closing Net
Working Capital, and (A) if such recomputed adjustment amount is greater than
the adjustment amount originally computed at Closing in _Section 1.2(iv)_ ,
then the Cash Consideration shall be increased by such excess or (B) if such
recomputed adjustment amount is less than the adjustment amount originally
computed at Closing in _Section 1.2(iv)_ , then the Cash Consideration shall
be decreased by such deficit;

  

(ii)  if the Closing Debt as finally determined pursuant to _Section 1.6(c)_
is more than the Estimated Closing Debt, the Cash Consideration shall be
reduced by the difference between the Closing Debt and the Estimated Closing
Debt;

  

(iii)  if the Closing Debt as finally determined pursuant to _Section 1.6(c)_
is less than the Estimated Closing Debt, the Cash Consideration shall be
increased by the difference between the Estimated Closing Debt and the
Closing Debt;

  

(iv)  if the Closing Cash as finally determined pursuant to _Section 1.6(c)_
is less than the Estimated Closing Cash, the Cash Consideration shall be
reduced by the difference between the Closing Cash and the Estimated Closing
Cash;

  

(v)  if the Closing Cash as finally determined pursuant to _Section 1.6(c)_
is more than the Estimated Closing Cash, the Cash Consideration shall be
increased by the difference between the Closing Cash and the Estimated
Closing Cash;

  

(vi)  if the Closing Transaction Expenses as finally determined pursuant to
_Section 1.6(c)_ are more than the Estimated Closing Transaction Expenses,
the Cash Consideration shall be reduced by the difference between the
Closing Transaction Expenses and the Estimated Closing Transaction Expenses;
and

  

(vii)  if the Closing Transaction Expenses as finally determined pursuant to
_Section 1.6(c)_ are less than the Estimated Closing Transaction Expenses,
the Cash Consideration shall be increased by the difference between the
Closing Transaction Expenses and the Estimated Closing Transaction Expenses.

  

(e) As used herein, " _Final Cash Consideration_ " shall mean the Cash
Consideration, as adjusted pursuant to this _Section 1.6_.

  

(i)  If the Final Cash Consideration is greater than the Cash
Consideration estimated at Closing, then Purchaser shall pay to the Seller an
amount equal to such excess.

  

(ii)  If the Final Cash Consideration is less than the Cash Consideration
estimated at Closing, then the Seller shall pay to Purchaser an amount equal
to such deficiency.

   

   

-5-    



   

 

(f) From the Closing until the determination of Final Cash Consideration
pursuant to this _Section 1.6_ , Purchaser shall provide Seller and its
Representatives with reasonable access, during normal business hours and
without disruption to its day-to-day business, to its and the Acquired
Companies' books and records relevant to a determination of the Closing Net
Working Capital, the Closing Debt, the Closing Cash and the Closing
Transaction Expenses, including any Tax Returns, financial statements, and
other related documents.  In addition, Purchaser shall, upon the Seller's
request, provide the Seller and its Representatives with reasonable access
during normal business hours to personnel of Purchaser and the Acquired
Companies and their Representatives involved in the preparation of the
Closing Statements or with knowledge of the information contained therein or
with knowledge of the Closing Net Working Capital, the Closing Debt, the
Closing Cash or the Closing Transaction Expenses.

  

1.7   _Closing_.  The Seller shall as promptly as practicable notify
Purchaser, and Purchaser shall as promptly as practicable notify the Seller,

Seller and Purchaser, respectively, to complete the Transactions have been

their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the
fulfillment or waiver thereof at the Closing), or at such other time, date
and place, or by remote communication, as the Seller and Purchaser may agree
in writing. The date on which the Closing occurs is referred to herein as the
" _Closing Date_." The Closing shall be deemed to be effective at 12:01 a.m.
Pacific Time on the Closing Date (the " _Effective Time_ ") for accounting,
working capital, corporate and all other purposes other than Tax, for which
the effective time of the Closing shall be 11:59 p.m. Pacific Time on the

 OF THE COMPANY**

  

The Company represents and warrants to Purchaser, subject to the exceptions

Export Administration Regulations and the ITAR), the NISPOM, and U.S.
economic sanctions laws and regulations (including regulations administered
by the Office of Foreign Assets Control set forth in 31 CFR Part 500). No
Acquired Company has, since January 1, 2013, received any written

any applicable Law that has not been resolved. Each of the Acquired Companies

unaudited Financial Statements are subject to year-end audit adjustments and
do not include footnotes, and present fairly in all material respects
the financial position and results of operations of the Acquired Companies as
of and for the periods ended on such dates. The Financial Statements

which the Seller is liable under this Agreement or otherwise, at least thirty
(30) days prior to the due date for the filing of any such Tax Return (taking
into account any valid extensions of time to file), Purchaser shall deliver
to the Seller a copy of such Tax Return, accompanied by an allocation
between the Seller and Purchaser of Taxes shown to be due on such Tax Return,
for the Seller's review and comment. Each such Tax Return and allocation
prepared in accordance with this _Section 5.6(b)(ii)_ shall be final and
binding on the Seller, unless, within fifteen (15) days after the date of
receipt by the Seller of such Tax Return and allocation (as applicable), the
Seller delivers to Purchaser a written request for changes to such Tax Return
and/or allocation.

 

   

-32-    



   

 

If the Seller delivers such a request, then the Seller and Purchaser shall
undertake in good faith to resolve the issues raised in such request in
a manner consistent with the standard set forth in the second sentence of
this _Section 5.6(b)(ii)_. If the Seller and Purchaser are unable to resolve
any issue by the earlier of (A) ten (10) days after the date of receipt
by Purchaser of the request for changes or (B) ten (10) days prior to the due
date (including any extension thereof) for filing of the Tax Return in
question, then the Seller and Purchaser shall jointly engage the Accounting
Expert (in the manner set forth in _Section 1.6(c)_ ) to resolve such
dispute, and the decision of such Accounting Expert shall be final. If the
Accounting Expert is unable to resolve any such dispute prior to the due date
for such Tax Return, such Tax Return shall be timely filed as prepared by the
Purchaser subject to amendment, if necessary to reflect the resolution by the
Accounting Expert. The Seller shall cooperate and provide any assistance
reasonably requested to allow Purchaser to prepare, or cause to be prepared,
and file, or cause to be filed, such Tax Returns.

  

(iii) Two (2) days prior to the filing of any Tax Return described in clause
(i) or (ii) above, the Seller shall pay to the Purchaser or directly to the
relevant Governmental Authority (A) in the case of any Tax Return for a Pre-
Closing Tax Period, the amount shown as due and owing on any such Tax Return
by the relevant Acquired Company, and (B) in the case of a Tax Return for a
Straddle Period, the amount of Taxes allocated to the portion of the Straddle
Period ending on the Closing Date pursuant to subparagraph (c) below, in each
case except to the extent such Taxes (x) were accurately accrued or reserved
on the books and records of the Acquired Companies as of the Closing Date or
(y) were previously paid or included in the calculation of Closing Net
Working Capital or the Cash Consideration.

  



  

(iv)  The Income Tax Returns referred to above shall include the following
positions: (A) all Deductions shall be allocated to and reported in the Pre-
Closing Tax Period or portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing
Date (each a " _Pre-Closing Period_ ") to the extent permitted by applicable
Tax law, (B) at Seller's election, to make (and cause the Acquired Companies
to make) the election under Revenue Procedure 2011-29 to apply the seventy
percent (70%) safe-harbor to any "success based fee" as defined in Treasury
Regulation Section 1.263(a)-5(f) incurred in connection with the
Transactions, (C) not to apply overpayments for any year to any other year's
Tax liability, and (D) not to waive the ability to carry back losses.

  

(c) _Straddle Period Taxes_.  For purposes of this Agreement, in the case of
a Straddle Period, Taxes of an Acquired Company shall be allocated to the
portion of the period ending on Closing Date as follows: (i) all Income
Taxes, sales Taxes, employment Taxes and other Taxes that are readily
apportionable based on an actual or deemed closing of the books shall be
allocated based on the amount that would be payable if the taxable year ended
on and included the Closing Date, and (ii) all property and other Taxes that
are imposed on a periodic basis and not described in _clause (i)_ shall be
allocated based on the amount of such Tax for the entire period multiplied by
a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the portion of a
period ending on and including the Closing Date and the denominator of which
is the number of days in the entire period; _provided_ , _however_ , that any
reassessments or revaluations of property resulting from Purchaser's purchase
of the Membership Interests shall not be taken into account in determining
any allocation pursuant to _clause (ii)_. For purposes of

 

   

-33-    



   

 

this Agreement, any Tax refunds with respect to Straddle Periods shall be
allocable based on the manner in which the corresponding Taxes are allocable
pursuant to this _Section 5.6(c)_.

  

(d)   _Tax Refunds_.

  

(i) All Tax refunds or credits (in lieu of a refund) of Taxes (including any
interest paid thereon) of any of the Acquired Companies for any Pre-Closing
Tax Period or the portion of any Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date
that are received or actually utilized (in the form of a reduction of cash
Taxes actually payable) by Purchaser or the Acquired Companies after the
Closing (a " _Pre-Closing Tax Refund_ ") shall be for the account of the
Seller, and Purchaser shall pay to the Seller the amount of any Pre-Closing
Tax Refund (net of any reasonable out of pocket costs, expenses and Taxes
incurred or imposed on Purchaser, its Affiliates or any Acquired Company in
obtaining, receiving or accruing such Pre-Closing Tax Refund) within ten (10)
Business Days after receipt of any such Pre-Closing Tax Refund (or in the
case of a credit, within ten (10) Business Days of the filing of a Tax
Return actually utilizing such credit). Purchaser and its Affiliates shall,
if the Seller so requests (and at Seller's cost), file a claim for and use
reasonable efforts to obtain any Pre-Closing Tax Refund; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Purchaser, its Affiliates and the Acquired Companies shall
not be required to take any action that could result in or otherwise cause
such Person to incur any material unreimbursed costs and expense. This
_Section 5.6(d)_ shall not apply to any Pre-Closing Tax Refund that was taken
into account in Closing Net Working Capital or that results from the
carryback of a net operating loss or other Tax attribute incurred in a Post-
Closing Tax Period or the portion of any Straddle Period beginning on the day
following the Closing Date.

  

(ii) If any Deductions are not permitted to be reported in a Pre-Closing
Period but instead are deductible by the Acquired Companies in a Post-Closing
Tax Period or portion of a Straddle Period beginning after the Closing Date
(" _Post-Closing Period_ "), or are deductible in a Pre-Closing Period but
the deductions contribute to a loss carryforward rather than a reduction in
the Taxes payable by the Acquired Companies in such period (determined on a
"with and without" basis), then, except to the extent reflected as a tax
asset in the Closing Net Working Capital, Purchaser shall pay over to the
Seller an amount equal to the net reduction in Taxes realized (in the form of
a refund, credit or reduction in otherwise required Tax payments otherwise
payable by the applicable Acquired Company or its Affiliates) resulting from
such Deductions or loss carryforward (a " _Tax Benefit Payment_ ") within ten
(10) Business Days after such reduction is realized by any Acquired Company
or the affiliated, combined or consolidated group including the Acquired
Companies, as applicable, provided that Tax Benefit Payments shall only be
made if the net reduction in Taxes to which they relate are realized during
or with respect to the first three taxable years of the Acquired Companies
(or the consolidated or affiliated group that includes the Acquired
Companies) ending after the Closing Date. For the avoidance of doubt,
Purchaser shall report, or cause the Acquired Companies to report, all
Deductions on their income Tax Returns for the first taxable period for which
such Deductions may be reported under applicable Law. For each of the three
taxable periods for which a Tax Benefit Payment could be required, on or
prior to ten (10) days following the date on which the Purchaser or relevant
Acquired Company files its U.S. federal income Tax Return (whether or not a
Tax Benefit Payment is due for such year), Purchaser will deliver to
the Seller an explanation and calculation of the Tax Benefit Payment for
that taxable year (even if zero),

 

   

-34-    



   

 

together with such other information as the Seller may reasonably request to
allow it to confirm the calculation.

  

(e)   _Post-Closing Actions._ Except as otherwise required by applicable
Laws, Purchaser shall not, without the prior written consent of the Seller,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, (i)
file or cause any Acquired Company to file any amended Tax Return for any
Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period, or (ii) make or change any
election that has any retroactive effect on any Pre-Closing Tax Period or
Straddle Period, or take, or cause or permit any Acquired Company to take,
any action on the Closing Date or following the Closing, to the extent such
election or action would give rise to any indemnification claim with respect
to Taxes or reduce any Pre-Closing Tax Refund or other payment to which the
Seller would otherwise be entitled under _Section 5.6(d)_.

  

(f)   _Voluntary Disclosure Agreement_. As soon as practicable after the
date hereof, Seller shall cause to be prepared and filed a Voluntary
Disclosure Agreement ("VDA") with the state of Hawaii with respect to the
applicable item disclosed on Section 2.11 of the Disclosure Schedule. Seller
shall have the right to represent the Company in the negotiation of such VDA
with the goal of obtaining a final agreement with the state of Hawaii as to
requested items.  The preparation, negotiation and filing of the VDA shall be
subject to the provisions of _Section 5.6(g)_ hereof ( _mutatis mutandis_ )
as if it were a Seller's Tax Contest Claim, and Purchaser will cause duly
authorized officers of the Acquired Companies (or any successor thereof) to
execute and file a VDA prepared in accordance with such requirements.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in _Section 5.6(e)_ , in the event the VDA is not filed on or before the
later of December 31, 2015 or sixty (60) days following the Closing Date,
Purchaser shall be entitled to prepare and file the VDA.

  

(g)   _Tax Controversy_. After the Closing, each of Purchaser, the Acquired
Companies and the Seller shall promptly notify each of the other parties in
writing upon receipt of any written notice of any pending or threatened Tax
proceeding or similar claim relating to Taxes of any Acquired Company (" _Tax
Claim_ ") for which the Seller could be liable pursuant to this Agreement;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that the failure to so notify shall not relieve the
Seller of any liability hereunder except to the extent the Seller is actually
and materially prejudiced thereby. The Seller shall have the sole right to
employ counsel of its choice at its expense and to control the defense of all
such Tax Claims for which the Seller is liable under this Agreement for the
full amount of Tax payable with respect to such claim or proceeding (a "
_Seller 's Tax Contest Claim_") and shall bear the full cost of pursuing any
such claim; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that Purchaser shall be entitled
to participate in the defense of such Tax Claim, at its expense, with counsel
of its choosing and the Seller shall not agree to the settlement of any such
Tax Claim or proceeding that would have an adverse effect on any Acquired
Company without Purchaser's consent, which will not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed.  None of Purchaser, the Acquired Companies
and their respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates will agree to any settlement
of any such Tax Claim without the prior written consent of the Seller, which
will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.  Purchaser shall,
at the Seller's expense, make available or shall cause the applicable
Acquired Company to make available to the Seller any and all books and
records of such Acquired Company and other documents reasonably requested by
the Seller and shall make available employees of such Acquired Company
to enable the Seller to defend any Seller's Tax Contest Claim and shall
cooperate with the Seller in defense of such

 

   

-35-    



   

 

claim. Except as otherwise provided herein, Purchaser shall control all other
Tax Claims; _provided _ that Purchaser shall notify the Seller and allow the
Seller a reasonable opportunity to participate (at its own cost) in any such
Tax Claims that could result in an indemnification claim by Purchaser with
respect to Taxes, and none of Purchaser, the Acquired Companies and their
respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates will agree to any settlement of any
such Tax Claim or cease to defend such Tax Claim without the prior written
consent of the Seller, which will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed.

(a)  For purposes of this _Section 5.7_ , the term " _Continuing Employees_
" shall mean employees who are employed by the Acquired Companies at the
Closing.

  

(b) _Benefits and Compensation_.

  

(i)  Following the Closing Date, Purchaser shall either continue to offer
or establish, effective as of the Closing Date, employee compensation and
benefit plans, programs, policies and arrangements (including fringe benefits
but excluding severance pay) that will provide benefits and compensation to
the Continuing Employees (and, if applicable, their eligible beneficiaries)
for a period of at least one (1) year after the Closing Date that are
substantially comparable in the aggregate to the Acquired Plans set forth in
_Section 2.10(a)_ of the Disclosure Schedule, to the extent that such
Acquired Plans are provided by the Acquired Companies to the Continuing
Employees (and, if applicable, their eligible beneficiaries) immediately
prior to the Closing Date. Following the Closing Date, Purchaser and the
Acquired Companies shall be solely responsible for any liability, cost,
expense or obligation arising under or relating to any Acquired Plan, whether
incurred before, on or after the Closing Date.

  

(ii)  Following the Closing Date, with respect to each employee benefit plan
in which any Continuing Employee participates, for purposes of determining
eligibility to participate, vesting and entitlement to benefits, including
vacation entitlement, but not including benefit accrual under any pension
plan, service with the Company or any other Acquired Company shall be treated
as service with Purchaser or the applicable Affiliate of Purchaser;
_provided_ , _however_ , that such service shall not be recognized to the
extent that such recognition would result in a duplication of benefits. Such
service shall also apply for purposes of satisfying any waiting periods,
evidence of insurability requirements or the application of any pre-existing
condition limitations.  Each such plan shall waive pre-existing condition
limitations to the same extent waived under the corresponding Acquired Plan.
Continuing Employees shall be given credit under the applicable plan of
Purchaser or any Affiliate thereof for amounts paid under a corresponding
Acquired Plan during the same period for purposes of applying deductibles,
co-payments and out-of-pocket maximums as though such amounts had been paid
in accordance with the terms and conditions of the successor or replacement
plan.

  

(c) _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Notwithstanding the above, nothing in
this Agreement is intended to or shall confer upon any Continuing Employee or
Former Employee any legal or equitable right, benefit or remedy of any
nature whatsoever, including any rights of employment for any specified
period, under or by reason of this Agreement. Nothing in this Agreement is
intended to or shall prohibit Purchaser or the applicable Affiliate of
Purchaser from

 

   

-36-

intended to or shall be construed as in any way modifying or amending the
provisions of any Acquired Plan.

  

(d) Nothing in this _Section 5.7_ shall require Purchaser to establish or
maintain any benefit that is not provided through the Acquired Plans that
exist as of the Closing.

  

5.8 _Further Assurances_. From and after the Closing, the parties shall use
all commercially reasonable efforts to take or cause to be taken all
necessary actions and do, or cause to be done, all things necessary to

containing additional representations and warranties) which may be necessary
to carry out any of the provisions hereof.

from the Seller, Purchaser shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to (a)
provide to the Seller or its Representatives reasonable access to such
records during normal business hours for reasonable purposes relating to pre-
closing ownership or operations of the Acquired Companies and (b) permit the
Seller or its Representatives to make copies of such records, in each case at
no cost to the Seller or its Representatives (other than for reasonable out-
of-pocket expenses, including reimbursement of Purchaser's out-of-pocket
expenses). Such records may be sought under this _Section 5.9_ for any
reasonable purpose, including to the extent reasonably required in connection
with the audit, accounting, Tax Return preparation, financial statement
preparation. litigation, or other similar needs of the Seller or its
Affiliates. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the requirements
for Purchaser to provide any documents, information, records, or any other
items pursuant to this _Section 5.9_  shall not apply in connection with any
Litigation or other dispute between the parties hereto or as it relates to an
indemnification claim hereunder other than with respect to a Third Party
Claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any and all such records may be
destroyed by Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries at any time if such party
sends to the Seller written notice of its intent to destroy such records,
specifying in reasonable detail the contents of the records to be destroyed;
such records may then be destroyed after the thirtieth (30th) day following
such notice unless the Seller notifies the destroying party that it desires
to obtain possession of such records, in which event the destroying party
shall transfer the records to the Seller.

  

5.10   _Director and Officer Liability and Indemnity_. From and after the
Closing, Purchaser shall not, and shall not permit any Acquired Company to,
amend, repeal or modify any provision in Organizational Documents of the
Acquired Companies relating to the exculpation or indemnification of any
present and former director, manager and officer of any Acquired Company
(collectively, the " _Company Indemnified Persons_ ") in a manner that is
adverse to any Company Indemnified Person (unless required by applicable
Law), it being the intent of the parties that the Company Indemnified Persons
shall continue to be entitled to such exculpation and indemnification to the
full extent of applicable Law. This _Section 5.10_ is intended to be in
addition to the rights otherwise available to the Company Indemnified Persons
at Law or

Indemnified Persons and their respective heirs and representatives.

earlier of the Closing Date or termination of this Agreement, Seller shall
not, nor shall it authorize any of its Representatives to, directly or
indirectly solicit or initiate any discussions with, provide any information
to, or negotiate with, any third party concerning any sale of the Acquired
Companies, issuance of equity in any of the Acquired Companies, merger,
consolidation, sale of significant or substantial assets other than in the
Ordinary Course of Business, or similar transaction relating to the business
or the assets of any Acquired Company (any such transaction being referred to
herein as an " _Acquisition Proposal_ ").  During the period from the date of

Agreement, Seller shall promptly notify Purchaser in writing if it receives

to an Acquisition Proposal.

shall cause each of its Affiliates to, hold all of the Confidential
Information in the strictest confidence and refrain from using any of the
Confidential Information; _provided _ that the foregoing shall not apply to

opportunity to intervene prior to such disclosure, if possible), (ii)
Confidential Information that becomes publicly available (through no fault of
Seller or any of its Affiliates), (iii) use of Confidential Information by
any Affiliate of Seller in furtherance of such Person's employment duties for

Acquired Company to such customer or client during such time period, or (B)

-38-    



   

 

(b) From and after the Closing, no party to this Agreement shall directly or
indirectly (including through its Affiliates) disparage any other party to
this Agreement or any of its Affiliates, _provided_ ,  _however_ , nothing in

about the other party during Litigation between the parties or as required by
applicable Law or Order.

representations and warranties of the Company and the Seller in this
Agreement and the other matters (if any) covered by such policy, in the form
of _Exhibit 3_ (" _R andW Insurance Policy_"). The cost of the premiums
together with all taxes and application, underwriting or similar or other
fees or expenses in connection with the RandW Insurance Policy shall be paid by

5.17   _Release_.  Effective as of the Closing:

  

(a) Seller (on behalf of itself and its Affiliates) irrevocably releases and
forever discharges each Acquired Company (and, to the extent they would be
liable in respect of their position with such Acquired Company, each of their
respective directors, officers, employees, members, and equityholders) and
the respective successors, agents and assigns of any of the foregoing (each,
a " _Releasee_ ") from any and all Liabilities, damages, costs, claims,
complaints, charges or causes of action in law or equity that any of them or
any of their successors or assigns may now have or may ever have against any
of the Releasees, whether accrued, absolute, contingent, unliquidated or
otherwise, and whether known or unknown, in any case arising out of any act,
omission, event, or circumstance occurring prior to or existing as of the
Closing relating to any Acquired Company; _provided_ that this release shall
in no way modify or otherwise limit

 

   

-39-    



   

 

(i) any rights arising under or with respect to this Agreement, the
Transaction Agreements, or the Transactions or (ii) any indemnification
rights under applicable Law or the Organizational Documents of the Acquired
Companies.

  

(b) The Seller (on behalf of itself and its Affiliates) acknowledges and
agrees that the releases set forth in this _Section 5.17_ (collectively, the
" _Seller Release_ ") are not to be construed in any way as (i) an admission
of any liability whatsoever by any Releasee under any Law, or (ii) any such
liability having been expressly denied.

  

(c) Seller may hereafter discover facts in addition to, or different from,
those that Seller now knows or believes to be true with respect to the
subject matter of the Seller Release, and Seller intends that the Seller
Release shall be and remain in effect as a full and complete release
notwithstanding the discovery or existence of any such additional or
different facts. In furtherance of the foregoing intention, Seller hereby
waives and relinquishes any rights and benefits that it may have as a party
granting a release under any applicable Law of any jurisdiction to the full
extent that it may lawfully waive all such rights and benefits pertaining to
the subject matter of the Seller Release.  Seller acknowledges that the Laws
of many states provide substantially the following: "A GENERAL RELEASE DOES
NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN
HIS OR HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM
OR HER MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR."
Seller acknowledges that such provisions are designed to protect a party from
waiving claims which it does not know exist or may exist. Nonetheless, Seller
agrees that, effective as of the Closing Date, the Seller shall be deemed to
waive any such provision. Seller further agrees that neither Seller nor any
of its Affiliates shall (a) institute a lawsuit or other legal proceeding
based upon or arising out of any of the released claims, (b) participate,
assist, or cooperate in any such proceeding or (c) encourage, assist and/or
solicit any third party to institute any such proceeding.

representations and warranties of Purchaser contained in _Article IV_ (i)

have been true and correct in all respects. Except as would not have a
material adverse effect on Purchaser or its ability to consummate the

Purchaser contained in _Article IV_ shall be true and correct at and as of
the Closing Date with the same effect as though made on and as of the Closing
Date (or, with respect to representations and warranties which speak as of a
specified date or period of time, as of such specified date or period of
time).

  

(b)   _Performance_. Purchaser shall have performed in all material
respects its covenants and agreements under this Agreement to be performed or
complied with on or prior to the Closing Date.

  

(c) _Officer 's Certificate_.  The Seller shall have received on the Closing

 **ARTICLE VII** ** 
 INDEMNITY OBLIGATIONS AFTER CLOSING**

  

7.1   _Survival; Indemnification_.

  

(a) _Survival_. If the Closing is consummated, (i) all representations and
warranties contained in this Agreement or in any officer's certificate
delivered at Closing (and the corresponding indemnifications in _Sections
7.1(b)(i) _ and _7.1(c)(i)_ ) shall survive until the twelve (12) month
anniversary of the Closing Date at which time they shall terminate,
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Company Fundamental Representations, the
Seller Fundamental Representations, and the representations and warranties in
any officer's certificate delivered at Closing only as they relate to the
Company Fundamental Representations or the Seller Fundamental Representations
(and the corresponding indemnifications in _Sections 7.1(b)(i) _ and
_7.1(c)(i)_ ) shall survive the Closing Date until the thirtieth (30th) day
after the expiration of the respective statutes of limitations applicable to
matters covered thereby, at which time they shall terminate; (ii) the
indemnifications in _Sections 7.1(b)(iii) _ and _7.1(b)(iv) _ shall survive
until the

 

   

-42-    



   

 

thirtieth (30th) day after the expiration of the respective statutes of
limitations applicable to matters covered thereby, at which time they shall
terminate; (iii) all covenants contained in this Agreement that are to be
performed at or prior to Closing (and the corresponding indemnifications in
_Sections 7.1(b)(ii)_  and _7.1(c)(ii)_ ) shall survive until the three (3)
month anniversary of the Closing Date, at which time they shall terminate;
and (iv) all other covenants contained in this Agreement that are to be
performed after the Closing (and the corresponding indemnifications in
_Sections 7.1(b)(ii)_  and _7.1(c)(ii)_ ) shall survive in accordance with
their respective terms or until the expiration of the applicable statute of
limitations, as applicable, at which time they shall terminate. The
applicable survival period specified in this _Section 7.1(a)_ for a
particular representation, warranty or covenant (or indemnification) is
referred to as the " _Survival Period_."  Notwithstanding the foregoing to
the contrary, if notice of an indemnification claim pursuant to this _Article
VII_ has been properly given in accordance with this _Article VII_ within the
foregoing applicable Survival Period, such indemnification claim will survive
until such time as such claim is finally resolved. Nothing in this _clause
(a)_ shall serve to limit a claim against a party in the event of (and
arising out of) fraud by such party.

  

(b)   _Indemnification by the Seller_. Subject to the other provisions of
this _Article VII_ , from and after the Closing Date, the Seller shall
indemnify Purchaser (which, for purposes of this _Section 7.1(b)_ shall
include the Acquired Companies) and its Affiliates (the " _Purchaser
Indemnified Parties_ ") from and against and in respect of any and all losses
incurred by Purchaser (which, for purposes of this _Section 7.1(b)_ shall
include the Acquired Companies) to the extent relating to or arising out of:

  

(i) any breach of any of the representations or warranties (A) of the Company
contained in _Article II_  or of Seller in _Article III_ , in each case, as
of the Agreement Date or as of the Closing Date as if each representation and
warranty in _Article II_  and _Article III_ was made on the Agreement Date
and on the Closing Date (or as of a specified date or period of time, with
respect to representations and warranties which speak as of a specified date
or period of time) or (B) in the officer's certificate delivered at Closing
pursuant to _Section 6.2(c)_ ;

  

(ii) any failure by the Company (prior to Closing) or Seller to perform or
comply with its respective covenants and agreements contained in this
Agreement;

  

(iii) any Taxes of the Acquired Companies for any Pre-Closing Tax Period or
the portion of any Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date (including any
Taxes for which any Acquired Company is liable under Treasury Regulation
Section 1.1502-6 (or under any similar provision of state, local or foreign
Law), as transferee or successor, by contract or otherwise), except to the
extent such Taxes were paid prior to Closing, were taken into account in
determining the Closing Net Working Capital or the Cash Consideration, or
were paid or reimbursed by Seller pursuant to _Section 5.6(b)(iii)_ ; or

  

(iv) any Closing Debt or Closing Transaction Expenses, to the extent such
amounts did not result in a reduction to the Cash Consideration.

  

(c)   _Indemnification by Purchaser_. Subject to the other provisions of this
_Article VII_ , from and after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall indemnify
the Seller and its

 

   

-43-    



   

 

Affiliates (the " _Seller Indemnified Parties_ ") from and against and in
respect of any and all losses incurred by the Seller to the extent relating
to or arising out of:

  

(i)  any breach of any of the representations or warranties (A) of
Purchaser contained in _Article IV_ , in each case, as of the Agreement Date
or as of the Closing Date as if each representation and warranty in _Article
IV_  was made on the Agreement Date and on the Closing Date (or as of a
specified date or period of time, with respect to representations and
warranties which speak as of a specified date or period of time) or (B) in
the officer's certificate delivered at Closing pursuant to _Section 6.3(c)_;
or

  

(ii)  any failure by Purchaser to perform or comply with its covenants and
agreements contained in this Agreement.

  

(d)   _Limitation of Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary,
but without limiting the other limitations set forth in this _Article VII_
, the obligations and liabilities of the Seller and Purchaser under
_Sections 7.1(b)_ and _(c)_ , respectively, shall be subject to the
following additional limitations ( _provided _ that nothing in this clause
_(d) _ shall serve to limit a claim against a party in the event of (and
arising out of) fraud by such party):

  

(i) The Seller shall only have liability or obligation with respect to losses
subject to indemnity pursuant to _Section 7.1(b)(i)_ if the aggregate amount
of losses incurred by Purchaser for which Purchaser would otherwise be
entitled to indemnification pursuant to _Section 7.1(b)(i)_ exceeds an amount
equal to the Deductible and, thereafter, only to the extent of such losses in
excess of the Deductible;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the limitations in
this _Section 7.1(d)(i) _ will not apply to claims for breaches of Company
Fundamental Representations or Seller Fundamental Representations.

  

(ii) _Waterfall of Recourse After Satisfaction of Section 7.1(d)(i)_. After
application of _Section 7.1(d)(i)_ to the extent applicable (i.e., the
Deductible shall not apply to breaches of Company Fundamental Representations
or Seller Fundamental Representations), but, for clarity, subject to the
other limitations in this _Section 7.1(d)_ :

  

(1) The first recourse for any amount finally determined to be owed in
respect of any indemnity obligations of Seller pursuant to _Section 7.1(b)_
shall be to the Escrow Account up to, in the aggregate pursuant to this
clause (1), the Seller Retention Escrow Amount.

  

(2) After application of _Section 7.1(d)(ii)(1)_ , recourse for any amount
finally determined to be owed in respect of any indemnity obligations of
Seller pursuant to _Section 7.1(b)(i)_ or _Section 7.1(b)(iii)_ shall
be against the RandW Insurance Policy until the earlier of (A) coverage for
such amount under the RandW Insurance Policy (including all applicable
deductibles and retention amounts thereunder) is exhausted or (B) coverage
for such amount under the RandW Insurance Policy is denied by the insurer, it
being understood and agreed that the Purchaser shall use reasonable efforts
to collect under the RandW Insurance Policy (including using reasonable
efforts after, and notwithstanding, any such denial), but without any
obligation to litigate or arbitrate. For clarity, the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties shall have no

 

   

-44-    



   

 

recourse against the Seller or the Escrow Account for any amounts received by
the Purchaser Indemnified Parties under the RandW Insurance Policy.

  

(3) So long as Purchaser has complied with its obligations in _Section 5.16_
and _Section 7.1(d)(ii)(2)_ , after application of _Section 7.1(d)(ii)(1)_
and _Section 7.1(d)(ii)(2)_ , the next recourse for any amount finally
determined to be owed in respect of any indemnity obligations of Seller
pursuant to _Section 7.1(b)_ shall be against the Escrow Account.

  

(4) So long as Purchaser has complied with its obligations in _Section 5.16_
and _Section 7.1(d)(ii)(2)_ , after application of _Section 7.1(d)(ii)(1)_ \-
_Section 7.1(d)(ii)(3)_ , recourse for any amount finally determined to be
owed in respect of any indemnity obligations of Seller pursuant to _Section
7.1(b)_  shall be against Seller directly.

  

(iii) The Seller's maximum aggregate indemnification liability pursuant to,
and the sole and exclusive recourse for any amount finally determined to be
owed in respect of any indemnity obligations pursuant to, _Section 7.1(b)(i)_
(other than for breaches of Seller Fundamental Representations or Company
Fundamental Representations) shall be the amounts then held in the Escrow
Account, and once the Escrow Account shall be depleted or released all such
indemnity obligations pursuant to _Section 7.1(b)(i)_  (other than for
breaches of Seller Fundamental Representations or Company Fundamental
Representations) shall terminate.

  

(iv) The Seller's maximum aggregate indemnification liability under this
Agreement (including pursuant to _Section 7.1(b)(i)_ \- _Section 7.1(b)(iv)_
) shall be limited to the sum of the Closing Cash Payment paid to Seller
at Closing plus any amount actually received by Seller after Closing from
the Escrow Account plus any amounts paid to Seller after Closing under
_Section 1.6(e)(i)_.

  

(v) No party shall be liable for any losses pursuant to _Sections 7.1(b)_ or
_(c) _ unless the party seeking such indemnification (the " _Indemnified
Party_ ") has delivered (in accordance with _Section 10.8_ ) the notice of
Claim in respect of such loss required by _Section 7.1(f)_ below to the party
from which indemnification is sought (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") on or
prior to the expiration of the applicable Survival Period.

  

(vi) The word "loss" (and "losses" and other variants thereof) for all
purposes under this Agreement shall exclude exemplary or punitive damages
except to the extent payable to a third party pursuant to a Third Party
Claim.

  

(vii) Each loss shall be reduced by (A) the amount of any net insurance
proceeds (net of deductible paid, directly resulting increased premiums and
direct reasonable out of pocket cost of recovery) received by the Indemnified
Party or any of its Affiliates with respect to such loss, including amounts
received under the RandW Insurance Policy, and (B) any net indemnification,
contribution, compensation or other payment paid (net of any direct
reasonable out of pocket cost of recovery) to the Indemnified Party or any of
its Affiliates by any third party with respect to such loss (any such amount,
a " _Reimbursement_ ").  If any such Reimbursement is obtained subsequent to
payment to an Indemnified Party in respect of any losses, then such
Reimbursement shall be promptly paid over to the Indemnifying Party.

   

   

-45-    



   

 

(viii) The parties shall be entitled to seek indemnification pursuant to
multiple provisions of this _Article VII_ , _provided_ ,  _however_ , that
neither the Purchaser Indemnified Parties nor the Seller Indemnified Parties
may recover more than once for the same loss.

  

(ix) Nothing in this Agreement shall limit the right of the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties to make claims against the RandW Insurance Policy, nor
shall Seller have any right of subrogation, offset or other recovery, under
this Agreement or otherwise, against any amounts recovered by any Purchaser
Indemnified Party under the RandW Insurance Policy.

  

(x) To the extent that Purchaser has actual knowledge prior to the Agreement
Date that a representation or warranty in _Article II_ or _Article III_
is breached as of the date of this Agreement, Purchaser shall not be entitled
to indemnification pursuant to _Section 7.1(b)(i)_ for such breach.

  

(e) _Exclusive Remedy_. From and after Closing, except as provided in
_Section 1.6_ , _Section 10.13_ and the Indemnity Agreement, indemnification
under this _Article VII_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Purchaser
Indemnified Parties and the Seller Indemnified Parties, as applicable (and
including their respective Affiliates, successors and assigns), with respect
to any and all claims relating to the subject matter of this Agreement, the
Acquired Companies, or the Transactions including for breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement
or any certificate delivered hereunder, and the Seller and Purchaser, as
applicable (and including their respective Affiliates, successors and
assigns), shall have no other liability to the other party resulting
therefrom.

  

(f)   _Notice of Claim_. If the Indemnified Party shall become aware of
any claim, proceeding or other matter (a " _Claim_ "), which may give rise to
a loss subject to indemnification hereunder or that will be taken into
account for purposes of calculating whether the Indemnifying Party's
indemnification obligation arises pursuant to _Section 7.1(b)_ or _Section
7.1(c) _ above, the Indemnified Party shall promptly give notice thereof to
the Indemnifying Party. Such notice shall specify whether the Claim arises as
a result of a Claim by a third party against the Indemnified Party (a "
_Third Party Claim_ ") or whether the Claim does not so arise, and shall
also specify with reasonable particularity (to the extent that the
information is available) the factual basis for the Claim and the amount of
the Claim, if known or estimable. If the Indemnified Party does not promptly
give notice of any Claim as specified above, such failure shall not affect
the Indemnified Party's right to indemnification or application to the
applicable deductible set forth in _Section 7.1(d)_ hereunder for losses in
connection with such Claim, except to the extent the Indemnifying Party's
rights are prejudiced by such failure or its indemnification obligations are
increased as a result of such failure.

  

(g) _Third Party Claims_.

  

(i) With respect to any Third Party Claim, unless such Claim is being
controlled by the carrier under the RandW Insurance Policy, the Indemnifying
Party shall have the right, at its expense and at its election, to assume
control of the negotiation, settlement and defense of such Claim through
counsel of its choice; _provided_ , that (1) within ten days after the
Indemnified Party has given notice (in accordance with _Section 7.1(f)_ ) of
the Third Party Claim

 

   

-46-    



   

 

the Indemnifying Party replies in writing to the Indemnified Party that
the Indemnifying Party will assume the defense of the Third Party Claim, (2)
the Indemnifying Party provides the Indemnified Party with reasonable
evidence that the Indemnifying Party will have the financial resources to
defend against the Third Party Claim and fulfill its indemnification
obligations hereunder, (3) the Third Party Claim involves only money damages,
and does not seek an injunction or other similar equitable relief, (4) the
monetary damages claimed in the Third Party Claim do not exceed the Escrow
Amount (excluding the amount thereof already paid and subject to pending
claims), (5) the Third Party Claim does not involve a claim by a key supplier
or customer of the Acquired Companies or a Governmental Authority, and (6)
the Third Party Claim does not involve a class action lawsuit. The
Indemnifying Party shall conduct any such assumed defense actively and
diligently. The election of the Indemnifying Party to assume such control
shall be made within thirty (30) days of receipt of notice of the Third Party
Claim, failing which the Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to have elected
not to assume such control. If the Indemnifying Party elects to assume such
control, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to be informed and
consulted with respect to the negotiation, settlement or defenses of such
Third Party Claim and to retain counsel to act on its behalf, but the fees
and disbursements of such counsel shall be paid by the Indemnified
Party unless the named parties to any action or proceeding include both
the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party and a representation of both
the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party by the same counsel would
be inappropriate due to an actual or potential conflict of interest between
them (such as the availability of different defenses), in which case the
reasonable costs and expenses of a single counsel to the Indemnified Party,
who shall be reasonably acceptable to the Indemnifying Party, shall be
included in the losses subject to indemnification. If the Indemnifying Party,
having elected to assume such control, thereafter fails to defend the Third
Party Claim within a reasonable period of time, subject to _Section
7.1(g)(ii)_ , the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to assume such control.
In any circumstance where the Indemnifying Party is not controlling defense
of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to be
informed and consulted with respect to the negotiation, settlement or
defenses of such Third Party Claim.

  

(ii) Whether or not the Indemnifying Party assumes control of the
negotiation, settlement or defense of any Third Party Claim:

  

(1) unless such settlement provides for no fault on the part of the
Indemnified Party and provides for a full release, in customary form, of the
Indemnified Party, and there are no obligations of the Indemnified Party
under such settlement other than monetary damages or other monetary payments
to be paid for by the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnifying Party shall not
settle any Third Party Claim without the written consent of the Indemnified
Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed; and

  

(2) if the Indemnifying Party has not assumed control of the defense of a
Third Party Claim, then the Indemnified Party may settle such Third Party
Claim for which indemnification is sought without the consent of the
Indemnifying Party (for purposes of clarity, nothing in this _Section
7.1(g)(ii)(2) _ shall prohibit the Indemnifying Party from contesting whether
it has indemnification obligations hereunder or the extent thereof).

  

 

   

-47-    



   

 

(iii)  The Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall cooperate fully
with each other with respect to Third Party Claims and, regardless of which
party has control thereof as provided for herein, shall keep each other
reasonably advised with respect thereto.

  

(iv)  The Indemnified Party shall not take any action the purpose of which is
to prejudice the defense of any Claim subject to indemnification hereunder or
to induce a third party to assert a Claim subject to indemnification
hereunder.

  

(h)   _Other Provisions_. Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 7.1_  to
the contrary, the Seller shall not be liable pursuant to _Section 7.1(b)_
 for any losses arising out of any matter to the extent that such matter
has been taken into account in the calculation of the Closing Net Working
Capital, the Closing Debt, the Closing Cash, or the Closing Transaction
Expenses or an adjustment to the Cash Consideration pursuant to _Section
1.6_. The Indemnifying Party shall be subrogated to the extent of any
indemnification payment to the rights of the Indemnified Party against any
Person other than a material supplier or customer of an Acquired Company or,
if the applicable policy prohibits subrogation, an insurer of an Acquired
Company with respect to the subject matter of the applicable Claim. Nothing
herein shall abrogate any party's obligations under applicable Law to
mitigate damages. Solely with respect to indemnification under this Article
VII, for purposes of measuring the amount of losses from a breach of a
representation or warranty in Article II, III or IV of this Agreement and for
purposes of determining whether a breach of a representation or warranty
in Article II, III or IV of this Agreement occurred, materiality qualifiers
(e.g., "material", "in all material respects", "Material Adverse Effect",
etc.) shall be disregarded as if the representation or warranty was not so
qualified.

  

(i) _No Contribution_. Anything to the contrary herein notwithstanding, the
Seller shall not have any right to seek any indemnification or contribution
from or remedy against the Company whether arising prior to or after the
Closing Date in respect of any breach of any representation or warranty
hereunder by the Company or the failure of the Company to comply with any
covenant or agreement hereunder to be performed by the Company on or prior to
the Closing Date and the Seller hereby waives any such claim it may have
against the Company with respect thereto whether at law, in equity or
otherwise.

  

(j)   _Coordination with Carrier_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, to the extent required by the carrier of the RandW Insurance
Policy in connection with any claim made by a Purchaser Indemnified Party
thereunder, the conduct of the defense or prosecution of any Third Party
Claim will be assigned to counsel selected or approved by the carrier of the
RandW Insurance Policy, or otherwise conducted in coordination with the carrier
of the RandW Insurance Policy, in each case without prejudice to the rights
of the parties hereunder, and Seller and the Purchaser Indemnified Parties
will reasonably cooperate at Purchaser's expense with the carrier of the
RandW Insurance Policy and such counsel in the defense or prosecution of the
Third Party Claim and otherwise comply with the requirements of the RandW
Insurance Policy applicable to such party in connection therewith.

  

7.2 _No Right of Off-Set/Set-Off_.  Except as otherwise expressly provided
in this Agreement, neither the Seller nor Purchaser shall have any right to
set off any amount to which it claims to be entitled from any other party,
including any amounts that may be owed under this

 

   

-48-    



   

 

 _Article VII_ or otherwise, against amounts otherwise payable under any
provision of this Agreement.

  

7.3 _Treatment of Indemnity Payment_.  Any indemnity payment made to
Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement shall be treated as an adjustment to the
Final Cash Consideration for all tax, financial reporting and other purposes.

failure of the Closing to occur on or prior to such date.

  

8.3   _Termination by the Seller_. This Agreement may be terminated and the
Transactions may be abandoned by the Seller at any time prior to the Closing,
by written notice from the Seller to Purchaser, if (a) Purchaser shall have

shall have breached or failed to perform or comply with any of its material
covenants or agreements in this Agreement, (b) such breach cannot be cured or
has not been cured within thirty (30) days after the giving of written notice
by the Seller to Purchaser specifying such breach and (c) such breach,

conditions in _Section 6.3_ impossible.

  

8.4 _Termination by Purchaser_.  This Agreement may be terminated and the
Transactions may be abandoned by Purchaser at any time prior to the Closing,

all other such breaches by the Seller and the Company, makes or will make the
satisfaction of one or more of the conditions in _Section 6.2_ impossible. 

   

   

-49-    



   

 

8.5   _Effect of Termination_.  In the event this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to this _Article VIII_ , the Transactions shall be abandoned,
without further action by either of the parties hereto, and this Agreement
shall become void and have no further force and effect without any liability
of any party to any other party, except that (a) the obligations of Purchaser
set forth in the Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in effect, (b)
neither party shall be relieved from any liabilities or damages arising out
of a material breach of any covenant of such party contained in this
Agreement prior to termination of this Agreement, (c) in the event of a
termination pursuant to Section 8.3 or Section 8.4, as applicable, of this
Agreement by one party due to the material breach of the representations or
warranties of the other party contained in this Agreement, the breaching
party shall not be relieved from any damages incurred by the non-breaching
party arising out of a material breach of any representation or warranty of
the breaching party contained in this Agreement that the non-breaching party
did not have actual knowledge of prior to the Agreement Date; provided that
in no event shall such damages exceed the reasonable, out-of-pocket expenses
incurred by the non-breaching party in connection with the negotiation,
execution and performance of this Agreement, and (d) the provisions of
_Sections 8.5_ , _10.1_ , _10.2_ , _10.6_ , _10.7_ , _10.8_ , _10.9_ , 
_10.10_ , _10.11_ , _10.12_ , and _Article IX_ shall remain in effect.

electronic mail in "portable document format" (" _.pdf_ ") form, or by any
other electronic means intended to preserve the original graphic and
pictorial appearance of a document, or by combination of such means, shall
constitute effective execution and delivery of this Agreement as to the

Signatures of the parties transmitted by facsimile or other electronic means
shall be deemed to be their original signatures for all purposes.

  

10.6   _Governing Law_.  This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed
in accordance with, the Laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to any
conflict of laws principles thereof.

10.9 _Entire Agreement; Assignment_. The Transaction Agreements (including
all exhibits and schedules to such agreements) and the Confidentiality
Agreement together constitute the entire agreement between the parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersede all other
prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, between the
parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. Neither this Agreement nor
any rights or obligations hereunder shall be assigned or transferred by
Purchaser by operation of law or otherwise without the prior written consent
of the Seller. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be
binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties and
their respective successors and permitted assigns.

  

10.10   _Parties in Interest_.  Except as expressly provided in _Section
5.10_ or in _Article VII_  relating to indemnified parties, this Agreement is
not intended to confer any rights or remedies upon any Person except the
parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns, and
nothing herein, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any
other Person any legal or equitable right, benefit or remedy of any nature
whatsoever, including any rights of employment for any specified period,
under or by reason of this Agreement.

  

10.11   _Validity_.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of
this Agreement shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other
provisions of this Agreement, each of which shall remain in full force and
effect. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal
or incapable of being enforced by any Law or public policy, all other terms
and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and
effect for so long as the economic or legal substance of the Transactions is
not affected in any manner materially adverse to either party hereto. Upon
such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith
to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties
as closely as practicable in an acceptable manner in order that the
Transactions are consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest
extent practicable.

  

10.12   _Currency_.  Unless otherwise specified in this Agreement, all
references to currency, monetary values and dollars set forth herein shall
mean United States (U.S.) dollars.

  

10.13   _Specific Performance_.  The parties may seek specific performance
or injunctive relief hereunder.

  

10.14   _Representation_.  Purchaser agrees, on its own behalf and on behalf
of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties, that, following the Closing, O'Melveny
and Myers LLP may serve as counsel to the Seller and any or all of its
Affiliates (the " _Seller Group_ ") in connection with any matters related to
this Agreement and the Transactions, including any litigation, claim or
obligation arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the Transactions,
notwithstanding any representation by O'Melveny and Myers LLP prior to the
Closing Date of any Acquired Company or the Seller. Purchaser and the Company
(on behalf of itself and the other Acquired Companies) hereby (i) waive any
claim they have or may have that O'Melveny and Myers LLP has a conflict of
interest or is otherwise prohibited from engaging in such representation and
(ii) agree that, following the Closing, in the event that a dispute arises
after the Closing between Purchaser, any Acquired Company or any other
Purchaser Indemnified Party, on the one hand, and the Seller Group or any
member thereof, on the other hand, O'Melveny and Myers LLP may

 

   

-65-    



   

 

represent such Seller Group or member thereof in such dispute even though the
interests of such Seller Group may be directly adverse to Purchaser, the
Acquired Companies or any other Purchaser Indemnified Party and even though
O'Melveny and Myers LLP may have represented one or more Acquired Companies in
a matter substantially related to such dispute, and (iii) agree that they
shall not seek to disqualify O'Melveny and Myers LLP from any such
representation. Purchaser and the Company (on behalf of itself and the other
Acquired Companies) also further agree that, as to all communications among
O'Melveny and Myers LLP and the Acquired Companies (or any of them) and the
Seller Group that relate in any way to the Transactions, the attorney-client
privilege and the expectation of client confidence and any other rights to
evidentiary privilege belong exclusively to the Seller and shall be
controlled by the Seller and shall not pass to or be claimed by Purchaser,
any Acquired Company, or any other Purchaser Indemnified Party.
