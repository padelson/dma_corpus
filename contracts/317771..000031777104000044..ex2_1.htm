    AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

   

 AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of May 19, 2004 (this " _Agreement_ "), among Tellabs, Inc., a Delaware corporation (" _Parent_ "), Chardonnay Merger Corp., a Delaware corporation and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Sub_ "), and Advanced Fibre Communications, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ ") (Sub and the Company being hereinafter collectively referred to as the " _Constituent Corporations_ "). 

   

 W I T N E S S E T H: 

   

 WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Parent, Sub and the Company have approved and declared advisable the merger of Sub with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ "), upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, whereby each issued and outstanding share of common stock, $0.01 par value, of the Company (" _Company Common Stock_ "), together with the associated Rights (as hereinafter defined) under the Rights Agreement (as hereinafter defined), not owned directly or indirectly by Parent or the Company, will be converted into the right to receive (i) shares of common stock, $0.01 par value, of Parent (" _Parent Common Stock_ ") and (ii) the Per Share Cash Consideration (as hereinafter defined); 

   

 WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Parent and the Company have determined that the Merger is in furtherance of and consistent with their respective long-term business strategies and is fair to, and in the best interest of, their respective stockholders; 

   

 WHEREAS, immediately following the Merger, Parent will cause the surviving corporation in the Merger to merge with and into a newly created direct, wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent pursuant to the Subsequent Merger (as hereinafter defined); and 

   

 WHEREAS, this Agreement is intended to constitute a "plan of reorganization" with respect to the Merger and the Subsequent Merger for United States federal income tax purposes pursuant to which the Merger and the Subsequent Merger, taken together, are to be treated as a "reorganization" under Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "). 

   

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, representations, warranties and agreements herein contained, the parties agree as follows: 

    

ARTICLE I

  
   

THE MERGER AND SUBSEQUENT MERGER

   

  Section 1.1 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ "), Sub shall be merged with and into the Company at the Effective Time (as hereinafter defined). Following the Merger, the separate corporate existence of Sub shall cease and the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation (the " _Surviving Corporation_ ") and shall succeed to and assume all the rights and obligations of Sub in accordance with the DGCL. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, at the election of Parent, any direct wholly owned Subsidiary (as hereinafter defined) of Parent may be substituted for Sub as a constituent corporation in the Merger; provided that such substituted corporation is a Delaware corporation which is formed solely for the purpose of engaging in the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and has engaged in no other business activities. In such event, the parties agree to execute an appropriate amendment to this Agreement, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent and the Company, in order to reflect such substitution. 

    Section 1.2 _Effective Time_. The Merger shall become effective when a certificate of merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ "), executed in accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL, is filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware;  _provided_ , _however_ , that, upon mutual consent of the Constituent Corporations, the Certificate of Merger may provide for a later date of effectiveness of the Merger not more than 30 days after the date the Certificate of Merger is filed. When used in this Agreement, the term " _Effective Time_ " shall mean the date and time at which the Certificate of Merger is accepted for recording or such later time set forth in the Certificate of Merger. The filing of the Certificate of Merger shall be made on the date of the Closing (as hereinafter defined). 

   

  Section 1.3 _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in this Agreement and in Section 259 of the DGCL. 

   

  Section 1.4 _Charter and Bylaws; Directors and Officers_. (a) At the Effective Time, the Fifth Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, of the Company (the " _Company Charter_ "), as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be amended so that Article FOURTH of the Company Charter reads in its entirety as follows: "The total number of shares of all classes of capital stock which the Corporation shall have authority to issue is 1,000 shares of Common Stock, $0.01 par value." As so amended, the Company Charter shall be the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable law. At the Effective Time, the Bylaws of Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall become the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or in the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation. 

   

   (b)   The directors of Sub at the Effective Time shall be the directors of the  Surviving Corporation, until the earlier of their resignation or removal or  until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, as the case  may be. The officers of the Company at the Effective Time shall be the officers  of the Surviving Corporation, until the earlier of their resignation or removal  or until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, as the case  may be. 

   

  Section 1.5 _Conversion of Securities_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Sub, the Company or the holders of any securities of the Constituent Corporations: 

   

 (a)   Each issued and outstanding share of common stock, $0.01 par value, of Sub shall  be converted into one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of  common stock, $0.01 par value, of the Surviving Corporation. 

     (b)   All shares of Company Common Stock, together with the associated Rights, that  are held in the treasury of the Company or by any wholly owned Subsidiary of the  Company and any shares of Company Common Stock, together with the associated  Rights, owned by Parent or any wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent shall be  canceled and no capital stock of Parent or other consideration shall be  delivered in exchange therefor. 

   

   (c)   Subject to the provisions of _Sections 1.8_ and _1.10_ hereof, each  share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the  Effective Time (together with the associated Rights), other than Dissenting  Shares (as hereinafter defined) and shares to be canceled in accordance with  _Section 1.5(b)_ , shall be converted into the right to receive (i) 1.55  (such number being the " _Exchange Ratio_ ") validly issued, fully  paid and nonassessable shares of Parent Common Stock (the " _Per Share  Stock Consideration_ ") and (ii) $7.00 in cash, without interest  (the " _Per Share Cash Consideration_ " and, together with the Per  Share Stock Consideration, the " _Per Share Merger  Consideration_ "). All such shares of Company Common Stock and the  associated Rights, when so converted, shall no longer be outstanding and shall  automatically be canceled and retired, and each holder of a certificate  representing any such shares shall cease to have any rights with respect  thereto, except the right to receive any dividends and other distributions in  accordance with _Section 1.7_ , certificates representing the shares of  Parent Common Stock into which such shares are converted, the Per Share Cash  Consideration and any cash, without interest, in lieu of fractional shares to be  issued or paid in consideration therefor upon the surrender of such certificate  in accordance with _Section 1.6_. 

   

   (d)   Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, shares of Company  Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time,  together with the associated Rights, which are held of record by stockholders  who shall not have approved the Merger and who shall have demanded properly in  writing appraisal of such shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL  (" _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the right to  receive the Per Share Merger Consideration as set forth in _Section  1.5(c)_ , but the holders thereof instead shall be entitled to, and the  Dissenting Shares shall only represent the right to receive, payment of the fair  value of such shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the  DGCL; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) if such a holder fails to demand  properly in writing from the Surviving Corporation the appraisal of his or its  shares in accordance with Section 262(d) of the DGCL or, after making such  demand, subsequently delivers an effective written withdrawal of such demand, or  fails to establish his or its entitlement to appraisal rights as provided in  Section 262 of the DGCL, if so required, or (ii) if a court shall determine that  such holder is not entitled to receive payment for his or its shares or such  holder shall otherwise lose his or its appraisal rights, then, in any such case,  each share of Company Common Stock, together with the associated Rights, held of  record by such holder or holders shall automatically be converted into and  represent only the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration as set  forth in _Section 1.5(c)_ , upon surrender of the certificate or  certificates representing such Dissenting Shares. The Company shall give Parent  and Sub prompt notice of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of  such shares, and Parent and Sub shall have the right to participate in all  negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands except as required by  applicable law. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of  Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demands for fair value  for Dissenting Shares or offer to settle, settle or negotiate in respect of any  such demands. 

    Section 1.6 _Parent to Make Certificates Available_. (a) Parent shall authorize a commercial bank (or such other Person as shall be reasonably acceptable to Parent and the Company) to act as Exchange Agent hereunder (the " _Exchange Agent_ "). As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent for exchange with certificates which represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time, together with the associated Rights, all cash and certificates representing the shares of Parent Common Stock payable or issuable pursuant to _Section 1.5(c)_ and cash, as required to make payments in lieu of any fractional shares pursuant to _Section 1.8_ (such cash and shares of Parent Common Stock, together with any dividends or distributions with respect thereto, being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The Exchange Agent shall deliver the Per Share Merger Consideration contemplated to be issued and paid pursuant to  _Section 1.5(c)_ out of the Exchange Fund. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Person_ " means any individual, corporation, partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, association, joint-stock company, estate, Governmental Entity (as hereinafter defined), trust or unincorporated organization. 

   

   (b)   Parent shall instruct the Exchange Agent, as soon as practicable after the  Effective Time, to mail to each record holder of a certificate or certificates,  which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of  Company Common Stock, together with the associated Rights, converted in the  Merger (the " _Certificates_ "), a letter of transmittal (which  shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the  Certificates shall pass, only upon actual delivery of the Certificates to the  Exchange Agent, and shall contain instructions for use in effecting the  surrender of such Certificates in exchange for the Per Share Cash Consideration  and certificates representing shares of Parent Common Stock and cash in lieu of  fractional shares and which shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Company (the  " _Transmittal Letter_ ")). Upon surrender for cancellation to the  Exchange Agent of all Certificates held by any record holder of a Certificate,  together with the Transmittal Letter, duly executed, the holder of such  Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Per Share Cash  Consideration and a certificate representing that number of whole shares of  Parent Common Stock into which the shares represented by the Certificate so  surrendered shall have been converted at the Effective Time pursuant to this  _Article_ I, cash in lieu of any fractional share in accordance with  _Section 1.8_ and certain dividends and other distributions in accordance  with _Section 1.7_ , and any Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be  canceled. 

   

  Section 1.7 _Dividends; Transfer Taxes; Withholding_. No dividends or other distributions that are declared on or after the Effective Time on Parent Common Stock, or are payable to the holders of record thereof on or after the Effective Time, will be paid to any Person entitled by reason of the Merger to receive a certificate representing Parent Common Stock until such Person surrenders the related Certificate or Certificates, as provided in _Section 1.6_. Subject to the effect of applicable law, there shall be paid to each record holder of a new certificate representing such Parent Common Stock: (i) at the time of such surrender or as promptly as practicable thereafter, the amount of any dividends or other distributions theretofore paid with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock represented by such new certificate and having a record date on or after the Effective Time and a payment date prior to such surrender; and (ii) at the appropriate payment date or as promptly as practicable thereafter, the amount of any dividends or other distributions payable with respect to such shares of Parent Common Stock and having a record date on or after the Effective Time but prior to such surrender and a payment date

    on or subsequent to such surrender. In no event shall the Person entitled to
receive such dividends or other distributions be entitled to receive interest
on such dividends or other distributions. If any cash or certificate
representing shares of Parent Common Stock is to be paid to or issued in a
name other than that in which the Certificate surrendered in exchange
therefor is registered, it shall be a condition of such exchange that
the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed and otherwise in
proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such exchange shall
pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other taxes required by reason of
the issuance of certificates for such shares of Parent Common Stock in a name
other than that of the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, or
shall establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such tax has
been paid or is not applicable. Parent or the Exchange Agent shall
be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement to any Person such amounts as Parent or the
Exchange Agent is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making
of such payment under the Code or under any provision of state, local or
foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent or the
Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the Person who otherwise would have
received the payment in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made by Parent or the Exchange Agent.

   

  Section 1.8 _No Fractional Securities_. No certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates pursuant to this  _Article I_ ; no Parent dividend or other distribution or stock split shall relate to any fractional share; and no fractional share shall entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a securityholder of Parent. In lieu of any such fractional share, each holder of Company Common Stock who would otherwise have been entitled to a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock upon surrender of Certificates for exchange pursuant to this _Article I_ will be paid an amount in cash (without interest), rounded down to the nearest cent, determined by multiplying (i) the last reported sale price per share of Parent Common Stock on The Nasdaq National Market (" _Nasdaq_ ") on the date of the Effective Time (or, if the shares of Parent Common Stock do not trade on Nasdaq on such date, the first date of trading of shares of Parent Common Stock on Nasdaq after the Effective Time) by (ii) the fractional interest of a share of Parent Common Stock to which such holder would otherwise be entitled. As promptly as practicable after the determination of the amount of cash, if any, to be paid to holders of fractional share interests, the Exchange Agent shall so notify Parent, and Parent shall deposit such amount with the Exchange Agent and shall cause the Exchange Agent to forward payments to such holders of fractional share interests subject to and in accordance with the terms of this  _Section 1.8_. No cash payment in lieu of fractional shares will be paid to any Person until such Person surrenders the related Certificate or Certificates. 

   

  Section 1.9 _Return of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which remains undistributed to the former stockholders of the Company for twelve (12) months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand of Parent, and any such former stockholders who have not theretofore complied with this _Article I_ shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of their claim for Parent Common Stock, Per Share Cash Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock and any dividends or distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock. None of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any former holder of Company Common Stock for any such shares of Parent Common Stock, Per Share Cash Consideration, cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock and dividends and distributions which are delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. 

    Section 1.10 _Adjustment of Per Share Merger Consideration_. In the event of any reclassification, stock split or stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into or exercisable for Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock) with respect to Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock or any change or conversion of Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock into other securities (or if a record date with respect to any of the foregoing should occur) on or after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time, appropriate and proportionate adjustments, if any, shall be made to the Per Share Merger Consideration, Exchange Ratio, Per Share Stock Consideration and Per Share Cash Consideration and all references to the Per Share Merger Consideration, Exchange Ratio, Per Share Stock Consideration and Per Share Cash Consideration in this Agreement shall be deemed to be to the Per Share Merger Consideration, Exchange Ratio, Per Share Stock Consideration and Per Share Cash Consideration as so adjusted. 

   

  Section 1.11 _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. All shares of Parent Common Stock issued and the Per Share Cash Consideration paid upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates in accordance with the terms hereof (including any cash paid pursuant to _Section 1.8_ ) shall be deemed to have been issued and paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock, together with the associated Rights, represented by such Certificates. 

   

  Section 1.12 _Closing of Company Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and no transfer of shares of Company Common Stock shall thereafter be made on the records of the Company.

  Section 1.13 _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent or the Exchange Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as Parent or the Exchange Agent may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent or Parent will issue and pay or cause to be issued and paid in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the shares of Parent Common Stock, Per Share Cash Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which the holder thereof is entitled pursuant to _Section 1.8_ , and any dividends or other distributions to which the holder thereof is entitled pursuant to _Section 1.7_. 

   

  Section 1.14 _Further Assurances_. If at any time after the Effective Time the Surviving Corporation shall consider or be advised that any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances or any other acts or things are necessary, desirable or proper (a) to vest, perfect or confirm, of record or otherwise, in the Surviving Corporation its right, title or interest in, to or under any of the rights, privileges, powers, franchises, properties or assets of either of the Constituent Corporations, or (b) otherwise to carry out the purposes of this

reasonable good faith judgment of the Board of Directors of Company, after
consultation with its outside financial advisors, would cause the proposal,

 For purposes of this _Section 5.6_ , each of the parties hereto acknowledges that this Agreement may only be deemed to be terminated by a party hereto pursuant to a single subsection of _Section 7.1_. 

  

  Section 5.7 Company Stock Plans and Company Stock Purchase Plan.

   

   (a)   Not later than the Effective Time, each Company Stock Option (and related stock  appreciation right (" _SAR_ ")) which is outstanding immediately  prior to the Effective Time pursuant to the Company Stock Option Plans shall be  assumed by Parent and become and represent an option and related SAR to purchase  the number of shares of Parent Common Stock (a _"Substitute  Option_ ") (decreased to the nearest full share) determined by  multiplying (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such  Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time by (ii) the Option  Exchange Ratio (as hereinafter defined), at an exercise price per share of  Parent Common Stock (rounded up to the nearest cent) equal to the exercise price  per share of Company Common Stock under such Company Stock Option immediately  prior to the Effective Time divided by the Option Exchange Ratio. After the  Effective Time, except as provided above in this _Section 5.7_ , each  Substitute Option shall be exercisable upon the same terms and conditions as  were applicable under the related Company Stock Option immediately prior to the

     Effective Time, after giving effect to any acceleration, lapse or other

The  certificates representing such shares of Parent Common Stock shall accordingly  be marked with appropriate legends noting such Unvested Share Restrictions. The  Company shall take all actions necessary to ensure that, from and after the  Effective Time, Parent (or its assignee) shall be entitled to exercise the  rights held by the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time with respect  to all Unvested Share Restrictions. For purposes of this Agreement, (i)  " _Unvested Company Share_ " means each outstanding share of  Company Common Stock issued under a Company Stock Option Plan or otherwise which  is subject to any Unvested Share Restrictions and (ii) " _Unvested Share  Restrictions_ " means all repurchase, cancellation, forfeiture, vesting  and other conditions or restrictions applicable to an Unvested Company Share.

   (d)   Parent, in its sole discretion, upon at least 10 days prior written notice to  the Company, may require the Company to cause the Company Stock Purchase Plan  and all rights thereunder to be suspended immediately following the close of any  Purchase Interval (as such term is defined in the Company Stock Purchase Plan)  ending after the date hereof, with the effect of such suspension being that no  offering period and no Purchase Interval shall commence or continue under such  plan during the period of such suspension. 

   

  Section 5.8 _Reasonable Best Efforts_. (a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of Parent and the Company agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the Merger, the Subsequent

    Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
using reasonable best efforts to accomplish the following: (i) causing the
conditions precedent set forth in _Article VI_ to be satisfied; (ii)
obtaining all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents, approvals,
orders and authorizations from Governmental Entities and from Persons other
than Governmental Entities and the making of all necessary registrations,
declarations and filings (including registrations, declarations and
filings with Governmental Entities, if any) and the taking of all reasonable
steps as may be necessary to avoid any suit, claim, action, investigation or
proceeding by any Governmental Entity; (iii) defending any suits, claims,
actions, investigations or proceedings, whether judicial or administrative,
challenging this Agreement, the consummation of the Merger, the Subsequent

Whenever any event occurs that is required to be set forth in an  amendment or supplement to any filing made pursuant hereto, Parent or the  Company, as the case may be, will promptly inform the other of such occurrence  and cooperate in filing with the applicable Governmental Entity such amendment  or supplement. 

   

   (c)   Each party shall use all reasonable best efforts to not take any action, or  enter into any transaction, which would cause any of its representations or  warranties contained in this Agreement to be untrue or result in a breach of any  covenant made by it in this Agreement. 

   

   (d)   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, (i)  neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates shall be required to divest or hold  separate or otherwise take or commit to take any action that limits its freedom  of action with respect to, or its ability to retain, the Company or any of the  businesses, product lines or assets of Parent, the Company or any of their  respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates, unless such action or actions would not,  individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to materially impair  the benefits sought to be derived by Parent from the transactions contemplated  by this Agreement, including the Merger and the Subsequent Merger, or have a  Material Adverse Effect on Parent and (ii) the Company shall not, without  Parents prior written consent, take or agree to take any such action. 

   

   (e)   At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall deliver to Parent all  consents, waivers or approvals obtained by the Company with respect to the  consummation of the Merger, the Subsequent Merger and the other transactions  contemplated by this Agreement. 

   

  Section 5.9 _Public Announcements_. The initial press release concerning the Merger shall be a joint press release of Parent and the Company. Thereafter, Parent and the Company will not issue any press release with respect to the Merger, the Subsequent Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or otherwise issue any written public statements with respect to such transactions without prior consultation with the other party, except as may be required by applicable law or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national securities exchange or the rules of Nasdaq. 

    Section 5.10 _State Takeover Laws_. If any "fair price," "business combination" or "control share acquisition" statute or other similar statute or regulation shall become applicable to the Merger, the Subsequent Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated hereby, Parent and the Company and their respective Boards of Directors shall use their reasonable best efforts to grant such approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that the Merger, the Subsequent Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act to minimize the effects of any such statute or regulation on the Merger, the Subsequent Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby. 

  

  Section 5.11  Indemnification; Directors and Officers
Insurance.

   

   (a)   Subject to applicable law, for six years from and after the Effective Time,  Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall, jointly and severally, (i) fulfill  and honor in all respects the obligations of the Company for indemnification and  advancement of expenses in favor of each past and present officer and director  of the Company (each, an " _Indemnified Party_ ") under the Company  Charter, the Company Bylaws or any indemnification agreement set forth in  Section 5.11 of the Company Letter to which such Indemnified Party is a party  and (ii) shall indemnify and hold harmless each Indemnified Party against any  costs or expenses (including but not limited to reasonable attorneys fees  and expenses), judgments, fines, losses, claims, settlements, damages or  liabilities (collectively, " _Costs_ ") incurred in connection with  any threatened or pending claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation,  whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (each, a  " _Proceeding_ "), whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or  after the Effective Time, if and whenever such Indemnified Party is or was a  party to or a subject of, or is threatened to be made a party to or a subject  of, such Proceeding arising out of or pertaining to acts or omissions or alleged  acts or omissions of the Indemnified Party occurring at or prior to the  Effective Time (including, without limitation, for acts or omissions occurring  in connection with the approval of this Agreement and the consummation of the  transactions contemplated hereby) in his or her capacity as an officer or  director of the Company or its wholly-owned Subsidiaries, to the fullest extent  permitted under the DGCL (and Parent shall also advance expenses to each  Indemnified Party as incurred to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL,  provided that Indemnified Party to whom expenses are advanced provides an  undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such  expenses can not be reimbursed or indemnified under the DGCL to the extent such  undertaking is required by the DGCL). The provisions of _Section  5.11(a)(ii)_ shall not require Parent to indemnify an Indemnified Party  hereunder in connection with a Proceeding commenced by such Indemnified Party. 

   

   (b)   Parent shall provide and maintain in effect, or shall cause the Surviving  Corporation to provide and maintain in effect, for an aggregate period of not  less than six (6) years from the Effective Time, for the benefit of those  Persons who are covered by the Companys directors and officers  liability insurance policy as of the date hereof an insurance and  indemnification policy that provides coverage for acts or omissions occurring at

     or prior to the Effective Time (including, without limitation, for acts
or  omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement and
the  consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby) (the " _D andO 
Insurance_") that is at least as favorable (with respect to coverage, 
amounts, limits, deductibles and conditions) to the Companys existing 
policy; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent and the Surviving  Corporation
shall not be required to pay an annual premium for the DandO  Insurance in
excess of 200% of the annual premium currently paid by the Company  for such
coverage (the " _Company s Current Premium_"). If  such premiums for such
insurance would at any time exceed 200% of the  Companys Current Premium,
then Parent shall maintain the maximum amount of  coverage under a policy
having the same deductible as is available for such 200%  of the Companys
Current Premium. The Company represents and warrants to  Parent that the
Companys Current Premium is $1,240,000. Notwithstanding  the foregoing,
Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause coverage to  be
extended under the Companys DandO Insurance by obtaining a six-year  "tail"
policy, provided that the cost of such tail coverage does not  exceed $3
million. If Parent is unable to obtain such tail policy, Parent shall 
provide the Company with notice thereof at least 5 business days prior to
the  Effective Time. If the Company receives such notice from Parent, the
Company may  purchase such tail policy, provided that the cost of such tail
coverage does not  exceed $3 million. Such tail policy shall satisfy Parents
and the  Surviving Corporations obligations under the provisions of this
_Section  5.11(b)_.

   

   (c)   The provisions of this _Section 5.11_ are intended to be for the benefit  of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties and their heirs  and estates and such provisions may not be terminated or amended in any manner  adverse to the interests of such Person without his or her prior consent. 

   

   (d)   Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any claim, action, suit,  proceeding or investigation is made against an Indemnified Party, for which such  Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification hereunder, on or prior to the  sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the provisions of this _Section  5.11_ shall continue in effect, solely with respect to such matters, until  the final disposition of such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation. 

   

   (e)   In the event the Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective  successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and  shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation of such consolidation or  merger, or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties to any  Person, then, and in each case, to the extent necessary to effect such  assumption, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of  the Parent and the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the  obligations set forth in this _Section 5.11_. 

   

  Section 5.12 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to give prompt notice to the Company, and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to give prompt notice to Parent, of: (i) the occurrence, or non-occurrence, of any event the occurrence, or non-occurrence, of which it has Knowledge and which would be reasonably likely to cause (x) any representation or warranty of the notifying party contained in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect or (y) any covenant, condition or agreement of the notifying party contained in this Agreement not to be complied with or satisfied in all material respects, (ii) any material failure of the notifying party

    to comply in a timely manner with or satisfy any material covenant,
condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder or
(iii) any change, event or effect which would, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on the notifying party; _provided_
, _however_ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this _Section
5.12_ shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to
the party receiving such notice; and _provided_ ,  _further_ , that a failure
to comply with this _Section 5.12_ shall not cause the failure of any
condition set forth in Article VI to be satisfied unless the
underlying untruth, inaccuracy, noncompliance, failure or Material Adverse
Effect would independently result in the failure of a condition set forth in
Article VI to be satisfied.

   

  Section 5.13 _Employee Benefit Plans and Agreements_. (a) Parent agrees that it will cause the Surviving Corporation from and after the Effective Time to honor all Company Plans and all employment, severance and change in control agreements entered into by the Company prior to the date hereof and described in Section 3.12 of the Company Letter; _provided_ , _however_ , that, except as provided in this Section 5.13, nothing in this Agreement shall be interpreted as limiting the power of Parent or the Surviving Corporation to amend or terminate any Company Plan or any other individual employee benefit plan, program, Contract or policy (provided that such amendment or termination is permitted by its terms) or as requiring Parent or the Surviving Corporation to offer to continue (other than as required by its terms) any written employment contract. Except as otherwise provided herein, following the Effective Time and continuing at least until December 31, 2004, employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries (i) shall continue to participate in all "welfare plans" and "pension plans," as such terms are defined in Sections 3(1) and 3(2), respectively, of ERISA, which are maintained by the Company and in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) shall be eligible for benefits other than those described in clause (i) (" _Non-ERISA Benefits_ ") which in the aggregate are substantially comparable to the Non-ERISA Benefits provided by the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that the employee stock purchase plans maintained by Parent and the Company shall be deemed comparable to each other for this purpose. After December 31, 2004, employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries shall be eligible for the Parent Plans on the same terms as such plans and arrangements are generally offered from time to time to employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries in comparable positions. 

   

   (b)   Parent shall cause each Parent Plan covering employees of the Company or its  Subsidiaries to recognize prior service of such employees with the Company and  its Subsidiaries or their predecessors (to the extent recognized under the  analogous Company Plans) as service with Parent and its Subsidiaries for  purposes of eligibility (including eligibility for early retirement benefits)  and vesting (but not benefit accrual) under any Parent Plan that is a  "pension plan" (as defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA). 

   

   (c)   To the extent any employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries first becomes  eligible to participate in a Parent Plan that is a "welfare plan," as  defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA, after January 1, 2005, Parent shall take  such action as is appropriate to effect the integration of such employee into  such Parent Plan, which shall include (i) waiving all pre-existing  conditions and waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage  requirements applicable to such employee and his or her eligible dependents  under such Parent Plan, except to the extent such pre-existing conditions or  waiting periods applied immediately prior thereto under the analogous Company  Plan and (ii) providing such employee and his or her eligible dependents

     with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid prior to becoming
eligible  to participate in such Parent Plan under an analogous Company Plan
(to the same  extent that such credit was given under such Company Plan) in
satisfying any  applicable deductible or annual maximum out-of-pocket
requirements under such  Parent Plan.

   

   (d)   Following the Effective Time, employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries  shall accrue vacation under a policy maintained by Parent for employees in  comparable positions; provided, however, that no such employee shall accrue  vacation at a rate less than the rate at which such employee was accruing  vacation for the calendar year in which the Effective Time occurs under the  policy maintained by the Company. 

   

   (e)   The employee sabbatical program maintained by the Company immediately prior to  the Effective Time (the _"Sabbatical Program_ ") shall terminate  as of the Effective Time and, in lieu of the benefits otherwise provided  thereunder, and subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this _Section  5.13(e)_ , Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to make cash payments  to employees who are eligible to participate in the Sabbatical Program as of the  date hereof, based on the years of eligibility service which they have accrued  under the terms and conditions of the Sabbatical Program immediately prior to  the Effective Time (including the method of crediting service applicable to  former employees of Marconi Communications, Inc. or its Affiliates  (" _Marconi_ ") pursuant to the terms of the Asset Sale Agreement,  dated January 5, 2004, as amended, between Parent and Marconi). If an  eligible employee has accrued five or more years of eligibility service as of  the Effective Time, then such employee shall receive a cash payment, not later  than 30 days after the Effective Time, in an amount equal to six times such  employees weekly rate of base pay. If an eligible employee has accrued  fewer than five years of eligibility service as of the Effective Time, then such  employee shall receive a cash payment in an amount equal to the product of (i)  six times the employees weekly rate of base pay and (ii) a fraction, the  numerator of which is the number of months of eligibility service credited to  such employee under the Sabbatical Program immediately prior to the Effective  Time, rounded up to the nearest whole month, and the denominator of which is 60;  _provided_ , _however_ , that such payment shall be subject to, and  payable within 30 days after, such employees (x) continuous employment by  Parent or any of its Affiliates through the 12-month anniversary of the  Effective Time or (y) the termination of such employment prior to the 12-month  anniversary of the Effective Time due to an involuntary termination by Parent or  any of its Affiliates (other than as a result of death, disability or for cause)  or a voluntary termination by such employee for "good reason" or  pursuant to a "qualifying resignation" (as defined in the severance  plan or agreement pursuant to which such employee is eligible for severance  benefits). No employee shall receive a cash payment pursuant to this _Section  5.13(e)_ in excess of six times such employees weekly rate of base pay. 

   

   (f)   Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation (or any successor thereto)  (i) to maintain the Companys Change-in-Control Severance Plan, as in  effect on the date hereof, for a period not less than six months after the  Effective Time, and (ii) to maintain the severance plan and agreements  applicable to former employees of Marconi, as set forth in Section 5.13(f)  of the Company Letter, through December 31, 2004.

quarters ending therein, to those persons employed by the Company or its 
Subsidiaries immediately before the Effective Time and who are eligible 
thereunder, equal to a percentage of base salary based upon actual
performance  (provided, that Parent shall be entitled to make such
adjustments in the  performance goals of the MIP as it shall deem appropriate
in light of any  changes in circumstance following the Effective Time that do
not materially  reduce either the amount as a percentage of base compensation
or the likelihood  of achievement of the goals). Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained  herein, any employee whose employment terminates
prior to December 31, 2004 due  to an involuntary termination by Parent or
any of its Affiliates (other than as  a result of death, disability or for
cause) or a voluntary termination by such  employee for "good reason" or
pursuant to a "qualifying  resignation" (as defined in the severance plan or
agreement pursuant to  which such employee is eligible for severance
benefits) shall be entitled to (i)  a prorated bonus for the quarter during
which the employees employment  terminates, based on the employees period
of employment during such  quarter, (ii) the bonus earned for any prior
quarter during 2004 but not yet  paid and (iii) a prorated bonus for the
"fifth quarter," within the  meaning of the MIP, based on the employees
period of employment during  2004, and in each case based on the employees
annualized base salary and  the achievement of actual performance goals.
Bonus payments pursuant to this  Section 5.13 shall be in addition to any
benefits to which the employee is  entitled under any applicable severance
plan or agreement.

   

  Section 5.14 _Nasdaq_. Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in the Merger to be approved for listing on Nasdaq, subject to official notice of issuance, prior to the Effective Time. The Surviving Corporation shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its shares of Common Stock and associated Rights to no longer be quoted on Nasdaq and to be de-registered under the Exchange Act as soon as practicable following the Effective Time. 

   

  Section 5.15 _Rights Agreement_. Without the prior written consent of Parent, the Company shall not redeem the Rights issued under the Rights Agreement or amend or terminate the Rights Agreement prior to the Effective Time unless required to do so by a court of competent jurisdiction. 

   

  Section 5.16 _Board of Directors Representative_. Immediately after the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint John A. Schofield, William L. Keever and Frank Ianna, or such other three persons to be agreed upon by Parent and the Company prior to the Effective Time, to the Board of Directors of Parent, as a Class I director, a Class II director and a Class III director, respectively. Prior to such appointment, the Board of Directors of Parent shall take all necessary action to increase the size of the Board of Directors of Parent as necessary to comply with the foregoing sentence. 

   

  Section 5.17 _Section 16 Matters_. The Board of Directors of the Company and Parent shall, prior to the Effective Time, to the extent permitted by law, take all such actions as may be necessary or appropriate pursuant to Rule 16b-3(d) and Rule 16b-3(e) to exempt (i) the conversion of Company Common Stock into cash or Parent Common Stock and the conversion of Company Stock Options into Substitute Options and (ii) the acquisition of Parent Common Stock and the right to receive Parent Common Stock (including pursuant to Substitute Options) pursuant to the terms of this Agreement by officers and directors of the Company subject to the

    reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act or by employees
or directors of the Company who may become an officer or director of Parent
subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act.
Parent and the Company shall provide to counsel to the other party copies of

The  parties hereby irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of the courts of the State  of Delaware and the federal courts of the United States of America located in  the State of Delaware solely in respect of the interpretation and enforcement of  the provisions of this Agreement and of the documents referred to in this  Agreement, and in respect of the Merger, the Subsequent Merger and the other  transactions contemplated hereby, and hereby waive, and agree not to assert, as  a defense in any action, suit or proceeding for the interpretation or  enforcement hereof or of any such document, that it is not subject thereto or  that such action, suit or proceeding may not be brought or is not maintainable  in said courts or that the venue thereof may not be appropriate or that this  Agreement or any such document may not be enforced in or by such courts, and the  parties hereto irrevocably agree that all claims with respect to such action or  proceeding shall be heard and determined in such a Delaware state or federal  court. The parties hereby consent to and grant any such court jurisdiction over  the person of such parties and over the subject matter of such dispute and agree  that mailing of process or other papers in connection with any such action or  proceeding in the manner provided in _Section 8.2_ or in such other manner  as may be permitted by law shall be valid and sufficient service thereof. 

   

   (b)   EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER  THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND  THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY  RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION  DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE MERGER,  THE SUBSEQUENT MERGER OR ANY OF THE OTHER TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS  AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (i) NO REPRESENTATIVE,  AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE,  THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE  FOREGOING WAIVER, (ii) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE  IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (iii) EACH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND  (iv) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER  THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 8.6_. 

   

  Section 8.7 _Assignment_. Subject to _Section 1.1_ , neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties hereto (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other parties. 

    Section 8.8 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or public policy, all other terms, conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic and legal substance of the Merger, the Subsequent Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby are not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the Merger, the Subsequent Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible. 

   

  Section 8.9 _Enforcement of this Agreement_. In addition to any remedy to which any party hereto is specifically entitled by the terms hereof, each party shall be entitled to pursue any other remedy available to it at law or in equity (including damages, specific performance or other injunctive relief) in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their terms or were otherwise breached.
