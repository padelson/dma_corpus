Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in
accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the

          fails to establish his or its entitlement to appraisal rights as provided in
          Section 262 of the DGCL, if so required, or (ii) if a court shall determine that
          such holder is not entitled to receive payment for his or its shares or such
          holder shall otherwise lose his or its appraisal rights, then, in any such case,
          each share of Company Common Stock, together with the associated Rights, held of

          certificates representing such Dissenting Shares. The Company shall give Parent

          such shares, and Parent and Sub shall have the right to participate in all
          negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands except as required by

dividends or other distributions be entitled to receive interest on such dividends or
other distributions. If any cash or certificate representing shares of Parent Common Stock
is to be paid to or issued in a name other than that in which the Certificate surrendered
in exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a condition of such exchange that the
Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for
transfer and that the Person requesting such exchange shall pay to the Exchange Agent any
transfer or other taxes required by reason of the issuance of certificates for such shares
of Parent Common Stock in a name other than that of the registered holder of the
Certificate surrendered, or shall establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that
such tax has been paid or is not applicable. Parent or the Exchange Agent shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement to any Person such amounts as Parent or the Exchange Agent is required to deduct
and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or under any
provision of state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld
by Parent or the Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes
of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person who otherwise would have received the
payment in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent or the
Exchange Agent. </FONT></P>

Section 1.8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>No Fractional
Securities</U>. No certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates pursuant to this
<U>Article I</U>; no Parent dividend or other distribution or stock split shall relate to
any fractional share; and no fractional share shall entitle the owner thereof to vote or
to any other rights of a securityholder of Parent. In lieu of any such fractional share,
each holder of Company Common Stock who would otherwise have been entitled to a fraction
of a share of Parent Common Stock upon surrender of Certificates for exchange pursuant to
this <U>Article I</U> will be paid an amount in cash (without interest), rounded down to
the nearest cent, determined by multiplying (i) the last reported sale price per share of
Parent Common Stock on The Nasdaq National Market (&#147;<U>Nasdaq</U>&#148;) on the date
of the Effective Time (or, if the shares of Parent Common Stock do not trade on Nasdaq on
such date, the first date of trading of shares of Parent Common Stock on Nasdaq after the
Effective Time) by (ii) the fractional interest of a share of Parent Common Stock to which
such holder would otherwise be entitled. As promptly as practicable after the
determination of the amount of cash, if any, to be paid to holders of fractional share
interests, the Exchange Agent shall so notify Parent, and Parent shall deposit such amount
with the Exchange Agent and shall cause the Exchange Agent to forward payments to such
holders of fractional share interests subject to and in accordance with the terms of this
<U>Section 1.8</U>. No cash payment in lieu of fractional shares will be paid to any
Person until such Person surrenders the related Certificate or Certificates. </FONT></P>

Section 2.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <U>Organization, Standing

and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware and has the requisite
corporate power and authority to carry on its business as now being conducted. Each
Subsidiary (as hereinafter defined) of Parent is duly organized, validly existing and in
good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction in which it is organized and has the
requisite corporate (in the case of a Subsidiary that is a corporation) or other power and
authority to carry on its business as now being conducted, except where the failure to be
so organized, existing or in good standing or to have such power or authority would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect (as hereinafter defined)

in good standing, in each jurisdiction where the character of their properties owned or
held under lease or the nature of their activities makes such qualification or good
standing necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified and in good standing would

or when taken together with all other events, effects, changes or developments, is, or
would reasonably be expected to be, materially adverse to the business, assets,

case may be, with their respective covenants contained in this Agreement; (iii) factors
affecting the industry in which the Company or Parent, as the case may be, operates
generally or affecting the economy or financial markets as a whole (which factors in each
case do not disproportionately affect Parent or the Company, as the case may be, as
compared to other comparable companies in their industry in any material respect); (iv)
changes in any applicable law, ordinance, administrative or governmental rule or
regulation after the date hereof; and (v) any failure by Parent or the Company, as the
case may be, to meet analysts revenue or earnings projections, in and of itself, or the
trading price of the Company Common Stock or Parent Common Stock, as the case may be, in
and of itself (it being understood that any event, effect, change or development which
affects or otherwise relates to the failure to meet analysts revenue or earnings
projections or the trading price, other than an event, effect, change or development set
forth in <U>clauses (i) </U>through <U>(iv)</U> above, may be deemed to constitute, or be
