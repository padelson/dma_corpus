each case, calculated as of 11:59 p.m. (Eastern Time) on the day immediately
preceding the Closing Date. The items comprising the Estimated Closing
Statement shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP, as adjusted by the
accounting principles, practices, policies, judgments and methodologies set
forth on _Schedule 1.1(c)_, without giving effect to the consummation of the
Merger, including any payments or cash in respect of the Merger Consideration,
Outstanding Company Expenses or any repayment of Indebtedness. The Company
shall provide Buyer with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the
Estimated Closing Statement and components thereof, and shall consider in good
faith any revisions to the Estimated Closing Statement proposed by Buyer.

 



 

3.4. _Adjustment Amount_.

 



 

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable following the Closing Date, and in any
event within sixty (60) calendar days thereof, Buyer shall prepare and deliver
to the Holder Representative a written statement (the " _Closing Statement_ ")
setting forth (i) a calculation of Net Working Capital (" _Closing Date Net
Working Capital_ "), (ii) a calculation of the aggregate amount of all
Indebtedness of the Company (" _Closing Date Indebtedness_ "), (iii) a
calculation of Cash of the Company (" _Closing Date Cash_ ") and (iv) a
calculation of Outstanding Company Expenses (" _Closing Date Outstanding
Company Expenses_ "), in each case, calculated as of 11:59 p.m. (Eastern Time)
on the day immediately preceding the Closing Date. The items comprising the
Closing Statement shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP, as adjusted by
the accounting practices, policies, judgments and methodologies set forth on
_Schedule 1.1(c)_ , without giving effect to the consummation of the Merger,
including any payments or cash in respect of the Merger Consideration,
Outstanding Company Expenses or any repayment of Indebtedness. Following the
Closing, Buyer shall provide the Holder Representative and its representatives

 



      
 

 



 

reasonable access (upon reasonable notice and during normal business hours) to
the records, properties, personnel and (subject to the execution of customary
work paper access letters if requested) auditors of the Company and its
Subsidiaries relating to the preparation of the Closing Statement and shall
cause the personnel of the Company and its Subsidiaries to reasonably
cooperate with the Holder Representative in connection with its review of the
Closing Statement.

 



 

(b) If the Holder Representative shall disagree with the calculation of
Closing Date Net Working Capital, Closing Date Indebtedness, Closing Date
Outstanding Company Expenses and/or Closing Date Cash, it shall notify Buyer
of such disagreement in writing, setting forth in reasonable detail the
particulars of such disagreement, within thirty (30) days after its receipt of
the Closing Statement. In the event that the Holder Representative does not
provide such a notice of disagreement within such thirty (30)-day period, the
Holder Representative and Buyer shall be deemed to have accepted the Closing
Statement and the calculation of Closing Date Net Working Capital, Closing
Date Indebtedness, Closing Date Outstanding Company Expenses and Closing Date
Cash delivered by Buyer, which shall be final, binding and conclusive for all
purposes hereunder. In the event any such notice of disagreement is timely
provided, Buyer and the Holder Representative shall use commercially
reasonable efforts for a period of twenty (20) days (or such longer period as
they may mutually agree) to resolve any disagreements with respect to the
calculations of Closing Date Net Working Capital, Closing Date Indebtedness,
Closing Date Outstanding Company Expenses and/or Closing Date Cash. If, at the
end of such period, Buyer and the Holder Representative are unable to resolve
such disagreements, then any such remaining disagreements shall be resolved by
an independent accounting or financial consulting firm of recognized national
standing as may be mutually selected by Buyer and the Holder Representative
(such firm, subject to the following proviso, the " _Auditor_ "); _provided_ ,
that if the Holder Representative and Buyer cannot agree on the Auditor,
either Party may request that the American Arbitration Association (the "
_AAA_ ") choose the Auditor, in which case the AAAs choice of the Auditor
will be binding and the expenses of the AAA will be shared 50% by Buyer and
50% by the Holder Representative (on behalf of the Holders). Each of Buyer and
the Holder Representative shall promptly provide their assertions regarding
the disputed elements of Closing Date Net Working Capital, Closing Date
Indebtedness, Closing Date Outstanding Company Expenses and/or Closing Date
Cash in writing to the Auditor and to each other. The Auditor shall be
instructed to render its determination with respect to such disagreements as
soon as reasonably practicable (which the Parties hereto agree should not be
later than forty-five (45) days following the day on which the disagreement is
referred to the Auditor). The Auditor shall base its determination solely on
(i) the written submissions of the Parties and shall not conduct an
independent investigation and (ii) the extent (if any) to which Closing Date
Net Working Capital, Closing Date Indebtedness, Closing Date Outstanding
Company Expenses and/or Closing Date Cash require adjustment (only with
respect to the remaining disagreements submitted to the Auditor) in order to
be determined in accordance with _Section 3.4(a)_ (including the definitions
of the defined terms used in _Section 3.4(a)_) and must be based solely in
accordance with the terms and provisions of this Agreement. The determination
of the Auditor shall be final, conclusive and binding on the Parties. The date
on which Closing Date Net Working Capital, Closing Date Indebtedness, Closing
Date Outstanding Company Expenses and/or Closing Date Cash are finally
determined in accordance with this _Section 3.4(b)_ is hereinafter referred
to as the " _Determination Date_." All fees and expenses of the Auditor
relating to the work, if any, to be performed by the Auditor hereunder

 



      
 

 



 

shall be borne 50% by Buyer and 50% by the Holder Representative, as a Holder
Allocable Expense.

 



 

(c) The " _Adjustment Amount_ ," which may be positive or negative, shall mean
(i) Closing Date Net Working Capital (as finally determined in accordance with
_Section 3.4(b)_), _minus_ Estimated Closing Date Net Working Capital, _plus_
(ii) Estimated Closing Date Indebtedness, _minus_ Closing Date Indebtedness
(as finally determined in accordance with _Section 3.4(b)_), _plus_ (iii)
Closing Date Cash (as finally determined in accordance with _Section
3.4(b)_), _minus_ Estimated Closing Date Cash, _plus_ (iv) Estimated
Outstanding Company Expenses, _minus_ Outstanding Company Expenses (as finally
determined in accordance with _Section 3.4(b)_). If the Adjustment Amount is
a positive number, then the Merger Consideration shall be increased by the
Adjustment Amount, and if the Adjustment Amount is a negative number, the
Merger Consideration shall be decreased by the absolute value of the
Adjustment Amount. The Adjustment Amount shall be paid in accordance with
_Section 3.4(d)_.

 



 

(d) The Adjustment Escrow Amount shall be held and invested by the Escrow
Agent in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement. If the Adjustment
Amount is a positive number, then, promptly following the Determination Date,
and in any event within three (3) Business Days of the Determination Date,
Buyer shall pay to the Paying Agent an amount in cash equal to the Adjustment
Amount, and the Escrow Agent shall release the Adjustment Escrow funds to the
Paying Agent, to be paid by the Paying Agent to Holders pursuant to their
respective Post-Closing Payment Allocation. If the Adjustment Amount is a
negative number (the absolute value of such amount, the " _Deficit Amount_ "),
then, promptly following the Determination Date, and in any event within three
(3) Business Days of the Determination Date, the Escrow Agent shall pay to
Buyer an amount out of Adjustment Escrow Funds equal to the Deficit Amount
(and, to the extent the Deficit Amount is less than the Adjustment Escrow
Funds, the Escrow Agent shall release the difference between the Deficit
Amount and the Adjustment Escrow Funds to the Paying Agent, to be paid by the
Paying Agent to Holders according to their respective Post-Closing Payment
Allocation. If the Deficit Amount exceeds the Adjustment Escrow Funds, Buyer
shall be entitled to be paid such difference from the Indemnity Escrow Funds.
Upon determination of the Adjustment Amount pursuant to _Section 3.4(a)_ and
_Section 3.4(b)_, each of Buyer and the Holder Representative shall execute
joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to
disburse Adjustment Escrow Funds in accordance with this _Section 3.4(c)_.

 



 

3.5. _Holder Allocable Expenses_. On the Closing Date, Buyer shall pay to the
Holder Representative an amount in cash equal to $500,000 (the " _Holder
Allocable Expenses_ "), which shall be used by the Holder Representative in
its capacity as such. Whether or not paid on or prior to the Closing Date, no
amount shall be included on the Closing Statement with respect to liabilities
for the Holder Allocable Expenses.

 



 

3.6. _Outstanding Company Expenses_. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company
shall provide to Buyer a written report setting forth a list of the following
fees and expenses incurred by the Company in connection with the preparation,
negotiation and execution of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, solely to the extent such fees and expenses
are unpaid as of immediately prior to the Effective Time: (a) the fees and
disbursements of outside counsel to the Company in connection with the
transactions

 



      
 

 



 

contemplated by this Agreement, (b) the fees, costs and expenses of any other
agents, advisors, consultants, experts, service providers and financial
advisors employed by the Company in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (c) all Transaction Payments and (d) all fees
payable by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (excluding, for the
avoidance of doubt, payment of the Merger Consideration) to any stockholder of
the Company or any Affiliate of such Person in connection with this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby (collectively, the " _Outstanding
Company Expenses_ "). Immediately prior to the Effective Time and concurrently
with the payment to the Paying Agent of the Funding Amount, Buyer shall pay to
the Paying Agent or, in the case of Transaction Payments, to the Company, by
wire transfer of immediately available funds an amount equal to the
Outstanding Company Expenses. No amount shall be included on the Closing
Statement with respect to liabilities for the Outstanding Company Expenses
paid in accordance with this _Section 3.6_. For the avoidance of doubt, no
amounts payable in connection with the repayment of the Indebtedness or any
amounts in connection with the Committed Financing or any Alternative
Financing shall be included in the Outstanding Company Expenses.

 



 

3.7. _Repayment of Indebtedness_. Immediately prior to the Closing, and
subject to the other terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, (a)
Buyer or Merger Sub shall make available to the Company, or pay directly, an
amount sufficient to pay all amounts owing with respect to the Indebtedness of
the Company and its Subsidiaries on the Closing Date (but immediately prior to
the Closing), (b) the Company, if such amount is not paid directly by Buyer or
Merger Sub, shall apply such cash to pay all amounts owing with respect to the
Indebtedness of the Company and its Subsidiaries on the Closing Date (but
immediately prior to the Closing), (c) Buyer or Merger Sub shall (and the
Company shall cause the Company and the officers, employees and advisors,
including legal and accounting, of the Company and its Subsidiaries to use
commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with Buyer and Merger Sub to)
substitute, replace, cash collateralize, backstop or enter into any other
arrangement with respect to letters of credit that is reasonably necessary to
cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to be fully and irrevocably released on
the Closing Date (but immediately prior to the Closing) from all Liens
relating to such letters of credit (other than Liens on any such cash
collateral), (d) the Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries,
to be fully and irrevocably released prior to Closing from all obligations and
Liens relating to the Indebtedness of the Company and its Subsidiaries on the
Closing Date (but immediately prior to the Closing) (other than contingent
reimbursement, indemnification and similar obligations in respect of which no
claim has been made which customarily survive repayment of similar types of
indebtedness) and (e) the Company shall cause the applicable lenders of the
Indebtedness of the Company and its Subsidiaries on the Closing Date (but
immediately prior to the Closing) to deliver to Buyer (A) payoff letters (or
other evidence in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Buyer) with
respect to all the Indebtedness of the Company and its Subsidiaries on the
Closing Date (but immediately prior to the Closing) evidencing the
satisfaction of all liabilities thereunder upon receipt of the amounts set
forth therein (other than contingent reimbursement, indemnification and
similar obligations in respect of which no claim has been made which
customarily survive repayment of similar types of indebtedness) and (B) full
and irrevocable releases in customary forms concurrently with the repayment of
obligations giving rise thereto of all Liens relating to such Indebtedness
(other than Liens on any cash collateral described in clause (b) above);
_provided_ , that in the case of clauses (d) and (e), so long as all Liens are
contractually released as of the Closing and so long as customary further
assurance provisions are contained in such

 



      
 

 



 

payoff letters, the Company shall not be required to effect filings and/or
modifications to title with respect to vehicles on or prior to the Closing.

 



 

3.8. _Paying Agent_. Promptly following the date which is six (6) months after
the Effective Time, Buyer shall instruct the Paying Agent to deliver to the
Surviving Corporation all cash, Certificates and other documents in its
possession relating to the transactions contemplated hereby. Thereafter, each
Holder of a Certificate (other than Certificates representing Dissenting
Shares or Cancelled Shares) may surrender such Certificate to the Surviving
Corporation and (subject to applicable abandoned property, escheat and similar
Laws) receive in consideration therefor, and the Surviving Corporation shall
promptly pay, the portion of the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect
thereof as determined in accordance with this _Article III_ without any
interest thereon.

 



 

3.9. _Lost Certificate_. In the event any Certificate has been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, and in accordance with the
Paying Agent Agreement, the Paying Agent shall issue in exchange for such
lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration deliverable in
respect thereof as determined in accordance with this _Article III_, without
any requirement to post any bond or other security.

 



 

3.10. _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this
_Article III_, the Dissenting Shares shall not be converted into a right to
receive any portion of the Merger Consideration and the holders thereof shall
be entitled to such rights as are granted by Section 262 of the DGCL to the
extent that such rights were not waived by such holders by execution of the
Stockholders Agreement. Each holder of Dissenting Shares who is entitled to
exercise the rights granted by Section 262 of the DGCL pursuant to the
immediately preceding sentence and who becomes entitled to payment for such
shares pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL shall receive payment therefor from
the Surviving Corporation in accordance with the DGCL; _provided_ , _however_
, that (i) if any such holder of Dissenting Shares shall have failed to
establish such holders entitlement to appraisal rights as provided in Section
262 of the DGCL, or (ii) if any such holder of Dissenting Shares shall have
effectively withdrawn such holders demand for appraisal of such shares or
lost such holders right to appraisal and payment for such holders shares
under Section 262 of the DGCL, such holder shall forfeit the right to
appraisal of such shares and each such share shall not constitute a Dissenting
Share and shall be treated as if it had been a Common Share immediately prior
to the Effective Time and converted, as of the Effective Time, into a right to
receive from the Surviving Corporation the portion of the Merger Consideration
deliverable in respect thereof as determined in accordance with this _Article
III_, without any interest thereon. The Company shall serve prompt notice to
Buyer of any demands for appraisal of any Common Shares, attempted withdrawals
of such notices or demands and any other instruments received by the Company
relating to rights to appraisal, and Buyer shall have the right to participate
in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands.
The Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Buyer (not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), make any payment with respect
to, settle or offer to settle, any such demands, and prior to the Effective
Time, Buyer shall not, without the prior written consent of the Company (not
to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), make any payment with
respect to, settle or offer to settle, any such demands.

 



      
 

 



 

3.11. _Withholding_. Buyer, Merger Sub, the Company, the Holder
Representative, the Paying Agent and the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise paid pursuant to this
Agreement, to any person such amounts that Buyer, Merger Sub, the Company, the
Holder Representative, the Paying Agent or the Escrow Agent is required to
deduct and withhold with respect to any such deliveries and payments under the
Code or any provision of state, local, provincial or foreign Tax law. To the
extent that amounts are so withheld, and deposited with the appropriate
Governmental Authority, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the person in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made. To the extent that Buyer or the
Company becomes aware of any withholding Taxes applicable to the payment of
the Merger Consideration (other than Management Equity Compensation), such
Person shall (i) provide prompt written notice to the other Person of the
amount of such Tax and (ii) consult with such other Person in good faith as to
the nature of the Tax and the basis upon which such withholding is required.
Buyer, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation and the Holder
Representative agree to use their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
exemptions from, or reductions of, any Taxes required to be withheld from
payments under this Agreement.

 



 

3.12. _Compensatory Payments_. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement
to the contrary, to the extent payment of any consideration under this
Agreement with respect to Common Shares, shares of Series B Preferred Stock,
Phantom Common Shares or Phantom Series B Shares shall be treated as
compensation income subject to income and employment tax withholdings ("
_Management Equity Compensation_ "), then Buyer, the Paying Agent or the
Escrow Agent shall make any such payments to the Company and the Company shall
on behalf of Buyer, the Paying Agent or the Escrow Agent, make such payment,
net of all applicable Tax withholdings thereon, to the holder of such Common
Shares, shares of Series B Preferred Stock, Phantom Common Shares and Phantom
Series B Shares through the Companys payroll system, and the Company shall
satisfy and be responsible for remitting all Tax withholdings thereon.

 



 

3.13. _Accounts Receivable_.

 



 

(a) From and after the Closing until the date that is eighteen (18) months
after the Closing Date, Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
collect all accounts receivable of the Company and its Subsidiaries arising
prior to the Closing Date, whether or not invoiced or billed (the " _Pre-
Closing Accounts Receivable_ "); it being understood that Buyers obligation
to use commercially reasonable efforts may be satisfied by continuing and, if
necessary, renewing, one or more of the Companys current accounts receivable
servicing agreements with the applicable counterparties thereto (the "
_Account Servicers_ ") and maintaining, monitoring and authorizing the Account
Servicers collection efforts in a manner substantially consistent with
practices of the Company prior to the Closing Date, as may be adjusted, from
and after the three (3) month anniversary of the Closing Date, to take into
account the declining balance of the Pre-Closing Accounts Receivable over
time. Buyer and the Company shall continue to maintain the IT Systems in
accordance with historical practices, and shall not make any (i) material
modifications to the Contracts in effect with the applicable Account
Servicers; (ii) material modifications to the IT Systems applicable to the
Pre-Closing Accounts Receivable; or (iii) material adjustments to the
Companys employees with responsibility for supervising the Pre-Closing
Accounts Receivable (other than, from and after the three (3) month
anniversary of the Closing Date, adjustments to take into account the
declining balance of the Pre-Closing

 



      
 

 



 

Accounts Receivable over time), in each case, without the prior written
consent of the Holder Representative (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned). Buyer and the Holder Representative shall
regularly consult regarding the status of the collection of the Pre-Closing
Accounts Receivable. Without limiting the foregoing, following the Closing,
Buyer shall provide the Holder Representative and its representatives
reasonable access (upon reasonable notice and during normal business hours) to
the records, properties and personnel of the Company and its Subsidiaries
relating to the collection of the Pre-Closing Accounts Receivable and shall
cause the personnel of the Company and its Subsidiaries to reasonably
cooperate with the Holder Representative in connection with its review of the
Pre-Closing Accounts Receivable collection efforts.

 



 

(b) Buyer shall be entitled to retain all amounts collected in respect of the
Pre-Closing Accounts Receivable up to the Accounts Receivable Threshold. Any
amounts collected in respect of the Pre-Closing Accounts Receivable in excess
of the Accounts Receivable Threshold (any such amount, an " _Excess Receivable
Amount_ " and such amounts in the aggregate, the " _Excess Receivable Fund_ ")
shall be allocated as follows:

 



 

(i) First, Buyer shall be entitled to retain ten percent (10%) of the Excess
Receivable Fund (the " _Retention Amount_ ");

 



 

(ii) Second, any Excess Receivable Amounts collected in excess of the
Retention Amount shall be paid by Buyer to the Escrow Agent for further
deposit into the Indemnity Escrow Funds until the aggregate amount so
deposited (together with any amount deposited pursuant to _Section 3.4(d)_
and/or _Section 3.13(d)_) is equal to the Indemnity Escrow Cap;

 



 

(iii) Third, to the extent the Excess Receivable Fund (less the Retention
Amount) exceeds the Indemnity Escrow Cap, the excess shall be distributed
twenty percent (20%) to Buyer and eighty percent (80%) to the Paying Agent for
further distribution to the Holders in accordance with such Holders relative
Post-Closing Payment Allocation.

 



 

(c) In the event that, following the deposit into the Indemnity Escrow Funds
of an amount equal to the Indemnity Escrow Cap, the Holder Representative in
good faith disagrees with Buyers assessment of commercially reasonable
efforts required to collect the Pre-Closing Accounts Receivable (taking into
account, from and after the three (3) month anniversary of the Closing Date,
the amount remaining and likely collectability of the remaining Pre-Closing
Accounts Receivable), the Holder Representative shall identify in writing
additional commercially reasonable efforts (the " _Additional Efforts Notice_
") to be taken by Buyer to pursue the collection of the Pre-Closing Accounts
Receivable. During the thirty (30) day period following the delivery of the
Additional Efforts Notice, Buyer and the Holder Representative shall use good
faith efforts to resolve the concerns raised by the Additional Efforts Notice.
At the end of such thirty (30) day period, if Buyer and the Holder
Representative are unable to agree upon requisite commercially reasonable
efforts to collect the Pre-Closing Accounts Receivable, the Holder
Representative may, upon written notice to Buyer, assume the responsibility to
use commercially reasonable efforts to collect the Pre-Closing Accounts
Receivable (a " _Collection Assumption_ "). Upon a Collection Assumption, (A)
the Holder Representative shall be entitled to

 



      
 

 



 

receive one hundred percent (100%) of the Excess Receivable Fund (for further
distribution to the Holders in accordance with such Holders relative Post-
Closing Payment Allocation) and, from the date of the Collection Assumption,
shall bear 100% of the costs associated with employing the Account Servicers
in connection with the Pre-Closing Accounts Receivable and (B) from the date
of the Collection Assumption until the date that is eighteen (18) months after
the Closing Date, Buyer and the Company shall cooperate with the Holder
Representative, which from the date of a Collection Assumption shall be at the
Holder Representatives expense, including by providing reasonable access to
the employees, IT Systems and books and records and other assets of the
Company relevant to the collection of the Pre-Closing Accounts Receivable;
_provided_ the Holder Representative shall only be responsible for reasonable
documented out-of-pocket third party expenses incurred by Buyer and the
Company directly in connection with Buyer and the Companys compliance with
this clause (B) and Buyer and the Company shall be responsible for all other
internal expenses incurred in connection with their compliance with this
clause (B).

 



 

(d) In the event that, on the Closing Date, the outstanding accounts
receivable of the Company and its Subsidiaries, less any reserves for doubtful
accounts, (on a consolidated basis) (the " _Closing Date Accounts Receivable_
") is less than $140,700,000.00, then the portion of the Merger Consideration
payable on the Closing Date shall be reduced, on a dollar-for-dollar basis, by
an amount equal to the difference between $140,700,000.00 and the Closing Date
Accounts Receivable (such amount, which shall not exceed an amount equal to
the Indemnity Escrow Cap, the " _Accounts Receivable Adjustment_ "), and Buyer
shall cause the Accounts Receivable Adjustment to be deposited into the
Indemnity Escrow Funds. In the event that, on the Closing Date, the Closing
Date Accounts Receivable is less than the Accounts Receivable Threshold, the
Base Purchase Price shall be reduced, on a dollar-for-dollar basis, by an
amount equal to the difference between the Accounts Receivable Threshold and
the Closing Date Accounts Receivable.

both, would result in any such violation, breach, termination or creation of a
Lien or (d) result in a violation, revocation, withdrawal, suspension,
cancellation, termination or modification of any license, permit, approval,
consent or registration from any Governmental Authority, except, in the case
of clauses (c) and (d), as would not reasonably be expected to be,
individually or in the aggregate, material to the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

Debt Commitment Letter is contemplated; provided, that the existence or
exercise of "market flex" provisions contained in the Debt Fee Letter (to the

available cash of Buyer and Merger Sub, will be sufficient for Merger Sub and
the Surviving Corporation to complete the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and to pay all fees and expenses required to be paid by Buyer or

equity financing of Buyer or Buyers affiliates of a type similar to the
Financing (whether or not in connection with the transactions contemplated by
the Agreement) as may be reasonably requested by Buyer (provided that such
requested cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing
operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries and such cooperation, including
the completion or furnishing of any of the financial statements or other
information, shall not constitute a condition to the Closing or a condition to
the Buyers obligations to consummate the Merger).

(within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code), waiving such Persons right
to receive such payments and accepting in substitution therefore the right to
receive such payments only if approved by the stockholders of the Company in a
manner that complies with Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and (b) reasonably
in advance of the Closing Date, deliver to its stockholders (whether direct or
indirect to the extent required) a disclosure statement which satisfies its
disclosure obligations under Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and the
regulations thereunder, and which solicits and recommends that its
stockholders vote in favor of the transactions disclosed therein through a
vote meeting the requirements of Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and the
regulations thereunder. The Company shall provide Buyer and its
representatives with a copy of such waivers and disclosure statement within a
reasonable time prior to delivery to the Companys stockholders and shall
consider in good faith any comments made by Buyer or its representatives
regarding the content of such disclosure statement.

 



 

6.8. _Termination of 401(k) Plan_. If requested in writing by Buyer at least
ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall cause the
Companys 401(k) Plan (the " _Company 401(k) Plan_") to be terminated
effective the day immediately prior to the Closing Date. In the event that
Buyer requests that the Company 401(k) Plan be terminated, the Company shall
provide Buyer with evidence that such Plan has been terminated (the form and
substance of which shall be subject to review and approval by Buyer) not later
than the Business Day immediately preceding the Closing Date. If Buyer
requests that the Company 401(k) Plan be so terminated, (x) the Company shall
take any and all action as may be reasonably required, including amendments to
the Company 401(k) Plan, to permit each Company Employee to make rollover
contributions of "eligible rollover distributions" (within the meaning of
Section 401(a)(31) of the Code), in an amount equal to the full account
balance distributed or distributable to such Company Employee from the Company
401(k) Plan to a tax-qualified defined contribution retirement plan designated
by Buyer and (y) if necessary in Buyers reasonable discretion, Buyer agrees
to amend, or cause to be amended, the Buyer 401(k) Plan to accept a rollover
of all outstanding loans from the Company 401(k) Plan as of the Closing Date.

 



 

6.9. _Exclusive Dealing_. During the Interim Period, the Company shall not
take, and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure its
Representatives do not take, any action to solicit, encourage, initiate or
engage in discussions or negotiations with, or provide any information to or
enter into any agreement with any Person (other than Buyer, Merger Sub and/or
their respective Affiliates or as contemplated by this Agreement) concerning
any purchase of any of the Companys equity securities or any merger, sale of
substantially all of the Companys assets or a similar transaction involving
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, other than assets sold in the ordinary
course of business (each such acquisition transaction, an " _Acquisition
Transaction_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may respond to any

 



       
 

 



 

unsolicited proposal regarding an Acquisition Transaction by indicating that
the Company is subject to an exclusivity obligation and is unable to provide
any information related to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or entertain
any proposals or offers or engage in any negotiations or discussions
concerning an Acquisition Transaction for as long as that exclusivity
obligation remains in effect.

 



 

6.10. _Joint Venture_. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall use reasonable
best efforts to (a) cause Southwest General Services of Dallas, LLC to be
wound up or dissolved, (b) transfer its equity interest in Southwest General
Services of Dallas, LLC to the other equityholder of such entity or to a third
party or (c) cause the other equityholder of Southwest General Services of
Dallas, LLC to transfer its equity interest to the Company, and the Company
shall consult with Buyer in good faith prior to taking one of the actions
described in this _Section 6.10_.

(a) In connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Buyer
shall (and, to the extent required, shall cause its Affiliates to) promptly
but in no event later than ten (10) Business Days after the date hereof submit
a notification under the HSR Act with respect to the Merger. Buyer shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to substantially comply with any
Information or Document Request.

 



 

(b) Buyer shall request early termination of any waiting period under the HSR
Act and exercise its reasonable best efforts to (i) obtain termination or
expiration of the waiting period under the HSR Act, (ii) prevent the entry in
any Action brought by a Regulatory Consent Authority or any other Person of
any Governmental Order which would prohibit, make unlawful or delay the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (iii) if
any such Governmental Order is issued in any such Action, cause such
Governmental Order to be lifted.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary (including the
other provisions of this _Section 7.1_), it is expressly understood and
agreed that: (i) the Company and its Affiliates shall not give any
undertakings, make any commitments or enter into any agreements that would be
binding upon Buyer or any of its Affiliates, including, after the Closing, the
Surviving Corporation, without the prior written consent of Buyer and (ii)
neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries) shall be required to take any
action that could reasonably be expected to constitute a material adverse
effect on the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or on Buyer and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

 



 

(d) Buyer shall promptly furnish to the Company and the Holder Representative
copies of any notices or written communications received by Buyer or any of
its Affiliates from any third party or any Governmental Authority with respect
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and Buyer shall permit
counsel to the Company an opportunity

 



      
 

 



 

to review in advance, and Buyer shall consider in good faith the views of such
counsel in connection with, any proposed substantive written communications by
Buyer and/or its Affiliates to any Governmental Authority concerning the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ , that, with the
exception of Buyers right to withdraw and refile the notification under the
HSR Act once, Buyer shall not extend any waiting period or comparable period
under the HSR Act or enter into any agreement with any Governmental Authority
without the written consent of the Company. Buyer agrees to provide the
Company, the Holder Representative and its counsel the opportunity, on
reasonable advance notice, to participate in any substantive meetings or
discussions, either in person or by telephone, between Buyer and/or any of its
Affiliates, agents or advisors, on the one hand, and any Governmental
Authority, on the other hand, concerning or in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

(e) Buyer shall be solely responsible for and pay all filing fees payable to
the Regulatory Consent Authorities in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

7.2. _Indemnification and Insurance_.

 



 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Buyer agrees that it shall indemnify
and hold harmless each present and former director and officer of the Company
and any of its Subsidiaries against any costs or expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or
liabilities incurred in connection with any Action, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to matters
existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time relating to acts or
omissions in their capacities as officers or directors, whether asserted or
claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent that
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, would have been
permitted under applicable Law and its respective certificate of
incorporation, bylaws or other organizational documents in effect on the date
of this Agreement to indemnify such Person (including promptly advancing
expenses as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law).
Without limiting the foregoing, Buyer shall cause the Company and each of its
Subsidiaries (i) to maintain for a period of not less than six (6) years from
the Effective Time provisions in its certificate of incorporation, bylaws and
other organizational documents concerning the indemnification and exoneration
(including provisions relating to expense advancement) of the Companys and
its Subsidiaries former and current officers, directors, employees, and
agents that are no less favorable to those Persons than the provisions of the
certificates of incorporation, bylaws and other organizational documents of
the Company or such Subsidiary, as applicable, in each case, as of the date of
this Agreement and (ii) not to amend, repeal or otherwise modify such
provisions in any respect that would adversely affect the rights of those
Persons thereunder, in each case, except as required by Law.

 



 

(b) For a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, Buyer shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to maintain in effect directors and officers
liability insurance covering those Persons who are currently covered by the
Companys or any of its Subsidiaries directors and officers liability
insurance policies on terms not less favorable than the terms of such current
insurance coverage; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) Buyer or the Surviving
Corporation may cause coverage to be extended under the current directors and
officers liability insurance by obtaining at or prior to the Closing a
prepaid, non-cancelable six-year "tail" policy in an

 



      
 

 



 

amount not greater than 300% of the annual premiums paid for such insurance,
containing terms not less favorable than the terms of such current insurance
coverage with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time, the premium for which shall be paid by Buyer, and (ii) if any
claim is asserted or made within such six-year period, any insurance required
to be maintained under this _Section 7.2 _shall be continued in respect of
such claim until the final disposition thereof.

 



 

(c) The rights of indemnification and to receive advancement of expenses as
provided by this Agreement shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights
to which any Person entitled to indemnification under this _Section 7.2_ (an
" _Indemnified Person_ ") may at any time be entitled. No right or remedy
herein conferred by this Agreement is intended to be exclusive of any other
right or remedy, and every other right and remedy shall be cumulative and in
addition to every other right and remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter
existing at Law or in equity or otherwise. The assertion of any right or
remedy hereunder, or otherwise, shall not prevent the concurrent or subsequent
assertion of any other right or remedy. Buyer hereby acknowledges that the
Indemnified Persons have or may, in the future, have certain rights to
indemnification, advancement of expenses and/or insurance provided by other
Persons (collectively, " _Other Indemnitors_ "). Buyer hereby agrees that,
with respect to any advancement or indemnification obligation owed, at any
time, to an Indemnified Person by Buyer, the Surviving Corporation or any of
its Subsidiaries or any Other Indemnitor, whether pursuant to any certificate
of incorporation, by-laws, partnership agreement, operating agreement,
indemnification agreement or other document or agreement and/or pursuant to
this _Section 7.2_ (any of the foregoing, an " _Indemnification Obligation_
"), Buyer shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to (i) jointly and severally, and at all times, be the
indemnitors of first resort (i.e., Buyers, the Surviving Corporations and
its Subsidiaries obligations to an Indemnified Person shall be primary and
any obligation of the Other Indemnitors to advance expenses or to provide
indemnification for the same expenses or liabilities incurred by a Indemnified
Person shall be secondary), (ii) at all times, be required to advance, and
shall be liable, jointly and severally, for, the full amount of all expenses,
judgments, penalties, fines and amounts paid in settlement to the extent
legally permitted and as required by the terms of this Agreement or any
Indemnification Obligation, without regard to any rights that an Indemnified
Person may have against the Other Indemnitors. Furthermore, Buyer irrevocably
waives, relinquishes and releases the Other Indemnitors from any and all
claims (x) against the Other Indemnitors for contribution, subrogation,
indemnification or any other recovery of any kind in respect thereof and (y)
that the Indemnified Person must seek expense advancement or reimbursement, or
indemnification, from any Other Indemnitor before the Surviving Corporation or
its Subsidiaries or Buyer must perform its expense advancement and
reimbursement, and indemnification obligations, under this Agreement. Buyer
hereby further agrees that no advancement, indemnification or other payment by
the Other Indemnitors on behalf of an Indemnified Person with respect to any
claim for which an Indemnified Person has sought indemnification from Buyer or
the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries shall affect the foregoing, and
the Other Indemnitors shall have a right of contribution and/or be subrogated
to the extent of such advancement, indemnification or other payment to all of
the rights of recovery of such Indemnified Person against Buyer, the Surviving
Corporation or its Subsidiaries, and Buyer or the Surviving Corporation or its
Subsidiaries shall jointly and severally indemnify and hold harmless against
such amounts actually paid by the Other Indemnitors to or on behalf of such
Indemnified Person to the extent such amounts would have

 



      
 

 



 

otherwise been payable by Buyer or the Surviving Corporation or its
Subsidiaries under any Indemnification Obligation.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, this
_Section 7.2_ shall survive the consummation of the Merger indefinitely and
shall be binding, jointly and severally, on all successors and assigns of
Buyer and the Surviving Corporation. In the event that Buyer or the Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns consolidates with
or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or transfers or conveys
all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and
in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of Buyer or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall
succeed to the obligations set forth in this _Section 7.2_; _provided_ , that
recourse shall first be against the "tail" policy until it is exhausted before
recovery against Buyer shall take place.

 



 

7.3. _Employment Matters_.

 



 

(a) For a period of not less than one (1) year following the Closing Date,
Buyer shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or an Affiliate thereof
to, provide each non-union represented employee of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries employed on the Closing Date (other than any employee whose
employment is demoted or terminated for any reason following the Effective
Time) (" _Continuing Employees_ ") with: (i) annual base salary, short-term
target incentive compensation opportunities and employee benefits (but
excluding equity and equity-based incentives, retention bonuses and other
change in control entitlements and retirement compensation and benefits, other
than under a defined contribution plan) that are substantially comparable in
the aggregate to, in Buyers discretion, (A) the compensation and benefits
(subject to the same exclusions) provided to such Continuing Employee
immediately prior to the Closing Date, (B) the compensation and benefits
(subject to the same exclusions)that Buyer or its Affiliates provide to their
similarly situated employees during such period and (C) some combination of
the foregoing; _provided_ that for any Continuing Employee who is demoted at
or following the Effective Time, the level of compensation and benefits to be
provided to such Continuing Employee pursuant to this _Section 7.3(a)_ shall
be determined by the position of such Continuing Employee after giving effect
to such demotion.

 



 

(b) From and after the Closing, Buyer shall give each Continuing Employee full
credit for such Continuing Employees service with the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries and with any predecessor employer, to the same extent recognized
by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for all purposes (including for
purposes of eligibility to participate, level of benefits, early retirement
eligibility and early retirement subsidies, vesting and benefit accrual) under
any employee benefit plans, arrangements, collective agreements and
employment-related entitlements (including under any applicable pension,
401(k), savings, medical, dental, life insurance, vacation, long-service leave
or other leave entitlements, post-retirement health and life insurance,
termination indemnity, severance or separation pay plans) provided, sponsored,
maintained or contributed to by Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries in which such
Continuing Employee participates, except to the extent such credit would
result in the duplication of benefits for the same period of service.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent permitted under applicable Law,
Buyer shall not be required to provide credit for such service for vesting or

 



      
 

 



 

benefit accrual purposes under any benefit plan, program, agreement or
arrangement of Buyer or any of its Affiliates that provides defined pension
benefits, retiree medical benefits or equity or equity based awards.

 



 

(c) Buyer shall (i) waive, or caused to be waived, for each Continuing
Employee and his or her dependents, any waiting period provision, payment
requirement to avoid a waiting period, actively-at-work requirement and any
other restriction that would prevent immediate or full participation under the
welfare plans of Buyer or any of its Affiliates applicable to such Continuing
Employee to the extent such waiting period, actively-at-work requirement or
other restriction would not have been applicable to (or was previously
satisfied by) such Continuing Employee under the terms of the applicable
Company Benefit Plan and (ii) give or cause to be given full credit under the
welfare plans of Buyer and its Affiliates applicable to each Continuing
Employee and his or her dependents for all co-payments and deductibles
satisfied prior to the Closing in the same plan year as the Closing, and for
any lifetime maximums, as if there had been a single continuous employer, to
the extent such credit (A) would have been given under the applicable Company
Benefit Plan as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time and (B) is
permitted by the terms and conditions of the welfare plan that covers such
Continuing Employee following the Effective Time.

 



 

(d) Without limiting the generality of _Section 13.4_, the provisions of this
_Section 7.3_ are solely for the benefit of the Company and Buyer, and no
current or former employee or any other Person shall be regarded for any
purpose as a third-party beneficiary of this _Section 7.3_. In no event shall
the terms of this _Section 7.3_ be deemed to (i) establish, amend, or modify
any Company Benefit Plan, any "employee benefit plan" as defined in Section
3(3) of ERISA, or any other benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement
maintained or sponsored by Buyer or any of its Affiliates; (ii) alter or limit
the ability of Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including, following the
Closing, the Company and its Subsidiaries) to amend, modify or terminate any
Company Benefit Plan, or any other benefit plan, program, agreement or
arrangement after the Effective Time; or (iii) confer upon any current or
former employee or other Person any right to employment or continued
employment or continued service with Buyer or any of its Affiliates
(including, following the Effective Time, the Company and its Subsidiaries),
preclude the ability of Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including, following
the Effective Time, the Company and its Subsidiaries) to terminate the
employment or services of or demote the position of any employee for any
reason, or constitute or create an employment agreement with any such Person.

 



 

7.4. _Committed Financing_. Buyer and Merger Sub shall use reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and do, or cause to be
done, as promptly as possible (taking into account the expected timing of the
Marketing Period), all things necessary to arrange and obtain the Committed
Financing on terms and conditions no less favorable to Buyer and Merger Sub
than the terms and conditions described in the Debt Commitment Letter and the
Debt Fee Letter (including any related flex terms), including using reasonable
best efforts to maintain in effect the Debt Commitment Letter (subject to the
Buyers and Merger Subs right to amend, modify, waive or replace the Debt
Commitment Letter in accordance herewith) and using reasonable best efforts
to, as promptly as possible (taking into account the expected timing of the
Marketing Period), (a) satisfy (or obtain a waiver of) on a timely basis
(taking into account the anticipated timing of the Marketing Period) all
conditions applicable to

 



      
 

 



 

Buyer and Merger Sub obtaining the Committed Financing set forth therein and
that are within Buyers and/or Merger Subs control, (b) negotiate and enter
into definitive agreements with respect thereto on terms no less favorable to
Buyer and Merger Sub than the terms and conditions contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letter (including any related flex terms), (c) prepare the
necessary marketing materials with respect to the Committed Financing and (d)
commence the syndication and/or marketing activities contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letter. Buyer shall give the Company prompt written notice (i) of
any breach or default (or any event or circumstance that, with or without
notice, lapse of time or both, would reasonably be expected to result in
breach or default) by any party to the Debt Commitment Letter or other Debt
Document (as defined below) of which Buyer or Merger Sub becomes aware, (ii)
if and when Buyer or Merger Sub becomes aware that any portion of the
Committed Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter (including any
related flex terms) will not be available to consummate the Merger, (iii) of
the receipt of any written notice or other written communication from any
Person with respect to any (A) actual or potential material breach, default,
termination or repudiation by any party to the Debt Commitment Letter or other
Debt Document or (B) material dispute or disagreement between or among any
parties to the Debt Commitment Letter or other Debt Document (but excluding,
for the avoidance of doubt, any ordinary course negotiations with respect to
the terms of the Committed Financing or Debt Documents), (iv) if for any
reason Buyer or Merger Sub believes in good faith it will not be able to
obtain any portion of the Committed Financing on the terms, in the manner and
from the sources contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter (including any
related flex terms) or the definitive agreements with respect thereto (such
definitive agreements related to the Committed Financing, collectively, with
the Debt Commitment Letter, the " _Debt Documents_ ") and (v) of any
termination of the Debt Commitment Letter. If any portion of the Committed
Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated in the
Debt Commitment Letter (including any related flex terms), Buyer and Merger
Sub shall, without limiting the obligations of Buyer and Merger Sub set forth
in the immediately following sentence, use reasonable best efforts to arrange
to obtain alternative financing, including from alternative sources, on terms
(including any related flex terms) no less favorable to Buyer and Merger Sub
than the Committed Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter ("
_Alternative Financing_ ") as promptly as practicable following the occurrence
of such event; provided that Buyer and Merger Sub shall have no obligation to
seek Alternative Financing if the Committed Financing or any portion thereof
becomes unavailable due to the failure of the conditions to Closing set forth
in _Sections 9.2(a)_ and _9.2(b)_ to be satisfied. The provisions of this
_Section 7.4_ and _Section 13.14_ shall be applicable to the Alternative
Financing, and, for the purposes of _Section 6.4_, this _Section 7.4_ and
_Section 13.14_, all references to the Committed Financing shall be deemed to
include such Alternative Financing, all references to the Debt Commitment
Letter or other Debt Documents shall include the applicable documents for the
Alternative Financing and all references to the Committed Financing Sources
shall include the persons providing or arranging the Alternative Financing.
Buyer and Merger Sub shall (1) comply in all material respects with the Debt
Commitment Letter and each definitive agreement with respect thereto,
including the Debt Documents and (2) not permit, without the prior written
consent of the Company, any replacement, amendment or modification to be made
to, or any waiver of any provision or remedy under, any Debt Document or the
Fee Letter if such replacement, amendment, modification or waiver (i) would
reduce the aggregate amount of proceeds from the Committed Financing available
to fund the amounts required to be paid by Buyer under this Agreement

 



      
 

 



 

below the amount required to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (ii) would amend or add new or additional conditions precedent to
the Committed Financing in a manner that would reasonably be expected to
materially delay or prevent the Closing or make the funding of the Committed
Financing less likely to occur, or (iii) would reasonably be expected to
materially delay or prevent the Closing or make the funding of the Committed
Financing less likely to occur. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this _Section 7.4_ or _Section 5.6_, Buyer may, upon written notice to the
Company and without the Companys consent, terminate the Debt Commitment
Letter upon consummation of one or more debt or equity financings, the
aggregate net cash proceeds of which are no less than the contemplated net
cash proceeds of the Committed Financing set forth in the Debt Commitment
Letter and, upon any such termination, (a) each of (i) the Companys
obligations under _Section 6.4_ as to the Committed Financing, (ii) any
representation or warranty by Buyer with respect to the Debt Commitment Letter
and (iii) this _Section 7.4_ shall be of no further force or effect, and (b)
the Marketing Period shall be deemed for all purposes hereunder to have
concluded and no provision hereof related to the Marketing Period shall be of
any further force or effect. Buyer and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that
the obtaining of the Committed Financing, or any Alternative Financing, is not
a condition to Closing and reaffirm their obligation to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement irrespective and independently of
the availability of the Committed Financing, any Alternative Financing or any
other financing, subject to fulfillment or waiver of the conditions set forth
in _Article IX_.

 



 

7.5. _Retention of Books and Records_. Buyer will, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, retain all books, ledgers,
files, reports, plans, operating records and any other material documents
pertaining to the Company and its Subsidiaries in existence at the Closing
that are required to be retained under the retention policies of the Company
in effect immediately prior to the Closing for a period of seven (7) years
from the Closing Date, and to make the same available after the Closing for
inspection and copying by the Holder Representative or its representatives at
the Holder Representatives expense, during regular business hours and upon
reasonable request and upon reasonable advance notice.

 



 

7.6. _Contact with Customers and Suppliers_. Until the Closing Date, Buyer
shall not, and shall cause its representatives not to, contact or communicate
with the employees, customers, potential customers, suppliers, distributors or
licensors of the Company or the Companys Subsidiaries, or any other Persons
having a business relationship with the Company or the Companys Subsidiaries,
concerning the transactions contemplated hereby without the prior written
consent of the chief executive officer of the Company.

 



 

 **ARTICLE VIII. 
JOINT COVENANTS**

 



 

8.1. _Support of Transaction_. Without limiting any covenant contained in
_Article VI_ or _Article VII_, which obligations shall control to the extent
of any conflict with the succeeding provisions of this _Section 8.1_, Buyer
and the Company shall each, and shall each cause their respective Subsidiaries
to: (a) use reasonable best efforts to assemble, prepare and file any
information (and, as needed, to supplement such information) as may be
reasonably necessary to obtain as promptly as practicable all governmental and
regulatory consents required to be obtained in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby, (b) use reasonable best

 



      
 

 



 

efforts to obtain all material consents and approvals of third parties that
any of Buyer, the Company, or their respective Affiliates are required to
obtain in order to consummate the Merger and (c) take such other action as may
reasonably be necessary or as another Party may reasonably request to satisfy
the conditions of _Article IX_ or otherwise to comply with this Agreement and
to consummate the transaction contemplated hereby as soon as practicable. For
the avoidance of doubt, the Parties obligations with respect to obtaining the
Committed Financing are exclusively governed by Sections _6.4_ and _7.4_ and
with respect to HSR Act matters are exclusively governed by _Sections 6.3_
and _7.1_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall any Party be
obligated to bear any expense or pay any fee or grant any concession in
connection with obtaining any consents, authorizations or approvals pursuant
to the terms of any Contract to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
is a party in connection with the consummation of the Merger.

 



 

8.2. _Delivery of Agreements_. Each of the Company, the Holder Representative,
Buyer and Merger Sub shall execute and deliver to one another at the Closing,
the Escrow Agreement and a Paying Agent Agreement in a form agreed to among
the Company, the Holder Representative, Buyer, Merger Sub and the Paying Agent
(the " _Paying Agent Agreement_ ").

 



 

8.3. _Further Assurances_. Each Party hereto agrees that, from time to time
after the Closing Date, it will execute and deliver or cause its respective
Affiliates to execute and deliver such further instruments, and take (or cause
their respective Affiliates to take) such other action, as may be reasonably
necessary to carry out the purposes and intents of this Agreement.

 



 

8.4. _Tax Matters_.

 



 

(a) Buyer shall promptly notify the Holder Representative in writing upon
receipt by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of notice of any pending or
threatened Tax audits or assessments or other Actions relating to Taxes for
which the Buyer Indemnified Parties may be entitled to indemnification under
_Section 12.2(a)_ (" _Tax Contest Claims_ "). Such notice shall include a
copy of the relevant portion of any correspondence received from the relevant
Governmental Authority and describe in reasonable detail the nature of such
Tax Contest Claim. Buyer shall control the conduct of any Tax Contest Claim,
provided that (i) the Holder Representative shall have the right to
participate in any Tax Contest Claim, (ii) Buyer shall keep the Holder
Representative informed regarding the progress and substantive aspects of each
Tax Contest Claim and (iii) Buyer shall not compromise or settle any Tax
Contest Claim without obtaining the Holder Representatives prior written
consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed). In the event of any conflict between the provisions of this
_Section 8.4(a)_ and _Section 12.3_, this _Section 8.4(a)_ shall control.

 



 

(b) Buyer and the Holder Representative shall cooperate fully, and shall cause
their respective Affiliates to cooperate fully, as and to the extent
reasonably requested by the other party, in connection with the conduct of any
Tax Contest Claim or the preparation and filing of any Tax Return subject to
_Section 8.4(e)_. Such cooperation shall include the retention of and (upon
the other Partys request) the provision of records and information reasonably
relevant to any Tax Contest Claim or the preparation and filing of any Tax
Return subject to _Section 8.4(e)_ and making employees available on a
mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of
any material provided hereunder, and the provision of

 



      
 

 



 

such powers of attorney as may be necessary to allow for the control of a Tax
Contest Claim or to prepare and file any such Tax Return.

 



 

(c) Buyer shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates (including the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries following the Effective Time) not to, (i)
take any action on the Closing Date (but after the Closing) other than in the
ordinary course of business, (ii) make any election or deemed election under
Section 338 of the Code (or any analogous or similar rules in any relevant tax
jurisdiction), (iii) except to the extent required by Law (or necessary to
comply with Section 481 of the Code) make any other election inconsistent with
past practice, as reflected on a Tax Return for a taxable period ending on or
prior to the Closing Date, that could increase the amount of the entitlement
of any Buyer Indemnified Party to indemnification pursuant to _Section
12.2(a)_ or (iv) except to the extent required by Law (or necessary to comply
with Section 481 of the Code), amend any Tax Return in a manner that could
increase the amount of the entitlement of any Buyer Indemnified Party to
indemnification pursuant to _Section 12.2(a)_.

 



 

(d) Prior to the Closing, the Company will reasonably cooperate with Buyer to
ensure that Buyer will have available after the Closing all of the information
necessary in order to cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to timely and
properly file all Tax Returns required to be filed after the Closing for tax
periods (or portions thereof) ending on or prior to the Closing Date,
including introducing Buyer to any third party service providers that have
been used by the Company to file Tax Returns in the past; provided, however,
that the Companys obligations and the Buyers rights under this _Section
8.4(d)_ shall be subject to _Section 6.2_ in all respects.

 



 

(e) Buyer shall prepare, or cause the Company to prepare, in a manner
consistent with the Company and its Subsidiaries past practices and customs
(except as required by applicable Law), and file, or cause the Company to
file, all Tax Returns of the Company and its Subsidiaries for tax periods (or
portions thereof) that end on or before the Closing Date and that are filed
after the Closing Date. For so long as any Buyer Indemnified Party is entitled
to indemnification pursuant to _Section 12.2(a)_, (i) Buyer shall deliver, or
cause to be delivered, a draft of each such Tax Return to the Holder
Representative for its review and comment at least thirty (30) days prior to
the due date (taking into account any applicable extension) for filing such
Tax Return and (ii) Buyer shall not file any Tax Return subject to this
_Section 8.4(e)_ without the prior written consent of the Holder
Representative, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed (except that if such consent has not been obtained for any Tax
Return prior to the due date (taking into account any applicable extension)
for filing such Tax Return then such Tax Return shall be filed in the manner
proposed by Buyer and thereafter an amended Tax Return shall be filed (if
necessary) to reflect the resolution of the issue).

 



 

8.5. _HSR Act and Regulatory Approvals_.

 



 

(a) If the parties receive a request for additional information or documentary
material pursuant to 15 USC § 18a(e)(1)(A) made or issued by the Antitrust
Division of the United States Department of Justice or the United States
Federal Trade Commission (a " _Second Request_ "), Buyer and the Company shall
consult with each other in good faith within five

 



      
 

 



 

Business Days following such receipt to determine whether to continue to
pursue the actions described in _Section 6.3(a)_ and _Section 7.1(b)_ (the "
_Regulatory Efforts_ ").

 



 

(b) If the Agreement is not terminated pursuant to _Section 10.1(b)(i)_,
Buyer and the Company shall continue each partys Regulatory Efforts. After
both parties substantial compliance with any such Second Request, Buyer and
the Company shall consult with each other in good faith during the five (5)
Business Day period following the tenth (10th) Business Day after both
parties substantial compliance with such Second Request to determine whether
to continue each partys Regulatory Efforts. If Buyer and the Company mutually
agree to continue the Regulatory Efforts, each of Buyer and the Company shall
bear its own expenses incurred in connection with such undertaking. If Buyer
delivers notice of intent to terminate pursuant to _Section 10.1(b)(ii)_, but
the Company delivers notice of its desire to continue its Regulatory Efforts,
then (i) for the avoidance of doubt, this Agreement shall not be terminated
and (ii) Buyer shall cooperate in good faith with the Company in continuing
each partys Regulatory Efforts and the Company shall pay for reasonable,
documented, out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Buyer in connection therewith.

consummate the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby and (ii)
otherwise comply with its obligations under this Agreement.

 



 

 **ARTICLE X. 
TERMINATION/EFFECTIVENESS**

 



 

10.1. _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated and the transactions

(a) prior to the Closing, by written consent of the Company and Buyer;

 



 

(b) prior to the Closing, by written consent of the Company and Buyer, (i)
within five (5) Business Days after receipt of a Second Request or (ii) upon
the completion of the five (5) Business Days consultation period contemplated
by _Section 8.5(b)_ after both parties substantial compliance with a Second
Request, in each case, if each of the Company and Buyer delivers written
notice of its intent to terminate and not to continue the Regulatory Efforts;

 



 

(c) prior to the Closing, by written notice to the Company from Buyer, if (i)
there is any material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement on the part of the Company set forth in this Agreement, such that
the conditions specified in _Section 9.2(a) _or _Section 9.2(b)_ would not
be satisfied at the Closing (a " _Terminating Company Breach_ "), except that,
if such Terminating Company Breach is curable by the Company through the
exercise of its reasonable best efforts, then, for a period of up to 30 days
(or any shorter period of time that remains between the date Buyer provides
written notice of such violation or breach and the Outside Date) after receipt
by the Company of written notice from Buyer of such breach, but only as long
as the Company continues to use its reasonable best efforts to cure such

hereunder to the date that is the fourth (4th) Business Day following the
twentieth (20th) calendar day after the initial Outside Date prior to giving

without giving effect to any such extension, or (iii) the consummation of the
Merger is permanently enjoined or prohibited by the terms of a final, non-
appealable Governmental Order; _provided_ , that Buyers right to terminate
this Agreement under this _Section 10.1(c)_ shall not be available if Buyers
or Merger Subs failure to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement has
been the primary cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the Closing to occur
on or before such date;

 



 

(d) prior to the Closing, by written notice to Buyer from the Company if (i)
there is any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on
the part of

 



      
 

 



 

Buyer or Merger Sub set forth in this Agreement, such that the conditions
specified in _Section 9.3(a)_ or _Section 9.3(b)_ would not be satisfied at
the Closing (a " _Terminating Buyer Breach_ "), except that, if any such
Terminating Buyer Breach is curable by Buyer or Merger Sub through the
exercise of its reasonable best efforts, then, for a period of up to 30 days
(or any shorter period of time that remains between the date the Company
provides written notice of such violation or breach and the Outside Date)
after receipt by Buyer of written notice from the Company of such breach, but
only as long as Buyer and Merger Sub continue to exercise such reasonable best
efforts to cure such Terminating Buyer Breach (the " _Buyer Cure Period_ "),
such termination shall not be effective, and such termination shall become
effective only if the Terminating Buyer Breach is not cured within the Buyer
Cure Period, (ii) the Closing has not occurred on or before the Outside Date,
or (iii) the consummation of the Merger is permanently enjoined or prohibited
by the terms of a final, non-appealable Governmental Order; _provided_ , that

shall not be available if the Companys failure to fulfill any obligation
under this Agreement has been the primary cause of, or resulted in, the
failure of the Closing to occur on or before such date;

 



 

(e) by the Company by giving written notice to Buyer at any time prior to the
Closing if (i) all of the conditions set forth in _Section 9.1_ and _Section
9.2_ (other than conditions which are to be satisfied by actions taken at the
Closing) have been satisfied, (ii) the Company has indicated in writing to
Buyer that all of the conditions set forth in _Section 9.1_ and _Section
9.3_ (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied by
actions taken at the Closing) have been satisfied or have been waived by the
Company, (iii) the Company has delivered an irrevocable notice that it is
ready, willing and able to consummate the Closing and (iv) Buyer fails to
consummate the Closing when the Closing should have occurred pursuant to
_Section 2.3_; or

 



 

(f) by Buyer if the Shareholder Approvals or Shareholder Joinder Agreements
executed by the Holders listed on _Schedule 10.1(f)_ in respect of their
respective Common Shares shall not have been delivered to Buyer within two (2)
Business Days after execution of this Agreement.

 



 

10.2. _Effect of Termination_.

 



 

(a) Except as otherwise set forth in this _Section 10.2_, in the event of the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 10.1_, this Agreement
shall forthwith become void and have no effect, without any liability on the
part of any Party hereto or its respective Affiliates, officers, directors or
stockholders; _provided_ that the termination of this Agreement shall in no
way limit any claim by a Party that another Party breached the terms of this
Agreement prior to, or in connection with, such termination, including by
failing to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, nor
shall such termination limit the right of such non-breaching Party to seek
specific performance or any other remedies available at law or equity. In
determining losses or damages recoverable upon termination by a Party hereto
for the other Partys breach, the Parties acknowledge and agree that such
losses and damages shall not be limited to reimbursement of expenses or out-
of-pocket costs, and may include the benefit of the bargain lost by such Party
or, in the case of the Company, the Holders (taking into consideration
relevant matters, including other opportunities and the time value of money),
which shall be deemed to be damages payable to such Party. Under no
circumstance shall the

 



      
 

 



 

Company be entitled to monetary damages in excess of the amount of the Merger
Consideration. Without limiting the foregoing, the provisions of this _Section
10.2_, _Article XI_ and _Article XIII_ (collectively, the " _Surviving
Provisions_ ") and the Confidentiality Agreement, and any other Article,
Section, Schedule or Annex of this Agreement referenced in the Surviving
Provisions which are required to survive in order to give appropriate effect
to the Surviving Provisions, shall in each case survive any termination of
this Agreement. In the event that Buyer terminates this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 10.1(f)_, then the Company shall promptly, but in no event later
than ten (10) Business Days after the date of termination of this Agreement,
pay by wire transfer of immediately available funds to accounts designated by
Buyer, the documented out of pocket costs incurred by Buyer in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

(b) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 10.1(b)_, Buyer
shall pay the Company an amount in cash equal to $10,000,000, by wire transfer
of immediately available funds, within ten (10) Business Days of such
termination.

 



 

 **ARTICLE XI. 
HOLDER REPRESENTATIVE**

 



 

11.1. _Designation and Replacement of Holder Representative_. The Parties have
agreed that it is desirable to designate a representative to act on behalf of
holders of the Common Stock and the Preferred Stock for certain limited
purposes, as specified herein (the " _Holder Representative_ "). The Parties
have designated Fortis Advisors LLC as the initial Holder Representative, and
execution of the Letter of Transmittal by the Holders pursuant to _Section
3.2(b)_ shall constitute ratification and approval of such designation. The
Holder Representative may resign at any time, and the Holder Representative
may be removed by the vote of Persons which collectively owned more than fifty
percent (50%) of the Aggregate Fully-Diluted Common Shares immediately prior
to the Effective Time (the " _Majority Holders_ "). In the event that a Holder
Representative has resigned or been removed, a new Holder Representative shall
be appointed by a vote of the Majority Holders, such appointment to become
effective upon the written acceptance thereof by the new Holder
Representative. The immunities and rights to indemnification shall survive the
resignation or removal of the Holder Representative or any member of the
Advisory Group (as defined below) and the Closing and/or any termination of
this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement. The powers, immunities and rights to
indemnification granted to the Holder Representative Group (as defined below)
hereunder are (i) coupled with an interest, and, except as set forth in this
_Article XI_, such designation is irrevocable and shall not be affected by
the death, incapacity, incompetence, illness, bankruptcy, liquidation,
dissolution or other inability to act of any of the Holders and shall be
binding on any successor thereto, and (ii) shall survive the delivery of an
assignment by any of the whole or any fraction of his, her or its interest in
the Indemnity Escrow Funds.

 



 

11.2. _Authority and Rights of the Holder Representative; Limitations on
Liability_. The Holder Representative shall have such powers and authority as
are necessary to carry out the functions assigned to it under this Agreement;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Holder Representative shall have no
obligation to act, except as expressly provided herein, in the Holder
Representative Engagement Letter (or in any other Holder Representative
engagement letter) or in the Escrow Agreement, and for purposes of clarity,
there are no obligations of the Holder Representative under any other
ancillary agreement, schedule, exhibit or the Schedules. Without limiting the

 



      
 

 



 

generality of the foregoing, the Holder Representative shall have full power,
authority and discretion to (i) expend Holder Allocable Expenses, (ii) after
the Closing, negotiate and enter into amendments to this Agreement, the Escrow
Agreement and the Paying Agent Agreement for and on behalf of the Holders of
Common Stock and Preferred Stock, (iii) to do or refrain from doing any
further act or deed on behalf of the Holders of Common Stock and Preferred
Stock which the Holder Representative deems necessary or appropriate in its
sole discretion relating to the subject matter of this Agreement and the
Escrow Agreement, and (iv) to do all things and to perform all acts, as
contemplated by or deemed advisable by the Holder Representative in connection
with this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, in each case, subject to the
limitations set forth herein, in the Escrow Agreement and in the Holder
Representative Engagement Letter (or in any other Holder Representative
engagement letter). All actions taken by the Holder Representative under this
Agreement or the Escrow Agreement shall be binding upon such Holder of Common
Stock and Preferred Stock and such Holders successors as if expressly
confirmed and ratified in writing by such Holder, and all defenses which may
be available to the Holders to contest, negate or disaffirm the action of the
Holder Representative taken in good faith under this Agreement or the Escrow
Agreement are waived.

 



 

11.3. _Advisory Group; Indemnification_. Certain Holders have entered an
engagement agreement with the Holder Representative to provide direction to
the Holder Representative in connection with the performance of its services
under this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement (such Holders, including their
Representatives, collectively hereinafter referred to as the " _Advisory
Group_ "). Neither the Holder Representative nor its members, managers,
directors, officers, contractors, agents and employees nor any member of the
Advisory Group (collectively, the " _Holder Representative Group_ "), shall
have any liability to Buyer, the Company, any Holder or any of their
respective successors, heirs or Affiliates with respect to actions taken or
omitted to be taken in its capacity as the Holder Representative hereunder,
under the Escrow Agreement or under any Holder Representative engagement
agreement. The Holder Representative shall at all times be entitled to (i)
rely upon any signature believed by it to be genuine, (ii) reasonably assume
that a signatory has proper authorization to sign on behalf of the applicable
Holders of Common Stock and Preferred Stock or other party, and (iii) rely on
any directions received from the Majority Holders; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the Holder Representative shall not be required to follow any such
direction and shall be under no obligation to take any action in its capacity
as the Holder Representative (except as set forth in the Holder Representative
Engagement Letter (or in any other Holder Representative engagement letter)),
unless the Holder Representative is holding funds delivered to it under
_Section 3.5_ of this Agreement and/or has been provided with other funds,
security or indemnities which, in the sole determination of the Holder
Representative, are sufficient to protect the Holder Representative against
the costs, expenses and liabilities which may be incurred by the Holder
Representative in responding to such direction or taking such action. The
Holder Representative shall be entitled to engage such counsel, experts and
other agents and consultants as it shall deem necessary in connection with
exercising its powers and performing its function hereunder and under the
Escrow Agreement and (in the absence of bad faith on the part of the Holder
Representative) shall be entitled to conclusively rely on the opinions and
advice of such Persons. The Holder Representative shall be entitled to
reimbursement first, from funds paid to it under _Section 3.5_ of this
Agreement, second, from funds released from the Indemnity Escrow Funds at such
time as remaining amounts would otherwise be distributable to the Holders and
third, directly from the Holders, for all reasonable losses, claims, damages,
liabilities, fees, costs, expenses,

 



      
 

 



 

disbursements and advances (including fees, costs and disbursements of its
counsel, experts and other agents and consultants and in connection with
seeking recovery from insurers), judgments, fines or amounts paid in
settlement (collectively, the " _Holder Representative Expenses_ ") incurred
by the Holder Representative in such capacity. The Holders shall indemnify,
defend and hold harmless the Holder Representative Group from and against any
and all Holder Representative Expenses arising out of actions taken or omitted
to be taken by the Holder Representative in its capacity as such (except for
those arising out of the Holder Representatives bad faith or willful
misconduct), including the costs and expenses of investigation and defense of
claims. The Holders acknowledge that the Holder Representative shall not be
required to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur any financial
liability in the exercise or performance of any of its powers, rights, duties
or privileges or administration of its duties.

 



 

11.4. _Holder Allocable Expenses_. The amount paid to Holder Representative
under _Section 3.5_ shall be held by the Holder Representative as agent and
for the benefit of the Holders in a segregated client account and shall be
used (i) for the purposes of paying directly or reimbursing the Holder
Representative for any Holder Representative Expenses incurred pursuant to
this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or any Holder Representative letter
agreement, or (ii) as otherwise determined by the Advisory Group (the "
_Expense Fund_ "). The Holder Representative is not providing any investment
supervision, recommendations or advice and shall have no responsibility or
liability for any loss of principal of the Expense Fund other than as a result
of its gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Holder Representative is
not acting as a withholding agent or in any similar capacity in connection
with the Expense Fund, and has no tax reporting or income distribution
obligations hereunder. In the event that the Holder Allocable Expenses exceed
the Holder Representative Expenses, upon the final release of the Indemnity
Escrow Funds to the Holders, such excess amount shall be distributed to the
Paying Agent and the Paying Agent shall release such funds pursuant to such
Holders respective Post-Closing Payment Allocation.

 



 

 **ARTICLE XII. 
INDEMNIFICATION**

 



 

12.1. _Survival of Representations, Warranties and Covenants_. Each
representation warranty, covenant and obligation of the Company contained
herein and any certificate related to any such representation, warranty,
covenant or obligation will survive the Closing and continue in full force and
effect for eighteen (18) months from the Closing Date (such date, the "
_Survival Expiration Date_ "), except that the representations and warranties
set forth in _Section 4.6(a)_ (Capitalization of the Company) will survive
the Closing and will expire on the three (3) year anniversary of the Closing
Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that any covenant or obligation contained in
this Agreement that, by its terms, provides for performance following the
Closing Date, shall survive until such covenant or obligation is performed. No
claim for indemnification for breach of any representation, warranty, covenant
or agreement contained in, or otherwise pursuant to, this Agreement (other
than any covenant (excluding this _Article XII_) that provides for
performance following the Closing) may be asserted pursuant to this Agreement
unless (i) on or before the Survival Expiration Date, such claim is asserted
by proper written notice in accordance with this _Article XII_, specifying,
in reasonable detail, the basis of the claim and (ii) such claim is made in
respect of Damages specified, in reasonable detail, and incurred prior to the
Survival Expiration Date. For the avoidance of doubt, if in connection with
the filing of

 



      
 

 



 

any Tax Return or the payment of any Taxes Buyer determines that there has
been a breach of a representation or warranty made by the Company relating to
Taxes, Buyer may make a claim in respect of such breach. The representations
and warranties made by Buyer and Merger Sub in _Article V_ shall continue in
full force and effect for eighteen (18) months from the Closing Date.

 



 

12.2. _Indemnification_.

 



 

(a) Subject to _Section 12.4_, from and after the Effective Time, each Holder
shall indemnify and hold harmless, severally but not jointly, Buyer and its
Affiliates and its and their respective officers, directors, employees,
shareholders, partners, members, attorneys, accountants, agents and
representatives (collectively, the " _Buyer Indemnified Parties_ ") for any
and all Damages to the extent arising from (i) any breach of any
representation or warranty the Company has made in this Agreement (except for
the representations and warranties made in _Section 4.6(a)_), (ii) any breach
of the representations and warranties the Company has made in _Section
4.6(a)_, (iii) any breach by the Company of any covenant or agreement of the
Company in this Agreement requiring performance by the Company prior to or at
the Closing or by the Holder Representative after the Closing (other than
_Sections 6.2_ , _6.3_ , _6.4_ , _6.5_ or _8.1_ ), (iv) any claims related to
unissued New Common Stock pursuant to and as defined in the Reorganization
Plan (each such claim, a " _Reorganization Claim_ "), (v) any fraud by or on
behalf of the Company committed in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or (vi) any Action by any Holder relating to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (other than any Action brought
by the Holder Representative relating to Buyers indemnification obligations
pursuant to _Section 12.2(b)_); _provided_ , _however_ , that the Buyer
Indemnified Parties shall be indemnified for claims under _Section
12.2(a)(i)_ and _Section 12.2(a)(iii)_ (other than with respect to
intentional breaches) solely from the Indemnity Escrow Funds; _provided_ ,
_further_ , the Indemnity Escrow Funds must first be exhausted with respect to
any indemnification pursuant to this _Section 12.2(a)_ before recovery can be
made against any Holder.

 



 

(b) Subject to _Section 12.4_, from and after the Effective Time, Buyer shall
indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Holder Representative and the Holders
and its and their respective officers, directors, employees, shareholders,
agents and representatives (collectively, the " _Seller Indemnified Parties_
") for any and all Damages to the extent arising from (i) any breach of any
representation or warranty Buyer or Merger Sub has made in this Agreement or
(ii) any breach of any covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement
requiring performance by Buyer or Merger Sub prior to or at the Closing or by
Buyer, Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation after the Closing.

 



 

(c) Subject to _Section 12.4_ and the other provisions of this _Article
XII_, the amount of indemnification to which an Indemnified Party shall be
entitled under this _Article XII_ shall be determined: (i) by the written
agreement between the Indemnified Party and the Indemnitor, (ii) by a final
judgment or decree of any court of competent jurisdiction or (iii) by any
other means to which the Indemnified Party and the Indemnitor shall agree. The
judgment or decree of a court shall be deemed final when the time for appeal,
if any, shall have expired and no appeal shall have been taken or when all
appeals taken shall have been finally determined. The Indemnified Party shall
have the burden of proof in establishing the amount of Damages suffered by it.

 



      
 

 



 

12.3. _Indemnification Claim Procedures_.

 



 

(a) If any Action is commenced or threatened that is reasonably likely to give
rise to a claim for indemnification (an " _Indemnification Claim_ ") by any
Person entitled to indemnification under this Agreement (each, an "
_Indemnified Party_ "), then such Indemnified Party shall promptly (i) notify
the Indemnitor and (ii) deliver to the Indemnitor a written notice (A)
describing in reasonable detail the nature of the Action, (B) including a copy
of all papers served with respect to such Action, (C) including the
Indemnified Partys best estimate of the amount of Damages that may arise from
such Action and (D) describing in reasonable detail the basis for the
Indemnified Partys request for indemnification under this Agreement. Failure
to notify the Indemnitor in accordance with this _Section 12.3(a)_ will not
relieve the Indemnitor of any liability that it may have to the Indemnified
Party, except to the extent (1) the defense of such Action is materially
prejudiced by the Indemnified Partys failure to give such notice or (2) the
Indemnified Party fails to notify the Indemnitor of such Indemnification Claim
in accordance with this _Section 12.3(a)_ prior to the Survival Expiration
Date.

 



 

(b) An Indemnitor may elect at any time to assume and thereafter conduct the
defense of any Action subject to any such Indemnification Claim with counsel
of the Indemnitors choice (which counsel is reasonably satisfactory to the
Indemnified Party) and at its own expense and to settle or compromise any such
Action, unless (i) the Indemnified Party notifies the Indemnitor that the
Indemnified Party reasonably believes in good faith that such Action, if
adversely determined, would, after giving effect to the indemnity available
hereunder, materially impair the financial condition, business, operations,
reputation or prospects of the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates,
(ii) such Action relates to or arises in connection with any criminal
proceeding, indictment, allegation or investigation or any other action by or
on behalf of any Governmental Authority, (iii) such Action seeks an injunction
or equitable relief against the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates or
(iv) in the case of an Action involving a Buyer Indemnified Party as the
Indemnified Party, Damages that may reasonably arise from such Action would be
expected to result in Damages that, together with all other claims for
indemnification hereunder by the Buyer Indemnified Parties that are pending or
have previously been paid hereunder, would exceed the amount available to be
paid with respect to such Damages from the Indemnity Escrow Funds after giving
effect to all outstanding claims for indemnification under this _Article
XII_; _provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Agreement, with respect to any Reorganization Claim, the Indemnitor
shall have exclusive and absolute control over the allowance of such
Reorganization Claim, subject to the terms of the Reorganization Plan. Each
Indemnified Party shall cooperate in all respects with the conduct of such
defense by the Indemnitor (including the making of any related claims,
counterclaim or cross complaint against any Person in connection with the
Action) and/or the settlement of such Action by the Indemnitor; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Indemnitor will not agree to the entry of any judgment or
enter into any settlement or compromise with respect to such Action without
the Indemnified Partys prior written approval (which must not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed), unless the terms of such settlement (1) provide for a
complete release of the claims that are the subject of such Action in favor of
the Indemnified Party, (2) would not reasonably be expected to result in any
material limitation on the future operation of the business of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or any material liability or the creation of a
material financial obligation on the part of, the Indemnified Party or any of
its Affiliates (after giving effect to the indemnity available hereunder) and
(3) do not impose any

 



      
 

 



 

material injunctive or other equitable relief against, or involve any finding
or admission of any violation of Law by, the Indemnified Party or any of its
Affiliates (including any equitable remedies); _provided_ , _further_ , that
the Indemnitor shall allow the Indemnified Party a reasonable opportunity to
participate in such defense with its own counsel at its own expense. If the
Indemnified Party gives an Indemnitor notice of an Indemnification Claim and
the Indemnitor does not, within sixty (60) days after such notice is given,
(A) give notice to the Indemnified Party of its election to assume the defense
of the Action subject to such Indemnification Claim and (B) thereafter
promptly assume such defense, then the Indemnified Party may conduct the
defense of such Action; _provided_ , _however_ , that (x) the Indemnified
Party will not agree to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement
or compromise with respect to such Action or Actions without the prior written
consent of the Indemnitor (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed) and (y) the Indemnitor may thereafter assume the defense of such
Action. To the extent the defense of any Action subject to any Indemnification
Claim is assumed by the Holder Representative as the Indemnitor, at the
election of the Indemnitor, the costs and expenses of such defense of, and any
payment in respect of, any Action, including any settlement thereof, shall be
paid from the Indemnity Escrow Funds, and Buyer and the Holder Representative
shall instruct the Escrow Agent to disburse such portion of the Indemnity
Escrow Funds as is reasonably requested in writing by the Holder
Representative to pay such costs and expenses or other amounts; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that no amounts (other than, at the election of the Holder
Representative, costs and expenses of the Holder Representative as Indemnitor)
will be payable from the Indemnity Escrow Funds unless the Indemnified Party
is actually entitled to indemnification hereunder.

 



 

(c) If any Indemnified Party becomes aware of any circumstances that may give
rise to an Indemnification Claim for any matter not involving an Action, then
such Indemnified Party shall promptly (i) notify the Indemnitor and (ii)
deliver to the Indemnitor a written notice (A) describing in reasonable detail
the nature of the circumstances giving rise to the Indemnification Claim, (B)
including the Indemnified Partys best estimate of the amount of Damages that
may arise from such circumstances and (C) describing in reasonable detail the
basis for the Indemnified Partys request for indemnification under this
Agreement. Failure to notify the Indemnitor in accordance with this _Section
12.3(c)_ will not relieve the Indemnitor of any liability that it may have to
the Indemnified Party, except to the extent (1) the defense of such
Indemnification Claim is prejudiced by the Indemnified Partys failure to give
such notice or (2) the Indemnified Party fails to notify the Indemnitor of
such Indemnification Claim in accordance with this _Section 12.3(c)_ prior to
the Survival Expiration Date.

 



 

(d) At the reasonable request of the Indemnitor, each Indemnified Party shall
grant the Indemnitor and its representatives all reasonable access to the
books, records, employees and properties of such Indemnified Party to the
extent reasonably related to the matters to which the applicable
Indemnification Claim relates. All such access shall be granted during normal
business hours upon reasonable notice and shall be granted under the
conditions which shall not unreasonably interfere with the business and
operations of such Indemnified Party.

 



 

12.4. _Limitations on Indemnification Liability_. Notwithstanding any
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, any claims an Indemnified Party
makes under this _Article XII_ will be limited as follows:

 



      
 

 



 

(a) _Indemnification Cap_. The aggregate amount of Damages for which the Buyer
Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to indemnification pursuant to _Section
12.2(a)(i)_ and _Section 12.2(a)(iii)_ (other than with respect to
intentional breaches) will not exceed the Indemnity Escrow Cap and, in no
event, shall any Holder be liable to the Buyer Indemnified Parties for Damages
under this _Article XII_ (i) in excess of such Holders pro rata share of
such Damages (based upon the proportion of the aggregate transaction
consideration received) or (ii) in excess of the Merger Consideration actually
received by such Holder. The Indemnity Escrow Funds then remaining in escrow
shall serve as the sole and exclusive source of payment of any Indemnification
Claim pursuant to _Section 12.2(a)(i)_ and _Section 12.2(a)(iii)_ (other
than with respect to intentional breaches) and, in any event, the Indemnity
Escrow Funds must first be exhausted with respect to any indemnification
pursuant to _Section 12.2(a)_ before recovery can be made against any Holder.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
limitations set forth in this _Section 12.4_ shall not apply with respect to
a Holder in the case of such Holders actual fraud and such Holder shall be
liable to the Buyer Indemnified Parties for the full amount of Damages
resulting from, arising out of or related to such actual fraud.

 



 

(b) _Claims Basket_. The Buyer Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to
indemnification for any Damages to the extent arising from any breach of any
representation or warranty the Company has made in this Agreement (other than
the Fundamental Representations and the representations and warranties made in
_Section 4.15_ (Taxes)) unless and until the amount of Damages (excluding
costs and expenses of Buyer Indemnified Parties incurred in connection with
making such claim under this Agreement) incurred by the Buyer Indemnified
Parties that are the subject of such claim exceeds $75,000 (the " _Per-Claim
Basket_ ") (for the avoidance of doubt, for purposes of the Per-Claim Basket,
individual and unrelated claims underlying a breach of a representation or
warranty shall not be aggregated), and the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall
only be entitled to indemnification for any Damages to the extent arising from
any breach of any representation or warranty the Company has made in this
Agreement (other than the Fundamental Representations and the representations
and warranties made in _Section 4.15_ (Taxes)) to the extent the aggregate
amount of all Damages (excluding costs and expenses of Buyer Indemnified
Parties incurred in connection with making such claim under this Agreement)
incurred by the Buyer Indemnified Parties for which the Buyer Indemnified
Parties are entitled to indemnification for any Damages to the extent arising
from any breach of any representation or warranty the Company has made in this
Agreement (other than the Fundamental Representations and the representations
and warranties made in _Section 4.15_ (Taxes)) (excluding amounts below the
applicable Per-Claim Basket) exceeds $6,200,000 (the " _Basket Amount_ "), and
the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall only be entitled to indemnification for
such Damages to the extent such Damages exceed the Basket Amount. Other than
with respect to any claim for breach by Buyer of any representations,
warranties or covenants set forth in _Article II_, _Article III_ or _Article
VII_, the Seller Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to indemnification
pursuant to this _Article XII_ with respect to any claim for indemnification
unless and until the amount of Damages incurred by the Seller Indemnified
Parties that are the subject of such claim exceeds the Per-Claim Basket, and
the Seller Indemnified Parties shall only be entitled to indemnification
pursuant to this _Article XII_ to the extent the aggregate amount of all
Damages incurred by the Seller Indemnified Parties for which the Seller
Indemnified Parties are entitled to indemnification pursuant to this _Article
XII_ (excluding amounts below the applicable Per-Claim Basket) exceeds the
Basket Amount, and the Seller Indemnified Parties shall only be entitled to
indemnification

 



       
 

 



 

for such Damages to the extent such Damages exceed the Per-Claim Basket and
the Basket Amount. For purposes of determining whether any breach or
inaccuracy has occurred and the amount of any Damages under _Section 12.4(a)_
or this _Section 12.4(b)_, all qualifications and limitations as to
materiality, Material Adverse Effect and words of similar import set forth in
_Article IV_ shall be disregarded (except those contained in _Sections 4.10_
and _4.22(i)_ ).

 



 

(c) _Damages Net of Insurance Proceeds, Tax Benefits and Other Third-Party
Recoveries_.

 



 

(i) All Damages for which any Indemnified Party would otherwise be entitled
to indemnification under this _Article XII_ shall be reduced by the amount of
insurance proceeds, the Tax Benefit realized by the Indemnified Party,
indemnification payments and other third-party recoveries to which any
Indemnified Party obtains, receives or realizes in respect of any Damages
incurred by such Indemnified Party. For purposes of this Agreement, a " _Tax
Benefit_ " in respect of an Indemnified Party means an amount by which the Tax
liability of such Indemnified Party is actually reduced as a result of the
Damages subject to an Indemnification Claim under this Agreement. A Tax
Benefit that results from Damages giving rise to any indemnification payment
shall be considered actually realized by an Indemnified Party only to the
extent that (x) such Tax Benefit is realized during a tax period that ends on
the later of (A) the Survival Termination Date and (B) the date on which all
Pending Claims have been finally resolved or satisfied and (y) but for such
Tax Benefit, such Indemnified Partys Tax liability would be higher than it is
with such Tax Benefit (e.g., deductions, credits or losses of such Indemnified
Party that do not result from the event giving rise to the indemnification
payment shall be deemed to be used prior to the use of any deduction, credit
or loss that does not result from the event giving rise to the indemnification
payment).

 



 

(ii) In the event any Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates is entitled
to any insurance proceeds, Tax Benefit, indemnity payments or any third-party
recoveries in respect of any Damages (or any of the circumstances giving rise
thereto) for which such Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification
pursuant to this _Article XII_, such Indemnified Party shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain, receive or realize such proceeds, benefits
(including any Tax Benefit), payments or recoveries. In the event that any
such insurance proceeds, Tax Benefit, indemnity payments or other third-party
recoveries are obtained, received or realized by an Indemnified Party
subsequent to receipt by such Indemnified Party of any indemnification payment
hereunder in respect of the claims to which such insurance proceeds, Tax
Benefit, indemnity payments or other third-party recoveries relate,
appropriate refunds shall be made promptly by the relevant Indemnified Parties
of all or the relevant portion of such indemnification payment (after
deducting therefrom the amount of the expenses incurred by the Indemnified
Party in procuring such recovery). If such a refund is required and the
applicable indemnification payments were paid from the Indemnity Escrow Funds,
(i) if prior to the Survival Expiration Date, such amount will be deposited
with the Escrow

 



      
 

 



 

Agent to be held with the remaining Indemnity Escrow Funds and (ii)
thereafter, such amount will be paid to the Paying Agent for the account of
the Holders.

 



 

(iii) For the avoidance of doubt, any indemnification obligation of the
Holders pursuant to _Section 12.2(a)_ shall be reduced to the extent funds
are received from or made available to or on behalf of the Company or any
Buyer Indemnified Party from the escrow established pursuant to that certain
Indemnification Escrow Agreement, dated as of December 9, 2011, by and among
Rural/Metro of Northern California, Inc., Brian H. Cates and Raymond Iskander
as representatives of and on behalf of the Selling Shareholders (as defined
therein), and U.S. Bank National Association, in connection with the
acquisition of stock of Pacific Ambulance, Inc. and Bowers Companies Inc.
pursuant to that certain Stock Purchase and Sale Agreement dated September 27,
2011 (as amended), by and among Rural/Metro of Northern California, Inc., the
Selling Shareholders of the Companies (each as defined therein), and Brian H.
Cates and Raymond S. Iskander as the Selling Shareholders Representatives.
From and after the Closing, Buyer, the Surviving Corporation and their
respective Subsidiaries will take all commercially reasonable actions
reasonably requested by the Holder Representative in connection with claims
against such escrow or the release of funds therefrom with any reasonable out-
of-pocket cost incurred in connection therewith to be reimbursed from any
recovery from such escrow or from the Indemnity Escrow Funds, if available.

 



 

(d) _Assignment of Claims_. If any Indemnified Party receives any
indemnification payment pursuant to this _Article XII_, at the election of
the Indemnitor, such Indemnified Party shall assign to the Indemnitor all of
its claims for recovery against third Persons as to such Damages, whether by
insurance coverage, contribution claims, subrogation or otherwise.

 



 

(e) _Expenses_. In the event that the Holder Representative assumes any
defense of any Action for which a Buyer Indemnified Party has sought
indemnification, reasonable expenses incurred by any Seller Indemnified Party
in connection therewith, including reasonable legal costs and expenses, shall
constitute Damages for purposes of determining the maximum aggregate amount to
which the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall be entitled pursuant to _Section
12.4(a)_.

 



 

(f) _Consequential, Punitive and Certain Other Damages_. No Indemnified Party
shall be entitled to indemnification for any (i) special, punitive or
exemplary damages, (ii) any damage to reputation, loss relating to business
interruption or lost opportunity or loss of goodwill or (iii) any lost
profits, consequential, indirect or incidental damages, except, in each case
if and to the extent any such damages are recovered by a third party against
such Indemnified Party, and except, in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii), to
the extent such Damages are reasonably foreseeable.

 



 

(g) _Damages Reserved for on the Closing Statement or Included in Merger
Consideration_. No Buyer Indemnified Party shall be entitled to
indemnification for any Damages (i) in respect of any liability or obligation
specifically accrued or reserved for on the

 



      
 

 



 

Closing Statement or (ii) in respect of any liability included in the
calculation of the Merger Consideration.

 



 

(h) _No Duplicate Claims_. In the event a Buyer Indemnified Party or Seller
Indemnified Party, as the case may be, recovers Damages in respect of an
Indemnification Claim, no other Buyer Indemnified Party or Seller Indemnified
Party, as applicable, may recover the same Damages in respect of a claim for
indemnification under this Agreement.

 



 

12.5. _Mitigation of Damages_. An Indemnified Party shall use its reasonable
best efforts to mitigate any Damages for which it is entitled to
indemnification pursuant to this _Article XII_. The Indemnitor shall have the
right, but not the obligation, and shall be afforded the opportunity by the
Indemnified Party to the extent reasonably possible, to take all reasonably
available steps to minimize Damages for which the Indemnified Party is
entitled to indemnification before such Damages actually are incurred by the
Indemnified Party.

 



 

12.6. _Indemnification Sole and Exclusive Remedy_. Each of the Parties hereto
acknowledges and agrees that from and after the Closing, except in the event
of actual fraud, claims under this _Article XII_ shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy of the Buyer Indemnified Parties with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and, except as otherwise provided
for herein, the Indemnity Escrow Funds shall be the sole source of recovery of
the Buyer Indemnified Parties. In furtherance of the foregoing, Buyer and
Merger Sub, on behalf of themselves and on behalf of the Buyer Indemnified
Parties, hereby waive, from and after the Closing, to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Law, except in the event of actual fraud, any and
all rights, claims, and causes of action it may have against any indemnifying
party relating to the subject matter of this Agreement based upon predecessor
or successor liability, contribution, tort, strict liability or any Law or
otherwise. All representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement are
contractual in nature only and, except in the event of actual fraud, subject
to the sole and exclusive remedies set forth in this _Article XII_. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing:

 



 

(i) after the Closing Date, none of the Buyer Indemnified Parties may seek
the rescission of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

 



 

(ii) the provisions of and the limited remedies provided in this _Article
XII_ were specifically bargained for between the Parties hereto and were taken
into account by the Parties hereto in arriving at the Merger Consideration;

 



 

(iii) the Parties hereto have voluntarily agreed to define their rights,
liabilities and obligations respecting the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby exclusively in contract pursuant to the express terms and
provisions of this Agreement;

 



 

(iv) the sole and exclusive remedies for any breach of the terms and
provisions of this Agreement (including any representations and warranties set
forth herein, made in connection herewith or as an inducement to enter into
this Agreement) or any claim or cause of action otherwise arising out of or
related to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall be those

 



      
 

 



 

remedies available at law or in equity for breach of contract only (as such
contractual remedies have been further limited or excluded pursuant to the
express terms of this Agreement); and, except in the event of actual fraud,
the Parties hereto hereby agree that no party hereto shall have any remedies
or cause of action (whether in contract or in tort) for any statements,
communications, disclosures, representations or warranties, or failures to
disclose, not set forth in this Agreement; and

 



 

(v) the Parties hereto each hereby acknowledge that this Agreement embodies
the justifiable expectations of sophisticated parties derived from
arms-length negotiations, and the Parties hereto specifically acknowledge
that no Party hereto has any special relationship with another Party hereto
that would justify any expectation beyond that of an ordinary buyer and an
ordinary seller in an arms-length transaction.

 



 

For the avoidance of doubt, any adjustments made to the Merger Consideration
pursuant to _Section 3.4_ shall not be considered "remedies" for purposes of
this _Section 12.6_ and shall not be limited by the terms of this _Section
12.6_.

 



 

12.7. _Release of Indemnity Escrow_. The Escrow Agreement shall specify that
the Indemnity Escrow Funds shall be released to the Holders in accordance with
such Holders relative Post-Closing Payment Allocation on the first Business
Day following the Survival Expiration Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that if
the Specified Matter shall not have been finally concluded on or prior to the
Survival Expiration Date, then $10,000,000 of the Indemnity Escrow Funds shall
remain in escrow until the earlier of (i) final resolution of the Specified
Matter by entry of a final, non-appealable order or a fully-executed
settlement agreement and (ii) the later of the three year anniversary of (A)
the date of the last subpoena, other written request for testimony,
documentation, information or interviews and other discovery by any
Governmental Authority or relator to the Specified Matter (but not including
any demand or intervention initiated by or on behalf of Buyer or its
Affiliates) during such three-year period and (B) the Closing Date; and
_provided_ , _further_ , that if any Indemnification Claim (other than any
Indemnification Claim relating to the Specified Matter) shall have been
properly asserted by any Buyer Indemnified Party in accordance with this
Agreement on or prior to the Survival Expiration Date and remains pending on
the Survival Expiration Date (any such claim, a " _Pending Claim_ "), (i) the
Indemnity Escrow Funds released to the Holders shall be the amount of
Indemnity Escrow Funds then held by the Escrow Agent, _minus_ the aggregate
amount of any such Pending Claim and (ii) any funds that remain in escrow
following the Survival Expiration Date in respect of any such Pending Claim
shall be released to the Holders in accordance with such Holders relative
Post-Closing Payment Allocation promptly upon resolution or (if applicable)
satisfaction of such Pending Claim. For the avoidance of doubt, if at any time
the amount underlying any Pending Claim is reduced for any reason by the
applicable claimant or a Governmental Authority, the amount by which such
Pending Claim is reduced shall be immediately released to the Holders in
accordance with such Holders relative Post-Closing Payment Allocation. In
each case in which this _Section 12.7_ provides for the release of Indemnity
Escrow Funds, each of Buyer and the Holder Representative shall promptly
submit joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow
Agent to distribute the Indemnity Escrow Funds in accordance with this
_Section 12.7_ and the Escrow Agreement.

 **ARTICLE XIII. 
MISCELLANEOUS**

 



 

13.1. _Waiver_. Any Party to this Agreement may, at any time prior to the
Closing, by action taken by its board of directors (or other managing entity),
or officers thereunto duly authorized, waive any of the terms or conditions of
this Agreement or agree to an amendment or modification to this Agreement in
the manner contemplated by _Section 13.10_ and by an agreement in writing
executed in the same manner (but not necessarily by the same Persons) as this
Agreement. No waiver by any of the Parties hereto of any default,
misrepresentation or breach of warranty or covenant hereunder, whether
intentional or not, shall be deemed to extend to any prior or subsequent
default, misrepresentation or breach of warranty or covenant hereunder or
affect in any way any rights arising by virtue of any prior or subsequent such
occurrence. No waiver by any of the Parties of any of the provisions hereof
shall be effective unless explicitly set forth in writing and executed by the
party sought to be charged with such waiver. No delay on the part of any Party
in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a
waiver thereof, nor shall any waiver on the part of any Party of any right,
power or privilege hereunder operate as a waiver of any other right, power or
privilege hereunder, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right,
power or privilege hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or
the exercise of any other right, power or privilege hereunder.

 



 

13.2. _Notices_. All notices and other communications among the Parties shall
be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given (i) when delivered

prepaid, (iii) when delivered by FedEx or other nationally recognized

or to such other address or addresses as the Parties may from time to time
designate in writing.

 



 

13.3. _Assignment_. No Party hereto shall assign this Agreement or any part
hereof without the prior written consent of the other Parties, _provided_ that
Buyer may assign this Agreement to any of its Affiliates so long as it
guarantees the performance of all obligations of the assignee and the
enforceability and validity of the Guaranty is unaffected by any such
assignment. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of the Parties hereto and their respective permitted
successors and assigns.

 



 

13.4. _Rights of Third Parties_. Nothing expressed or implied in this
Agreement is intended or shall be construed to confer upon or give any Person,
other than the Parties hereto, any right or remedies under or by reason of
this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that, notwithstanding the foregoing
(i) in the event the Closing occurs, the Indemnified Persons, Other
Indemnitors and past, present and future officers, directors and employees of
the Company (and their successors, heirs and representatives) are intended
third-party beneficiaries of, and may enforce, _Section 7.2_ (ii) from and
after the Effective Time, the Holders (and their successors, heirs and
representatives) shall be intended third-party beneficiaries of, and may
enforce, _Articles II_ , _III_ and the other sections of this Agreement
providing for payment to such Holder, (iii) the past, present and future
directors, officers, employees, incorporators, members, partners,
stockholders, Affiliates, agents, attorneys, advisors and representatives of

heirs and representatives), are intended third-party beneficiaries of, and may
enforce, _Section 13.15_, (iv) the pre-Closing directors, officers and
representatives of the Company and its Subsidiaries (and their successors,
heirs and representatives) shall be intended third party beneficiaries of, and

13.5. _Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided herein or by the other
documents or agreements contemplated hereby, each Party hereto, other than the
Holder Representative (whose expenses shall be paid out of funds paid to the
Holder Representative under _Section 3.5_), shall bear its own expenses
incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions herein
contemplated whether or not such transactions shall be consummated, including
all fees of its legal counsel, financial advisers and accountants; _provided_
, _however_ , that all stamp taxes or other transfer taxes payable as a result
of the Merger (" _Transfer Taxes_ ") shall be borne 50% by Buyer and 50% by
the Company; _provided_ , _further_ , that, in the event that the transactions
contemplated hereby are not consummated, (i) the Company shall reimburse the
Holder Representative for all costs and expenses incurred by the Holder
Representative in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and
(ii) Buyer shall pay all fees and expenses in connection with any financing
arrangements, regardless of whether such financing fees and expenses were to
be incurred by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

 



 

13.6. _Governing Law_. This Agreement, and all claims or causes of action
based upon, arising out of, or related to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby (including all claims (whether in contract, equity, tort
or otherwise) against any of the Committed Financing Sources), shall be
governed by, and construed in accordance with, the

 



      
 

 



 

Laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to principles or rules of
conflict of laws to the extent such principles or rules would require or
permit the application of Laws of another jurisdiction; provided, however, to
the extent required by the laws of the State of Delaware (including any Law
related to any fiduciary duty, duty of loyalty or other duty or obligation of
the board of directors of the Company with respect to the Merger, this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby), in which case such Laws
shall apply to the Merger.

 



 

13.7. _Captions; Counterparts_. The captions in this Agreement are for
convenience only and shall not be considered a part of or affect the
construction or interpretation of any provision of this Agreement. This
Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be
deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the
same instrument.

 



 

13.8. _Schedules and Annexes_. The Schedules and Annexes referenced herein are
a part of this Agreement as if fully set forth herein. Any information set

to the extent that it is reasonably apparent that such information is relevant
to such other section or subsection. Certain information set forth in the
Schedules is included solely for informational purposes and may not be

Annexes to this Agreement), the Escrow Agreement, the Paying Agent Agreement,
the Guaranty, the Shareholder Joinder Agreements and that certain
confidentiality agreement dated as of March 14, 2015 between American Medical

Parties relating to the transactions contemplated hereby and supersede any
other agreements, whether written or oral, that may have been made or entered
into by or among any of the Parties hereto or any of their respective
Subsidiaries relating to the transactions contemplated hereby. No
representations, warranties, covenants, understandings, agreements, oral or
otherwise, relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement exist

13.10. _Amendments_. This Agreement may be amended or modified in whole or in
part, only by a duly authorized agreement in writing executed in the same
manner as this Agreement and which makes reference to this Agreement. The
approval of this Agreement by the holders of Common Stock of the Company shall
not restrict the ability of the board of directors of the Company to terminate
this Agreement in accordance with _Section 10.1_ or to cause the Company to
enter into an amendment to this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 13.10_ to
the extent permitted under Section 251(d) of the DGCL. To the extent any
amendment or modification to _Sections_ _13.4_ , _13.6_ , _13.10_ or _13.13_
is sought which is adverse to the rights of the

 



      
 

 



 

Committed Financing Sources, the prior written consent of the Committed
Financing Sources shall be required before such amendment or modification is
rendered effective.

 



 

13.11. _Publicity_. The Parties agree that, from the date hereof through the
Closing Date, no public release or announcement concerning the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be issued or made by or on behalf of any Party
without the prior consent of the other Parties, except that (i) each Party may
make announcements from time to time to their respective employees, customers,
suppliers and other business relations or otherwise as it may reasonably
determine is necessary to comply with applicable Law or the requirements of
any agreement to which it or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, (ii) each
Party and their respective Affiliates may make statements that are
substantially similar to previous press releases, public disclosures or public
statements made by the Parties in compliance with this _Section 13.11_ and
(iii) Buyer, in connection with the Financing, may disclose information
concerning the transactions contemplated by this Agreement of the type
typically included in any offering or private placement of debt securities
pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act, including pro forma financial
information and a summary of the transaction and this Agreement, after
providing the Company with a reasonable opportunity to review such disclosure
and acting in good faith to take into account the reasonable comments of the
Company. The Parties further acknowledge and agree that the Holders may
disclose such terms and the existence of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby to its and their Affiliates in order that such Persons may
provide information about the subject matter of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby to their respective limited partners and
prospective limited partners in connection with their fundraising and
reporting activities.

 



 

13.12. _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid or
unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction, the other provisions of
this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. The Parties further
agree that if any provision contained herein is, to any extent, held invalid
or unenforceable in any respect under the Laws governing this Agreement, they
shall take any actions necessary to render the remaining provisions of this
Agreement valid and enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by Law and, to
the extent necessary, shall amend or otherwise modify this Agreement to
replace any provision contained herein that is held invalid or unenforceable
with a valid and enforceable provision giving effect to the intent of the
Parties.

 



 

13.13. _Jurisdiction; WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_.

 



 

(a) Any proceeding or action based upon, arising out of or related to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (including the Committed
Financing) shall be brought in the courts of the Borough of Manhattan in the
State of New York, or, if it has or can acquire jurisdiction, in the United
States District Court for the Southern District of New York, and, in each
case, appellate courts therefrom, and each of the Parties irrevocably submits
to the exclusive jurisdiction of each such court in any such proceeding or
action, waives any objection it may now or hereafter have to personal
jurisdiction, venue or to convenience of forum, agrees that all claims in
respect of the proceeding or action shall be heard and determined only in any
such court, and agrees not to bring any proceeding or action arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby in any
other court. Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to affect the right of
any Party to serve process in any manner

 



      
 

 



 

permitted by Law or to commence legal proceedings or otherwise proceed against
any other Party in any other jurisdiction, in each case, to enforce judgments
obtained in any action, suit or proceeding brought pursuant to this _Section
13.13(a)_.

 



 

(b) Each Party hereto hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law, any right it may have to a trial by jury in
respect of any suit, action or other proceeding arising out of this Agreement
(including any issue, action, claim, cause of action or suit against any
Committed Financing Source) or the transactions contemplated hereby. Each
Party hereto (i) certifies that no representative, agent or attorney of any
other Party has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such Party would
not, in the event of any action, suit or proceeding, seek to enforce the
foregoing waiver and (ii) acknowledges that it and the other Parties hereto
have been induced to enter into this Agreement, by, among other things, the
mutual waiver and certifications in this _Section 13.13(b)_.

 



 

13.14. _Enforcement_. The Parties agree that irreparable damage for which
monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would
occur in the event that the Parties do not perform their obligations under the
provisions of this Agreement (including failing to take such actions as are
required of them hereunder to consummate this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated thereby) in accordance with its specified terms or otherwise
breach such provisions. The Parties acknowledge and agree (a) that the
Parties shall be entitled to an injunction, specific performance, or other
equitable relief, to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof, without proof of damages, this
being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled under this
Agreement, (b) that the right of specific enforcement is an integral part of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and without that right, the
Parties would not have entered into this Agreement and (c) not to assert that
a remedy of specific performance is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to law or
inequitable for any reason, nor to assert that a remedy of monetary damages
would provide an adequate remedy. Each Party agrees that it will not oppose
the granting of specific performance and other equitable relief on the basis
that the other Parties have an adequate remedy at Law or that an award of
specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at Law or
equity. The Parties acknowledge and agree that any Party seeking an injunction
to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms
and provisions of this Agreement in accordance with this _Section 13.14_
shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in connection with
any such injunction. To the extent any Party brings an action, suit or
proceeding to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions
of this Agreement (other than an action, suit or proceeding to enforce
specifically any provision that expressly survives termination of this
Agreement), the Outside Date shall automatically be extended to (i) the
twentieth (20th) Business Day following the resolution of such action, suit or
proceeding or (ii) such other time period established by the court presiding
over such action, suit or proceeding (it being understood that this _Section
13.14_ shall not be deemed to alter, amend, supplement or otherwise modify the
terms of any Debt Commitment Letter (including the expiration or termination
provisions thereof)). Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, if the Company is granted specific performance in accordance with
this _Section 13.14_, the Company is entitled to receive from Buyer the
payment of any fees, costs and expenses (including legal fees) incurred by the
Company in connection with the Companys pursuit of such grant of specific
performance.

 



       
 

 



 

13.15. _Non-Recourse_. Without limiting the rights of the Company under and to
the extent provided in _Section 13.14_ , this Agreement may only be enforced
against, and any claim or cause of action based upon, arising out of, or
related to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby may only be
brought against, the entities that are expressly named as Parties hereto (and
the Guarantor in accordance with the Guaranty) and then only with respect to
the specific obligations set forth herein with respect to such Party, or with
respect to the Guarantor, set forth in the Guaranty. Without limiting the
rights of the Company under and to the extent provided in _Section 13.6_,
except to the extent a Person is a named Party to this Agreement (and the
Guarantor in accordance with the Guaranty) (and then only to the extent of the
specific obligations undertaken by such named Party in this Agreement or, with
respect to the Guarantor, set forth in the Guaranty), (i) no past, present or
future director, officer, employee, incorporator, member, partner,
stockholder, Affiliate, agent, attorney, advisor or representative or
Affiliate of any named Party and (ii) no past, present or future director,
officer, employee, incorporator, member, partner, stockholder, Affiliate,
agent, attorney, advisor or representative or Affiliate of any of the
foregoing, shall have any liability (whether in contract, tort, equity or
otherwise) for any one or more of the representations, warranties, covenants,
agreements or other obligations or liabilities of any Party under this
Agreement (whether for indemnification or otherwise) of or for any claim based
on, arising out of, or related to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby.

 



 

13.16. _Waiver of Conflicts Regarding Representations; Non-Assertion of
Attorney-Client Privilege_.

 



 

(a) Buyer acknowledges that Latham and Watkins LLP (" _L andW_") has, on or prior
to the Closing Date, represented one or more of the Holder Representative, one
or more Holders, the Company, and the Companys Subsidiaries and other
Affiliates, and their respective officers, employees and directors (each such
Person, other than the Company and its Subsidiaries, a " _Designated Person_
") in connection with this Agreement or any other agreements or transactions
contemplated hereby (including any matter that may be related to a lawsuit,
claim or dispute arising under or related to this Agreement or such other
agreements or in connection with such transactions contemplated hereby) (each,
an " _Existing Representation_ "), and that, in the event of any post-Closing
matters (x) relating to this Agreement or any other agreements or transactions
contemplated hereby (including any matter that may be related to a lawsuit,
claim or dispute arising under this Agreement or such other agreements or in
connection with such transactions contemplated hereby) and (y) in which Buyer
or any of its Affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries), on the one hand, and one or more Designated Persons, on the
other hand, are in a dispute with each other (each, a " _Post-Closing Matter_
"), the Designated Persons reasonably anticipate that LandW will represent them
in connection with such matters. Accordingly, each of Buyer and the Surviving
Corporation hereby (i) waives and shall not assert, and agrees after the
Closing to cause its Affiliates to waive and to not assert, any conflict of
interest arising out of or relating to the representation by LandW of one or
more Designated Persons in connection with one or more Post-Closing Matters
(the " _Post-Closing Representations_ ") and (ii) agrees that, in the event
that a Post-Closing Matter arises, LandW may represent one or more Designated
Persons in a Post-Closing Matter even though the interests of such Person(s)
may be directly adverse to Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries), and even though LandW may (A) have
represented the Company, its Subsidiaries or a Designated Person in a matter
substantially related to such

 



      
 

 



 

dispute or (B) be currently representing Buyer, the Company or any of their
respective Affiliates in one or more matters unrelated to the Post-Closing
Representations. Without limiting the foregoing, each of Buyer and the
Surviving Corporation (on behalf of itself and its Affiliates) consents to the
disclosure by LandW to the Designated Persons of any information learned by LandW
in the course of one or more Existing Representations, whether or not such
information is subject to the attorney-client privilege of the Surviving
Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries and/or LandWs duty of confidentiality as
to the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries and whether or not
such disclosure is made before or after the Closing.

 



 

(b) Each of Buyer and the Surviving Corporation (on behalf of itself and its
Affiliates) waives and shall not assert, and agrees after the Closing to cause
its Affiliates to waive and to not assert, any attorney-client privilege,
attorney work-product protection or expectation of client confidence with
respect to any communication between LandW, on the one hand, and any Designated
Person or the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Pre-
Closing Designated Persons_ "), or any advice given to any Pre-Closing
Designated Person by LandW, occurring during one or more Existing
Representations (collectively, " _Pre-Closing Privileges_ ") in connection
with any Post-Closing Representation, including in connection with a dispute
between any Designated Person and one or more of Buyer, the Surviving
Corporation and their respective Affiliates, it being the intention of the
Parties hereto that all rights to such Pre-Closing Privileges, and all rights
to waiver or otherwise control such Pre-Closing Privileges, shall not be
claimed or used by Buyer, the Surviving Corporation or their respective
Affiliates, except as provided in the last sentence of this _Section
13.16(b)_. Furthermore, each of Buyer and the Surviving Corporation (on behalf
of themselves and their respective Affiliates) acknowledges and agrees that
any advice given solely to or communication solely with any of the Designated
Persons shall not be subject to any joint privilege (whether or not the
Surviving Corporation or one more of its Subsidiaries also received such
advice or communication) and shall be owned solely by such Designated Persons
post-Closing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a dispute
arises between Buyer or the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries,
on the one hand, and a third party other than a Designated Person, on the
other hand, the Surviving Corporation shall (and shall cause its Affiliates
to) assert the Pre-Closing Privileges on behalf of the Designated Persons to
prevent disclosure of privileged materials to such third party; it being
understood and agreed that such privilege may be waived only with the prior
written consent of the Holder Representative.

 



 

(c) Buyer, Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation agree that the Pre-Closing
Privilege shall survive the Closing, and absent the prior written consent of
the Holder Representative, neither Buyer, Merger Sub nor the Surviving
Corporation shall have a right of access to, or reliance upon, any books and
records and other documents of the Company and its Subsidiaries containing any
advice or communication that is covered by any Pre-Closing Privilege. The
Designated Persons, Buyer, Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation shall take
such measures as are reasonably necessary to protect the confidentiality of
any such materials and to maintain the Pre-Closing Privilege. In no event
shall Buyer, Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation assert any waiver over
any Pre-Closing Privilege due to the acquisition of any books and records of
the Company or the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



      
 

 



 

The Holder Representative shall reasonably cooperate with the Surviving
Corporation in connection with its defense against any third party claims.

 



 

(d) Each of Buyer and Merger Sub hereby acknowledges (including on behalf of
its Affiliates and the Surviving Corporation) that it has had the opportunity
to discuss and obtain adequate information concerning the significance and
material risks of, and reasonable available alternatives to, the waivers,
permissions and other provisions of this Agreement, including the opportunity
to consult with counsel other than LandW. This _Section 13.16_ shall be
irrevocable, and no term of this _Section 13.16_ may be amended, waived or
modified, without the prior written consent of the Holder Representative and
LandW.
