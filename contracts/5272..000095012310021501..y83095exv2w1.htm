Shares referred to in _clause 2.3(b)_ shall be such whole number as most
nearly represents 11.3 per cent (the "Relevant Percentage") of the issued
ordinary share capital of the Purchaser immediately following Completion. The
Relevant Percentage has been calculated by expressing as a percentage
the result of dividing the notional Sterling value of the Consideration
Shares (being Â£3.613 billion) (the "Consideration Shares Value") by the sum
of: (w) Â£15.257 billion, being the market capitalisation in Sterling of
Prudential as at close of trading on the trading day immediately prior to the
date of this agreement, (x) less the value of the final dividend which is
Â£0.343 billion, (y) plus Â£13.465 billion, being the expected gross proceeds
in Sterling of the Rights Issue (the "Expected Sterling Gross Proceeds") and
(z) plus the Consideration Shares Value. In the event that the actual
Sterling gross proceeds of the Rights Issue (the "Actual Sterling Gross
Proceeds") differ from the Expected Sterling Gross Proceeds, the Relevant
Percentage shall be re-calculated as described above on the basis that the
value to be inserted at (y) shall be the Actual Sterling Gross Proceeds rather
than the Expected Sterling Gross Proceeds.

  2.6  |   | If the Purchaser would be unable to receive the desired

credit of 100% from Standard and PoorÂ’s, 100% from MoodyÂ’s and 100% from Fitch
for the Mandatory Convertible Securities as at or with effect from the
Completion Date, both parties agree to enter into good faith negotiations with
the aim of modifying the terms of the Mandatory Convertible Securities so
that the desired regulatory capital treatment or equity credit can be
achieved, provided that neither party shall be obliged to agree to any such
terms that are less favourable than the Terms and Conditions of the Mandatory
Convertible Securities. For the avoidance of doubt, this provision shall
not allow the Purchaser to enter into negotiations with the Parent to modify
the terms of the Mandatory Convertible Securities after the Completion Date
(otherwise than in accordance with the Terms and Conditions of the Mandatory
Convertible Securities).  
      
  2.7  |   | At Completion, the Seller shall transfer and the Parent shall

     4.13  |   | The obligation of Prudential set out in _clause 4.12_
is (for the avoidance of doubt) subject to the fiduciary duties from time to
time of its directors and the ability of the directors to withdraw, qualify
or modify the Board Recommendation at any time shall not be limited by
anything other than as provided expressly in these _clauses 4.12_ and 
_4.13_. In particular, the obligation of those directors to give and maintain
the Board Recommendation is subject to any duty of such directors to make
full and honest disclosure to shareholders of, among other things, any
changes of circumstances before they vote on such resolutions and to express
their opinion as to what they consider is in the interests of Prudential at
any particular time in the light of what they

or deemed necessary or appropriate, by the directors in the absolute
discretion.

     4.14  |   | In the event that the directors of Prudential shall at
any time be minded to withdraw, qualify or modify the Board Recommendation

shall and Prudential shall procure that the directors shall:  
---|---|--- 
   

  

       | (a)  |   | notify the Parent and Seller forthwith of the
prospective Change of Recommendation and, in reasonable detail, of the facts,
matters and circumstances underlying the prospective Change of
Recommendation;  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | consult with the Parent and Seller as to the
prospective Change of Recommendation and afford to the Parent and Seller
reasonable opportunities to meet and discuss the same with the directors
and/or senior executives of Prudential;  
      
    | (c)  |   | obtain legal advice in writing from competent
independent legal counsel qualified in English law and experienced in the
field of directorsÂ’ duties as to the nature, extent and application of the

    | (d)  |   | afford to counsel nominated by Parent and Seller a
reasonable opportunity to consult with counsel to the directors as referred
to in sub paragraph (b) above (who shall be instructed to provide appropriate
explanations to counsel nominated by the Parent and Seller);  
      
    | (e)  |   | where practicable having regard to the timing of the
Court Meeting and general meeting of Prudential, not make or agree to make,

with the provisions of this  _clause 4.14_ and without having first allowed
the Parent and Seller at least 48 hours to consult and otherwise exercise the
rights given to them pursuant to this  _clause 4.14_ following the
notification pursuant to _sub clause (a)_  above.  
   

  

     4.15  |   | In the event of a Change of Recommendation and
provided that the Prudential directors comply with their obligations under
_clause 4.14_ , the Parent and the Seller shall not be permitted or entitled
to claim, allege or suggest that the directors did not act in accordance with
their obligations under this agreement

Prudential did not act in accordance with their obligations under this
agreement.  
---|---|--- 
   

  

     4.16  |   | For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this _clause 4_
shall restrict or otherwise modify or extinguish the obligations of any party
to continue to comply with their continuing obligations under this agreement
notwithstanding any potential or actual Change of Recommendation; _provided_
that if a Change of Recommendation occurs, the PurchaserÂ’s and PrudentialÂ’s
continuing obligations in respect of the satisfaction of the Condition
set out in _clause 3.1(c)_ shall not include an obligation to endeavour to
obtain the votes of PrudentialÂ’s shareholders in favour of the Resolutions.  
---|---|---

any discussions with any third party with a view to entering into,

or arranging finance for that purpose) any other person in doing any of
the foregoing.

tender or other type of offer including, without limitation, an acquisition,
takeover, amalgamation or merger transaction (however effected), reverse
takeover, scheme or

forth in an amendment or supplement to the Circular, the Purchaser Prospectus
or the Prudential Prospectus, Prudential or the Purchaser (as applicable)

Parent and the Seller.  
      
  4.20  |   | The Seller and the Parent on the one hand and the Purchaser

anything of which they become aware which will or will be reasonably likely

under _clauses 4.3_ , _4.4_ ,  _4.5_ , _4.7_ or _4.22_ or otherwise as a
consequence of information on the Purchaser or its Affiliates that is

     5.  |   | Completion  
---|---|--- 
      
  5.1  |   | On a date to be nominated by the Purchaser, being not later

Conditions has been satisfied or (if applicable) waived (other than those
Conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at Completion,
including the Conditions set out in _clauses 3.1(d)(iii)_ and _(iv)_ , but
subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions at Completion), or
on such other date as the parties may agree in writing, completion of the
sale and purchase of the Shares ("Completion") shall take place at the

_(d)(i)_ have been satisfied, Prudential shall arrange with the court a date
for the hearing at which it will seek the sanction of the court to the Scheme
of Arrangement and the confirmation of the court to the Prudential Reduction
of Capital (the "Court Sanction Date"). Upon arranging such date,
the Purchaser shall promptly give notice to the Parent of such date.  
      
  5.3  |   | The Purchaser and the Seller shall, prior to the Court
Sanction Date, agree to appropriate mechanics regarding the documents to be
delivered pursuant to _Schedule 3_ such that the court will be prepared to

     5.6  |   | Each party acknowledges and agrees that following
Completion, none of the parties shall be entitled to rescind this agreement
and, accordingly, each party, to the maximum extent permitted by Law, waives
all and any rights of rescission it may have in respect of this agreement.  
---|---|--- 
      
  6.  |   | Warranties  
      
  6.1  |   | The Parent and the Seller hereby warrant to the Purchaser

out in _paragraphs 1_ , _2_ , _3_ , _4_ ,  _9_ , _11_ , and _13_ of _Schedule
1 (Warranties)_ are accurate as at the date of this agreement, and (iii) all
other Warranties are accurate as at 1 November 2009, in each case subject to,
and as qualified by, the Disclosure Letter. The Purchaser shall not be
entitled to claim that any fact, matter or circumstance causes any of the
Warranties to be breached if such fact, matter or circumstance is fairly
disclosed (or deemed disclosed) in the Disclosure Letter or in any document
delivered or deemed delivered with it.  
      
  6.2  |   | The Purchaser shall notify the Parent and the Seller not more
than 30 Business Days and not less than 10 Business Days in advance of the

the Seller shall: (a) between the date of receipt of such notice and the date
falling 2 Business Days prior to the intended Posting Date so notified by the
Purchaser (the "Additional Disclosure Date"), deliver to the Purchaser
information (the "Additional Disclosure") about any matter arising between
the Signing Date and the Additional Disclosure Date that would have been
required to be disclosed in the AIA Prospectus in order to make the Warranty
set forth in _paragraph 12_ of _Schedule 1 (Warranties)_ true and correct as
of the Additional Disclosure Date as if it had been made as of the Additional
Disclosure Date as soon as reasonably practicable after such information
becomes available (it being understood that this obligation is not intended
to require daily disclosure but rather disclosure as appropriate with a view
to assisting with the preparation of the Purchaser Prospectus, Prudential
Prospectus and Circular); and (b) on the Additional Disclosure Date, deliver
to the Purchaser a letter addressed to the Purchaser from the Parent (the
"Warranty Letter"), warranting to the Purchaser that, as of the Additional
Disclosure Date, the Additional Disclosure, taken together with the AIA
Prospectus, does not contain any untrue statement of material fact or omit to
state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements contained therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading; _provided_ that if the Parent and the Seller shall
have complied with their obligations under this _clause 6.2_ , and if the
Posting Date does not occur on the date notified by the Purchaser, the Parent
and the Seller shall have no   
  

  ##### 

  

  

      |   | further obligation to provide any such information to the
Purchaser under this _clause 6.2_.  
---|---|--- 
   

  

     6.3  |   | Except for the Warranties, neither the Parent nor the
Seller makes any representation or warranty of any kind or nature whatsoever,
oral or written, express or implied, with respect to the Seller, the Company,
the Company Subsidiaries, the business of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries, the Transaction Agreements or the transactions contemplated by
the Transaction Agreements, including any representation or warranty relating
to the financial condition, results of operations, assets or liabilities of
any of the foregoing entities. Except for the Warranties, the Parent and the
Seller disclaim all liability and responsibility for any representations or
warranties, whether made by the Parent, or any of its Affiliates
or Representatives or any other Person, and any opinion, projection,
forecast, advice, statement or information made, communicated or furnished
(orally or in writing) to the Purchaser or its Affiliates or Representatives
(including any opinion, projection, forecast, advice, statement or
information that may have been or may be provided to the Purchaser by any
Representative of the Parent or any of its Affiliates). Neither the Parent
nor the Seller makes any representations or warranties to the Purchaser or
any other Person regarding the probable success or profitability of the
Company, the Company Subsidiaries or the business of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries (whether before or after Completion).  
---|---|--- 
      
  6.4  |   | The Seller and the Parent undertake to disclose in writing to
the Purchaser anything to the knowledge of the Parent that is or is
reasonably likely to constitute:  
   

  

       | (a)  |   | a breach of Warranty that, without giving effect
to any limitations as to materiality or Material Adverse Change set forth
therein, has had, or would reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse
Change;  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | a breach of the ParentÂ’s covenants under _clause 8.1_
and/or  _Schedule 2_ where any such breach is material in the context of the
AIA Group taken as a whole; or  
      
    | (c)  |   | a Material Adverse Change,  
   

  

       |   | promptly upon it coming to the notice of the Seller or
the Parent between the date of this agreement and the Completion Date (in the
case of _paragraph (a) or (b)_) and the Admission Date (in the case of
_paragraph (c)_ ).  
---|---|--- 
   

  ##### 

  

   

     6.5  |   | The Seller and the Parent undertake, in the absence of
fraud, that if any claim is made against them in connection with the sale of
the Shares to the Purchaser, not to make any claim against any member of the
AIA Group or any director, employee, agent or adviser of any such member on
whom it may have relied before agreeing to any term of the Transaction
Agreements or authorising any statement in the Disclosure Letter.  
---|---|--- 
      
  6.6  |   | The Purchaser hereby warrants to the Parent and the Seller as
at the date hereof as follows (the "Purchaser Warranties"):  
   

  

       | (a)  |   | each of the Purchaser and Prudential is a
corporation duly incorporated and validly existing under the Laws of the
jurisdiction of its incorporation with full power and authority to conduct
such business as it presently conducts, and has been in continuous existence
since its incorporation;  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | each of the Purchaser and Prudential has all requisite
power to enter into and, subject to satisfaction of the Conditions, complete
the transactions contemplated by and carry out its obligations under the
Transaction Agreements to which it is a party. The execution and delivery by
each of the Purchaser and Prudential of each of the Transaction Agreements to
which it is a party, and, subject to satisfaction of the Conditions, the
completion by each of the Purchaser and Prudential of the
transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreements, has been (or will be
prior to Completion be) duly authorised by all requisite corporate or other
similar action on the part of the Purchaser or Prudential. Each of the
Transaction Agreements to which the Purchaser and Prudential is a party has
been, or upon execution and delivery thereof, will be, duly executed and
delivered by the Purchaser or Prudential as applicable;  
      
    | (c)  |   | the execution and delivery by the Purchaser and
Prudential of the Transaction Agreements do not, and the completion by the
Purchaser or Prudential of the transactions contemplated by the Transaction
Agreements to which each is a party will not, require any Governmental
Approvals (other than those identified in _Schedule 7 (Regulatory and anti-
trust approvals)_) or approval of PurchaserÂ’s shareholders (other than the
PurchaserÂ’s Shareholder Approval) to be obtained or made by the Purchaser or
Prudential, except for such notices, filings, exemptions or
reviews, authorisations, consents or approvals that (i) would not give rise
to a material liability in a jurisdiction material to the Purchaser Group or
to criminal liability or (ii) of which the Purchaser was not aware after due
enquiry;  
   

  ##### 

  

   

       | (d)  |   | assuming due authorisation, execution and
delivery by the other parties hereto or thereto, each of the Transaction
Agreements to which the Purchaser or Prudential is a party constitutes, or
upon execution and delivery thereof, will constitute, legal, valid and
binding obligations of the Purchaser or Prudential, enforceable against it in
accordance with its terms. For purposes of this _clause 6.6(d)_ , the term
"enforceable" means that the obligations in question are of a type which the
English courts enforce and does not mean that those obligations necessarily
will be enforced in accordance with their terms or be binding in
all circumstances. In particular, enforcement may be subject to equitable
principles, time-barring of claims and laws generally affecting the rights of
creditors;  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (e)  |   | the statement in the Announcement to the effect that
the directors intend to make the Board Recommendation referred to in _clause
4.12(a)_ was considered at a duly convened and held meeting of the board of
directors or a committee of the directors of Prudential in light of, inter
alia, such directorsÂ’ fiduciary and statutory duties under English law;  
      
    | (f)  |   | the Purchaser has delivered to the Parent and the
Seller in the agreed form certified copies of (i) an executed commitment
letter, dated as of the date hereof (the "Underwriting Commitment Letter"),
between the Purchaser and the Underwriters relating to the commitment by the
Underwriters to enter into a definitive agreement in the form set out in
Schedule 4 to the Underwriting Commitment Letter (the "Underwriting
Agreement") pursuant to which the Underwriters would underwrite the Rights
Issue (the "Underwriting") in the aggregate amount of US$20 billion (net
of costs, fees and expenses) pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of
the Underwriting Agreement, ( _ii_ ) an executed $5,400,000,000 Bridge
Facility Agreement between Prudential and the Debt Financiers, dated as of
the date hereof (the "Bridge Credit Agreement", and together with the
Underwriting Commitment Letter, the "Commitments", collectively referred to
as the "Financing");  
      
    | (g)  |   | the Commitments are in full force and effect and are
valid. The obligations of the parties thereto to fund the Commitments are not
subject to any conditions other than as set forth in the Commitments. As of
the Signing Date, no event has occurred that (with or without notice, lapse
of time or both) would constitute a breach or default under the Commitments
by the Purchaser or Prudential. Neither the Purchaser nor Prudential has any
knowledge of any facts or circumstances that are reasonably likely to result
in ( _i_ ) any of the   
  

  ##### 

  

  

      |   |   | conditions set forth in the Commitments not being
satisfied or ( _ii_ ) the funding contemplated in the Commitments not being
made available to the Purchaser on a timely basis in order to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this agreement;  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (h)  |   | the Purchaser is not aware of any facts or conditions
related to its regulatory or financial status (including pending or
threatened proceedings, claims, judgments, orders, or legal administrative or
arbitration proceedings or investigations by any Governmental Authority) that
are reasonably likely to impede its ability to promptly obtain any
Governmental Approvals necessary for it to comply in full with its
obligations under the Transaction Agreements. In the past three years, in the
East Asian jurisdictions in which the Purchaser operates: (a) neither the
Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates has been denied a Governmental
Approval required in connection with any acquisition in any such
jurisdiction; and (b) no license, permit or authorization issued to the
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates by any Governmental Authority in any such
jurisdiction has been suspended, terminated, withdrawn, suspended, revoked or
non-renewed;  
      
    | (i)  |   | the Consideration Shares, Mandatory Convertible
Securities and the Purchaser Preferred Securities to be allotted and issued
to the Seller at Completion will, when so allotted and issued, be free and
clear of any and all Encumbrances;  
      
    | (j)  |   | the Consideration Shares, Mandatory Convertible
Securities and the Purchaser Preferred Securities will, on Completion, be
duly and validly authorised and issued in accordance with the provisions of
the Companies Act, not subject to any call for the payment of further
capital, credited as fully paid and (save as set out in clause 16 of this
agreement) free of all pre-emptive rights or other rights or restrictions
on transfer or otherwise; and  
      
    | (k)  |   | the Consideration Shares shall, when issued at
Completion, rank pari passu with the ordinary in the capital of the
Purchaser, including the right to receive all dividends declared made or paid
with a dividend record date which falls after the Completion Date.  
   

  

     6.7  |   | Except for the Purchaser Warranties and the Warranties,
the parties and their respective Representatives:

_Schedule 1 (Warranties)_ by means of the AIA Prospectus, and (ii) in the
case of the warranty contained in the Warranty Letter by means of the

requirements of the Securities Act, including, without limitation, a
requirement that the Parent shall have acted with scienter

      |   | in respect of such breach, and _provided_ , _further_ ,
that the liability of the Parent for breaches of its covenants contained in
_Schedule 2 (Conduct of Business Prior to Completion)_ shall survive
Completion only to the extent such breaches continue following written notice
thereof by the Purchaser and a reasonable time period for cure.

  7.2  |   | With the exceptions of the Purchaser Warranties set out in
_clauses 6.4(a)_ ,  _(b)_ , _(c)_ , _(d)_ , _(i)_ , _(j)_ and _(k)_ , the
Purchaser Warranties and the PurchaserÂ’s and PrudentialÂ’s Pre-Completion

Board Recommendation is clearly and definitively withdrawn or modified or
qualified in any manner adverse to the Parent or the Seller in advance of the
passage of the Resolutions by PrudentialÂ’s shareholders, provided that the
right to terminate pursuant to this clause 7.3(b) shall expire in the event
that (and with effect from) the Resolutions are (being) passed by
PrudentialÂ’s shareholders;

Prudential if Completion has not occurred on or before the date which is 12
months after the Signing Date (as may be extended pursuant to this clause,
the "Long-Stop Date"); _provided_ that, if the sole reason that Completion
has not occurred is that any of the Governmental Approvals required pursuant
to _clause 3.1_ have not been obtained on or prior to such date, or that the
parties have begun taking any action pursuant to clause 4.9 that has not been
completed but is capable of completion, any of the Parent, the Seller, the
Purchaser or Prudential may extend the Long-Stop Date for an additional
90 days beyond the date which is 12 months after the Signing Date. For the
avoidance of doubt, if the Long-Stop Date is so extended, it shall not be

occurred:

_clause 3.1(f)_ not to be satisfied, only insofar as it is reasonably likely
that such breach will not be cured by the earlier of the Long-Stop Date and
the date falling 3 months after the date of such breach; or

    | (ii)  |   | except to the extent that (without giving effect to
any limitations as to materiality or Material Adverse Change set forth
therein) the failure or failures of the relevant Warranties to be true and
correct when given in accordance with clause 6.1, individually or in the
aggregate, has not had or would not reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Change, and only insofar as it is reasonably likely that such breach
will not be cured by the earlier of the Long Stop Date and the date falling 3
months after the date of such breach;  
   

  

       | (f)  |   | by the Purchaser, if a breach of the ParentÂ’s
covenants under _clause 8.1_ shall have occurred that would cause the
condition set forth in _clause 3.1(h)_ not to be satisfied, only insofar as
it is reasonably likely that such breach will not be cured by the earlier of
the Long-Stop Date and the date falling 3 months after the date of such
breach;

state of facts, circumstance, change, development, effect, event or
occurrence which would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Change, occurs between the Signing Date and the Admission Date; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Purchaser may not terminate this agreement pursuant to
this _clause 7.3(h)_ at any time following the Admission Date;  
   

  ##### 

  

   

       | (i)  |   | by the Parent or the Seller, if Completion shall
not have occurred within five Business Days following the date on which the
last of the Conditions has been satisfied or (if applicable) waived, or, with
respect to those Conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at
Completion including the Conditions at _clause 3.1(d)(iii) and (iv)_ , are
capable of being satisfied at Completion, provided that at the time of such
termination, the Parent and the Seller are prepared to proceed with
Completion, including being prepared materially to comply with their
respective obligations under _Schedule 3 (Completion Arrangements)_; or  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (j)  |   | by the Purchaser, if Completion shall not have occurred

     7.4  |   | Any party desiring to terminate this agreement pursuant
to _clause 7.3_ shall give written notice of such termination to the other
parties (except that the Parent does not need to give such notice to the
Seller nor the Purchaser to Prudential and, in each case, vice versa).  
---|---|--- 
      
  7.5  |   | In the event of the termination of this agreement pursuant to
_clause 7.3_ , this agreement shall terminate forthwith save that such
termination shall be without prejudice to any accrued rights, obligations and
liabilities of the parties as at the date of termination and without
prejudice to any partiesÂ’ liability under this _clause 7._ The provisions set
out in _clauses 22, 27, 28, 31, 32, 33, 34, 36 and 37_ of this agreement
shall survive termination.  
      
  7.6  |   | For the avoidance of doubt, and not in limitation of any
other remedy or claim for damages to which any party hereto may be entitled
in the event of any termination of this agreement, (i) in the event that this
agreement is terminated pursuant to _clause 7.3(i)_ as a result of a breach
by the Purchaser of its obligation to proceed with Completion, Prudential
shall be liable to the Parent and the Seller for any Losses resulting from
such termination of this agreement, and (ii) in the event that this agreement
is terminated pursuant to _clause 7.3(j)_ as a result of a breach by the
Parent or the Seller of their respective obligations to proceed with
Completion, the Parent shall be liable to the Purchaser for any
Losses resulting from such termination of this agreement.  
   

  ##### 

  

   

     7.7  |   | Prudential agrees to pay to the Seller a fee equal to
Â£152,569,000 (the "Termination Fee") in the event that: (x) this agreement is
terminated pursuant to clause 7.3(c) as a result of either the failure of the
Conditions contained in clause 3.1(a) or in the event that the Rights Issue
is not completed by the Long-Stop Date, (y) this agreement is terminated
pursuant to _clause 7.3(b) or 7.3(d)_ , or (z) in the event that this
agreement is terminated on or after the Long-Stop Date, and at the time of
such termination, the Parent and the Seller had the right to terminate this
agreement pursuant to _clause 7.3(b) or 7.3(d)_ , in each case, subject to
_clause 7.11_ ; and _provided_ that no Termination Fee will be payable if, at
the time this agreement is terminated, the Purchaser had the right to
terminate this agreement pursuant to _clause 7.3(e)_ or _7.3(f)_.  
---|---|--- 
      
  7.8  |   | If Prudential fails to promptly pay the Termination Fee when
due, interest shall accrue on such amount from the date such payment was
required to be paid pursuant to the terms of this agreement until the date of
payment at the Interest Rate. If, in order to obtain such payment, the Parent
and/or the Seller commences a suit that results in judgment for such
party for such amount, the Purchaser shall pay the Parent and/or the Seller
(as applicable) its (or their) reasonable costs and expenses (including
reasonable attorneysÂ’ fees and expenses) incurred in connection with such
suit.  
      
  7.9  |   | Each of the parties hereto further acknowledges and agrees
that the payment of the Termination Fee is not a penalty, and Prudential
waives any right it may otherwise have to challenge the payment of the
Termination Fee or as a penalty or as unenforceable in any way.  
      
  7.10  |   | The Purchaser and Prudential on the one hand and the Seller
and the Parent on the other acknowledge and agree that the agreements
contained in this _clause 7_ are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this agreement and that, without these agreements, the other
parties would not enter into this agreement.  
      
  7.11  |   | The Termination Fee is payable as follows:  
   

  

       | (a)  |   | Save as provided in _clause 7.11(f)_ , an amount
equal to the Termination Fee LESS an amount equal to the amount of VAT that
Prudential or the representative member of the same group of companies for
VAT purposes as Prudential (the "Representative Member") would have to
account for to HMRC in respect of a standard rated taxable supply by it for
which the full amount of the Termination Fee were the consideration (the
amount so deducted from the Termination Fee being the "Subtracted Amount")
shall be payable within ten Business Days of the applicable termination event
referred to in _clause 7.3_.  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  ##### 

  

   

       | (b)  |   | As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Termination Fee has become payable under _clause 7.7_ above, Prudential
shall, if no prior request has been made pursuant to _clause 7.11(f)_ , apply
to HMRC for a ruling in accordance with then current HMRC practice that
neither it nor the Representative Member is required to account for any VAT
in respect of the Termination Fee (whether as a result of section 8 of the
Value Added Tax Act 1994 or otherwise). If HMRC rules that neither Prudential
nor the Representative Member is required to account for any VAT in
respect of the Termination Fee, Prudential shall within ten Business Days of
the receipt by it of the ruling pay to the Seller an amount equal to the
Subtracted Amount.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (c)  |   | If HMRC rules that Prudential or the Representative
Member is required to account for any VAT in respect of the Termination Fee,
Prudential shall give written notice to the Seller of such ruling as soon as
reasonably practicable after becoming aware of such ruling and the Seller
may, within ten Business Days of being so notified, give written notice to
Prudential that it requires Prudential to obtain a review by HMRC of that
ruling, in which case Prudential shall, as soon as reasonably practicable,
request HMRC to undertake such a review. Upon PrudentialÂ’s being advised by
HMRC of its decision arising out of the review, Prudential shall
provide written notice to the Seller as soon as possible of that decision
and, if the Seller disagrees with the decision, the Seller may within ten
Business Days of being so notified give notice to Prudential that it requires
Prudential to appeal that decision to the First Tier Tribunal provided
that:  
   

  

       | (i)  |   | the Seller indemnifies Prudential and the
Representative Member to their reasonable satisfaction against all losses,
costs, damages and expenses, including interest on overdue Tax, which may be
incurred thereby; and  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (ii)  |   | the Seller furnishes Prudential with a written
opinion (obtained at the SellerÂ’s expense) of leading tax counsel of at least
ten yearsÂ’ standing chosen by the Seller from a panel of at least three
such counsel nominated by Prudential that the appeal would, on the balance
of probabilities, be successful.  
   

  

       | (d)  |   | Within 15 Business Days of receipt by it: of the
ruling referred to in  _clause 7.11(c)_ ; or, if the Seller shall have
required a review of the ruling under that _clause 7.11(c)_ , of the receipt
by Prudential of HMRCÂ’s decision; or, if the Seller shall have required an
appeal to be made to the First Tier Tribunal, of the First Tier TribunalÂ’s
decision, Prudential shall pay to the Seller an amount equal to (i) so much
of the   
---|---|---|--- 
  

  ##### 

  

  

      |   |   | VAT for which Prudential or the Representative Member
is in accordance with the ruling of HMRC, the decision of HMRC or, as the
case may be, the decision of the First Tier Tribunal, liable that Prudential
in good faith determines that it or the Representative Member is entitled to
credit for as input tax or (ii) if it is determined on such review, decision
or appeal that neither Prudential nor the Representative Member is required
to account for any VAT in respect of the Termination Fee, the Subtracted
Amount. For the avoidance of doubt, Prudential shall have no liability to the
Seller for any amount by which the aggregate amount payable under _clause
7.11(a)_ above and this _clause 7.11(d)_ is less than the Termination Fee.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (e)  |   | Prudential shall provide the Seller with a draft copy
of any ruling, review or appeal application to be made in relation to the VAT
treatment of the Termination Fee reasonably in advance of its proposed
submission to HMRC or the First Tier Tribunal and shall ensure all reasonable
comments of the Seller are reflected therein. Where there is any
correspondence with HMRC or other documents are prepared in relation to such
correspondence or a ruling or review (or any appeal in respect thereof) or
where any meeting or telephone call is to take place with any representative
or representatives of HMRC in relation to a such ruling, review or appeal,
Prudential shall:  
   

  

       | (i)  |   | as promptly as reasonably practicable send copies
of all such correspondence received and copies of all draft replies and other
such prepared documents to the Seller (in each case to the extent that it
relates or they relate to the Termination Fee) and shall give the Seller
an opportunity to make comments thereon a reasonable time in advance of
their submission to HMRC; and  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (ii)  |   | give reasonable advance notice of any such meeting to
the Seller, it is hereby agreed that the Seller shall be entitled to nominate
a person or persons to attend and participate in such meeting or call.  
   

  

       | (f)  |   | At any time before the Termination Fee becomes
payable under _clause 7.7 _ above, the Seller may by written notice require
that Prudential applies as soon as reasonably practicable to HMRC for a
ruling in accordance with then current HMRC practice that neither it nor the
Representative Member would be required to account for any VAT in respect of
the Termination Fee if it were paid (including under section 8 of the Value
Added Tax Act 1994). If such a request is made, then:  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  ##### 

  

   

     

  

       | (i)  |   | if the Termination Fee becomes payable under
_clause 7.7_ above, and before the due date for payment under
_clause 7.11(a)_ , HMRC rule that neither Prudential nor the Representative
Member would be required to account for VAT in respect of the Termination
Fee, Prudential shall as soon as reasonably practicable give written notice
to the Seller of such ruling and no amount may be subtracted from the
Termination Fee pursuant to _clause 7.11(a)_ (unless Prudential reasonably
believes that the ruling may no longer be binding upon HMRC as a result of a
change of Law, in which case _clause 7.11(b)_ above shall apply as if the
words Â‘, if no prior request has been made pursuant to _clause 7.11(f)_
,Â’ were omitted). If the Termination Fee becomes payable under _clause 7.7_
above and such ruling is received on or after the due date for payment under
_clause 7.11(a)_ above, _clause 7.11(b)_ shall apply as though such ruling
had been obtained pursuant to that clause;  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (ii)  |   | if HMRC rule that Prudential or the Representative
Member would be required to account for any VAT in respect of the Termination
Fee if it were paid, Prudential shall as soon as reasonably practicable give
written notice to the Seller of such ruling and the Seller and Prudential
shall in good faith negotiate to determine whether there is an alternative
transaction which the Seller and Prudential could undertake which would, if a
termination event referred to in _clause 7.3_ occurred, put them in the
same position as they would have been in if the Termination Fee payable in
respect of such termination event could have been paid with no VAT (or a
lower VAT) liability arising in respect of it. If the Seller and Prudential
agree that there is such an alternative transaction and if a termination
event referred to in _clause 7.3_ occurs such that, absent this
_clause 7.11(f)(ii)_ the Termination Fee would have become payable,
the Termination Fee shall not be payable and the Seller and Prudential
shall effect the agreed transaction. If within fifteen Business Days of
the SellerÂ’s being so notified by Prudential no such agreement has been
reached then the remaining provisions of this _clause 7.11_ (excluding 
_7.11(b)_ ) shall apply as appropriate (save that the ten Business Day period
first mentioned in _clause 7.11(c)_ shall be treated as commencing at the end
of such fifteen Business Day period). For the avoidance of doubt, the payment
of the Termination Fee or the Late Completion Adjustment Amount shall not
relieve any party of any liability for fraud or for any breach of any
covenant or obligation in this agreement (including any breach of any
covenant or obligation giving rise to payment of such Termination Fee or Late
Completion Adjustment   
  

  #####

additional or other damages to which they are entitled in a circumstance in
which the Termination Fee or the Late Completion Adjustment Amount is
payable.  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  

     7.12  |   | In the event that Completion occurs after August 31,
2010, the Cash Consideration payable by the Purchaser to the Seller for the
Shares shall be increased by an amount (the "Late Completion Adjustment
Amount") equal to 5/1200ths of the Cash Consideration outstanding per month,
from September 1, 2010 through the Completion Date. The Late Completion
Adjustment Amount shall be without prejudice to any rights and remedies
available to the Seller.

  8.1  |   | Subject to any applicable Laws, during the period from the
date of this agreement until Completion, except:  
   

  

       | (a)  |   | as otherwise contemplated by or necessary to
effect the matters contemplated by the Transaction Agreements;  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | for matters identified in the Disclosure Letter;  
      
    | (c)  |   | as may otherwise be required by applicable Contract
obligations or by applicable Law; or  
      
    | (d)  |   | as the Purchaser otherwise consents in writing in
advance (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed);  
   

  

       |   | the Parent shall use its best endeavours to cause the
Company and the AIA Group Members (i) to conduct their business in the
ordinary course, and (ii) not to take any of the actions listed in _Schedule
2 (Conduct of Business Prior to Completion)_.  
---|---|--- 
      
  8.2  |   | The Seller and the Parent shall use commercially reasonable
endeavours to, and shall use commercially reasonable endeavours to procure
that the AIA Group will, co-operate fully between the date of this agreement
and Completion in order to assist the Purchaser, Prudential and their
Affiliates to communicate with employees, agents and consultants of the AIA
Group and take actions to inform and retain such persons as employees, agents
and   
  

  ##### 

  

  

      |   | consultants, _provided_ that neither the Seller nor the
Parent shall be obliged to do anything that would unreasonably interfere with
any of the businesses or operations of the Parent or any of its Affiliates
(including the Company and the Company Subsidiaries); and  _provided_ ,
_further_ , that, anything to the contrary in this agreement notwithstanding,
nothing herein shall obligate or be construed to obligate the Parent or the
Seller to make, or to cause to be made, any payment to any employee, agent
or consultant of the AIA Group or any other third party in order to comply
with its obligations under this _clause 8.2_.  
---|---|--- 
      
  8.3  |   | Prudential and the Parent shall take the actions set forth in
_clause 8.3_ of the Disclosure Letter.  
      
  9.  |   | Stamp Duty  
      
  9.1  |   | Any Hong Kong stamp duty payable on the sale by the Seller of
the Shares to the Purchaser under this Agreement or on any instrument of
transfer used to complete such sale shall be borne equally by the Seller on
the one hand and the Purchaser on the other. Each of the Seller and the
Purchaser agrees to indemnify, and keep indemnified (on an after Tax
basis), the other against any losses suffered and all liabilities, costs and
expenses incurred by the relevant party which arise out of or in connection
with the relevant party not paying any Hong Kong stamp duty which is due and
payable by either of them in relation to the sale and purchase of the
Shares.  
      
  9.2  |   | Any stamp duty, stamp duty reserve tax and any similar stamp
or documentary Tax ("Stamp Tax") payable on:  
   

  

       | (a)  |   | the issue of the Consideration Shares by the
Purchaser to the Seller under  _clause 2.3(b)_ ;

the Purchaser to the Seller under _clause 2.3(c)_ ; and  
      
    | (c)  |   | the issue of the Purchaser Preferred Securities by the
Purchaser to the Seller under _clause 2.3(d)_ ,  
   

  

       |   | shall be borne by the Purchaser except to the extent that
such Stamp Tax (if payable outside the United Kingdom) would not have been
payable but for the Seller being established in or having some other
connection with the jurisdiction in which such Stamp Tax is payable.

     9.3  |   | For so long as the Seller remains the registered holder

distributions of profits or surplus or other assets declared, paid or made in
respect of them after Completion and all rights arising out of or in
connection with them in trust for the Purchaser and its successors in
title;

    | (ii)  |   | execute all instruments of proxy or other documents
which the Purchaser may reasonably require and which may be necessary or
desirable or convenient to enable the Purchaser or any such successor to
attend and vote at any such meeting.  
   

  

     10.  |   | Undertakings  
---|---|--- 
      
  10.1  |   | The Purchaser shall use its best endeavours to exercise all
of its rights and fulfill all of its obligations under the Commitments in
order to obtain funds to make payment of the Purchase Price, including (i)
using best endeavours to (A) satisfy on a timely basis all terms, covenants
and conditions set forth in the Commitments; (B) to the extent applicable,
enter into definitive agreements with respect thereto, on the terms and
conditions contemplated by the Commitments. The Purchaser will furnish
correct and complete copies of all such definitive agreements to the Parent
and the Seller promptly upon their execution.  
      
  10.2  |   | The Purchaser shall keep the Parent and the Seller fully
informed with respect to all material activity concerning the status of the
Financing contemplated by the Commitments and shall give the Parent and the

party thereto and, to the knowledge of the Parent, as of 25 June 2009, and,
to the knowledge of the Parent without inquiry, as of 1 November 2009, each
other party to such Material Contract in accordance with its terms (subject

       |   | the Insurance Subsidiaries as of 25 June 2009 and, to the

due and payable under Insurance Contracts issued by any of the Insurance
Subsidiaries have been paid in the ordinary course of business and in
accordance with the terms of the Insurance Contracts under which they arose,

  16.4  |   | All reinsurance treaties or agreements to which any
Insurance Subsidiary is a party or under which any Insurance Subsidiary has
any existing rights, obligations or liabilities are in full force and effect,
or run-off in accordance with its terms, subject to such exceptions
that, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Change. None of the Insurance Subsidiaries and any
other party to a reinsurance treaty, binder or other reinsurance agreement,
in each case the annual premium associated therewith is greater than or equal
to $10 million, is in default in any material respect as to any provision
thereof and, except as is not, individually or in the aggregate, would
not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Change, no such
agreement contains any provision providing that the other party thereto may
terminate such agreement by reason of the transactions contemplated by the
Transaction Agreements. None of the Insurance Subsidiaries has received any
written notice to the effect that the financial condition of any other
party to any such agreement is impaired with the result that a default
thereunder may reasonably be anticipated, whether or not such default may be
cured by the operation of any offset clause in such agreement.  
      
  17.  |   | _Producers; Sales Practices_

such Insurance Contract, was duly licensed as required by applicable Law (for
the type of business written, sold, produced or marketed on behalf 

      ##### 

  

    

of the Insurance Subsidiary) except for such failures to be licensed which
have been cured, which have been resolved or settled through agreements with
applicable Governmental Authorities, which are barred by an applicable
statute of limitations or which, individually or in the aggregate, would not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Change; and (ii) no Producer
is in violation of any Law applicable to the writing, sale, production or
marketing of Insurance Contracts for any of the Insurance Subsidiaries,
including (A) all applicable Laws relating to the disclosure of the nature of
insurance products as policies of insurance, (B) all applicable Laws relating
to insurance product projections and illustrations, (C) all applicable
prohibitions on the use of unfair methods of competition and deceptive acts
or practices relating to the advertising, sales and marketing of insurance or
annuities and (D) all applicable disclosure, filing and other requirements
with respect to any variation in premiums or other charges resulting from the
time at which such premiums or charges are paid, except for such violations
which have been cured, which have been resolved or settled through agreements
with applicable Governmental Authorities, which are barred by an applicable
statute of limitations or which, individually or in the aggregate, would not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Change. 

   

     18.  |   | _Affiliates_   
---|---|---

Group, on the one hand, and the Parent or any of its Affiliates (excluding

Date, have been entered into, and contain terms and conditions that have been
negotiated, on an armÂ’s-length basis. 

   

     19.  |   | _Compliance with Laws_   
---|---|--- 
   

 

Each AIA Group Member has all material permits, licenses, franchises,
authorizations, orders and approvals of, and have made all material filings,
applications and registrations with, Governmental Authorities, that are
required in order to permit it to own or lease its properties and assets
and to carry on its business as presently conducted (the "Permits"),
including all material licenses, certificates of authority, permits or other
authorizations that are required to be obtained from any Governmental
Authority in connection with the operation, ownership or transaction of
insurance or reinsurance business. To the knowledge of the Parent, all
Permits are valid and in full force and effect. To the knowledge of the
Parent, no AIA Group Member is in default under or the subject of a
proceeding for suspension or revocation of, and, to the knowledge of the
Parent, no condition exists that with notice or lapse of time or both would
constitute a default under, or basis for suspension or revocation of, any
Permit. To the knowledge of the Parent, each AIA Group Member has complied in
all respects and is not in default or violation of, and no AIA Group Member
is, to the knowledge of the Parent, under investigation with respect to or
has been threatened to be charged with or given notice of any violation of,
any applicable Law, other than such noncompliance, defaults or violations
that would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected
to have a Material Adverse Change. To the 

      ##### 

  

    

knowledge of the Parent, except for statutory or regulatory restrictions of
general application or applicable to insurance companies generally, no
Governmental Authority has placed any material restriction (other than
Permitted Liens) on the business or properties of any AIA Group Member
that would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have
a Material Adverse Change. This _paragraph 19_ shall not apply with respect
to Taxes. 

   

     20.  |   | _Reports_   
---|---|--- 
   

 

To the knowledge of the Parent, since January 1, 2008, each AIA Group Member
has timely filed (subject to any permitted extension) all material reports,
registrations, documents, filings, statements and submissions, together with
any amendments thereto, that it was required to file with any Governmental
Authority (the foregoing, collectively, the "Reports") and has paid all
material fees and assessments due and payable in connection therewith. As of
their respective dates of filing, to the knowledge of the Parent, (i) the
Reports complied in all material respects with all statutes and applicable
rules and regulations of the applicable Governmental Authorities and
(ii) were complete and accurate in all material respects. The statutory
statements of each Insurance Subsidiary have been prepared in all material
respects, to the extent applicable, in accordance with SAP and applicable
Laws, fairly present the statutory financial position of each
Insurance Subsidiary and have not been subject to any assertion of material
deficiency by any Governmental Authority. This _paragraph 20_ shall not apply
with respect to Tax Returns. 

   

     21.  |   | _Litigation and Other Proceedings_   
---|---|--- 
   

 

There are no legal proceedings pending or, to the knowledge of the Parent,
threatened in writing against any member of the AIA Group or to which any of
their respective assets are subject which would reasonably be expected to
result in Losses in excess of $10 million or any permanent injunction or
other form of equitable relief which would have a material adverse effect on
any material business operations of any member of the AIA Group in any
Material Jurisdiction. No member of the AIA Group is subject to any material
Order in a Material Jurisdiction and, to the knowledge of the Parent, in any
jurisdiction (other than a Material Jurisdiction).

equivalent in the applicable jurisdiction) to all real properties with a
minimum estimated fair market value of at least $50 million that are owned by
them, in each case free from liens, encumbrances, claims and defects (other
than Permitted Liens) that would affect the value thereof or interfere with

Bloomberg page GBP Crncy HP on the relevant Trading Day) on each of the five
consecutive Trading Days beginning on the third Trading Day immediately
following the giving of notice by the Issuer to Holders that any scheduled
payment of a Fixed Coupon Amount will not be made. Such an adjustment shall
only become effective if no other Parity Security or Junior Security is
subject to a dividend and capital restriction similar to the one described in
"Dividend and Capital Restriction" below (the date on which the circumstances
giving rise to such restriction as described in "Dividend and Capital
Restriction" below ceasing to exist or continue being the "Effective
Date").

  |   | In case of a voluntary or mandatory conversion of a Note before the
Effective Date, the Holder of such Note shall be entitled to the number of
additional Shares which the Holder would have been entitled to if such
adjustment had become effective before the relevant voluntary or mandatory
conversion date (the "Fixed Coupon Deferred Shares"). The Issuer shall issue
such additional shares on the latter to occur of: (a) 5 Trading Days after
the Effective Date; and (b) the date of such mandatory or
voluntary conversion. The Anti-dilution provisions (described below) shall
apply to such an Additional Share Entitlement Certificate _mutatis
mutandis_.

  |   |   
  

  

  |   |

such date, or any Fixed Amount Coupon payment date on which the Solvency
Condition is not met, the Issuer shall not (1) declare or pay a dividend or
distribution or make any other payment on any Parity or Junior Securities
(other than a dividend on the Shares declared prior to that date), or (2)
redeem, purchase, or otherwise acquire any Parity or Junior Securities until
the Effective Date.  
  



  |   |   
  

  

  |   | "Junior Securities" means the Shares and any other securities

  |   |   
  

Maximum Conversion Price: 

  |   | 125% of the Reference Share Price  
  



  |   |   
  

Reference Share Price: 

  |   | The Reference Share Price shall be the sterling value of the
Consideration Shares Value (being Â£3.613 billion), converted into USD at the
spot rate of USD 1.5224 / Â£1 (as the agreed prevailing exchange rate on
Friday 26th February 2010) divided by the Consideration Shares (each as
defined in the Share Purchase Agreement).  
  



  |   |   
  

Mandatory Conversion on the Mandatory Conversion Date: 

  |   | The Notes will only be convertible into Shares and will not be
redeemable in cash.  
  



  |   |   
  

  

  |   | Each Note not converted before the 25th Trading Day prior to the
Mandatory Conversion Date will be mandatorily converted on the Mandatory
Conversion Date into a number of Shares per Note equal to the Mandatory
Conversion Ratio. The Mandatory Conversion Ratio equals the arithmetic
average of the 20 Conversion Ratios (calculated to five decimal places)
calculated on the basis of the Volume Weighted Average Share Price (the
"VWAP") of the Shares on the London Stock Exchange (converted, if
necessary, into USD at the spot rate published at 11am (London time) on the
Bloomberg page GBP Crncy HP on the relevant Trading Day) (each a "Share
Price") on each of the 20 consecutive Trading Days ending on the third
Trading Day prior to the Mandatory Conversion Date. For the purposes of
calculating such arithmetic average, the Conversion Ratio for a given Trading
Day is determined as follows:  
  



  |   |   
  

  

  |   |

(i) if the Share Price is less than or equal to the Minimum Conversion Price
of USD [Â•], the Conversion Ratio shall be equal to the Maximum Conversion
Ratio of initially [Â•] (such figure to be determined by dividing USD 100,000
by

  |   |   
  

  

  |   |

(ii) if the Share Price is greater than or equal to the Maximum Conversion
Price of USD [Â•], the Conversion Ratio shall be equal to the Minimum
Conversion Ratio of initially [Â•] (such figure to be determined by dividing
USD 100,000 by the Maximum Conversion Price) Shares per Note; and

  
  



  |   |   
  

  

  |   |

(iii) if the Share Price is greater than the Minimum Conversion Price but
less than the Maximum Conversion Price, the Conversion Ratio shall be equal
to USD 100,000 divided by the Share Price.

  
  



  |   |   
  

Voluntary Conversion Right of Holders of Notes: 

  |   | Each Note may be converted into Shares at any time between such
date falling 41 days after the Closing Date and the 26th Trading Day prior to
the Mandatory Conversion Date (both days inclusive) at the election of each
Holder. Upon such conversion, each Holder making such election shall receive
the applicable Minimum Conversion Ratio for each Note converted.  
  



  |   |   
  

  

  |   | Each Note will cease to bear interest on the Fixed Coupon Payment
Date prior to the date of the exercise of the voluntary conversion option
with respect to such Note by the Holder thereof.  
  



  |   |   
  

Voluntary Conversion Right of Holders of Notes in case of a Change of Control
of the Issuer: 

  |   | In the case of a Change of Control of the Issuer (as defined in the
Terms and Conditions in line with UK convertible market practice), a Holder
may convert its Notes into Shares at the Maximum Conversion Ratio for a
period of 60 days after the occurrence of the Change of Control (the "Change
of Control Conversion Period").  
  



  |   |   
  

  

  |   | In addition, each Holder who converts its Notes into Shares during
the Change of Control Conversion Period shall be entitled to an additional
number of Shares which shall be calculated by dividing the Make-whole Coupon
Amount by the arithmetic average of the Volume Weighted Average Share Price
(the "VWAP") of the Shares on the London Stock Exchange (converted, if
necessary, into USD at the spot rate published at 11am (London time) on the
Bloomberg page GBP Crncy HP on the relevant Trading Day) on each of the three
consecutive Trading Days including and ending on the Trading Day immediately
prior to the date on which the voluntary conversion notice by the Holder
is validly submitted to the Issuer.  
  



  |   |   
  

  

  |   | The "Make-whole Coupon Amount" is the sum of all remaining Fixed
Coupon Amounts scheduled to be paid up to and including the Mandatory
Conversion Date.  
  



  |   |   
  

Early Conversion Right of the Issuer: 

  |   | The Notes may be converted into Shares, in whole but not in part,
at any time on or such date falling 41 days after the Closing Date and the
26th Trading Date prior to the Mandatory Conversion Date (both days
inclusive) at the option of the Issuer by giving not less than 20 and not
more than 40 Trading DaysÂ’ advance notice to the Trading Day selected for
early conversion (the "Early Conversion Date"). Upon such Early Conversion,
Holders shall receive per Note the number of Shares calculated at the Maximum
Conversion Ratio.  
  



  |   |   
  

  

  |   | In addition, each Holder shall be entitled to an additional number
of Shares per Note which shall be calculated by dividing the Make-whole
Coupon Amount by the arithmetic average of the Volume Weighted Average Share
Price (the "VWAP") of the Shares on the London Stock Exchange (converted, if
necessary, into USD at the spot rate published at 11am (London time) on the
Bloomberg page GBP Crncy HP on the relevant Trading Day) on each of the five
consecutive Trading Days including and ending on the third Trading Day prior
to the Early Conversion Date.  
  



  |   |   
  

  

  |   | This option can only be exercised if the Shares to be delivered
thereupon shall have the same entitlements (including dividends) as the other
outstanding Shares.  
  



  |   |   
  

Events of Default provisions: 

  |   | Limited to non-payment of amounts due and winding-up of the
Issuer.  
  



  |   |   
  

  

  |   | Upon declaration of an Event of Default by the Trustee or the
Holders of the Notes, the Notes may be converted at the election of each
Holder into Shares as described under "Mandatory Conversion on the Mandatory
Conversion Date".

consolidations, share splits, share distributions, spin-off events, bonus
issues, rights issues, and reorganizations by adjustment of the Minimum and
Maximum Conversion Price and Minimum and Maximum Conversion Ratio, subject to
customary exclusions for employee and executive incentive, option schemes and
issues under dividend reinvestment plans. The anti-dilution adjustment shall
factor in any adjustment required to the number of Fixed Coupon Deferred
Shares to be issued after the relevant Effective Date as described
under "Coupon Limitations". For the avoidance of doubt, even after an anti-
dilution adjustment the restriction on the Effective Date of any adjustment
described in "Coupon Limitations" shall remain valid and in force.

Holders to receive Shares will convert to a claim of the Holders to
participate in the liquidation proceeds of the Issuer. Holders of Notes shall
be entitled to participate in the liquidation proceeds of the Issuer with a
claim per Note that equals the number of Shares, which shall be calculated by
applying the provisions described under "Mandatory Conversion on the
Mandatory Conversion Date" _mutatis mutandis_.

  |   | Interest which the Issuer elects to defer and interest the Issuer
does not pay because the Solvency Condition is not satisfied constitutes
"Deferred Interest".

  |   |

(ii) the commencement of the winding-up of the Issuer.

  |   | If (1) the Issuer does not have sufficient authorised ordinary
share capital, necessary authorisations in place or for any other reason it
is unable to issue a sufficient number of Ordinary Shares to make payment of
Deferred Interest in full on any redemption date; or (2) as a result of the
Issuer is not being able to raise sufficient funds through the alternative
coupon satisfaction mechanism (the "ACSM") to pay all Deferred Interest on a
redemption date, the Issuer is required to postpone such redemption date,
the Notes will (in each case) continue to accrue and pay interest at the
applicable rate stated above.  
  



  |   |   
  

  

  |   | Except in the case of the winding-up of the Issuer,
Deferred Interest may only be satisfied in accordance with the ACSM.  
  



  |   |   
  

  

  |   | Deferred Interest will itself accrue interest at the
then applicable interest rate in the same limited circumstances as apply to
the IssuerÂ’s

or scheme of arrangement occurring in relation to the Issuer or the Guarantor
as provided for in the IssuerÂ’s USD 750,000,000 Tier 1 Notes issued in July
2009.  
  



  |   |   
  

Optional Early Redemption: 

  |   | In whole, but not in part, at the option of the Issuer, on the
First Call Date, and on any Interest Payment Date thereafter at a redemption
price of Par plus unpaid accrued and Deferred Interest, subject to the Issuer
giving prior notice to the FSA and receiving no objection from the FSA and
to the Issuer being in compliance with its capital requirements (the
"Redemption or Conversion Conditions") and the Solvency Condition.  
  



  |   |   
  

Tax Call Event, Tax Event: 

  |   | A Tax Call Event shall occur should (1) the Issuer be required to
pay additional amounts in making any payments of interest or Deferred
Interest; or (2) payments of interest or deferred interest be treated as
distributions or the Issuer is not entitled to obtain a deduction in
computing its UK tax liabilities either (i) following the giving of notice
by the Issuer to the FSA that it intends to convert the Notes into another
series of listed, undated cumulative subordinated notes having the same
material terms as the Notes, including not materially less favorable to
an investor than the current terms and the FSA objecting to such proposal or
(ii) the Issuer (acting reasonably) determining that those circumstances
apply or would apply to such other series of undated cumulative subordinated
notes.  
  



  |   |   
  

  

  |   | A Tax Event shall occur should (1) the Issuer be required to pay
additional amounts in making any payments of interest or Deferred Interest;
(2) payments of interest or deferred interest be treated as distributions; or
(3) the Issuer is not entitled to obtain a deduction in computing its UK
tax liabilities.  
  



  |   |   
  

  

  |   | Upon the occurrence of a Tax Call Event arising (i) prior to the
First Call Date as a result of a change in Tax Law (subject to receiving a
waiver from the FSA) or (ii) after the First Call Date, the Issuer may,
subject to the Redemption or Conversion Conditions, redeem the Notes at
Par plus unpaid accrued and Deferred Interest. Upon a Tax Event the Issuer
may, at its sole discretion but subject to the Redemption or Conversion
Conditions, convert the Notes in whole into another series of undated
cumulative subordinated notes having the same material terms as the Notes,
including not materially less favorable to an investor than the current
terms, which notes shall be listed on the Regulated Market of the London
Stock Exchange.

  |   | If a Tax Event arises due to the circumstances described in (2) of
the Tax Call Event (as described above) and the Issuer gives notice to the
FSA that it intends to convert the Notes into another series of undated
cumulative subordinated notes and the FSA objects to such proposal, the Tax
Event will become a Tax Call Event.  
  



  |   |   
  

Regulatory Event Redemption: 

  |   | The Issuer may redeem the Notes at any time, in whole but not in
part, should the Notes not longer be eligible to meet the minimum capital or
solvency requirement of the Issuer or Group, or the Tier 1 capital
requirement of the Issuer or Group, should the Issuer or Group be subject to
a minimum Tier 1 Capital requirement  
  



  |   |   
  

  

  |   | Any redemption prior to the First Call Date pursuant to
the Regulatory Event Redemption may only be exercised by the Issuer as a
result of any change in the capital regulations (or any change in the
application or official interpretation thereof) and shall be subject to
receiving a waiver from the FSA and to the Redemption or Conversion
Conditions and shall be at the Make Whole Redemption Amount.  
  



  |   |   
  

  

  |   | Any redemption after the First Call Date pursuant to

Conversion Conditions and shall be at the Par plus unpaid accrued and
Deferred Interest.  
  



  |   |   
  

Make Whole Redemption Amount: 

  |   | The Make Whole Redemption Amount shall be the sum of the present
value of the Nominal Amount and the present value of each remaining scheduled
quarterly interest payment to be due in full to and including the First Call
Date discounted on a quarterly basis at a rate equal to the yield on
a comparable maturity US Treasury plus 538.3 bps.  
  



  |   |   
  

Set-off: 

  |   | By acceptance of the Notes, each Holder will be deemed to have
waived any right of set-off or counterclaim that such Holder might otherwise
have against the Issuer whether prior to or in bankruptcy or winding-up.  
  



  |   |   
  

Modification: 

  |   | The Trustee may agree to any modification or waiver should the

  |   | The Issuer may at any time, and must at the request of holders
representing 5% or more of the Notes, convene a meeting to consider any
matter affecting their interests, including the passing of an Extraordinary
Resolution, modifying any of the terms or the Notes, or waiving
any requirement associated with the Notes.  
  



  |   |   
  

  

  |   | The quorum at any such meeting for passing an
Extraordinary Resolution shall be one or more holders representing 50%
or more of the Notes by nominal value then outstanding, save for
