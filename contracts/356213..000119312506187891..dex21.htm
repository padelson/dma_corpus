following procedures by the Auditor shall only be applicable if Buyer and ACE
Hi mutually agree on the selection of an Auditor. The Auditor shall determine
as promptly as practicable whether the Final ACE Closing Schedule was

and to what extent (if any) the Closing ACE Purchase Price requires
adjustment. The Auditor may retain an actuarial firm or other professionals as
it may reasonably determine to be necessary or appropriate in discharging its
duties under this Section 2.7(c). The parties and the Auditor shall agree on
reasonable procedures for determining the disputed line items; _provided_ ,
_that_ , such procedures shall include the following (collectively, the "
_Audit Procedures_ "): (i) each of Buyer and ACE Hi shall have the right to
make one (1) written submission to the Auditor regarding the disputed line
items submitted to the Auditor, (ii) each party shall have the right to make

Buyer and ACE Hi its determination in writing, which determination shall be
made subject to the definitions and principles set forth in this Agreement and
shall select either the position of ACE Hi or Buyer, and no compromise
position, with respect to each of the disputed line items submitted to the
Auditor. The fees and expenses of the Auditor shall be paid one-half by Buyer
and one-half by ACE Hi. The determination of the Auditor shall be final,
binding and conclusive for purposes of this Section 2.7(c) and enforceable as
an arbitration award, and shall



 

\- 15 - represent the exclusive remedy with respect to the determination of the
Closing ACE Purchase Price. The date on which Closing ACE Purchase Price is
finally determined in accordance with this Section 2.7 is hereinafter referred
to as the " _ACE Determination Date_."

(which may be a positive or negative number) equal to

(i) the Closing ACE Purchase Price, _minus_

(ii) the ACE Closing Payment, _minus_

delivery of written instructions to the Escrow Agent to release from the ACE

Section 2.8 _Final AREH Purchase Price Adjustment_.

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable following the Closing Date, but in no
event more than sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall cause to
be prepared and delivered to AREH a statement (the " _Final AREH Closing
Schedule_ ") setting forth Buyers determination of (i) the AREH Subs
Prorations, (ii) a calculation of the AREH Purchase Price and (iii) the AREH
Purchase Price Adjustment (as defined below), if any, based on the Final AREH
Closing Schedule and the provisions of this Section 2.8 and set forth in
reasonable detail. The Final AREH Closing Schedule (and each component
thereof) shall be accompanied by reasonably sufficient back-up or supporting
data used in the preparation of the Final AREH Closing Schedule as is
sufficient to reflect how Buyer made such determinations and calculations.
Buyer and AREH each shall bear its own expenses in the preparation and review
of the Final AREH Closing Schedule.

(b) If AREH shall disagree with the calculation of the AREH Purchase Price or
any element of the Final AREH Closing Schedule relevant thereto, it shall,
within thirty (30) business days after its receipt of the Final AREH Closing
Schedule, notify Buyer of such disagreement in writing, setting forth in
detail the particulars of such disagreement. In connection therewith and
subject to applicable Law, Buyer will provide AREH reasonable access to any of
the respective AREH Subs books and records to the extent reasonably related
to AREHs review of the Final



 

\- 16 - AREH Closing Schedule and the calculation of AREH Purchase Price. In the event
that AREH does not provide such notice of disagreement within such thirty
(30) business day period, AREH shall be deemed to have accepted the Final AREH
Closing Schedule and the calculation of AREH Purchase Price delivered by
Buyer, which shall be final, binding and conclusive for purposes of this
Section 2.8(b) with respect to the determination of the AREH Purchase Price.
In the event any such notice of disagreement is timely provided, Buyer and
AREH, in conjunction with their respective independent accounting
firms, shall use commercially reasonable efforts for a period of ten (10)
business days (or such longer period as they may mutually agree) to resolve
any disagreements with respect to the calculation of the AREH Purchase Price.
If, at the end of such period, they are unable to resolve such disagreements,
then the Auditor shall resolve any remaining disagreements provided, that if
Buyer and AREH cannot mutually agree on an Auditor, any remaining
disagreements shall be resolved by a court of competent jurisdiction in
accordance with Section 13.2 hereof. For the avoidance of doubt, the following
procedures by the Auditor shall only be applicable if Buyer and AREH mutually
agree on the selection of an Auditor. The parties and the Auditor shall agree
on reasonable procedures for determining the disputed line items; _provided_ ,
_that_ , that such procedures shall include the Audit Procedures. The Auditor
shall determine as promptly as practicable whether the Final AREH Closing
Schedule was prepared in accordance with the standards set forth in this
Agreement and, only with respect to the disputed line items submitted to the
Auditor, whether and to what extent (if any) the AREH Purchase Price
requires adjustment. The Auditor shall promptly deliver to Buyer and AREH its
determination in writing, which determination shall be made subject to the
definitions and principles set forth in this Agreement and shall select either
the position of AREH or Buyer, and no compromise position, with respect to
each of the disputed line items submitted to the Auditor. The fees and
expenses of the Auditor shall be paid one-half by Buyer and one-half by AREH.
The determination of the Auditor shall be final, binding and conclusive for
purposes of this Section 2.8(b) and enforceable as an arbitration award, and
shall represent the exclusive remedy with respect to the determination of the
AREH Purchase Price. The date on which AREH Purchase Price is finally
determined in accordance with this Section 2.8 is hereinafter referred to as
the " _AREH Determination Date_."

(c) Within ten (10) business days of the AREH Determination Date, the amount
(which may be a positive or negative number) equal to

(i) the AREH Purchase Price, _minus_

(ii) the AREH Closing Payment

(the " _AREH Purchase Price Adjustment_ ") shall be paid (A) from AREH to
Buyer (if the AREH Purchase Price Adjustment is a negative amount) by Buyers
delivery of written instructions to the Escrow Agent to release from the AREH
Closing Payment Escrow and pay to Buyer all or a portion of the funds in the
AREH Closing Payment Escrow, if any, up to the amount of the AREH Purchase
Price Adjustment (together with any interest earned on such payment), and any
remainder in cash by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account designated by Buyer by written notice to AREH given within two (2)
days of the AREH Determination Date or (B) from Buyer to AREH (if the AREH
Purchase Price Adjustment is a positive amount), in cash by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated by AREH by written notice
to Buyer given within two (2) days of the AREH Determination Date. Any funds



 

\- 17 - remaining in the AREH Closing Payment Escrow following the payment of the AREH
Purchase Price Adjustment pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be
promptly released from escrow and paid by the Escrow Agent to AREH as
authorized by written instructions delivered to the Escrow Agent by AREH.

\- 46 - ARTICLE IX

COVENANTS

Section 9.1 _Casino Shutdown; WARN Act Notice_.

(a) Within three (3) business days following the execution of this Agreement,
ACE Hi shall cause ACE Lo to give the notice required under the WARN Act (the
" _WARN Act Notice_ ") to employees of ACE Lo (the " _Casino Employees_ ")
(such date, the " _WARN Act Notice Date_ "). To the extent that it may do so
in compliance with applicable law and subject to any contrary order or
directive from the Gaming Authorities, ACE Hi shall cause ACE Lo to continue
to operate the Casino Business through the required notice period under the
WARN Act in accordance with Section 9.1(b) and Section 9.2(a) hereof. Whether
or not ACE Lo is permitted to continue to operate a gaming business, it shall
continue to employ and compensate its employees that have not resigned or been
terminated in accordance with past practice during the required notice period
under the WARN Act.

(b) Prior to the Closing, ACE Hi shall cause ACE Lo to surrender to the New
Jersey Casino Control Commission its certificate of operation for the Casino
Business in the State of New Jersey (the " _Casino Shutdown_ "). In addition,
ACE Hi shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause ACE Lo to comply
with a Casino Shutdown plan set forth in Section 9.1(b) of the ACE Disclosure
Letter (the " _Casino Shutdown Plan_ ").

(c) The parties hereby acknowledge and agree that prior the Casino Shutdown,
the operations of ACE Lo may deteriorate and such deterioration, by itself,
will not constitute a breach of any representation, warranty or covenant or
condition to Buyers obligation to close or constitute grounds for a
termination of this Agreement or the Purchase. Subject to Section 9.2(a)(i)(B)
through (N) and (x)(ii) hereof, Buyer hereby acknowledges and agrees that: (i)
ACE Lo and the Casino Business may not be able to operate in a manner that is
in the ordinary course of business or that is consistent with past practice,
and its failure to operate in the ordinary course of business or consistent
with past practice shall not, by itself, constitute a breach of
any representation, warranty or covenant or condition to Buyers obligation
to close or constitute grounds for a termination of this Agreement or the
Purchase, and (ii) if employees in certain key positions resign, ACE Lo may be
required to cease all gaming operations.

(d) Buyer shall be responsible for funding any cash shortfalls, including for
any Taxes imposed on ACE Lo, of ACE Lo due to losses of the Casino Business
after the Measurement Date and prior to Closing; _provided_ _that_ , at the
time of any such funding by Buyer, ACE Lo shall be in material compliance with
all of the covenants contained in Section 9.2(a) hereof. Not less than five
(5) business days prior to the date on which ACE Hi reasonably projects that
ACE Lo will suffer a cash shortfall, ACE Hi shall deliver written notice to
Buyer of such projected cash shortfall and the amount of such cash shortfall,
accompanied by reasonably sufficient back-up or supporting data used in the
calculation of such projected cash shortfall as is sufficient to reflect how
ACE Hi made such determination. Within two (2) business days following
Buyers receipt of such written notice, Buyer and ACE Hi shall deliver joint
written instructions to the Escrow Agent to deduct from the Deposit, release
from escrow and pay to ACE Lo cash in an amount sufficient to cover
such projected shortfall pursuant to the Deposit Escrow Agreement and this
Section 9.1(d) and (ii) ACE Lo shall issue a promissory note in favor



 

\- 47 - of Buyer substantially in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit J_ (an " _ACE
Lo Promissory Note_ ") in an amount equal to the withdrawal from the Deposit
described in preceding subclause (i). Each ACE Lo Promissory Note shall
provide, among other things, that the cash payments by Buyer contemplated by
this Section 9.1(d) shall be repaid by ACE Lo to Buyer only in the event this
Agreement is terminated (A) by either Buyer or Sellers, pursuant to Section
11.1(b) (unless Buyers failure to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement
has been the primary cause of, or materially contributed to, the failure of
the Closing to occur on or before the Outside Date) or Section 11.1(c) (unless
Buyer shall not have used its commercially reasonable efforts to prevent the
entry of and to remove the applicable Restraint or if Buyers failure to
fulfill any obligation under this Agreement has been the primary cause of, or
materially contributed to, the action resulting in such Restraint), (B) by
Buyer, pursuant to Section 11.1(d) or Section 11.1(h), or (C) by ACE Hi, with
respect to the ACE Lo Purchase, pursuant to Section 11.1(g). The ACE Lo
Promissory Note shall not be payable under any other circumstances. In the
event that the Deposit shall decrease to an amount less than Forty Million
Dollars ($40,000,000) as a result of the payments described in the preceding
sentence, Buyer shall, within five (5) business days after such shortfall,
promptly deposit into the Deposit Escrow cash in an amount equal to such
shortfall in order to cause the Deposit to be equal to Fifty Million Dollars
($50,000,000). For purposes of clarity, Buyer and ACE Hi hereby acknowledge
and agree that any adjustment in size of the Deposit pursuant to this Section
9.1(d) will result in a larger or smaller ACE Closing Payment. In no event
will any ACE Lo Promissory Note be treated as a liability to reduce any
payment to the Selling Parties under Article II hereof.

(e) Prior to the Closing, Buyer and ACE Hi shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to resolve with the New Jersey Casino Control Commission
the appropriate amounts, if any, of Progressive Gaming Liabilities,
Outstanding Chip and Ticket-In/Ticket-Out Liabilities and unclaimed jackpot
liabilities for which ACE Lo shall remain liable after the Casino Shutdown,
including without limitation amounts to be paid into escrow, withheld and/or
carried over to another meter when the casino reopens. Buyer shall and shall
cause ACE Lo following the Closing to promptly pay to ACE Hi (i) any Escrow
Gaming Amounts permitted to be released from any such escrow by the New
Jersey Casino Control Commission and (ii) one-half ( 1/2) of any amounts
(less a present value discount) permitted to be carried over to another meter
when the casino reopens by the New Jersey Casino Control Commission or any
other Governmental Entity, in each case in cash by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated by ACE Hi to Buyer.

this Agreement or the Closing, Buyer and the Selling Parties shall confer on
a regular basis with one or more Representatives of each other party to report
on the general status of ongoing operations of the Properties. Buyer and the
Selling Parties shall promptly notify each other in writing of, and will use
commercially reasonable efforts to cure before the Closing Date, any event,

such party, that (a) causes or will cause any covenant or agreement of Buyer

respect, (b) renders or will render untrue in any material respect any
representation or warranty of the respective parties contained in this
Agreement or (c) of any fact, circumstance, event or action which will result
in, or would reasonably be expected to result in, the failure of such party to
timely satisfy any of the closing conditions specified in ARTICLE X hereof of
this Agreement, as applicable. Nothing contained in Section 9.2 hereof shall
prevent the Selling Parties from giving such notice, using such efforts or
taking any action to cure or curing any such event, transaction or

Section 9.4 _No Solicitation_.

(a) None of the ACE Selling Parties shall, nor shall they authorize, knowingly
permit or cause any of their respective Affiliates or their or their
respective Affiliates directors, officers, managers, employees or members,
or any investment banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other
representative retained by any of them to, directly or indirectly, after the
date hereof, (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage (including by way
of furnishing non-public information), or knowingly take any other action
designed to facilitate, any inquiries or the making of any proposal that
constitutes a Takeover Proposal (as defined below) or (ii) participate in any
negotiations or discussions (other than to state that they are not permitted
to have discussions) regarding any Takeover Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that if, at any time prior to October 18, 2006 (the " _Alternative
Proposal Period_ "), the Board of Directors of ACE Hi determines in good
faith, after consultation with its Affiliates and advisors, that a Takeover
Proposal that was not solicited by it after the date hereof and did not
otherwise result from a breach of this Section 9.4(a) is, or is reasonably
likely to result in, a Superior Proposal (as defined in Section 9.4(d)(ii)),
and subject to providing prior written notice of its decision to take such
action to Buyer and compliance with Section 9.4(c), ACE Hi and its
Affiliates, and their respective directors, executive officers, controlling
persons, employees and advisors may (x) furnish information with respect to
ACE Lo, ACE Hi and their respective Affiliates (including without limitation
any Selling Party) to the Person making such proposal (and its
Representatives) pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement (provided,
that such confidentiality agreement shall not in any way restrict ACE Hi
from complying with its



 

\- 59 - disclosure obligations under this Agreement, including with respect to such
proposal; _provided further_ , that any such confidentiality agreement need
not contain a standstill or similar provision) and (y) participate in
discussions or negotiations regarding such proposal. ACE Hi agrees to provide
Buyer with any information provided in writing or a reasonable summary of
oral information provided to the person making such Takeover Proposal and its
Representatives substantially simultaneously with the provision thereof to
such other person. Each of the ACE Selling Parties shall, and shall cause any
of their respective Affiliates or any Persons acting on their behalf to,
immediately cease and cause to be terminated any activities, discussions or
negotiations with any parties existing on the date hereof with respect to any
Takeover Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board of Directors of
ACE Hi shall be permitted to disclose to the stockholders of ACE Hi a position
with respect to a Takeover Proposal required by Rule 14e-2(a), Item 1012(a) of
Regulation M-A or Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

(b) Except as contemplated by this Section 9.4, neither the Board of Directors
of ACE Hi nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw or modify, or propose
publicly to withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to Buyer, the approval or
recommendation by such Board of Directors or such committee of this Agreement
or the ACE Lo Purchase, (ii) approve or recommend, or propose publicly to
approve or recommend, any Takeover Proposal, or (iii) cause ACE Hi to enter
into any letter of intent, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement or
other similar agreement (other than a confidentiality agreement of the type
and under the circumstances described in Section 9.4(a)) related to any
Takeover Proposal (each, an " _ACE Hi Acquisition Agreement_ ").
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in response to a Takeover Proposal that was
not solicited by it after the date of this Agreement and that did not
otherwise result from a breach of Section 9.4(a), prior to October 18, 2006,
the Board of Directors of ACE Hi may, if it determines in good faith, after
consulting with outside counsel, that taking such action is reasonably
required by the Board of Directors fiduciary obligations under applicable
Law, (A) withdraw or modify, or propose publicly to withdraw or modify, the
approval or recommendation by such Board of Directors or any committee
thereof of this Agreement or the Purchase, (B) approve or recommend, or
propose to approve or recommend, any Superior Proposal, or (C) terminate this
Agreement with respect to the ACE Lo Purchase pursuant to Section 11.1(g)
hereof simultaneously with the payment of the Termination Fee, but only after
(I) such Board of Directors has determined in good faith that such Takeover
Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal, (II) ACE Hi has notified Buyer in
writing of the determination that such Takeover Proposal constitutes a
Superior Proposal, (III) Buyer has the opportunity to revise the terms of this
Agreement to match or exceed the terms of such Superior Proposal within three
(3) business days following receipt by Buyer of such notice, which shall
include the right to match any non-price terms of such Superior Proposal
(including without limitation, decreasing the size of or eliminating
the Deposit, or replacing the Deposit with a letter of credit, if applicable,
in the event that clause (II) in Section 9.4(d)(ii) is held unenforceable by a
court of competent jurisdiction) and (IV) following the expiration of the
three (3) business day period referenced in clause (III) above, the Board of
Directors of ACE Hi has determined that the Superior Proposal remains a
Superior Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, other than in connection
with a Takeover Proposal, the Board of Directors of ACE Hi may, if it
determines in good faith, after consulting with outside counsel, that the
failure to take such action would result in a breach of the Board of
Directors fiduciary obligations under applicable Law, withdraw or modify the
approval or recommendation by such Board of Directors or any committee thereof
of this Agreement or the Purchase if ACE Hi has notified Buyer in writing of
the decision to do so at



 

\- 60 - least three (3) business days prior to the taking of such action, which notice
shall specify in writing the reasons therefor. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement, Buyer and the Selling Parties hereby agree to
issue a press release promptly following the execution of this Agreement which
shall include the principal terms of this Agreement, including a summary of
the primary terms of Section 9.4, Section 9.5 and Section 9.11 hereof. The
parties have agreed to include in such press release the description of such
provisions in _Exhibit K_ attached hereto and that inclusion of such
description in such press release shall be deemed to have satisfied the
requirement of the previous sentence.

(c) In addition to the obligations of ACE Hi set forth in paragraphs (a) and
(b) of this Section 9.4, ACE Hi shall as promptly as practicable advise Buyer,
orally and in writing, of any request for information or of any Takeover
Proposal (and in any case within 24 hours of such request or the receipt of
such Takeover Proposal), the principal terms and conditions of such request or
Takeover Proposal and the identity of the person making such request or
Takeover Proposal. ACE Hi shall keep Buyer informed of the status and
material details (including amendments or proposed amendments) of any such
request or Takeover Proposal as promptly as practicable.

(d) For purposes of this Agreement, the term:

(i) " _Takeover Proposal_ " means any bona fide inquiry, proposal or offer
from any Person relating to (A) any direct or indirect acquisition or purchase
(or series of related acquisitions or purchases) of assets that constitute 20%

(I) 50% or more of any class of voting securities of ACE Hi or (II) any of the

the interests in AREP Sands to any direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary
of AREH or (ii) transfer of units of AREP), (C) any tender offer or exchange
offer (or other offer to purchase or acquire) that, if consummated, would
result in any Person beneficially owning (I) 50% or more of any class of
voting securities of ACE Hi or (II) any of the ACE Lo Equity Interests (other
than any direct or indirect (i) transfer of the interests in AREP Sands to
any direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of AREH or (ii) transfer of
units of AREP), (D) any merger, consolidation, business combination,
recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving
ACE Hi or ACE Lo or (E) any direct or indirect acquisition or purchase of, any
joint venture or partnership or similar arrangement involving, or any
recapitalization, restructuring or leveraged financing or similar transaction
involving all or any portion of the Casino Property, in each case other than
(I) any direct or indirect (i) transfer of the interests in AREP Sands to any
direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of AREH or (ii) transfer of units
of AREP and (II) the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.



 

\- 61 - (ii) " _Superior Proposal_ " means any written Takeover Proposal that
the Board of Directors of ACE Hi determines in good faith (after consultation
with its Affiliates and its advisors) to be more favorable (taking into
account (A) all financial and strategic considerations, including relevant
legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of such Takeover Proposal and
the Purchase and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement deemed
relevant by the Board of Directors of ACE Hi, (B) the identity of the third
party making such Takeover Proposal, (C) the anticipated timing, conditions
and prospects for completion of such Takeover Proposal, including the
prospects for obtaining regulatory approvals and financing, and any third
party shareholder approvals and (D) the other terms and conditions of such
Takeover Proposal) to ACE His stockholders than the ACE Lo Purchase and the
other transactions directly relating to the ACE Selling Parties contemplated
by this Agreement (taking into account all of the terms of any proposal by
Buyer to amend or modify the terms of the Purchase and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement), except that (I) the reference to "any of the
ACE Lo Equity Interests" in clauses (B)(II) and (C)(II) of the definition of
" _Takeover Proposal_ " in Section 9.4(d)(i) shall be deemed to be a reference
to "50% or more of the ACE Lo Equity Interests" and (II) the Takeover Proposal
must include an escrow deposit in an amount at least equal to and upon terms
and conditions substantially similar to the Deposit.

Nothing in this Section 9.4 is intended to prevent or preclude ACE Hi from
communicating with its Affiliates, its or their controlling persons, or its
counsel or advisors.

(e) (i) Prior to the termination of this Agreement with respect to the AREH
Subs Purchase, AREH shall not and shall not permit its Subsidiaries or BEC to
transfer or agree to transfer the Traymore Site, directly or indirectly, to
any Person (other than to a direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of
AREH that assumes all the obligations of the transferor under this Agreement),
except either (x) in accordance with this Agreement or (y) pursuant to an
exercise of the Traymore Call Right.

 

(ii) If the Board of Directors of ACE Hi has determined that a Takeover
Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal, AREH and Buyer shall remain
obligated to consummate the AREH Subs Purchase pursuant to this Agreement, and
all the relevant provisions of this Agreement relating to the AREH Subs
Purchase shall survive any termination by ACE Hi with respect to the ACE Lo
Purchase pursuant to Section 11.1(g) hereof based on the Superior Proposal;
_provided_ , _however_ , that (A) the closing of the AREH Subs Purchase shall
occur simultaneously with the closing of such Superior Proposal and (B)
the closing of such Superior Proposal shall be a condition to the closing of
the AREH Subs Purchase. For the avoidance of doubt, any purchase of the
Boardwalk Equity Interests by Buyer pursuant to this subsection (ii) would be
purchased subject to the continuing rights of ACE Lo, if any, under the
Traymore Call Right.

(iii) In the event that such Superior Proposal is terminated without being
consummated, then the ACE Selling Parties shall promptly notify Buyer of such
termination in writing and Buyer may elect, by delivering written notice to
the Selling Parties within thirty (30) days of the receipt of such notice
from the ACE Selling Parties, to reinstate the rights and obligations of Buyer
and the ACE Selling Parties under this



 

\- 62 - Agreement, including without limitation Buyers right to purchase the ACE Lo
Equity Interests and the AREH Subs Equity Interests from ACE Hi and AREH,

same terms and conditions as in this Agreement, modified as appropriate to
reflect changes in the timing and circumstances surrounding the transaction
(a " _Revival_ "), and the parties shall enter into appropriate documents and
agreements for such transaction as promptly as practicable. In the event that
Buyer does not so elect to effect a Revival during such thirty (30)-day
period pursuant to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall immediately
terminate pursuant to Section 11.1(i) hereof.

(f) (i) None of the AREH Selling Parties shall, nor shall they authorize,

shall cause ACE Lo to) provide written notice to ACE Hi as promptly as
reasonably practicable prior to changing the record owner of the Casino
Property and cooperate with ACE Hi in connection with any substitution of
parties in order to protect any claim with respect to the Real Property
Tax Contests.



 

\- 71 - (d) The amount of any Real Property Tax Refund shall be (i) first, reduced by
the amount of any contingent fees payable to Counsel, (ii) second, retained
by Buyer until Buyer has received an aggregate amount of Real Property Tax
Refunds equal to Ten Million Dollars ($10,000,000), (iii) third, paid to ACE
Hi as provided in the immediately following sentence until ACE Hi has

any amounts required to be paid pursuant to this Section 9.16(d) by wire
transfer of immediately available funds.

(e) If Buyer or ACE Lo receives any cash payments, including interest,
pursuant to a judgment of a judicial or administrative body relating to a Real
Property Tax Contest prior to a Real Property Tax Event, such cash payments
shall be allocated and paid in accordance with Section 9.16(d) hereof. At the
time of a Real Property Tax Event with respect to such Real Property Tax
Contest, there shall be an accounting by the parties to determine whether the
allocation of such payments pursuant to the preceding sentence was correct,
and whether any monies are due to ACE Hi or alternatively, if ACE Hi must
return to ACE Lo, with interest thereon at the actual rate charged to ACE Lo,
any excess monies received by it in the event the amount received pursuant to
the Real Property Tax Event is modified downward.

(f) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that, for purposes
of determining whether credits shall be included in the calculation of any
Real Property Tax Refund, such credits shall be taken into account whether or
not they are used and whether or not they could be used, including in
particular by reason of the fact that such credits may no longer be usable by
ACE Lo, Buyer or any Affiliate of Buyer, or any transferee therefrom or
successor thereto, if (i) ACE Lo does not continue to be the record owner of
the Casino Property or (ii) ACE Lo does not continue to be the named party in
the Real Property Tax Contests.

(c) The Electing Party hereby indemnifies and agrees to defend, and hold the
Non-Electing Parties harmless from and against any claims, costs, damages,

cessation of the Casino Business (the " _Final MEPA Determination_ "), Buyer
shall deliver to ACE Hi a notice setting forth (a) the amount of the Final
MEPA Determination (together with any backup or supporting data used in such

Buyer. ACE Hi and Buyer shall cooperate with each other with respect to notice
to, or the determination by any Multiemployer Plan of any withdrawal
liability, and any notice or other communication to such Multiemployer Plan

Parties in Section 4.3 hereof.

(c) The parties hereto hereby acknowledge and agree that for purposes of this
ARTICLE XII, in the event any representation or warranty of the ACE Selling
Parties in ARTICLE IV or ARTICLE V hereof or the AREH Selling Parties in
ARTICLE VI or ARTICLE VII hereof shall have been breached (taking into account
any and all "Material Adverse Effect," "materiality" and similar exceptions
and qualifiers set forth in any such representations and warranties), solely
for purposes of determining the amount of Losses resulting therefrom, any and
all "Material Adverse Effect" qualifiers set forth in any such
representations and warranties shall be disregarded.



 

\- 86 - (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
indemnification obligations of the Indemnifying Parties in Section 12.2(a)
and Section 12.2(b) hereof shall not apply to any particular Loss until ninety
(90) days after the applicable Indemnified Party has filed a claim with
respect to such insured Loss for reimbursement under its title insurance
policy(ies) and/or any other applicable insurance policies. Each Indemnified
Party covenants to use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain reimbursement
from such insurer(s) for any such insured Losses. Any indemnified Loss under
Section 12.2(a) or Section 12.2(b) shall be reduced by the amount, if any, of
the Indemnified Partys recovery under such insurance policies.

and Section 12.7 hereof, from and after the Closing, ACE Hi shall indemnify,

(iii) any breach of any covenant or agreement made, or to be performed, by ACE

with, arising out of, resulting from or incident to:

(i) Non-Income Taxes of the MLK Entities for all Pre-Closing Tax Periods;

representation or warranty, made in Section 7.4.

(c) _Indemnification by Buyer_. Subject to the provisions of Section 12.4
hereof, from and after the Closing, Buyer shall indemnify, defend, save and
hold harmless Sellers and their Affiliates (each individually, a " _Seller
Indemnified Party_ " and collectively, the " _Seller Indemnified Parties_ ")
from and against any and all Losses incurred in connection with, arising out
of, resulting from or incident to:

(i) Non-Income Taxes of (A) ACE Lo for all Post-Measurement Date Tax Periods,
(B) the MLK Entities for all Post-Closing Tax Periods, and (C) Boardwalk for
all Tax Periods; and Income Taxes of, or with respect to (including without
limitation with respect to the income, business, or activities of), ACE Lo and
each of the AREH Subs for all Post-Closing Tax Periods; 

(ii) any breach of any covenant or agreement made, or to be performed, by

the amount of Taxes which would have been paid but for the application of any
credit or net operating loss or capital loss deduction attributable to, as
applicable, either Post-Measurement Date Tax Periods or Post-Closing Tax
Periods.

(e) _Closing Date Straddle Period_. In the case of any Closing Date Straddle
Period:

(i) real and personal property Taxes or other Taxes levied on a per diem basis
(collectively, " _Per Diem Taxes_ ") of any of the Companies for a Pre-
Closing Tax Period shall be equal to the amount of such Per Diem Taxes for the
entire Closing Date Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of
which is the number of calendar days during the Closing Date Straddle Period
that are in the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the denominator of which is the
total number of calendar days in the Closing Date Straddle Period; and

(ii) Taxes of any of the Companies (other than Per Diem Taxes) for any Pre-
Closing Tax Period shall be computed as if such Tax Period ended as of the
end of the day on the Closing Date.

In the case of any Measurement Date Straddle Period, analogous principles to
the foregoing shall apply.



 

\- 88 - (f) _Certain Procedures_.

(i) All claims for indemnification under this Section 12.3 shall be asserted
and resolved pursuant to the provisions of Section 12.4, except to the extent
that the following clause (ii), (iii) or (iv) requires otherwise.

(ii) The applicable Seller and Buyer shall jointly control all proceedings
taken in connection with any claim made by any Governmental Entity, which if
successful might result in an indemnity payment under this Section 12.3 (a "
_Tax Claim_ ") relating to Taxes of the applicable Company or Companies for,
as applicable, a Measurement Date Straddle Period or a Closing Date Straddle
Period. A party shall promptly notify the other party if it decides not to
control the defense or settlement of any Tax Claim that it is entitled to
control pursuant to this Section 12.3(f)(ii), and the other party shall
thereupon be permitted to defend and settle such proceeding in its sole and
absolute discretion.

 

(iii) Sellers and Buyer shall reasonably cooperate with each other in
contesting any Tax Claim. Such cooperation shall include the retention and,
upon the request of the party or parties controlling proceedings relating to
such Tax Claim, the provision to such party or parties of records and
information that are reasonably relevant to such Tax Claim, and making
employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional
information or explanation of any material provided hereunder or to testify at
proceedings relating to such Tax Claim.

(iv) Any indemnity payment required to be made by any party under this Section
12.3 shall be due and payable from such party to the party being indemnified
or the applicable Governmental Entity, as applicable, in immediately available
funds no later than one (1) business day before the date on which the related
Taxes are required to be paid to the relevant Governmental Entity.

Section 12.4 _Procedures Relating to Indemnification_.

(a) _Notice of Asserted Liability_. With respect to third party claims, all
claims for indemnification by any Indemnified Party or Seller
Indemnified Party under this Section 12.4 shall be asserted and resolved as
follows: promptly after discovery of or receipt by an Indemnified Party or a
Seller Indemnified Party of notice of any demand, claim or circumstances,
which, with the lapse of time, are reasonably expected to give rise to a
claim or the commencement (or the threatened commencement) of any action,
proceeding or investigation (an " _Asserted Liability_ "), that may result in
Losses which are subject to indemnification hereunder, the Indemnified Party
or Seller Indemnified Party, as applicable, shall give written notice thereof
(the " _Claims Notice_ ") to the applicable Indemnifying Party or Buyer, as
applicable. The Claims Notice shall describe the Asserted Liability in
reasonable detail, to the extent possible, and shall indicate the amount
(estimated, if necessary, and to the extent feasible) of the Losses that have
been or may be suffered by the Indemnified Party or Seller Indemnified Party,
as applicable. The failure of an Indemnified Party or Seller Indemnified
Party, as applicable, to provide a Claims Notice with reasonable promptness
shall not affect any indemnification obligations hereunder except to
the extent that the applicable Indemnifying Party or Buyer, as applicable, is
actually and materially prejudiced thereby.



 

\- 89 - (b) _Opportunity to Defend_.

(i) An Indemnifying Party may elect to compromise or defend, at its own
expense and by its own counsel, any Asserted Liability;  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that counsel for such Indemnifying Party shall be approved by the
Indemnified Party (whose approval shall not unreasonably be withheld or
delayed). If such Indemnifying Party elects to compromise or defend
such Asserted Liability, it shall, within thirty (30) days (or sooner, if the
nature of the Asserted Liability so requires), notify the Indemnified Party of
its intent to do so, in which case it shall have the sole right and authority
to control any such compromise or defense, and the Indemnified Party shall
cooperate, at the expense of such Indemnifying Party, in the compromise of, or
defense against, such Asserted Liability. If such Indemnifying Party elects
not to compromise or defend the Asserted Liability or fails to notify the
Indemnified Party of its election within such thirty (30) day period, such
Indemnified Party may pay, compromise or defend such Asserted Liability with
counsel reasonably acceptable to such Indemnifying Party (at the Indemnifying
Parties sole cost and expense in the event that the Indemnifying Parties are
determined to be liable hereunder). Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the
Indemnifying Parties nor the Indemnified Party may settle or compromise any
claim over the objection of the other; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the
claim is for money damages only, the Indemnifying Parties can settle or
compromise any such claim solely for money damages without the consent of
the Indemnified Party provided it pays or otherwise satisfies the money
damages in full, in which case the Indemnifying Parties can settle or
compromise any such claim without the consent of the Indemnified Party. No
settlement or compromise may be entered into by an Indemnifying Party without
an unconditional and full release of the Indemnified Parties reasonably
acceptable to their counsel. If an Indemnifying Party elects to defend any
claim, the Indemnified Party shall make available to such Indemnifying Party
such non-privileged books, records or other documents within its control that
are necessary or appropriate for such defense (in the judgment of counsel
engaged by such Indemnifying Party).

(ii) The Indemnified Parties have the right to employ their own counsel in any
compromise of, or defense against, any Asserted Liability, or in connection
with an Indemnified Partys provision of reasonable cooperation and assistance
to such Indemnifying Party or such Indemnifying Partys counsel as provided
above, but the fees, expenses and other charges of such counsel employed by
the Indemnified Party will be at the expense of the Indemnified Party (and
shall not constitute Losses hereunder) unless (A) the employment of counsel by
the Indemnified Party has been authorized in writing by an Indemnifying
Party, (B) the Indemnifying Parties have not in fact employed counsel to
compromise or defend against the Asserted Liability within the period provided
in Section 12.4(b)(i) hereof or (C) the provisions of Section 12.4(b)(iii)
below are applicable. It is understood that the Indemnifying Parties shall
not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same
jurisdiction, be liable for the reasonable fees, disbursements and other
charges of more than one separate firm (plus, if required, one separate firm
admitted to practice in a local jurisdiction) at any one time retained by the
Indemnified Party unless the employment of more than one counsel has been
authorized in writing by an Indemnifying Party. 



 

\- 90 - (iii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in the event
there is a conflict of interest between any of the Indemnifying Parties and
the Indemnified Parties with respect to the defense of any Asserted Liability
arising under Section 12.2(a)(iv) or Section 12.2(b)(iv) hereof, the
Indemnified Parties shall have the right to participate in the defense
(subject to the rights of the Indemnifying Parties pursuant to Section
12.4(b)(i) above), with one counsel selected by the Indemnified Parties and at
the Indemnifying Parties expense (with advancement of expenses pursuant to
Section 12.4(d) hereof), any such Asserted Liability arising under Section
12.2(a)(iv) or Section 12.2(b)(iv) hereof.

(c) _Notice of Direct Claim_. In the event that in the reasonable judgment of
Buyer, after consultation with Buyers outside legal counsel, an Indemnified
Party has a claim for indemnification that does not involve a third party (a
" _Direct Claim_ "), the Indemnified Party shall provide a written notice to
the Indemnifying Parties of such Direct Claim with reasonable promptness,
specifying, to the extent known, the nature and circumstances of such Direct
Claim and the amount (estimated, if necessary, and to the extent feasible) of
the Losses incurred or reasonably expected to be incurred in respect of such
Direct Claim (a " _Payment Request_ ");  _provided_ , _however_ , the failure
of an Indemnified Party to provide such Payment Request with reasonable
promptness shall not adversely affect any indemnification obligations
hereunder except to the extent that the Indemnifying Parties are actually and
materially prejudiced thereby.

(d) _Advancement of Expenses_. The right to indemnification of Losses
conferred by Section 12.2 hereof shall include, solely for Asserted
Liabilities under Section 12.2(a)(iv) or Section 12.2(b)(iv), the right to
have the applicable Indemnifying Party pay the Indemnified Partys expenses in
any action, proceeding or investigation in which (i) such Indemnifying Party
elects not to compromise or defend such Asserted Liability, (ii) such
Indemnifying Party fails to notify the Indemnified Party of its election
within the thirty (30) day period contemplated in Section 12.4(b)(i) or (iii)
the Indemnified Party is entitled to reimbursement pursuant to Section
12.4(b)(iii), in each case as such expenses are suffered or incurred and in
advance of such actions, proceedings or investigations final disposition.
Any such advance shall be subject to an undertaking by or on behalf of an
Indemnified Party, which need not be secured and shall be accepted without
reference to such Indemnified Partys financial ability to make repayment, to
make repayment to repay all advanced expenses if it shall ultimately be
determined by a final, nonappealable decision rendered by a court of competent
jurisdiction over the parties that such Indemnified Party is not entitled to
be indemnified by the Indemnifying Parties.

Section 12.5 _Contribution_.

(a) If the indemnification provided for in Section 12.2 hereof is not
enforceable under applicable Law, then the Indemnifying Parties, in lieu
of indemnifying such Indemnified Parties, shall to the full extent
permissible under applicable Law (but in all events subject to the terms and
limitations of this ARTICLE XII, including without limitation, Section 12.7
hereof) contribute to the Losses incurred by such Indemnified Parties in
connection with any claim relating to an indemnifiable event under this
Agreement, in such proportion as is deemed fair and reasonable in light of all
of the circumstances of such action, suit or proceeding in order to reflect
the relative fault of the Indemnifying Parties (and their officers, directors,
employees and agents), on one hand, and the Indemnified Parties, on the other
hand, in connection with the



 

\- 91 - events or transactions from which such action, suit or proceeding arose;
_provided_ , _however_ , that if the foregoing allocation is not permitted by
applicable Law, then such allocation shall be adjusted as appropriate to
reflect not only the relative fault of the Indemnifying Parties (and their
officers, directors, employees and agents), on one hand, and the Indemnified
Parties, on the other hand, but also the relative benefits received by such
parties in connection therewith as well as any other relevant equitable
considerations. For purposes of this Section 12.5, the relative fault of
the Indemnifying Parties (and their directors, officers, employees and
agents), on one hand, and the Indemnified Parties, on the other hand, in
connection with the events or transactions giving cause to such action, suit
or proceeding shall be determined by reference to, among other things, the
degree to which their liability is primary or secondary and the degree to
which their conduct is active or passive. In no event shall any Indemnified
Party be entitled to collect or receive indemnification or contribution in an
aggregate amount greater than would be applicable if the indemnification
provided for in Section 12.2 hereof was enforceable under applicable Law.

(b) The Indemnifying Parties hereby agree to fully indemnify and hold the
Indemnified Parties harmless from any claims of contribution or
indemnification which may be brought by officers, directors, employees or
agents of the Indemnifying Parties or persons who were officers, directors,
employees or agents of ACE Lo prior to the Measurement Date for actions, suits
or proceedings arising from or relating to events occurring prior to the
Measurement Date.

Section 12.6 _Payment of Damages_. An Indemnified Party shall be paid in cash
by an Indemnifying Party the amount to which such Indemnified Party may become
entitled by reason of the provisions of this ARTICLE XII, within fifteen (15)
days after such amount is determined either by mutual agreement of
the parties or on the date on which both such amount and an Indemnified
Partys obligation to pay such amount have been determined by a final,
nonappealable judgment of a court or administrative body having jurisdiction
over such proceeding. 

Section 12.7 _Limitations on Indemnity_.

(a) Other than in respect of a claim for indemnification based on fraud on the
part of any Indemnifying Party hereto, for which there shall be no limitations
on the amount of Losses recoverable through the indemnification provisions
hereunder, no Indemnified Party shall seek, or be entitled to seek or obtain,
indemnification from the Indemnifying Parties, for any amounts, in the
aggregate, in excess of the sum of (x) the Closing ACE Purchase Price _plus_
(y) cash amounts paid by Buyer to ACE Hi following the Closing pursuant to
Section 9.16 (Real Property Tax Refund), Section 9.19(b) (Tax Refunds), and
Section 9.24 (City-Wide Progressives Refund) hereof (collectively, (x) and
(y) are referred to as the " _ACE Hi Cap_ ") _plus_ (z) the AREH Purchase
Price; _provided_ , _however_ , that:

(i) no Indemnified Party shall seek, or be entitled to seek or obtain,
indemnification from AREH pursuant to Section 12.2(b)(vi) hereof for any
amount, in the aggregate, in excess of One Hundred Thirty-Five Million Dollars
($135,000,000);



 

\- 92 - (ii) no Indemnified Party shall seek, or be entitled to seek or obtain,
indemnification from ACE Hi pursuant to Section 12.2(a) or Section 12.3(a)
hereof for any amount, in the aggregate, in excess of the ACE Hi Cap;

(iii) no Indemnified Party shall seek, or be entitled to seek or obtain,
indemnification from the Indemnifying Parties pursuant to Section 12.2(a)(i)
or Section 12.2(b)(i) hereof until the aggregate amount of Losses arising
under such Sections, taken together, exceed Five Hundred Thousand Dollars
($500,000) (the " _Indemnification Floor_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that if
the aggregate amount of such Losses arising under Section 12.2(a)(i) and
Section 12.2(b)(i) hereof exceed the amount of the Indemnification Floor, the
Indemnified Parties shall only be entitled to seek indemnification from the
Indemnifying Parties for the amount of such Losses in excess of the
Indemnification Floor; and

(iv) to the extent that any matter is indemnified by both ACE Hi and AREH
pursuant to this ARTICLE XII, the Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled
to collect twice.

(b) In calculating the amount of any Losses payable to an Indemnified Party
hereunder, the amount of the Losses (i) shall not be duplicative of any
adjustments to the Purchase Price pursuant to ARTICLE II hereof, (ii) shall
not be duplicative of any other Losses for which an indemnification claim has
been made and (iii) shall be computed net of any amounts actually recovered by
such Indemnified Party under any insurance policy with respect to such Losses
(net of any costs and expenses incurred in obtaining such
insurance proceeds). If an Indemnifying Party pays an Indemnified Party for a
claim and subsequently insurance proceeds in respect of such claim is
collected by the Indemnified Parties, then the Indemnified Party promptly
shall remit the insurance proceeds (net of any costs and expenses incurred in
obtaining such insurance proceeds) to the Indemnifying Party. The Indemnified
Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain from any
applicable insurance company any insurance proceeds in respect of any claim
for which the Indemnified Parties seek indemnification under this ARTICLE XII.

(c) No Selling Party shall be liable to any Indemnified Party, and Buyer
shall not be liable to any Selling Party, for indirect, special, incidental,
consequential or punitive losses or damages (including, without limitation,
consequential losses or damages measured by lost profits) claimed by such
Indemnified Party or Selling Party, as applicable, under the terms of this
Agreement; _provided that_ nothing in this Section 12.7(c) shall prevent any
Indemnified Party or Selling Party, as applicable, from recovering amounts
paid for indirect, special, incidental, consequential or punitive losses or
damages to a " _Covered Third Party_." A " _Covered Third Party_ " means any
third party (other than an Indemnified Party or a Selling Party) having
claims (i) against any of the Selling Parties as of the Measurement Date
(including, without limitation, the GB Parties with respect to the GB Claims),
(ii) as a result of any breach of any of the Selling Parties of
their respective covenants or agreements under this Agreement other than the
covenants and agreements under this ARTICLE XII or (iii) as a GB Party against
Buyer in respect of the GB Claims. For the avoidance of doubt, any
counterparty to any Contract entered into (x) by Buyer and its Affiliates or
any other Indemnified Party after the date hereof or (y) by ACE Lo after the
Closing Date is not a " _Covered Third Party_ " with respect to claims arising
out 



 

\- 93 - of such Contract. It is the intention of the parties hereto, by this
limitation, to limit damage claims between the parties hereto to direct
damages, so that, for example, if it was determined that as a result of the GB
Claims, Buyer was not entitled to any of the property acquired under this
Agreement, Losses of the Indemnified Parties would include the direct damages
incurred in an amount equal to the payment Buyer made to the Selling Parties
for property Buyer did not receive, but would not include any amounts that
Buyer might owe to its lenders with respect to its future development
activities on the Properties, whether as a result of any undertaking to such
lenders or damages that Buyer may incur as a result of a breach or cross
default under its financing arrangements, or any business interference losses
or costs or losses due to any delays of or interference with Buyers planned
development activities for indirect, special, incidental, consequential or
punitive damages (including, without limitation, consequential damages
measured by lost profits) suffered by such parties. 

(d) Buyer and the Selling Parties hereby acknowledge and agree that (i)
Buyers Losses shall not include any direct Losses (i.e., damages other than
indirect, special, incidental, consequential or punitive damages (including,
without limitation, consequential damages measured by lost profits)) claimed
against such Indemnified Party in connection with Contracts relating to
Buyers future development activities on the Properties entered into by Buyer
or any of its Affiliates (including ACE Lo) following the Closing Date and
prior to the date that is two (2) years following the Closing Date, (ii)
Buyers Losses may, if otherwise indemnified under and not excluded from the
Indemnifying Parties indemnification obligations under this Agreement,
include any such direct Losses claimed against the Indemnified Parties
in connection with Contracts relating to Buyers future development
activities on the Properties entered into by Buyer or any of its Affiliates
(including ACE Lo) on or after the date that is two (2) years following the
Closing Date and (iii) Buyers Losses shall not in any event include direct
Losses claimed against any Indemnified Parties by lenders (or other financing
sources) to Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer.

Section 12.8 _Exclusive Remedy_. Except in the cases of (a) fraud and (b)
Section 9.16 hereof, in which cases the Indemnified Parties reserve any and
all rights and remedies available to them, after the Closing, the indemnities
provided in this ARTICLE XII shall constitute the sole and exclusive remedy of
any Indemnified Party (but not the Selling Parties) for Losses arising out
of, resulting from or incurred in connection with any claims regarding matters
arising under or otherwise relating to this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_
; that this exclusive remedy for Losses does not preclude any party
from bringing an action for specific performance, including the right to seek
a mandatory injunction or other equitable relief to require a party to close
the purchase or sale, as applicable, as contemplated herein, or otherwise seek
to require a party to perform its obligations under this Agreement.

Section 12.9 _Treatment of Indemnification Payments_. All
indemnification payments made pursuant to this ARTICLE XII shall be treated
by the parties for Income Tax purposes as adjustments to the Purchase Price,
unless otherwise required by applicable Law. The liabilities in respect of
which such indemnification payments are made shall, if applicable, be treated
for Income Tax purposes as additional applicable liabilities for purposes of
the Purchase Price Allocation.



 

\- 94 - Section 12.10 _Certain Claims_. For the avoidance of doubt, the ACE Closing
Price Adjustments contain accruals for various liabilities. To the extent any
claim for indemnification under this Article XII relates to a claim for which
an accrual has been made pursuant to the ACE Closing Price Adjustments, the
amount of such accrual shall be taken into account to reduce the Losses of
the Indemnified Parties in respect thereof and the Indemnifying Party shall
have all right to defend such claims in accordance with section 12.4(b)
notwithstanding such accruals.

Whenever the words " _include_ ," " _includes_ " or " _including_ " are used
in this Agreement they shall be deemed to be followed by the words " _without
limitation_." The phrase "made available" in this Agreement shall mean that
the information referred to has been _made available_ if requested by the

Section 13.7 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or

any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any
term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced,
the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so
as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an
