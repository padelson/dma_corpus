The Merger; Closing; Effective Time

  


 

  

SECTION 1.1. The Merger. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged
with and into the Company and the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub
shall thereupon cease. The Company shall be the surviving corporation in the
Merger (sometimes hereinafter referred to as the "Surviving Corporation"), and
the separate corporate existence of the Company, with all its rights,
privileges, immunities, powers and franchises, shall continue unaffected by
the Merger, except as set forth in Article II. The Merger shall have the
effects specified in the PBCL and in this Agreement.

  


 

  

SECTION 1.2. Closing. Unless otherwise mutually agreed in writing between the
Company and Parent, the closing of the Merger (the "Closing") shall take place
at the offices of Cravath, Swaine and Moore LLP, 825 Eighth Avenue, New York,
New York, at 9:00 a.m. (Eastern Time) on the later of (a) the third Business
Day following the day on which the last to be satisfied or waived of the
conditions set forth in Article VII (other than those conditions that by their
nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the fulfillment or
waiver of those conditions) shall have been satisfied or waived in accordance
with this Agreement, and (b) the third Business Day after the final day of the
Marketing Period or such earlier date as may be specified by

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

2  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

Parent on no less than two Business Days prior notice to the Company. The date
on which the Closing actually occurs is referred to as the "Closing Date". For
purposes of this Agreement, the term "Business Day" shall mean any day ending
at 11:59 p.m. (Eastern Time) other than a Saturday or Sunday or other day on
which banks are required or authorized to close in the City of New York. The
closing of the Carveout Transactions shall occur substantially concurrently
with the Closing (it being understood that the closing of the Carveout
Transactions shall not be a condition to Closing).

  


 

  

SECTION 1.3. Effective Time. As soon as practicable following the Closing, the
Company and Parent will cause the articles of merger (the "Articles of
Merger") to be executed, acknowledged and filed with the Department of State
of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in accordance with the provisions of the
PBCL. The Merger shall become effective at the time when the Articles of
Merger have been duly filed with the Department of State of the Commonwealth
of Pennsylvania or, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, at such later
time as may be agreed by the parties in writing and specified in the Articles
of Merger (the "Effective Time").

  


 

  

ARTICLE II

  

Articles of Incorporation and

  

Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation

  


 

  

SECTION 2.1. The Articles of Incorporation. The parties hereto shall take all
actions necessary so that the articles of incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation shall be amended and restated in their entirety in connection with
the completion of the Merger to read identically to the articles of
incorporation of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time (which shall be consistent with Section 6.11), except that the name of
the Surviving Corporation shall be "The Jones Group Inc.", and as so amended
shall be the articles of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation (the
"Charter"), until thereafter amended as provided therein or by applicable Law
(subject to Section 6.11(e)).

  


 

  

SECTION 2.2. The Bylaws. The parties hereto shall take all actions necessary
so that the bylaws of Merger Sub in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time (which shall be consistent with Section 6.11) shall be the bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation (the "Bylaws"), until thereafter amended as provided
therein or by applicable Law (subject to Section 6.11(e)).

  


 

  

ARTICLE III

  

Officers and Directors

  

of the Surviving Corporation

  


 

  

SECTION 3.1. Directors. The parties hereto shall take, or cause to be taken,
all actions necessary so that the directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to

appointed and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal
in accordance with the Charter and the Bylaws.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

3  

  

 

 

 

  


 

  

SECTION 3.2. Officers. The officers of the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall, from and after the Effective Time, be the officers of

ARTICLE IV

  

Effect of the Merger on Capital Stock;

  

Exchange of Certificates

  


 

  

SECTION 4.1. Effect on Capital Stock. At the Effective Time, as a result of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any capital
stock of the Company or the sole shareholder of Merger Sub:

  


 

  

(a) Merger Consideration. Each share of the common stock, par value $0.01 per
share, of the Company (a "Share" or, collectively, the "Shares") issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than (i) Shares
owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any other direct or indirect wholly owned
Subsidiary of Parent and Shares owned by the Company or any direct or indirect
wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company, and in each case not held on behalf of
third parties (Shares covered by this clause (i) being the "Excluded Shares")
and (ii) Restricted Shares, which are governed by the provisions of Section
4.3) shall be converted into the right to receive $15.00 per Share in cash
(the "Per Share Merger Consideration"), without interest. At the Effective
Time, all of the Shares shall cease to be outstanding, shall be cancelled and
shall cease to exist, and each certificate (a "Certificate") formerly
representing any of the Shares (other than Excluded Shares) shall thereafter
represent only the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration for
each such Share, without interest.

  


 

  

(b) Cancellation of Excluded Shares. Each Excluded Share shall, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of the Excluded
Share, cease to be outstanding, shall be cancelled without payment of any
consideration therefor and shall cease to exist.

  


 

  

(c) Merger Sub. At the Effective Time, each share of common stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into one share of common stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

  


 

  

SECTION 4.2. Exchange of Certificates. (a) Paying Agent. At or immediately
following the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be
deposited, with a paying agent selected by Parent with the Company's prior
approval (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed) (the "Paying Agent"), for the benefit of the Record Holders of Shares
entitled to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration and pursuant to a
paying agent agreement in customary form, cash in immediately available funds
in the aggregate amount necessary for the Paying Agent to make the payments
contemplated by Section 4.1(a) (such cash amount being hereinafter referred to
as the "Exchange Fund"). The Paying Agent shall invest the

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

4  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

Exchange Fund as directed by Parent; provided that such investments shall be
in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America or in
commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody's Investors
Service, Inc. or Standard and Poor's Corporation, respectively, or a combination
of the foregoing, and in each case, with maturities not exceeding three
months. Any interest and other income resulting from such investment shall
become a part of the Exchange Fund, and any amounts in excess of the aggregate
amount payable pursuant to Section 4.1(a) shall be returned to the Surviving
Corporation in accordance with Section 4.2(e). To the extent that there are
any losses with respect to any such investments, or the Exchange Fund
diminishes for any reason below the level required for the Paying Agent to
make prompt cash payment pursuant to Section 4.1(a), Parent shall, or shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to, promptly replace or restore the cash in
the Exchange Fund so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is at all times
maintained at a level sufficient for the Paying Agent to make all such cash
payments under Section 4.1(a).

  


 

  

(b) Exchange Procedures. Promptly (and in any event within two Business Days)
after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying
Agent to mail to each holder of record of Shares immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than Excluded Shares and Restricted Shares) (each, a
"Record Holder of Shares") (i) a letter of transmittal specifying that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates
shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in
lieu thereof as provided in Section 4.2(f)) to the Paying Agent, such letter
of transmittal to be in customary form and to have such other provisions as
Parent and the Company may reasonably agree, and (ii) instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu
thereof as provided in Section 4.2(f)) in exchange for the amount to which
such Record Holder of Shares is entitled as a result of the Merger pursuant to
Section 4.1(a). Upon delivery of the letter of transmittal duly executed by
the applicable Record Holder of Shares and the surrender of a Certificate that
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented such Shares (or affidavit
of loss in lieu of the Certificate as provided in Section 4.2(f)) to the
Paying Agent in accordance with the terms of such letter of transmittal, the
holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a
cash amount by check or wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account designated by such holder (less any required Tax withholdings as
provided in Section 4.2(g)) equal to the product of (x) the number of Shares
represented by such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as
provided in Section 4.2(f)) and (y) the Per Share Merger Consideration, and
the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will
be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of the
Certificates or affidavits of loss, as the case may be. In the event of a
transfer of ownership of Shares (other than Restricted Shares) that is not
registered in the transfer records of the Company, a check or wire transfer
for any cash to be delivered upon due surrender of the Certificate may be
issued or made to such transferee if the Certificate formerly representing
such Shares is presented to the Paying Agent together with the applicable
letter of transmittal, accompanied by all documents reasonably required by the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent to evidence and effect such transfer
and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer Taxes have been paid or are
not applicable.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

5  

  

 

 

 

  


 

  

(c) Special Payment Procedures for DTC. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent
and the Company shall cooperate to establish procedures with the Paying Agent
and the Depository Trust Company ("DTC") to ensure that (i) if the Closing
occurs and the Exchange Fund is funded at or prior to 11:30 a.m. (Eastern
Time) on the Closing Date, the Paying Agent will transmit to DTC or its
nominee on the Closing Date an amount in cash in immediately available funds
equal to the product of (x) the number of Shares held of record by DTC or such
nominee immediately prior to the Effective Time and (y) the Per Share Merger
Consideration (such amount, the "DTC Payment"), and (ii) if the Closing occurs
and the Exchange Fund is funded after 11:30 a.m. (Eastern Time) on the Closing
Date, the Paying Agent will transmit to DTC or its nominee on the first
Business Day after the Closing Date an amount in cash in immediately available
funds equal to the DTC Payment.

  


 

  

(d) Transfers. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers
on the stock transfer books of the Company of the Shares that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any
Certificate is presented to the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying
Agent for transfer, it shall be cancelled and, subject to compliance with the
procedures set forth in Section 4.2(b), exchanged for the amount in cash in
immediately available funds to which the holder of the Certificate is entitled
pursuant to this Article IV (less any required Tax withholdings as provided in
Section 4.2(g)), to be paid by check or wire transfer to an account designated
by such holder.

  


 

  

(e) Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including
the proceeds of any investments of the Exchange Fund) that remains unclaimed
by the Record Holders of Shares for 180 days after the Effective Time shall be
delivered to the Surviving Corporation. Any Record Holder of Shares (other
than Excluded Shares and Restricted Shares) who has not theretofore complied
with this Article IV shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation
for payment of the amount to which such Record Holder of Shares is entitled as
a result of the Merger pursuant to Section 4.1(a) (less any required Tax
withholdings as provided in Section 4.2(g)) upon due surrender of its
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section
4.2(f)), without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of
the Surviving Corporation, Parent, the Paying Agent or any other Person shall
be liable to any former Record Holder of Shares for any amount properly
delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Laws. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by Record Holders of
Shares at such date as is immediately prior to the time at which such amounts
would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Entity
shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the
Surviving Corporation, free and clear of any claims or interests of any such
holders or their successors, assignees or personal representatives previously
entitled thereto. For the purposes of this Agreement, (i) the term "Person"
shall mean any individual, corporation (including not-for-profit), general or
limited partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, estate, trust,
association, organization, Governmental Entity or other entity of any kind or
nature (including any person as defined in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange
Act) and (ii) the term "Law" or "Laws" shall mean any domestic or foreign
laws, statutes, ordinances, rules (including

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

6  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

rules of common law), regulations, codes, Orders or legally enforceable
requirements enacted, issued, adopted, or promulgated by any Governmental
Entity and any judicial interpretation thereof.

  


 

  

(f) Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event that any Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in
customary amount and upon such terms as may be required by Parent as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it or the Surviving Corporation
with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue a check in the
amount (less any required Tax withholdings as provided in Section 4.2(g))
equal to the product of (i) the number of Shares represented by such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate multiplied by (ii) the Per Share Merger
Consideration.

  


 

  

(g) Withholding Rights. Each of the Company, Parent, the Surviving Corporation
and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable under this Agreement such amounts as it is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), or any other
applicable state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so
withheld by the Company, the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying
Agent, as the case may be, such withheld amounts (i) shall be remitted by the
Company, the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent, as applicable,
to the applicable Governmental Entity and (ii) shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made by the Company, the Surviving
Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent, as the case may be.

  


 

  

SECTION 4.3. Restricted Shares; Share Equivalent Units. (a) Restricted Shares.
At the Effective Time, each outstanding Restricted Share shall be deemed to be
fully vested and nonforfeitable (assuming the maximum achievement of all
applicable performance goals) and shall be cancelled and shall only entitle
the holder thereof to receive from the Company, in full settlement of such
Restricted Share, as soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time
(but in any event no later than three Business Days after the Effective Time),
an amount in cash, for each Restricted Share, equal to the Per Share Merger
Consideration plus any unpaid dividends that have accumulated on such
Restricted Share prior to the Effective Time, less applicable Taxes required
to be withheld with respect to such payment and further subject to any
reduction pursuant to any Contract between any holder of Restricted Shares and
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

  


 

  

(b) Share Equivalent Units. At the Effective Time, each stock unit credited to
the account of any participant in The Jones Group Outside Directors Deferred
Compensation Plan (the "Outside Directors DC Plan") the value of which is
determined by reference to the value of a Share (each a "Share Equivalent
Unit") shall be deemed to be fully vested and nonforfeitable and shall be
cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash, without
interest, equal to the Per Share Merger Consideration in accordance with the
terms of the Outside Directors DC Plan and any applicable

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

7  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

elections thereunder, less applicable Taxes required to be withheld with
respect to such payment.

  


 

  

(c) Cancellation of Restricted Shares and Share Equivalent Units. At the
Effective Time, all Restricted Shares and Share Equivalent Units, whether or
not vested, shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically cease to
exist, and each holder thereof shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive the consideration specified in Sections
4.3(a) and 4.3(b).

  


 

  

(d) Corporate Actions. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the Board of
Directors of the Company and the Compensation Committee of the Board of
Directors of the Company, as applicable, shall adopt resolutions (which
resolutions shall promptly be provided to Parent) and will take such other
appropriate actions to implement the provisions of Sections 4.3(a) and 4.3(b).

  


 

  

SECTION 4.4. Adjustments to Prevent Dilution. In the event that the Company
changes the number of Shares or securities convertible or exchangeable into or
exercisable for Shares issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a
result of a reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split),
stock dividend or distribution, recapitalization, merger, issuer tender or
exchange offer, or other similar transaction, the Per Share Merger
Consideration shall be equitably adjusted to reflect such change and as so
adjusted shall, from and after the date of such event, be the Per Share Merger
Consideration.

SECTION 5.1. Representations and Warranties of the Company. Except as set
forth in the Company SEC Reports filed or furnished by the Company with the
SEC on or after December 31, 2010 and prior to the date of this Agreement
(excluding, in each case, any risk factor disclosures set forth under the
heading "Risk Factors" and any disclosure of risks that are predictive or
forward-looking in nature ("Excluded Disclosure")) (provided that nothing in
the Company SEC Reports shall be deemed to modify or qualify the
representations and warranties set forth in Sections 5.1(a) (Organization,
Good Standing and Qualification), 5.1(b) (Capital Structure), 5.1(c)
(Corporate Authority; Approval and Fairness) and 5.1(j) (Takeover Statutes; No
Rights Agreement)) or in the corresponding sections or subsections of the
Disclosure Letter delivered to Parent by the Company prior to or
simultaneously with entering into this Agreement (the "Company Disclosure
Letter") (it being agreed that disclosure of any item in any section or
subsection of the Company Disclosure Letter shall be deemed disclosure with
respect to any other section or subsection to which the relevance of such item
is reasonably apparent), the Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent
and Merger Sub that:

  


 

  

(a) Organization, Good Standing and Qualification. Each of the Company and its
Subsidiaries is a legal entity duly organized, validly existing and in

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

8  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

good standing (with respect to jurisdictions that recognize the concept of
good standing) under the Laws of the jurisdiction of its organization and has
all requisite corporate or similar power and authority to own, lease and
operate its properties and assets and to carry on its business as currently
conducted and is qualified to do business and is in good standing (with
respect to jurisdictions that recognize the concept of good standing) as a
foreign corporation or other legal entity in each jurisdiction where the
ownership, leasing or operation of its assets or properties or the conduct of
its business requires such qualification, except where the failure to be so
organized, validly existing, qualified, in good standing or to have such power
or authority is not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably likely to
have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company has made available to
Parent complete and correct copies of the Company's articles of incorporation
and bylaws and the articles and bylaws or comparable organizational and
governing documents of each of the Company's Subsidiaries set forth on Section
5.1(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter (the "Material Subsidiaries"), each as

full force and effect on the date of this Agreement. As used in this
Agreement, the term:

  


 

  

(i) "Affiliate" means, when used with respect to any Person, any other Person
who is an "affiliate" of that Person within the meaning of Rule 405

whole, or (3) the Stuart Weitzman Business, taken as a whole; provided,
however, that none of the following, and no change, event or occurrence
arising out of or resulting from the following, shall constitute or be taken
into account in determining whether a "Company Material Adverse Effect" has
occurred or may, would or could occur:

  


 

  

(A) (1) changes, events or occurrences generally affecting the economy,
credit, financial or capital markets, or regulatory, legislative or political
conditions in the United States or other countries in which the Apparel
Business, the Non-Apparel Business or the Stuart Weitzman Business conduct
operations, including changes in interest and exchange rates or as a result of
a government shutdown, or (2) changes, events or occurrences that are the
result of factors generally affecting the industries in which any of the
Apparel Business, the Non-Apparel Business or the Stuart Weitzman Business
operate or in which any of the products or services of the Apparel Business,
the Non-Apparel Business or the Stuart Weitzman Business are produced,
distributed or sold;

  


 

  

(B) changes or prospective changes in GAAP, applicable regulatory accounting
standards or applicable Law or in the interpretation or enforcement thereof;

international calamity or crisis;

  


 

  

(D) execution, announcement, pendency or performance of this Agreement or the
consummation of the Transactions, including the impact thereof on
relationships, contractual or otherwise, with customers, suppliers,

related thereto;

  


 

  

(E) any litigation arising from allegations of breach of fiduciary duty or
violation of Law relating to this Agreement or the Transactions;

  


 

  

(F) any decline in the market price, or change in trading volume, of any
capital stock or debt securities of the Company (provided that the exception
in this clause (F) shall not prevent or otherwise affect a determination that
any change, event or occurrence underlying such decline has resulted in or
contributed to a Company Material Adverse Effect);

  


 

  

(G) any change in the credit ratings of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
(provided that the exception in this clause (G) shall not prevent or otherwise
affect a determination that any change, event or occurrence underlying such
decline has resulted in or contributed to a Company Material Adverse Effect);

  


 

  

(H) any failure to meet any internal or public projections, forecasts or
estimates of revenue, earnings, cash flow or cash position (provided that the
exception in this clause (H) shall not prevent or otherwise affect a
determination that any change, event or occurrence underlying such failure has
resulted in or contributed to a Company Material Adverse Effect); and

  


 

  

(I) any action taken by the Company or the Company's Subsidiaries that is
required by this Agreement or taken at the express written request or with the

Effect" has occurred to the extent (but only to such extent) such changes have
a materially disproportionate adverse impact on any of (1) the Apparel
Business, taken as a whole, (2) the Non-Apparel Business, taken as a whole, or
(3) the Stuart Weitzman Business, taken as a whole, in each case, relative to
the other participants in the industries in which

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

10  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

the Apparel Business, the Non-Apparel Business or the Stuart Weitzman
Business, as the case may be, conduct their businesses;

  


 

  

(iii) "Subsidiary" means, with respect to any Person, any other Person of

Subsidiaries;

  


 

  

(iv) "Apparel Business" means the business, as conducted by the Company and
its Subsidiaries, of designing, manufacturing, procuring, marketing,
licensing, selling (including through retail and outlet stores, concessions
and e-commerce sites) and distributing sportswear, suits, dresses,

doubt, the Company's Corporate Level Services; and

and 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share (the

outstanding shares of capital stock or other equity securities of each of the
Company's Subsidiaries is duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable and owned by the Company or by a direct or indirect wholly owned
Subsidiary of the Company, free and clear of any lien, charge, pledge,

(iii) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is party to or bound by

understandings relating to the voting or registration of any equity securities
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

  


 

  

(c) Corporate Authority; Approval and Fairness.

  


 

  

(i) The Company has all requisite corporate power and authority to enter into
and has taken all corporate action necessary to execute, deliver and perform
its obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the Merger, subject
only to the affirmative vote (in person or by proxy) of a majority of the
votes cast by the holders of outstanding Shares at the Shareholders Meeting,
or any adjournment or postponement thereof, in favor of the adoption of this
Agreement (the "Company Requisite Vote") and the filing of the Articles of
Merger with the Department of State of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
pursuant to the PBCL. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by
the Company and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery hereof

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

12  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

by Parent and Merger Sub, constitutes a valid and binding obligation of the
Company enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, subject
to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and
similar Laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors'
rights and to general equity principles (the "Bankruptcy and Equity
Exception").

"Company Recommendation"). The Board of Directors of the Company has received
the opinions of Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and Peter J. Solomon Company,
dated the date hereof, in each case to the effect that, based upon and subject
to the assumptions, qualifications and limitations set forth in such opinions,
the Per Share Merger Consideration is fair, from a financial point of view, as
of the date of such opinions, to the holders of Shares. It is agreed and
understood that such opinions are for the benefit of the Board of Directors of
the Company and may not be relied on by Parent or Merger Sub.

13  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

authorizations required to be obtained by the Company from any domestic or
foreign governmental or regulatory body, commission, agency, instrumentality,
authority or other legislative, executive or judicial entity (each, a
"Governmental Entity") in connection with the execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement by the Company and the consummation of the
Merger Transactions, except those that the failure to make or obtain, as the
case may be, is not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably likely to
have a Company Material Adverse Effect or prevent or materially impede the
ability of the Company to consummate the Merger.

  


 

  

(ii) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Company
does not, and the consummation of the Merger will not, constitute or result in
(A) a breach or violation of, or a default under, the articles of
incorporation or bylaws of the Company or any of its Material Subsidiaries or
(B) with or without notice, lapse of time or both, a breach or violation of, a
termination (or right of termination) or default under, the creation or

assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to any Company
Material Contract, or assuming (solely with respect to performance of this

Company or any of its Subsidiaries is subject, except, in the case of clause
(B), for any such breach, violation, termination, default, creation,
acceleration or change that is not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect or prevent or
materially impede the ability of the Company to consummate the Merger.

  


 

  

(e) Company Reports; Financial Statements.

  


 

  

(i) Since January 1, 2011 (the "Applicable Date"), the Company has filed or
furnished, as applicable, on a timely basis (taking into account all
applicable grace periods) all forms, certifications, reports, statements and
documents required to be filed or furnished by it with the SEC pursuant to the
Securities Act and the Exchange Act (such forms, certifications, reports,
statements and documents filed or furnished since the Applicable Date and
those filed or furnished subsequent to the date of this Agreement, including
any amendments thereto, the "Company SEC Reports"). Each of the Company SEC
Reports (including any financial statements or other schedules included
therein), at the time of its filing or being furnished, complied or, if not
yet filed or furnished, will comply in all material respects with the
applicable requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the "Sarbanes-Oxley Act") and any rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder applicable to the Company SEC Reports. As
of their respective dates (or, if amended prior to the date of this Agreement,
as of the date of such amendment), the Company SEC Reports did not, and any
Company SEC Reports filed with or furnished to the SEC subsequent to the date
of this Agreement will not, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state a material fact required to

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

14  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

be stated therein or necessary to make the statements made therein, in light
of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the Company makes no representation or warranty with respect to
statements made or incorporated by reference therein based on information
supplied in writing by or on behalf of Parent, Merger Sub, or any of their
respective Affiliates specifically for inclusion or incorporation by reference
in the Proxy Statement or any Offer Document. As of the date hereof, there are
no material outstanding or unresolved comments received from the SEC with
respect to any of the Company SEC Reports.

  


 

  

(ii) The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures required by Rule
13a-15 or 15d-15 under the Exchange Act. Such disclosure controls and
procedures are reasonably designed to ensure that material information
required to be disclosed by the Company is recorded and reported on a timely
basis to the individuals responsible for the preparation of the Company SEC
Reports. The Company maintains internal control over financial reporting (as
defined in Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15, as applicable, under the Exchange Act). Such
internal control over financial reporting is effective in providing reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with United States
generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP").

  


 

  

(iii) The Company has disclosed, based on the most recent evaluation by its
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer prior to the date hereof,
to the Company's auditors and the audit committee of the Board of Directors of
the Company (A) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the
design or operation of internal control over financial reporting (as defined
in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) which would adversely affect in any
material respect the Company's ability to record, process, summarize and
report financial information and (B) any fraud that involves management or
other employees who have a significant role in the Company's internal control
over financial reporting.

  


 

  

(iv) The Company is in compliance in all material respects with the applicable
provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the applicable listing and corporate
governance rules and regulations of the NYSE.

  


 

  

(v) Each of the consolidated balance sheets included in or incorporated by
reference into the Company SEC Reports (including the related notes and
schedules) fairly presents in all material respects, or, in the case of
Company SEC Reports filed after the date of this Agreement, will fairly
present in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the
Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of its date and each of the
consolidated statements of operations, changes in equity and comprehensive
income (loss) and cash flows included in or incorporated by reference into the
Company SEC Reports (including any related notes and schedules) (such balance
sheets, statements of operations, changes in equity and comprehensive income
(loss) and cash flows, including any related notes and schedules,
collectively, the "Company Financial Statements") fairly

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

15  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

presents in all material respects, or in the case of Company SEC Reports filed
after the date of this Agreement, will fairly present in all material
respects, the results of operations, changes in equity and comprehensive
income (loss) and cash flows, as the case may be, of the Company and its
consolidated Subsidiaries for the periods set forth therein (subject, in the
case of unaudited statements, to notes and year-end adjustments), in each
case, in accordance with GAAP, except as may be noted therein or in the notes
thereto.

  


 

  

(f) Absence of Certain Changes. Since January 1, 2013 through the date of this
Agreement, (i) there has not been any Company Material Adverse Effect, and
(ii) except in connection with this Agreement, the Transactions or as
expressly contemplated or permitted by this Agreement, the Company and each of
its Subsidiaries have conducted their respective businesses in all material
respects in the ordinary course of business.

(i) As of the date of this Agreement, there are no civil, criminal or
administrative actions, suits, claims, hearings, arbitrations, investigations
or other proceedings or investigations, audits or reviews by any Governmental
Entity (excluding those covered by Section 5.1(l)) (collectively, "Actions")
pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened in writing against the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, except those that are not, individually or
in the aggregate, reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect
or prevent or materially impede the ability of the Company to consummate the
Merger.

  


 

  

(ii) As of the date of this Agreement, neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries is a party to or subject to the provisions of any order,
judgment, injunction, award, decree or writ adopted or imposed by, including
any consent decree, settlement agreement or similar written agreement with,
any Governmental Entity (each, an "Order") applicable to the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries except any such Order that is not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect or
prevent or materially impede the ability of the Company to consummate the
Merger.

  


 

  

(iii) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liabilities or
obligations of any nature (whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise)
that would be required to be reflected or reserved against on a consolidated
balance sheet of the Company prepared in accordance with GAAP or the notes
thereto, other than liabilities and obligations (A) set forth or as reflected
or reserved against in the Company's consolidated balance sheets or in the
notes thereto included in the Company SEC Reports filed prior to the date of
this Agreement, (B) incurred since January 1, 2013 in the ordinary course of

material Company Plan, together with the Company's good faith estimate of the
aggregate change in control payments that would be payable to employees of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with a termination of such

benefit plan" within the meaning of Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA"), (B) each stock purchase,

consulting agreement, and (D) each other employee benefit plan, fund, program,
policy, agreement or arrangement; in each case, that is sponsored, maintained
or contributed to or required to be contributed to by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or any trade or business, whether or not incorporated, that
together with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is deemed a "single
employer" under Section 4001(b) of ERISA or Section 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of
the Code (an "ERISA Affiliate") on behalf of any employee, officer, director
or individual consultant of the Company or its Subsidiaries (whether current,
former or retired) or their beneficiaries, or to which the Company or an ERISA
Affiliate is a party, for the benefit of any employee, officer, director or
individual consultant of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (whether
current, former or retired) or their beneficiaries or with respect to which
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has any liability or contingent
liability.

Company Disclosure Letter, the Company has heretofore made available to Parent

funding agreement; (C) the most recent determination letter received from the
Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS") with respect to each such Company Plan
intended to qualify under Section 401 of the Code; (D) if applicable, the most

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

17

all material respects, established, administered, funded and maintained (in
form and operation) in compliance with its terms and applicable Laws,
including, without limitation, ERISA and the Code. Other than with respect to
Multiemployer Plans, each Company Plan that is intended to be "qualified"
within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code is so qualified and has
received a favorable determination letter from the IRS or is entitled to rely
upon a favorable opinion issued by the IRS and, to the Knowledge of the
Company, nothing has occurred, whether by action or by failure to act, that
could reasonably be expected to cause the loss of such qualification. All
payments required by each Company Plan, any collective bargaining agreement or
other agreement, or by Law (including all contributions, insurance premiums or
intercompany charges) with respect to all prior periods have been made or
provided for by the Company or its Subsidiaries in accordance with the
provisions of each of the Company Plans, applicable Law and GAAP. No claim,
suit, investigation, hearing, action, lien, arbitration, dispute or other
proceeding has been asserted, instituted or, to the Knowledge of the Company,
is threatened with respect to any of the Company Plans (other than routine
claims for benefits and appeals of such claims). No Company Plan is under, and
neither the Company nor its Subsidiaries has received any written notice of,
an audit or investigation by the IRS, U.S. Department of Labor or any other
Governmental Entity.

Subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate made, or was required to make,
contributions during the past six years: (i) there does not now exist, nor to
the Knowledge of the Company do any circumstances exist that could reasonably
be expected to result in, any violation of the minimum funding standards under
Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA, whether or not waived, or any
liability under Section 4971 of the Code; (ii) no reportable event within the
meaning of Section 4043(c) of ERISA for which the 30-day notice requirement
has not been waived has occurred, and to the Knowledge of the Company the
consummation of the Merger is not reasonably likely to result in the
occurrence of any such reportable event; (iii) all material premiums to the
Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation have been timely paid in full; (iv) no
material liability or contingent liability (including liability pursuant to
Section 4069 of ERISA and under Title IV of ERISA) has been or is reasonably

Affiliate; (v) the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation has not instituted
proceedings to terminate any such plan

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

18  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

and, to the Knowledge of the Company, no condition exists that presents a risk
that such proceedings will be instituted or which would constitute grounds
under Section 4042 of ERISA for the termination of, or the appointment of a
trustee to administer, such plan; and (vi) no material tax or penalty
resulting from a prohibited transaction as defined in Section 406 of ERISA or
Section 4975 of the Code has been incurred.

  


 

  

(v) No Company Plan provides benefits or coverage in the nature of health,
life or disability insurance following retirement or other termination of
employment to any employee, officer, director or individual consultant of the
Company or its Subsidiaries (whether current, former or retired) or their
beneficiaries, other than pursuant to Part 6 of Title I of ERISA or Section
4980B of the Code, and/or any similar state or local Law or any foreign Law.

  


 

  

(vi) Each Company Plan that is mandated by a government other than the United
States or subject to the Laws of a jurisdiction outside of the United States
has been maintained and operated in all material respects in accordance with
all applicable plan documents and all applicable local Laws.

  


 

  

(vii) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the
consummation of the Merger could, either alone or in combination with another
event, (A) result in any payment or benefit becoming due or payable, or
required to be provided, to any current or former employee, director or
officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or result in severance pay
or any material increase in severance pay (other than severance pay required
by any Law) to any current or former employee, director or officer of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (B) accelerate the time of payment,
vesting or funding, or materially increase the amount or value of any benefit
or compensation otherwise payable or required to be provided to any such
employee, director or officer or (C) obligate the Company or any Subsidiary to
make the payment of any amount or provide any benefit that could, individually
or in combination with any other such payment, constitute an "excess parachute
payment" as defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code. Neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries has any indemnity obligation on or after the date of
this Agreement for any Taxes imposed under Section 4999 or 409A of the Code.
To the Knowledge of the Company, no amounts previously deducted under Section
162(m) of the Code are subject to disallowance.

(i) The businesses of each of the Company and its Subsidiaries have not been
since the Applicable Date, and are not being, conducted in violation of any
Laws or Orders of any Governmental Entity, and, since the Applicable Date,
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has been given written notice
of, or been charged with, any violation of any Law of any Governmental Entity,
except, in each case, for any such violation that is not, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.
The

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

19  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

Company and its Subsidiaries have all authorizations, licenses, franchises,
consents, certificates, registrations, approvals or other permits of any
Governmental Entity necessary to conduct their businesses as currently
conducted (each, a "Permit") except any such Permit the absence of which, is
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably likely to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect. This Section 5.1(i)(i) does not relate to the Company
SEC Reports, financial statements or disclosure controls and procedures or
internal controls, which are the subject of Section 5.1(e), employee benefits,
which are the subject of Section 5.1(h), environmental matters, which are the
subject of Section 5.1(k) or tax matters, which are the subject of Section
5.1(l).

  


 

  

(ii) To the Company's Knowledge, neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has at any time during the past three years committed any knowing
and willful violation of U.S. Laws governing international business
activities, including export control laws, trade and economic sanctions, or
the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended (the "FCPA"), except for
violations that, individually or in the aggregate, are not reasonably likely
to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company and its Subsidiaries
(A) keep books, records, and accounts that accurately and fairly reflect in
all material respects transactions and the distribution of the Company's and
the Subsidiaries' assets, and maintain a system of internal accounting
controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that transactions are
properly recorded in accordance with the FCPA and (B) the Company and its
Subsidiaries have disclosure controls and procedures and an internal
accounting controls system that is sufficient to provide reasonable assurances
that violations of the FCPA will be prevented, detected and deterred except
for such failures in each of (A) and (B) as would not, individually or in the
aggregate, be reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

  


 

  

(j) Takeover Statutes; No Rights Agreement.

  


 

  

(i) Assuming the representations and warranties of Parent and Merger Sub set
forth in Section 5.2(i) are true and correct, the approval by the Board of
Directors of the Company referred to in Section 5.1(c)(ii) constitutes the
only action necessary to render inapplicable to this Agreement and the Merger
(i) the restrictions on transactions with "interested shareholders" (as
defined in Section 2538 of the PBCL) set forth in Section 2538 of the PBCL and
(ii) the restrictions on "business combinations" (as defined in Section 2554
of the PBCL) set forth in Subchapter F of Chapter 25 of the PBCL, in each
case, to the extent, if any, such restrictions would otherwise be applicable
to this Agreement or the Merger. Assuming the representations and warranties
of Parent and Merger Sub set forth in Section 5.2(i) are true and correct, no

of the date hereof, of the out-of-pocket fees it

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

29  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

will incur to Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and Peter J. Solomon Company in
connection with this Agreement and the Transactions. The fees and expenses of
any legal or accounting service providers retained by the Company or any of

connection with this Agreement or the Transactions will not exceed the fees
and expenses set forth in Section 5.1(r) of the Company Disclosure Letter.

  


 

  

(s) No Other Parent or Merger Sub Representations or Warranties. Except for
the representations and warranties set forth in Section 5.2, the Guarantee and
the Financing Commitments, the Company hereby acknowledges and agrees that
neither Parent nor Merger Sub nor any of their respective Subsidiaries, nor
any of their respective shareholders, directors, officers, employees,
Affiliates, advisors, agents or representatives, nor any other Person, has
made or is making any other express or implied representation or warranty with
respect to Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective Subsidiaries or
their respective business or operations, including with respect to any
information provided, disclosed or delivered to the Company.

  


 

  

SECTION 5.2. Representations and Warranties of Parent and Merger Sub. Except
as set forth in the corresponding sections or subsections of the Disclosure
Letter delivered to the Company by Parent prior to or simultaneously with
entering into this Agreement (the "Parent Disclosure Letter") (it being agreed
that disclosure of any item in any section or subsection of the Parent
Disclosure Letter shall be deemed disclosure with respect to any other section
or subsection to which the relevance of such item is reasonably apparent),
Parent and Merger Sub each hereby represent and warrant to the Company that:

  


 

  

(a) Organization, Good Standing and Qualification. Each of Parent and Merger
Sub is a legal entity duly organized, validly existing and in good standing
(with respect to jurisdictions that recognize the concept of good standing)
under the Laws of the jurisdiction of its organization and has all requisite
corporate or similar power and authority to own, lease and operate its
properties and assets and to carry on its business as currently conducted and
is qualified to do business and is in good standing (with respect to
jurisdictions that recognize the concept of good standing) as a foreign
limited liability company, corporation or other legal entity in each
jurisdiction where the ownership, leasing or operation of its assets or
properties or conduct of its business requires such qualification, except
where any such failure to be so organized, validly existing, qualified, in
good standing or to have such power or authority is not, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably likely to prevent or materially impede the ability
of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the Merger or the other Transactions.
Parent has made available to the Company complete and correct copies of the
certificate of formation, articles of incorporation, limited liability company
agreement and bylaws or comparable governing documents of each of Parent and
Merger Sub, each as amended to the date of this Agreement, and each as so made
available is in full force and effect.

  


 

  

(b) Authority. The Board of Managers of Parent and the Board of Directors of
Merger Sub have approved this Agreement, the Merger and the other

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

30  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

Transactions. No vote of holders of capital stock of Parent is necessary to
approve this Agreement, the Merger or the other Transactions. Each of Parent
and Merger Sub has all requisite corporate or similar power and authority to
enter into and has taken all corporate or similar action necessary to execute,
deliver and perform its obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the
Merger and the other Transactions. This Agreement has been duly executed and
delivered by each of Parent and Merger Sub and, assuming the due
authorization, execution and delivery hereof by the Company, constitutes a
valid and binding obligation of Parent and Merger Sub enforceable against each
of Parent and Merger Sub in accordance with its terms, subject to the
Bankruptcy and Equity Exception.

  


 

  

(c) Governmental Filings; No Violations; Etc.

  


 

  

(i) Except for (A) compliance with, and filings under, the HSR Act, as
amended, and the rules and regulations thereunder; (B) compliance with, and
filings under, the Exchange Act and the Securities Act and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder, including the filing with the SEC of the
Proxy Statement; (C) the filing of the Articles of Merger and other
appropriate merger documents required by the PBCL with the Department of State
of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, (D) compliance with the applicable
requirements of the NYSE and (E) such other items as disclosed on Section
5.1(c)(i) of the Parent Disclosure Letter (the items set forth above in
clauses (A) through (E), the "Parent Required Governmental Approvals"), no
notices, reports or other filings are required to be made by Parent or Merger
Sub with, nor are any consents, registrations, approvals, permits or
authorizations required to be obtained by Parent or Merger Sub from any
Governmental Entity in connection with the execution, delivery and performance
of this Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub or the consummation of the Merger
and the other Transactions, other than such items that the failure to make or
obtain, as the case may be, is not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably likely to prevent or materially impede the consummation of the
Merger or the other Transactions.

  


 

  

(ii) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by each of
Parent and Merger Sub does not, and the consummation of the Merger and the
other Transactions will not, constitute or result in (A) a breach or violation
of, or a default under, the respective articles of incorporation, bylaws or
comparable governing documents of Parent or Merger Sub; (B) with or without
notice, lapse of time or both, a breach or violation of, a termination (or
right of termination) or default under, the creation or acceleration of any of
their respective obligations under or the creation of a Lien on any of the
assets of Parent or Merger Sub pursuant to any Contract binding upon Parent or
Merger Sub, or, assuming (solely with respect to performance of this Agreement
and consummation of the Merger and the other Transactions) compliance with the
matters referred to in Section 5.2(c)(i), under any Law to which Parent or
Merger Sub is subject; or (C) any change in the rights or obligations of any
party under any Contract binding upon Parent or Merger Sub, except, in the
case of clause (B) or (C) above, for any such breach, violation, termination,
default, creation,

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

31  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

acceleration or change that is not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably likely to prevent or materially impede the consummation of the
Merger or the other Transactions.

  


 

  

(d) Litigation. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no Actions
pending, or to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened against Parent or Merger
Sub that seek to enjoin, or would reasonably be expected to have the effect of
preventing, making illegal, or otherwise interfering with, any of the
Transactions, except those that, individually or in the aggregate, are not
reasonably likely to prevent or materially impede the ability of Parent and
Merger Sub to consummate the Merger or the other Transactions.

  


 

  

(e) Financing; Available Funds. Parent has delivered to the Company true,
complete and correct copies of (i) the commitment letters and other side
letter agreements, each dated as of the date hereof, from the financial
institutions and other Persons (including each agent and arranger) (together
with any other Persons (other than Parent or any of its Affiliates) that
otherwise have entered into or will enter into agreements in connection with
the Debt Financing or debt or other financing in connection with the
Transactions, collectively, the "Financing Sources", which term shall, for the
avoidance of doubt, include the financial institutions and other Persons
providing the debt or other financing for the Carveout Transactions, together
with their Affiliates, officers, directors, employees and representatives)
identified therein (such letters, as may be amended, modified or restated to
the extent permitted hereunder, the "Debt Financing Commitments"), pursuant to
which the lenders (and certain of their Affiliates) and other Persons party
thereto have committed, severally and not jointly, subject to the terms and
conditions set forth therein, to lend or contribute the amounts set forth
therein for the purposes of financing the Transactions (including funding of
the Exchange Fund) and related fees and expenses and the refinancing of
certain outstanding Indebtedness of the Company (the "Debt Financing") and
(ii) the equity commitment letter, dated as of the date hereof, from each of
Sycamore Partners, L.P. and Sycamore Partners A, L.P. (collectively, the
"Equity Provider"), pursuant to which the Equity Provider has committed,
subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, to invest in Parent
(and its Affiliates specified therein, for purposes of providing the equity
funding for the Carveout Transactions) the cash amount (the "Equity Financing"
and, together with the Debt Financing, the "Financing") set forth therein
(such letter, the "Equity Financing Commitment" and, together with the Debt
Financing Commitments, the "Financing Commitments"). None of the Financing
Commitments has been amended or modified prior to the date of this Agreement,
no such amendment or modification is contemplated and as of the date hereof,
the respective commitments contained in the Financing Commitments have not
been withdrawn, terminated or rescinded in any respect. Except for fee letters
relating to fees with respect to the Debt Financing (complete copies of which
have been provided to the Company, with only fee, the "Securities Demand",
flex and certain other economic terms redacted (the "Redacted Fee Letter"),
provided that such redactions do not relate to any terms that would adversely
affect the conditionality, enforceability, availability, termination or
aggregate principal amount of the Debt Financing), as of the date of this
Agreement there are no side letters or other Contracts or understandings
related to the funding or investing, as applicable, of

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

32  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

the Financing other than the Financing Commitments delivered to the Company
prior to the date of this Agreement (other than any customary engagement
letter that does not impact the conditionality or amount of the Debt
Financing). Parent has fully paid any and all commitment fees or other fees in
connection with the Financing Commitments that are payable on or prior to the
date of this Agreement and, as of the date hereof, the Financing Commitments
are in full force and effect and are legal, valid, binding and enforceable
obligations of Parent, Merger Sub or the Affiliates of Parent and Merger Sub,
in each case to the extent party thereto, as applicable, and, to the Knowledge
of Parent and Merger Sub, each of the other parties thereto. There are no
conditions precedent or other contingencies related to the funding of the full
amount of the Financing, other than as expressly set forth in or expressly
contemplated by the Financing Commitments. As of the date hereof, assuming the
accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in
Section 5.1 in all material respects, no event has occurred which, with or
without notice, lapse of time or both, would or would reasonably be expected
to constitute a default or breach on the part of Parent, Merger Sub or the
Affiliates of Parent or Merger Sub party thereto or, to the Knowledge of
Parent and Merger Sub, any other party thereto under any of the Financing
Commitments. As of the date hereof, assuming the accuracy of the
representations and warranties of the Company set forth in Section 5.1(b)(i)
(other than such inaccuracies as are de minimis relative to Section 5.1(b)(i)
taken as a whole), Parent has no reason to believe that any of the conditions
to the Financing contemplated by the Financing Commitments will not be
satisfied or the Financing will not be available at the Closing. Assuming (w)
the commitments contained in the Financing Commitments are funded in
accordance with their terms (after giving effect to the flex provisions), (x)
the accuracy of the representations and warranties set forth in Section
5.1(b)(i) (other than such inaccuracies as are de minimis relative to Section
5.1(b)(i) taken as a whole) and (y) the performance in all material respects
by the Company of its obligations under this Agreement, Parent and Merger Sub
will have at and after the Closing funds sufficient to (i) pay the aggregate
Per Share Merger Consideration, (ii) pay any and all fees and expenses
required to be paid by Parent, Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation in
connection with the Merger and the Financing, (iii) pay for any refinancing of
any outstanding Indebtedness of the Company contemplated by this Agreement or
the Financing Commitments and (iv) satisfy all of the other payment
obligations of Parent, Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation contemplated
hereunder.

  


 

  

(f) Guarantee. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, Parent has
delivered to the Company the Guarantee duly executed by the Guarantors in
favor of the Company. The Guarantee is in full force and effect and
constitutes a valid and binding obligation of each Guarantor, enforceable
against each Guarantor and no event has occurred, which, with or without
notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a default on the part of
either Guarantor under the Guarantee.

  


 

  

(g) Capitalization. The authorized capital stock of Merger Sub consists solely
of 1,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, all of which are
validly issued and outstanding. All of the issued and outstanding capital
stock of Merger Sub is, and at the Effective Time will be, owned by Parent
free and clear of all Liens. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub has conducted any
business prior to the date of

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

33  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

this Agreement and neither Parent nor Merger Sub has any, and prior to the
Effective Time will not have any, assets, liabilities or obligations of any
nature other than those as may be incident to their formation and pursuant to
this Agreement, the Merger and the other Transactions. Merger Sub does not
have outstanding any option, warrant, right or any other agreement pursuant to
which any Person other than Parent may acquire any equity security of Merger
Sub.

  


 

  

(h) Brokers. No agent, broker, finder or investment banker is entitled to any
brokerage, finder's or other fee or commission in connection with the
Transactions based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of Parent or Merger
Sub for which the Company could have any liability in a circumstance where the
Merger is not consummated.

  


 

  

(i) Ownership of Shares. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub nor any of their
"affiliates" or "associates" is, and at no time during the last five years has
been, an "interested shareholder" of the Company, as such quoted terms are
defined in Sections 2538, 2552 and 2553 of the PBCL. Neither Parent nor Merger
Sub nor any of their "affiliates" or "associates" "beneficially owns" any
shares of capital stock of the Company, as such quoted terms are defined in
Section 2552 of the PBCL. As of the date of this Agreement, none of Parent,
Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates beneficially own (as used in
this Agreement, "beneficial ownership" means beneficial ownership as
determined pursuant to Rule 13d-3 and Rule 13d-5 under the Exchange Act) any
Shares.

  


 

  

(j) Absence of Certain Agreements. Except for the Voting Agreements, neither
Parent nor any of its Affiliates has entered into any agreement, arrangement
or understanding (in each case, whether oral or written), or authorized,
committed or agreed to enter into any agreement, arrangement or understanding
(in each case, whether oral or written), pursuant to which: (i) (A) any
shareholder of the Company (other than Parent and its Affiliates) would be
entitled to receive value or consideration of a different amount or nature
than the Per Share Merger Consideration, (B) any shareholder of the Company
agrees to vote to adopt this Agreement or the Merger or any shareholder of the
Company agrees to vote against any Superior Proposal; or (ii) any current
employee of the Company has agreed to (x) remain as an employee of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries following the Effective Time (other than pursuant
to any employment Contracts in effect as of the date of this Agreement), (y)
contribute or rollover any portion of such employee's Shares and/or Restricted
Shares to the Company or its Subsidiaries or either Guarantor, Parent or any
of their respective Affiliates or (z) receive any capital stock or equity
securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or either Guarantor,
Parent or any of their respective Affiliates; provided that, notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, Parent and its Affiliates may, from and after
the date of this Agreement, enter customary agreements, arrangements and
understandings with employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of the
nature described in clause (ii) above.

  


 

  

(k) Solvency. Assuming (i) the accuracy of the representations and warranties
of the Company set forth in Section 5.1(e) and (ii) the satisfaction of the

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

34  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

conditions to Parent's obligation to consummate the Merger, or waiver of such
conditions, and after giving effect to the Transactions, including the payment
of the aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration, any other repayment or
refinancing of debt contemplated in this Agreement or the Financing
Commitments, payment of all amounts required to be paid in connection with the
consummation of the Merger and the other Transactions, and payment of all
related fees and expenses, each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation will
be Solvent as of the Effective Time and immediately after the consummation of
the Merger and the other Transactions. For the purposes of this Agreement, the
term "Solvent", when used with respect to any Person, means that, as of any
date of determination, (a) the amount of the "fair saleable value" of the
assets of such Person will, as of such date, exceed the sum of (i) the value
of all "liabilities of such Person, including contingent and other
liabilities," as of such date, as such quoted terms are generally determined
in accordance with applicable Laws governing determinations of the insolvency
of debtors, and (ii) the amount that will be required to pay the probable
liabilities of such Person, as of such date, on its existing debts (including
contingent and other liabilities) as such debts become absolute and mature,
(b) such Person will not have, as of such date, an unreasonably small amount
of capital for the operation of the businesses in which it is engaged or
proposed to be engaged following such date, (c) such Person will be able to
pay its liabilities, as of such date, including contingent and other
liabilities, as they mature, and (d) such Person is not insolvent under
Section 5102 of the Pennsylvania Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act as of such
date. For purposes of this definition, "not have an unreasonably small amount
of capital for the operation of the businesses in which it is engaged or
proposed to be engaged" and "able to pay its liabilities, as of such date,
including contingent and other liabilities, as they mature" means that such
Person will be able to generate enough cash from operations, asset
dispositions or refinancing, or a combination thereof, to meet its obligations
as they become due.

  


 

  

(l) No Other Company Representations or Warranties. Except for the
representations and warranties set forth in Section 5.1, Parent and Merger Sub
hereby acknowledge and agree that neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries, nor any of their respective shareholders, directors, officers,
employees, Affiliates, advisors, agents or representatives, nor any other
Person, has made or is making any other express or implied representation or
warranty with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or their
respective business or operations, including with respect to any information
provided, disclosed or delivered to Parent or Merger Sub. Neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor any of their respective shareholders,
directors, officers, employees, Affiliates, advisors, agents or
representatives, nor any other Person, will have or be subject to any
liability or indemnification obligation to Parent, Merger Sub or any other
Person resulting from the delivery, dissemination or any other distribution to
Parent, Merger Sub or any other Person, or the use by Parent, Merger Sub or
any other Person, of any such information provided or made available to them
by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or any of their respective
shareholders, directors, officers, employees, Affiliates, advisors, agents or
representatives, or any other Person, including any information, documents,
estimates, projections, forecasts or other forward-looking information,
business plans, cost-related plans or other material provided or made
available to Parent, Merger Sub or any other Person in certain "data rooms,"
confidential

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

35  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

information memoranda, management presentations or due diligence discussions
in anticipation or contemplation of any of the Transactions.

  


 

  

(m) Non-Reliance on Company Estimates, Projections, Forecasts, Forward-Looking
Statements and Business Plans. In connection with the due diligence
investigation of the Company by Parent and Merger Sub, Parent and Merger Sub
have received and may continue to receive from the Company certain estimates,
projections, forecasts and other forward-looking information, as well as
certain business plan and cost-related plan information, regarding the
Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective businesses and operations,
including with respect to any information provided, disclosed, delivered or
made available to Parent or Merger Sub. Parent and Merger Sub hereby
acknowledge that there are uncertainties inherent in attempting to make such
estimates, projections, forecasts and other forward-looking statements, as
well as in such business plans and cost-related plans, with which Parent and
Merger Sub are familiar, that Parent and Merger Sub are taking full
responsibility for making their own evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of
all estimates, projections, forecasts and other forward-looking information,
as well as such business plans and cost-related plans, so furnished to them
(including the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such estimates,
projections, forecasts, forward-looking information, business plans or cost-
related plans), and that Parent and Merger Sub will have no claim against the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or any of their respective shareholders,
directors, officers, employees, Affiliates, advisors, agents or
representatives, or any other Person, with respect thereto. Accordingly,
Parent and Merger Sub hereby acknowledge that none of the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries, nor any of their respective shareholders, directors,
officers, employees, Affiliates, advisors, agents or representatives, nor any
other Person, has made or is making any representation or warranty with
respect to such estimates, projections, forecasts, forward-looking statements,
business plans or cost-related plans (including the reasonableness of the
assumptions underlying such estimates, projections, forecasts, forward-looking
statements, business plans or cost-related plans).

of it or its Subsidiaries shall, and that it shall instruct and use its
reasonable best efforts to cause its and its Subsidiaries' employees,
investment bankers, attorneys, accountants and other advisors or
representatives (such directors, officers, employees, investment bankers,
attorneys, accountants and other advisors or representatives, collectively,
"Representatives") not to, directly or indirectly:

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

42  

  

 

 

 

  


 

  

(A) initiate, solicit or knowingly encourage any inquiries or the making of
any proposal or offer that constitutes an Acquisition Proposal;

  


 

  

(B) engage in, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or
negotiations regarding, or provide any non-public information or data to any
Person relating to, any Acquisition Proposal, except to notify such Person of
the existence of this Section 6.2;

  


 

  

(C) enter into any agreement or agreement in principle with respect to any

waived in accordance with the following paragraph; or

  


 

  

(E) otherwise knowingly facilitate any effort or attempt by any Person to make
an Acquisition Proposal.

  


 

  

The Company and its Subsidiaries shall, and shall cause its and its

cease immediately any discussions or negotiations, if any, with any Person
(other than Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Representatives) conducted
prior to the date of this Agreement with respect to any Acquisition Proposal
and shall promptly request that any such Person in possession of confidential
information about the Company that was furnished by or on behalf of the
Company return or destroy all such information in accordance with the terms of
the confidentiality agreement with such Person. Notwithstanding the foregoing
or anything in this Agreement to the contrary, each of the parties hereto
hereby acknowledges and agrees that any provision included in a
confidentiality agreement between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and a
third party in effect on the date hereof that restricts the ability of such
third party to make a non-public Acquisition Proposal to the Company regarding
a potential transaction between such third party and the Company shall be
deemed waived by the Company or such Subsidiary party thereto effective upon
execution of this Agreement.

  


 

  

(ii) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, prior to the

the Company and its Representatives may (A) contact such Person to clarify the
terms and conditions thereof; (B) provide information (including non-

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

43  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

public information concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries) in response to
a request therefor by such Person if the Company receives from such Person an
executed confidentiality agreement on terms not more favorable to such Person
in any material respect than the terms contained in the Confidentiality
Agreement (it being understood that such confidentiality agreement need not
include a standstill provision); provided that the Company shall promptly (and
in any event within 24 hours) make available to Parent any material non-public
information concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries that the Company made
available to any Person given such access which was not previously made
available to Parent; (C) engage or participate in any discussions or
negotiations with such Person; and (D) after having complied with Section
6.2(c), approve, recommend, or otherwise declare advisable or propose to

referred to in clause (B) or (C) above, the Board of Directors of the Company
or any committee thereof has determined in good faith based on the information
then available and after consultation with its financial advisor that such
Acquisition Proposal either constitutes a Superior Proposal or could
reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal, and (y) in the case
referred to in clause (D) above, the Board of Directors of the Company or any
committee thereof determines in good faith after consultation with its
financial advisor that such Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal.

  


 

  

(b) For the purposes of this Agreement:

  


 

  

(i) "Acquisition Proposal" means (A) any proposal or offer with respect to a
merger, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, reorganization
or similar transaction involving the Company and/or any of its Subsidiaries or
(B) any acquisition by any Person resulting in, or proposal or offer to
acquire by tender offer, share exchange, stock or asset purchase or in any
other manner, which in each of clauses (A) and (B) above, if consummated,
would result in any Person or group of Persons acting in concert becoming the
beneficial owner of, directly or indirectly, in one or a series of related
transactions, (1) 25% or more of the total voting power of the Company or (2)
25% or more of the consolidated total assets measured by fair market value
(including equity securities of its Subsidiaries), of the Company.

  


 

  

(ii) "Superior Proposal" means a bona fide Acquisition Proposal (with the
percentages set forth in the definition of such term in subsections (1) and
(2) thereof changed from 25% to 50%) that the Board of Directors of the
Company or any committee thereof has determined in its good faith judgment,
after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, (A)
is reasonably likely to be consummated in accordance with its terms, and (B)
if consummated, would result in a transaction more favorable to the Company's
shareholders from a financial point of view than the Merger, in the case of
clauses (A) and (B), after taking into account all legal, financial and
regulatory aspects of the proposal and the Person making the proposal
(including the financing thereof).

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

44  

  

 

 

 

  


 

  

(c) No Change of Recommendation or Alternative Acquisition Agreement. (i) The
Board of Directors of the Company and each committee thereof shall not:

  


 

  

(A) (i) withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify (or publicly propose or resolve
to withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify), in a manner adverse to Parent, the
Company Recommendation with respect to the Merger or (ii) approve, recommend
or otherwise declare advisable or propose to approve, recommend or otherwise
declare advisable or resolve to approve, recommend or otherwise declare
advisable (publicly or otherwise), any Acquisition Proposal (it being
understood that the Board of Directors of the Company may make a customary
"stop, look and listen" communication and may elect to take no position with
respect to an Acquisition Proposal until the close of business as of the 10th
Business Day after the commencement of such Acquisition Proposal pursuant to
Rule 14d-9(f) or Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange Act without such action being
considered an adverse modification); or

  


 

  

(B) except as expressly permitted by Section 8.3(a), cause or permit the
Company to enter into any letter of intent, acquisition agreement, merger
agreement or similar definitive agreement (other than a confidentiality
agreement referred to in Section 6.2(a)(ii)) (an "Alternative Acquisition
Agreement") relating to any Acquisition Proposal.

  


 

  

(ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
prior to the time, but not after, the Company Requisite Vote is obtained, the
Board of Directors of the Company and any committee thereof may (A) withhold,
withdraw, qualify or modify the Company Recommendation or (B) approve,
recommend or otherwise declare advisable or propose to approve, recommend or
otherwise declare advisable or resolve to approve, recommend or otherwise
declare advisable any Acquisition Proposal that the Board of Directors of the
Company or any committee thereof determines in good faith is a Superior
Proposal made after the date of this Agreement (any action described in
clauses (A) or (B), a "Change of Recommendation"), and thereafter may also
take action pursuant to Section 8.3(a); provided, however, that (1) in the
case of clause (A) where such action is not taken in response to an
Acquisition Proposal, the Board of Directors of the Company or any committee
thereof shall have first determined in good faith, after consultation with
outside counsel, that such action could be required by the directors'
fiduciary duties under applicable Law and (2) the Company shall not effect a
Change of Recommendation in connection with an Acquisition Proposal or take
any action pursuant to Section 8.3(a) with respect to an Acquisition Proposal
unless and until (x) the Company notifies Parent in writing, at least three
Business Days in advance, that the Company's Board of Directors intends to
effect a Change of Recommendation in connection with an Acquisition Proposal
that is a Superior Proposal or to take action pursuant to Section 8.3(a) with
respect to an Acquisition Proposal that is a Superior Proposal, in either case
subject only to compliance with this clause (2), which notice shall

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

45  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

specify the identity of the party who made such Superior Proposal and all of
the material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal and shall attach
the agreement and all material related documentation providing for such
Superior Proposal; (y) after providing such notice and prior to making such
Change of Recommendation in connection with a Superior Proposal or taking any
action pursuant to Section 8.3(a) with respect to a Superior Proposal, the
Company shall negotiate in good faith with Parent during such three Business
Day period (to the extent that Parent desires to negotiate) to make such
revisions to the terms of this Agreement, the Financing Commitments and the
Guarantee such that it would cause such Superior Proposal to no longer
constitute a Superior Proposal; and (z) the Board of Directors of the Company
shall have considered in good faith any changes to this Agreement, the
Financing Commitments and the Guarantee offered in writing by Parent in a
manner that would form a binding contract if accepted by the Company and shall
have determined in good faith that the Superior Proposal would continue to
constitute a Superior Proposal if such changes offered in writing by Parent
were to be given effect; provided that in the event the Acquisition Proposal
is thereafter modified by the party making such Acquisition Proposal, the
Company shall notify Parent in writing of such modified Acquisition Proposal
and shall again comply with this Section 6.2(c), except that the Company's
advance written notice obligation shall be reduced to two Business Days
(rather than the three Business Days otherwise contemplated by this Section
6.2(c)) and the time the Company shall be permitted to effect a Change of
Recommendation in connection with a Superior Proposal shall be reduced to the
time that is two Business Days after it has provided such written notice
(rather than the time that is the three Business Days otherwise contemplated
by this Section 6.2(c)).

  


 

  

(d) Certain Permitted Disclosure. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall
prohibit the Company or the Board of Directors of the Company or any committee
thereof from (i) complying with its disclosure obligations under United States
federal or state Law with regard to an Acquisition Proposal, including taking
and disclosing to its shareholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9,
14e-2(a) or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act
(or any similar communication to shareholders), (ii) making any "stop-look-
and-listen" communication to the shareholders of the Company pursuant to Rule
14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar communications to
the shareholders of the Company) or (iii) making any disclosure to the
Company's shareholders that is required by Law; provided, however, that the
Board of Directors of the Company or any committee thereof shall not make a
Change of Recommendation except in accordance with Section 6.2(c).

  


 

  

(e) Notice. The Company agrees that it will promptly (and, in any event,
within 24 hours) notify Parent if any proposals or offers with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal are received by, any non-public information in connection
with a potential Acquisition Proposal is requested from, or any discussions or
negotiations in connection with a potential Acquisition Proposal are sought to
be initiated or continued with, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any

court or Governmental Entity with jurisdiction over enforcement of any
applicable Antitrust Law (a "Governmental Antitrust Entity") non-privileged
information and documents requested by any such Governmental Antitrust Entity
in connection with obtaining any such approval of such Governmental Antitrust
Entity that is necessary, proper or advisable to permit consummation of the
Merger and the other Transactions;

  


 

  

(C) to use reasonable best efforts to take, and to cause each of its
Subsidiaries to take, any and all actions reasonably necessary to obtain any

49  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

any Antitrust Law, enable all waiting periods under any Antitrust Law to
expire and avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under any Antitrust
Law asserted by any Governmental Entity, in each case, to enable the Merger

(ii) In furtherance and not in limitation of the undertakings pursuant to this
Section 6.5, if any objections are asserted with respect to the Transactions
under any Law or if any Action is instituted (or threatened to be instituted)
by the Federal Trade Commission, the Department of Justice or any other
applicable Governmental Entity or any private party challenging any of the
Transactions as violative of any Law or which would reasonably be expected to
result in any of the conditions to the Merger set forth in Article VII not
being satisfied or that would reasonably be expected to prevent or materially
impede the consummation of the Merger or the other Transactions, each of
Parent and the Company and their respective Affiliates shall use their
respective reasonable best efforts to contest, resist and resolve any such
objections or Actions, and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any
Order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that
prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the Merger or the other
Transactions so as to permit consummation of the Transactions.

  


 

  

(iii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall take, and cause its
Affiliates to take, any and all actions necessary to obtain any consents,
clearances or approvals required under or in connection with any Antitrust
Law, and to enable all waiting periods under any Antitrust Law to expire, and

the other Transactions, including (A) promptly complying with or modifying any
requests for additional information (including any second request) by any
Governmental Entity; (B) subject to Section 6.5(e)(iv), if necessary to obtain

therein of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or pre-Closing Affiliates
and (C) contesting, defending and appealing any threatened or pending
preliminary or permanent injunction or other order, decree or ruling or
statute, rule, regulation or executive order that would adversely affect the
ability of any party to consummate the Merger or the other Transactions

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

50  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

and taking any and all other actions to prevent the entry, enactment or
promulgation thereof.

  


 

  

(iv) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 6.5, neither
this Section 6.5, nor the "reasonable best efforts" standard shall require, or
be construed to require, in order to obtain any required consent, clearance or
approval from any Governmental Entity or otherwise, Parent, the Company or any
of their respective Affiliates (the "Covered Parties") to (A) sell, lease,
license, transfer, dispose of, divest or otherwise encumber, or hold separate,
or propose, negotiate or offer to effect, or consent or commit to, any sale,
leasing, licensing, transfer, disposal, divestiture or other encumbrance, or
holding separate, before or after the Effective Time, of any assets, licenses,
operations, rights, product lines, businesses or interest therein of any of
the Covered Parties or (B) take or agree to take any other action or agree or
consent to any limitations or restrictions on freedom of actions with respect
to, or its ability to retain, or make changes in, any such assets, licenses,
operations, rights, product lines, businesses or interest therein of any of
the Covered Parties; except, solely in the case of any such actions listed in
subsections (A) and (B) above to the extent solely relating to the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or pre-Closing Affiliates with respect to their
respective businesses, if such action listed in subsections (A) or (B) above
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
material adverse effect on any of the Nine West Business, taken as a whole,
the Jones Apparel Business, taken as a whole, the Stuart Weitzman Business,
taken as a whole, the Jeanswear Business, taken as a whole, or the Kurt Geiger
Business, taken as a whole.

party has consented in advance to such withdrawal and refiling. Nothing in
this Agreement shall require the Company or its Affiliates, or Parent, Merger
Sub and their respective Affiliates, to take or agree to take any action with
respect to its business or operations unless the effectiveness of such
agreement or action is conditioned upon the Closing.

  


 

  

(vi) For purposes of this Agreement, "Antitrust Law" means the Sherman Act,
the Clayton Act, the HSR Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act and all other
Laws that are designed or intended to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions
having the purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint of trade or
lessening of competition through merger or acquisition.

  


 

  

SECTION 6.6. Access and Reports. (a) Subject to applicable Law, upon
reasonable notice, the Company shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to)
afford Parent's officers and other authorized representatives (including the
Financing Sources) reasonable access, during normal business hours throughout
the period prior to the Effective Time, to its employees, properties, books,
Contracts and records, and, during such period, the Company shall (and shall
cause its Subsidiaries to) furnish promptly to Parent all information
concerning its business, properties and personnel as may

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

51  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

reasonably be requested. All requests for information made pursuant to this
Section 6.6 shall be directed to the executive officer or other persons
designated by the Company. All such information shall be governed by the terms
of the Confidentiality Agreement. No investigation pursuant to this Section
6.6 or by Parent or its Representatives at any time prior to or following the
date of this Agreement shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation
or warranty made by the Company herein.

  


 

  

(b) This Section 6.6 shall not require the Company or its Subsidiaries to
permit any access, or to disclose (i) any information that, in the reasonable,
good faith judgment (after consultation with counsel, which may be in-house
counsel) of the Company, is reasonably likely to result in any violation of
any Law or any Contract to which the Company or its Subsidiaries is a party or
cause any privilege (including attorney-client privilege) that the Company or
its Subsidiaries would be entitled to assert to be undermined with respect to
such information and such undermining of such privilege could in the Company's
good faith judgment (after consultation with counsel, which may be in-house
counsel) adversely affect in any material respect the Company's position in
any pending or, what the Company believes in good faith (after consultation
with counsel, which may be in-house counsel) could be, future litigation, (ii)
if the Company or any of its Affiliates, on the one hand, and Parent or any of
its Affiliates, on the other hand, are adverse parties in a litigation, any
information that is reasonably pertinent thereto or (iii) any information that
in the reasonable judgment of the Company would result in the disclosure of
any trade secrets of third parties or violate any of its obligations with
respect to confidentiality if the Company shall have used reasonable best
efforts to obtain the consent of such third party to such disclosure; provided
that, in the case of clause (i), the parties hereto shall cooperate in seeking
to find a way to allow disclosure of such information to the extent doing so
(A) would not (in the good faith belief of the Company (after consultation
with counsel, which may be in-house counsel)) be reasonably likely to result
in the violation of any such Law or Contract or be reasonably likely to cause
such privilege to be undermined with respect to such information or (B) could
reasonably (in the good faith belief of the Company (after consultation with
counsel, which may be in-house counsel)) be managed through the use of
customary "clean-room" arrangements pursuant to which non-employee
Representatives of Parent could be provided access to such information.

  


 

  

(c) The information provided pursuant to this Section 6.6 shall be used solely
for the purpose of the Merger and the other Transactions, and such information
shall be kept confidential in accordance with the terms and conditions of, the
Confidentiality Agreement.

other Transactions shall be a joint press release and thereafter (unless and
until a Change of Recommendation occurs pursuant to Section 6.2(c)) Parent
(and Parent shall cause Sycamore Partners, L.P. and Sycamore Partners A, L.P.
and their affiliated

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

52  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

investment funds and use its reasonable best efforts to cause its other
Affiliates) and the Company each shall consult with each other prior to
issuing any press releases or otherwise making public announcements with
respect to the Merger or the other Transactions and prior to making any
filings with any third party and/or any Governmental Entity (including any
national securities exchange or interdealer quotation service) with respect
thereto, except as may be required by Law or by obligations pursuant to any
listing agreement with or rules of any national securities exchange or
interdealer quotation service or by the request of any Governmental Entity.

  


 

  

SECTION 6.9. Employee Benefits. (a) Parent agrees that, subject to any
collective bargaining or similar agreements, during the period commencing at
the Effective Time and ending on the date that is 12 months following the
Closing Date, each employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries who continues
employment with Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary of the
Surviving Corporation after the Effective Time ("Affected Employees") will be
provided with (A) base salary and annual cash bonus opportunities which are no
less than the base salary and annual cash bonus opportunities provided by the
Company and its Subsidiaries to each such Affected Employee immediately prior
to the Effective Time, (B) employee benefits (other than defined benefit
pension benefits, equity based benefits, and as otherwise provided in this
Section 6.9) that are substantially similar in the aggregate to those provided
by the Company and its Subsidiaries to each such Affected Employee under the
Company Plans in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time and (C)
severance benefits that are no less favorable than the severance benefits
provided by the Company and its Subsidiaries to each such Affected Employee
under the Company Plans in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time.

  


 

  

(b) With respect to any employee benefit plans maintained by Parent
(collectively, "Parent Benefit Plans") which the Affected Employees are
entitled to participate in as of the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the
Parent Benefit Plans to take into account for purposes of eligibility and
vesting (other than vesting of future equity awards) and for purposes of
determining amounts of severance, or future vacation or other paid time off
accrual (but not for benefit accrual purposes under any qualified defined
benefit pension plan) thereunder, service for the Company and its Subsidiaries
as if such service were with Parent, to the same extent such service was
credited under a comparable plan of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
(except to the extent it would result in a duplication of benefits with
respect to the same period of service). In the event of any change in the
welfare benefits provided to Affected Employee following the Effective Time,
Parent shall, and shall cause its direct and indirect Subsidiaries (including
the Surviving Corporation) to use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) waive
all limitations as to preexisting conditions exclusions and all waiting
periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to
each Affected Employee under any welfare benefit plan in which an Affected
Employee is eligible to participate on or after the Effective Time and (ii)
credit each Affected Employee for any co-payments, deductibles and other out-
of-pocket expenses paid prior to the Effective Time under the terms of any
corresponding Company Plan in satisfying any applicable deductible, co-payment
or out-of-pocket requirements for the plan year in which the Effective Time
occurs under any welfare benefit plan in which the Affected Employee
participates on

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

53  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

and after the Effective Time.

  

  

(c) Parent agrees that for the year in which the Effective Time occurs, it
shall provide annual cash bonus opportunities that are not less than the
annual cash bonus opportunities as in effect as of the Effective Time and
performance metrics relative to such opportunities that are substantially
comparable to the existing performance metrics as reasonably adjusted in good
faith following the Effective Time to reflect changes to corporate structure,
the Merger or the Carveout Transactions.

  


 

  

(d) Parent hereby acknowledges that a "change in control" or "change of
control" within the meaning of each Company Plan that contains such terms will
occur upon the Effective Time.

  


 

  

(e) Parent hereby acknowledges and recognizes that, as of the Effective Time,
all of the Company's and/or the Company's Affiliates' contractual obligations
with the unions representing bargaining unit employees of the Company or its
Affiliates will continue, including all contractual obligations under
applicable collective bargaining agreements, as listed in Section 5.1(m)(i) of
the Company Disclosure Letter (subject to future bargaining between the unions
and the Company or the Company's Affiliates).

  


 

  

(f) The parties agree that all provisions in this Section 6.9 are included for
the sole benefit of the parties hereto, and that nothing in this Agreement,
whether express or implied, shall (i) constitute an amendment to any Parent
Benefit Plan, Company Plan or any other applicable employee benefit
arrangement, (ii) create any third party beneficiary rights (x) in any other
Person, or (y) to continued employment with Parent, Company or any of their
Affiliates or Subsidiaries or (iii) shall alter or limit Parent's, the
Company's or any of their Affiliates' or Subsidiaries' ability to amend,
modify or terminate, in accordance with the terms of such plan, any particular
benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement.

  


 

  

(g) Parent shall take all actions necessary to cause each purchaser or
transferee of any of the businesses or assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries in connection with the Carveout Transactions to assume the
obligations of Parent under this Section 6.9 with respect to all employees of
the Company and its Subsidiaries that directly or indirectly transfer to or
are otherwise employed by such purchaser or transferee.

  


 

  

SECTION 6.10. Expenses. Except as otherwise expressly provided in Section 8.5,
whether or not the Merger is consummated, all costs and expenses incurred in
connection with this Agreement, the Merger and the other Transactions shall be
paid by the party incurring such expense, except expenses incurred in
connection with Parent's indemnification or reimbursement obligations pursuant
to Section 6.14(c), Section 6.17, Section 6.19 and Section 6.20.

  


 

  

SECTION 6.11. Indemnification; Directors' and Officers' Insurance. (a) From
and after the Effective Time, each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation
will

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

54  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

jointly and severally indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Law (and Parent will, and will cause the Surviving
Corporation to, advance expenses as incurred to the fullest extent permitted
under applicable Law), each present and former director, officer, employee and
agent of the Company and its Subsidiaries (collectively, the "Indemnified
Parties") against any costs, expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees),
judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in
settlement (collectively, "Costs") incurred in connection with any claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, arising out of or related to such Indemnified
Parties' service as a director, officer, employee or agent of the Company or
its Subsidiaries or services performed by such persons at the request of the
Company or its Subsidiaries at or prior to the Effective Time, whether
asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, including, for
the avoidance of doubt, in connection with (i) the Merger and the other
Transactions and (ii) actions to enforce this provision or any other
indemnification or advancement right of any Indemnified Party; provided that
the Person to whom Costs are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such
Costs if it is ultimately determined that such Person is not entitled to
indemnification. Neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall settle,
compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any threatened or actual
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation relating to any acts or
omissions covered under this Section 6.11 for which indemnification could be
sought by an Indemnified Party hereunder unless such settlement, compromise or
consent includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all
liability arising out of such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation
or such Indemnified Party otherwise consents in writing to such settlement,
compromise or consent.

  


 

  

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall and, if the Company is
unable to, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective
Time to, obtain and fully pay the premium for "tail" insurance policies for
the extension of (i) the directors' and officers' liability coverage of the
Company's existing directors' and officers' insurance policies, and (ii) the
Company's existing fiduciary and employment practices liability insurance
policies, in each case for a claims reporting or discovery period of at least
six years from and after the Effective Time from an insurance carrier with the
same or better credit rating as the Company's insurance carrier as of the date
of this Agreement with respect to directors' and officers' liability insurance
and fiduciary liability insurance (collectively, "DandO Insurance") with
benefits, terms, conditions, retentions and levels of coverage that are at
least as favorable to the Indemnified Parties as the Company's existing
policies with respect to any matters that existed or occurred at or prior to
the Effective Time (including in connection with this Agreement or the
Transactions); provided that the cost of the annual premium amount for such
"tail" insurance policies does not exceed an amount equal to 300% of the
annual premiums currently paid by the Company for such insurance. If the
Company and the Surviving Corporation for any reason fail to obtain such
"tail" insurance policies as of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, continue to
maintain in effect for a period of at least six years from and after the
Effective Time the DandO Insurance in place as of the date of this Agreement
with benefits, terms, conditions, retentions and levels of coverage that are
at least as favorable to the insureds as provided in the Company's existing
policies as of the date of

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

55  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

this Agreement, or the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, use reasonable best efforts to purchase comparable
DandO Insurance for such six-year period with benefits, terms, conditions,
retentions and levels of coverage that are at least as favorable to the
insureds as provided in the Company's existing policies as of the date of this
Agreement; provided, however, that in no event shall Parent or the Surviving
Corporation be required to expend for such policies pursuant to this sentence
an annual premium amount in excess of 300% of the annual premiums currently
paid by the Company for such insurance; and provided, further, that if the
annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount, the Surviving
Corporation shall obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a
cost not exceeding such amount.

  


 

  

(c) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns (A) (i) shall consolidate with or merge into any other
corporation or entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation
or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) shall transfer all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any individual, corporation
or other entity, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made
so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation
shall assume all of the obligations set forth in this Section 6.11 or (B)
shall sell or transfer any of the businesses or assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries in connection with the Carveout Transactions, then proper
provisions shall be made so that each purchaser or transferee of such
businesses or assets is jointly and severally liable for Parent's and the
Surviving Corporation's obligations set forth in this Section 6.11.

  


 

  

(d) The provisions of this Section 6.11 are intended to be for the benefit of,
and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties, who are third
party beneficiaries of this Section 6.11.

  


 

  

(e) The rights of the Indemnified Parties under this Section 6.11 shall be in
addition to any rights such Indemnified Parties may have under the articles of
incorporation, bylaws or comparable governing documents of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries, or under any applicable Contracts or Laws. All rights to
indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time and rights to advancement of
expenses relating thereto now existing in favor of any Indemnified Party as
provided in the articles of incorporation, bylaws or comparable governing
documents of the Company and its Subsidiaries or any indemnification agreement
between such Indemnified Party and the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
shall survive the Merger and shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise
modified in any manner that would adversely affect any right thereunder of any
such Indemnified Party.

  


 

  

SECTION 6.12. Takeover Statutes. The Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to take all action necessary so that no Takeover Statute is or becomes
applicable to the Merger or any of the other Transactions. If any Takeover
Statute is or may become applicable to the Merger or the other Transactions,
the Company, Parent and their respective Boards of Directors shall each use
reasonable best efforts to ensure that the Merger may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

56  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise eliminate or minimize the
effects of such Takeover Statute on this Agreement.

  


 

  

SECTION 6.13. Parent Vote. Parent shall vote (or consent with respect to) or
cause to be voted (or a consent to be given with respect to) any Shares
beneficially owned by Parent in favor of the adoption of this Agreement at any
meeting of shareholders of the Company at which this Agreement shall be
submitted for adoption and at all adjournments or postponements thereof (or,
if applicable, by any action of shareholders of the Company by consent in lieu
of a meeting).

  


 

  

SECTION 6.14. Financing. (a) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary, proper or advisable to arrange and obtain the Financing on
the terms and conditions (including the flex provisions) described in the
Financing Commitments and shall not permit any amendment or modification to be
made to, or any waiver of any provision or remedy under, the Financing
Commitments if such amendment, modification or waiver would (x) reduce the
aggregate amount of the Debt Financing (unless, in the case of this clause
(x), such amount is fully replaced with an amount of new equity financing on
terms no less favorable in any material respect (including as to
conditionality)) or (y) impose new or additional conditions or otherwise
amend, modify or expand any conditions precedent to the receipt of the Debt
Financing in a manner that would reasonably be expected to (I) delay or
prevent the Closing, (II) make the funding of the Debt Financing (or
satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the Debt Financing) less likely to
occur or (III) adversely impact the ability of Parent, Merger Sub or any of
their respective Affiliates to enforce its rights against the other parties to
the Debt Financing Commitments or the definitive agreements with respect
thereto, the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the Transactions or
the likelihood of consummation of the Transactions (provided, however, that
Parent and Merger Sub may replace or amend the Debt Financing Commitments to
add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar
entities that have not executed the Debt Financing Commitments as of the date
of this Agreement, in each case in accordance with the Debt Financing
Commitments as of the date hereof). Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall use
reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in effect the Debt Financing
Commitments (including by consummating the financing pursuant to the terms of
the Equity Financing Commitment) until the Transactions are consummated, (ii)
satisfy on a timely basis all conditions and covenants applicable to Parent,
Merger Sub and any of their respective Affiliates party thereto in the
Financing Commitments and otherwise comply with its obligations thereunder,
(iii) negotiate and enter into definitive agreements with respect to the
Financing on the terms and conditions (including the flex provisions)
contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitments, (iv) upon satisfaction of the
conditions contained in the Financing Commitments, consummate the Financing at
Closing, and (v) enforce its rights under the Debt Financing Commitments.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent and Merger Sub shall
give the Company prompt notice (which shall in no event be more than two
Business Days from their knowledge thereof): (A) of any material breach or
material default (or any event or circumstance that, with or without notice,
lapse of time or both, could reasonably be expected to give rise to any breach
or default) by any party to any Financing Commitment or definitive document
related to the

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

57  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

Financing; (B) of the receipt of any written notice or other written
communication from any Person with respect to any: (1) breach, default,
termination or repudiation by any party to any Financing Commitment or any
definitive document related to the Financing or any provisions of any
Financing Commitment or any definitive document related to the Financing or
(2) material dispute or disagreement between or among any parties to any
Financing Commitment or any definitive document related to the Financing (but
excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any ordinary course negotiations with
respect to the terms of the Financing or any definitive agreement with respect
thereto); and (C) if Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates
party thereto will not be able to obtain all or any portion of the Financing
on the terms, in the manner or from the sources contemplated by the Financing
Commitments or the definitive documents related to the Financing. As soon as
reasonably practicable, but in any event within two Business Days after the
date the Company delivers to Parent or Merger Sub a written request, Parent or
Merger Sub shall provide any information reasonably requested by the Company
relating to any circumstance referred to in clause (A), (B) or (C) of the
immediately preceding sentence; provided that in no event will Parent or
Merger Sub be under any obligation to disclose any information that is subject
to attorney-client or similar privilege if Parent or Merger Sub shall have
used reasonable best efforts to disclose such information in a way that would
not waive such privilege. If any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable
on the terms and conditions (including the flex provisions contained in the
Redacted Fee Letter) contemplated in the Debt Financing Commitments, Parent
shall use its reasonable best efforts to arrange and obtain alternative
financing from alternative sources in an amount sufficient to consummate the
Transactions on terms not materially less favorable from the standpoint of
Parent, Merger Sub, the Affiliates of Parent and Merger Sub party thereto and
the Company than those in the Financing Commitments (taking into account the
flex provisions) as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such
event but no later than the Business Day immediately prior to the Closing
Date. Parent shall promptly provide a true, correct and complete copy of each
alternative financing commitment (together with a redacted copy of any related
fee letter) to the Company. Parent represents and warrants that (i) the only
condition to closing set forth in the Carveout Purchase Agreements is that the
Merger has been consummated in accordance with the terms and conditions of
this Agreement and (ii) the terms of and performance by the parties of their
obligations under such Carveout Purchase Agreements would not reasonably be
expected to delay, prevent, hinder or impede the consummation of the
Transactions. Parent and Merger Sub will not, and will not permit any of their
Affiliates to, amend or modify any such Carveout Purchase Agreements" (a) to
add new or additional conditions or amend, modify or expand the existing
conditions or (b) otherwise in a manner that would reasonably be expected to
delay, prevent, hinder or impede the consummation of the Transactions.

  


 

  

(b) Parent and Merger Sub shall not permit any amendment or modification to be
made to, or any waiver of any provision or remedy under, the Equity Financing
Commitment and shall use their reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in
effect the Equity Financing Commitment until the Transactions are consummated
and (ii) subject to Section 9.5(c) and Section 9.5(d), enforce their rights
under the Equity Financing Commitment.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

58  

  

 

 

 

  


 

  

(c) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries
to, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause their respective
Representatives to, provide to Parent, at the Parent's sole expense, all
cooperation reasonably requested by Parent in connection with the arrangement
and consummation of the Financing (including the satisfaction of the
conditions precedent set forth therein) and any alternative financing as set
forth in Section 6.14(a), including, without limitation (in each case, to the
extent reasonably requested):

  


 

  

(i) participating in a reasonable number of meetings, presentations, road
shows, due diligence sessions, drafting sessions and sessions between senior
management and prospective lenders, investors and rating agencies;

  


 

  

(ii) assisting with the preparation of materials for rating agency
presentations (and assisting in the obtaining of corporate, credit and
facility ratings from ratings agencies), offering documents, private placement
memoranda, bank information memoranda and similar documents required in
connection with the Financing (including customary authorization and
management representation letters) and all documentation and other information
required in connection with applicable "know your customer" and anti-money
laundering rules and regulations, including the U.S.A. Patriot Act of 2001;

  


 

  

(iii) (A) assisting with the execution and delivery of any pledge and security
documents, currency or interest hedging arrangements, payoff and release
letters, other definitive financing documents, or other certificates or
documents as may be reasonably requested by Parent (it being understood that
the Company shall be under no obligation to deliver or cause to be delivered
any certificate with respect to solvency matters, but rather, any such
certificates shall be the responsibility of the post-Effective Time officers
of the Company); provided that the pre-Effective Time Board of Directors of
the Company will not be required to pass any resolutions pursuant to this
clause (iii)(A), (B) assisting with obtaining consents of accountants for use
of their reports in any materials relating to the Debt Financing and (C)
cooperating to facilitate the pledging of collateral (including any documents
requested by Parent in connection with the preparation of Intellectual
Property schedules, including with respect to items of Intellectual Property
not included in the Material Company Intellectual Property);

  


 

  

(iv) furnishing Parent and the Financing Sources as promptly as practicable
with (x) all of the financial statements described in paragraphs 6, 7 and 15
of Exhibit F of the Debt Financing Commitments (as in effect as of the date
hereof, and provided that Parent shall be responsible for the preparation of
any pro forma financial statements and pro forma adjustments giving effect to
the Transactions for use in connection with the offering of the Debt
Financing, it being understood that the Company shall cooperate with Parent in
the preparation of such pro forma information to the extent its cooperation
relates to financial information and data derived from the Company's
historical books and records) and (y) such other pertinent and customary
financial and other information relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries
as Parent shall reasonably request in

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

59  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

order to market, syndicate and consummate the Debt Financing; it being
understood that (A) all such financial statements and financial and other
information, to the extent based upon assumptions relating to the Carveout
Transactions, shall be prepared as contemplated by Section 6.14(e)(vii) and
(B) in no event shall the information required to be delivered by the Company
pursuant to this clause (iv) be deemed to include or shall the Company
otherwise be required to provide (1) any description of the Financing,
including any such description to be included in liquidity and capital
resources disclosure or any "description of notes," (2) risk factors relating
to the Financing, (3) separate subsidiary financial statements or any other
information of the type required by Rule 3-09, Rule 3-10 or Rule 3-16 of
Regulation S-X or "segment reporting", (3) Compensation Disclosure and
Analysis required by Regulation S-K Item 402(b) or (4) other information
customarily excluded from a Rule 144A offering memorandum (all such financial
statements and other financial and other information in this clause (iv), the
"Required Financial Information");

  


 

  

(v) providing monthly financial statements (excluding footnotes) of the
Company and its Subsidiaries or business units to the extent the Company
customarily prepares (and has prepared) such financial statements;

  


 

  

(vi) using reasonable best efforts to assist Parent in obtaining accountants'
comfort letters, consents, surveys, legal opinions from local outside counsel
and title insurance as reasonably requested by Parent for financings similar
to the Financing; and

  


 

  

(vii) using reasonable best efforts to (A) subject to Section 6.6(a), permit
the prospective lenders involved in the Financing to evaluate the Company and
its Subsidiaries' (including the Nine West Business, the Jeanswear Business,
the Jones Apparel Business, the Kurt Geiger Business and the Stuart Weitzman
Business) current assets, cash management and accounting systems, policies and
procedures relating thereto for the purpose of establishing collateral
arrangements, (B) cooperate with Parent to establish bank and other accounts
and blocked account agreements and lock box arrangements in connection with
the foregoing and (C) permit representatives of the prospective lenders to
conduct commercial field examinations, inventory and intellectual property
appraisals, Phase I environmental assessments and an appraisal of the owned
real estate, and make audits and appraisals delivered for the purposes of any
credit facility available to Parent for purposes of its Financing.

  


 

  

Nothing in this Section 6.14(c) shall require such cooperation to the extent
it would interfere unreasonably with the business or operations of the Company
or its Subsidiaries. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be
required pursuant to this Section 6.14(c) to enter into or perform under any
certificate, agreement, document or other instrument that is not contingent
upon the Closing or that would be effective prior to the Effective Time (other
than the authorization letters and management representation letters referred
to in clause (ii) above). None of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall
be required to take any action pursuant to this Section 6.14(c) that

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

60  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

would subject it to actual or potential liability for which it would not be
indemnified hereunder or to bear any cost or expense or to pay any commitment
or other similar fee or make any other payment (other than reasonable out-of-
pocket costs) or provide or agree to provide any indemnity in connection with
the Financing or any of the foregoing prior to the Effective Time. Parent
shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its Subsidiaries and its and
their Representatives from and against any and all liabilities, losses,
damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards, judgments and penalties
suffered or incurred by them in connection with the arrangement of the
Financing (including any action taken in accordance with this Section 6.14(c))
and any information utilized in connection therewith (other than historical
information relating to the Company or its Subsidiaries (including the Nine
West Business, the Jeanswear Business, the Jones Apparel Business, the Kurt
Geiger Business and the Stuart Weitzman Business) provided by the Company in
writing specifically for use in the Financing offering documents). Parent
shall, promptly upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company for all
reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred by the Company or its Subsidiaries in
connection with this Section 6.14(c). The Company hereby consents to the use
of its and its Subsidiaries' logos in connection with the Debt Financing;
provided that such logos shall be used solely in a manner that is not intended
or reasonably likely to harm, disparage or otherwise adversely affect the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

  


 

  

(d) Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that the obtaining of the
Financing, or any alternative financing, is not a condition to Closing and
reaffirm their obligation to consummate the Transactions irrespective and
independently of the availability of the Financing or any alternative
financing, subject to fulfillment or waiver of the conditions set forth in
Article VII and subject, in each such case, to the limitations set forth in
Section 9.5(c) and Section 9.5(d). In addition, the completion of the issuance
of the senior notes pursuant to the Debt Financing Commitments is not a
condition to Closing. In the event that all or any portion of the Debt
Financing to be obtained through the issuance of the senior notes as
contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitments has not been obtained on or
prior to the Closing, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause,
no later than the Closing, the bridge facility to be drawn and the proceeds of
the bridge facility contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitments to be used
to replace such portion of the senior notes not issued at Closing.

(i) the term "Marketing Period" shall mean the first period of 17 consecutive
Business Days throughout which (i) Parent shall have all of the Required
Financial Information and such Required Financial Information is Compliant,
(ii) the conditions set forth in Section 7.1 (including the condition set
forth in Section 7.1(a)) shall be satisfied or waived (other than those
conditions that by their nature can only be satisfied at the Closing) and
nothing has occurred and no condition exists that would cause any of the
conditions set forth in Section 7.2 to fail to be satisfied, assuming that the
Closing Date were to be scheduled for any time during such 17 consecutive
Business Day period; provided that the Marketing Period will not be deemed to
commence if prior to the completion of the Marketing Period, (A) the Company's
auditors shall have

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

61  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

withdrawn their audit opinion contained in the Required Financial Information
or (B) the financial statements included in the Required Financial Information
that is available to Parent on the first day of any such 17 consecutive
Business Day period would be required to be updated in order to be Compliant
in accordance with Section 6.14(e)(vi)(b) on any day during such 17
consecutive Business Day period, in which case the Marketing Period shall not
be deemed to commence until the receipt by Parent of such Compliant updated
financial statements; provided, further, that the Marketing Period shall end
on any earlier date that is the date on which all of the Debt Financing or any
alternative financing as set forth in Section 6.14(a) is obtained; provided,
further, that if the Company shall in good faith reasonably believe it has
delivered the applicable Required Financial Information, it may deliver to
Parent written notice to that effect (stating when it believes it completed
such delivery), in which case the Marketing Period shall be deemed to have
commenced on the date specified in that notice unless Parent in good faith
reasonably believes the Company has not completed delivery of the Required
Financial Information and, within two Business Days after the delivery of such
notice by the Company, delivers a written notice to the Company to that effect
(stating with reasonable specificity which Required Financial Information
Parent reasonably believes the Company has not delivered); provided, further,
that, notwithstanding the foregoing, the Marketing Period shall not commence
prior to January 6, 2014;

(iii) the term "Jeanswear Business" means the business, as conducted by the

Information, that (a) such Required Financial Information, taken as a whole,
does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact necessary in order to make such Required Financial Information
not misleading, (b) in the case of the Required Financial Information
delivered in connection with the offering of high yield debt securities as
part of the Debt Financing for RemainCo (as defined in the Debt Financing
Commitments (as in effect as of the date hereof)), such Required Financial
Information is, and remains throughout the Marketing Period, compliant in all
material respects with all applicable requirements of Regulations S-K and S-X
under the Securities Act applicable to offerings of debt securities on a
registration statement on Form S-1 for a non-reporting issuer (excluding
subsidiary financial statements or any other information of the type required
by Regulation S-X Rule 3-09, Rule 3-10 or Rule 3-16 or "segment reporting" and
Compensation Disclosure and Analysis required by Item 402(b) of Regulation

other financial data, audit reports and other information for the Nine West
Business, the Jeanswear Business, the Jones Apparel Business, the Kurt Geiger

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

63  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

Business and the Stuart Weitzman Business included within the definition of
"Required Financial Information" on or prior to December 27, 2013 (the
"Assumption Period"), the Company shall be permitted to make in good faith any
and all assumptions that it determines are reasonably necessary in order to
produce such Required Financial Information (it being understood that the
Company shall consider any assumptions provided by Parent after the Assumption
Period and shall use such assumptions unless the Company determines that such
assumptions would cause a material delay in the preparation of the Required
Financial Information or would be factually incorrect).

  


 

  

SECTION 6.15. FIRPTA Certificate. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall
deliver to Parent a certificate, signed under penalty of perjury and in form
and substance as required by Sections 1.897-2(h) and 1.1445-2(c)(3) of the

SECTION 6.16. Transaction Litigation. "Transaction Litigation" means any
litigation commenced or threatened against any party to this Agreement or any
of its Affiliates by any Governmental Entity or any private party relating to,
arising out of or involving this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other
Transactions or that would otherwise prevent or materially impede, interfere
with, hinder or delay the consummation of the Merger and the other
Transactions. Each party to this Agreement shall keep the other parties
reasonably informed, but only to the extent that doing so would not, in the
reasonable judgment of such party, jeopardize any privilege of the party with
respect thereto regarding any such Transaction Litigation; it being agreed
that each party will also cooperate with the other parties to permit such
inspection of or to disclose such information on a basis that does not
compromise or waive such privilege with respect thereto. The Company shall
promptly advise Parent orally and in writing and the Company shall cooperate
fully with Parent in connection with, and shall consult with and permit Parent
and its representatives to participate in, the defense, negotiations or
settlement of any Transaction Litigation and the Company shall give
consideration to Parent's advice with respect to such Transaction Litigation.
The Company shall not, and shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries nor any of
its or their representatives to, compromise, settle, come to a settlement
arrangement regarding any Transaction Litigation hereby or consent thereto
without the prior written consent of Parent, which consent may be granted or
withheld in Parent's sole discretion.

  


 

  

SECTION 6.17. Carveout Transaction Matters. If requested by Parent, at
Parent's sole expense, the Company shall provide reasonable cooperation to
Parent and Merger Sub in connection with Parent and Merger Sub's review of,
planning for and implementation of the Carveout Transactions (including, if
requested by Parent, reasonable cooperation so that the closing of the
Carveout Transactions and the Closing contemplated by this Agreement can occur
and be effected concurrently) and, for the avoidance of doubt, shall refrain
from taking actions to effect any internal reorganization to implement the
Carveout Transactions without the prior written consent of Parent; provided
that (a) the Board of Directors of the Company shall not be required to pass
any resolutions related to the matters contemplated by this Section 6.17 and
(b) this

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

64  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

Section 6.17 shall not require the Company to take any action, to execute any
document or other instrument, or to incur any liability (i) that is not
conditioned upon or that would be effective prior to the Effective Time, (ii)
that would contravene any organizational document of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or (iii) that would unreasonably interfere with the business or
operations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Upon request, Parent
will reimburse the Company for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the
Company pursuant to this Section 6.17. If requested by Parent, the Company
shall take any reasonably requested steps to begin to unwind the Company's
Canadian financing structure on or prior to December 31, 2013, so long as any
such steps will not result in any incremental material liability, obligation,
cost or expense to the Company. Substantially concurrently with the Closing,
unless prohibited by an Order, Parent shall cause the Restructuring (as
defined in the Carveout Purchase Agreements) to be consummated.

  


 

  

SECTION 6.18. Credit Agreement Matters. If requested by Parent, the Company
shall provide reasonable cooperation to Parent and Merger Sub in arranging
for, at the Closing, the termination of the Revolving Credit Facility and any
other existing indebtedness of the Company and its Subsidiaries and the
procurement of customary payoff letters in connection therewith; provided that
in no event shall this Section 6.18 require the Company to cause the Revolving
Credit Facility or any other existing indebtedness to be terminated unless (a)
the Company has received from Parent funds to pay in full the payoff amount
for any such indebtedness and (b) Parent has agreed to and has provided
backstop letters of credit or cash collateralized any existing letters of
credit and guarantees and hedging arrangements and other bank products
thereunder in a manner satisfactory to the lenders or holders of such
indebtedness, to the extent applicable. Upon request, Parent will reimburse
the Company for any reasonably incurred and documented out-of-pocket expenses
incurred by the Company pursuant to this Section 6.18.

  


 

  

SECTION 6.19. Repatriation. Parent may request in writing to the Company (the
"Repatriation Notice") that the Company and its wholly owned Subsidiaries
cooperate to transfer in any jurisdiction located outside of the United States
(the "Repatriation Jurisdictions") unrestricted cash balances held in
commercial bank accounts in the name of the Company or such wholly owned
Subsidiary to accounts in the name of the Company or a wholly owned Subsidiary
located in the United States (the "Repatriation"; and "Repatriate" shall have
a correlative meaning) effective as of the Effective Time. Parent may
periodically request from the Company, and the Company will provide (but not
more often than monthly), an estimate of the amount of cash that it believes
could be repatriated by the Company as of a Closing Date estimated by Parent
(as provided for in the immediately following sentence), understanding that
such amounts are only an estimate, that actual amounts may vary from such
estimates and that the Company shall not be liable for any such variances. The
Repatriation Notice shall specify the Repatriation Jurisdictions that Parent
would like the Company to repatriate cash from and Parent's good faith
estimate of the Closing Date. The Company will review the Repatriation Notice
and send to Parent, as promptly as practicable after the receipt thereof, a
written response setting forth the following information with respect each
Repatriation Jurisdiction (the "Repatriation Response"): (a) the amount of
cash in

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

65  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

each Repatriation Jurisdiction that the Company believes could be reasonably
Repatriated, taking into account (i) Parent's estimate of the Closing Date,
(ii) the amount of cash reasonably needed in such Repatriation Jurisdiction to
operate the business in the ordinary course and meet working capital
requirements in such Repatriation Jurisdiction, (iii) applicable Law,
including those relating to solvency, adequate surplus, similar capital
adequacy tests, corporate benefit, financial assistance, distributable
reserves and directors' duties, and (iv) any estimated Taxes or fees and
expenses to be paid in such Repatriation Jurisdiction in connection with the
Repatriation, (b) the estimated costs and expenses that would be incurred by
the Company and its Subsidiaries in connection with the Repatriation,
including estimated Taxes that would be payable on such Repatriated amount and
the estimated fees and expenses of counsel and accountants in connection with
any such Repatriation (collectively, the "Estimated Costs") and (c) the amount
of time that the Company estimates it would take for the Repatriation to be
completed in each such Repatriation Jurisdiction identified in the
Repatriation Notice. The Company shall not unreasonably deny a request for
repatriation set forth in a Repatriation Notice. Within five (5) Business Days
following delivery of the Repatriation Response, Parent shall notify the
Company in writing whether or not Parent wishes for the Company to consummate
immediately prior to the Effective Time any or all of the Repatriations set
forth in the Repatriation Response (including the amount of any such
Repatriation, subject to increases or decreases of such amounts by the Company
as may be reasonable at the time of Repatriation based on the amount of
unrestricted cash actually available at such time) (the "Repatriation
Confirmation") and if it requests any such Repatriation, confirming with
respect to each such Repatriation, (a) that it approves of the Company and its
Subsidiaries taking the actions reasonably necessary in the Company's sole
judgment to effect such Repatriation and (b) that it approves of the Company
incurring the Estimated Costs (and any additional costs as may be reasonably
incurred in connection with the Repatriation). Parent shall indemnify and hold
harmless the Company, its Subsidiaries and its and their Representatives from
and against any and all liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses,
interest, awards, judgments, Taxes (including loss of tax attributes) and
penalties suffered or incurred by them in connection with the Repatriation,
including any action taken in accordance with this Section 6.19 and including
the Estimated Costs (and any additional costs). Without limiting the
generality of the immediately preceding sentence, Parent shall, promptly upon
request by the Company, reimburse the Company for all Estimated Costs (and any
additional costs) actually incurred by the Company or its Subsidiaries in
connection with this Section 6.19.

  


 

  

SECTION 6.20. Treatment of Certain Notes. (a) Reference is made to each of (i)
the 5.125% Senior Notes Due 2014 issued by the Company and certain of its
Subsidiaries (the "2014 Notes"), (ii) the 6.875% Senior Notes Due 2019 issued
by the Company and certain of its Subsidiaries (the "2019 Notes"), (iii) the
6.125% Senior Notes Due 2034 issued by the Company and certain of its
Subsidiaries (the "2034 Notes" and, collectively with the 2014 Notes and the
2019 Notes, the "Notes"; the indentures governing the Notes being the
"Indentures") and (iv) the 5% Loan Notes Due 2016 issued by Jones Apparel
Group Holdings, Inc. (the "KG Loan Notes") and the management loan note
instrument governing the KG Loan Notes (the "KG Loan Note Deed").

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

66  

  

 

 

 

  

  


 

  

(b) As part of the Carveout Transactions, the KG Loan Notes will remain
obligations of the current obligor thereunder. At the Effective Time, Parent
shall cause Jones Apparel Group Holdings, Inc. to comply with all of the terms
and conditions of the KG Loan Notes and the KG Loan Note Deed.

  


 

  

(c) At the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and
each issuer (or its successor in interest) under any of the then outstanding
Notes to comply with all of the terms and conditions of the then outstanding
Notes and the Indentures governing the Notes, including, to the extent
required by the terms and conditions of any of the then outstanding Notes or
any Indenture governing any series of the then outstanding Notes, causing the
Surviving Corporation and any issuer (or its successor in interest) under any
series of Notes to (A) obtain and deliver officers' certificates and opinions
of counsel stating that the Transactions comply with the applicable Indentures
governing any series of then outstanding Notes and (B) take such steps as are
required to secure any of the then outstanding Notes equally and ratably with
all indebtedness secured by a lien on property not otherwise permitted to be
subject to a lien under the applicable Indentures governing any series of then
outstanding Notes.

  


 

  

(d) At the request and expense of Parent, the Company shall promptly at a time
reasonably requested by Parent, commence, and/or cause the Company's
Subsidiaries to promptly commence, an offer to purchase for any and all of the
outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Notes on price terms that are
acceptable to Parent and such other customary terms and conditions as are
reasonably acceptable to the Company and Parent to be consummated
substantially simultaneously with the Closing using funds provided by Parent
(the "Debt Tender Offer") and Parent shall assist the Company in connection
therewith. The Company shall take all corporate actions that are reasonable
and necessary for the Debt Tender Offer. The Company shall, and shall cause
its Subsidiaries to, and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause their
respective Representatives to, provide all cooperation reasonably requested by
Parent in connection with the Debt Tender Offer. The closing of the Debt
Tender Offer shall be conditioned on the occurrence of the Closing, and the
parties shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the Debt Tender Offer to
close on the Closing Date; provided that the consummation of the Debt Tender
Offer with respect to any series of Notes shall not be a condition to Closing.
Concurrent with the Effective Time, and in accordance with the terms of the
Debt Tender Offer, the Surviving Corporation shall accept for purchase and
purchase each series of Notes properly tendered and not properly withdrawn in
the Debt Tender Offer using funds provided by or at the direction of Parent.
Parent hereby covenants and agrees to provide (or to cause to be provided)
immediately available funds to the Company for the full payment at the
Effective Time of all Notes properly tendered and not withdrawn to the extent
required pursuant to the terms of the Debt Tender Offer.

  


 

  

(e) If reasonably requested by the Parent in writing, the Company and the
other issuers of the applicable series of Notes shall, in accordance with the
applicable redemption provisions of the applicable series of Notes and the
Indenture governing such Notes, (A) substantially simultaneous with the
Effective Time issue a notice of optional redemption for all of the
outstanding aggregate principal amount of such series of Notes, pursuant to
the redemption provisions of the applicable Indenture and (B) use reasonable

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

67  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

best efforts to take any other actions reasonably requested by the Parent to
facilitate the satisfaction and discharge of such series of Notes pursuant to
the satisfaction and discharge provisions of the applicable Indenture and the
other provisions of such Indenture applicable thereto; provided that prior to
the Company's being required to take any of the actions described in clauses
(A) and (B) above, the Parent shall have, or shall have caused to be, set
aside sufficient funds to deliver to the Company to effect such redemption and
satisfaction and discharge. The redemption and satisfaction and discharge of
any series of Notes pursuant to the preceding sentence are referred to
collectively as the "Discharge" of such series of Notes. The Company shall,
and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and shall use reasonable best efforts to
cause their respective Representatives to, provide all cooperation reasonably
requested by Parent in connection with the Discharge of any series of Notes
identified to the Company by Parent in writing at any time. Without in any way
limiting the provisions of this Section 6.20(e), at the Effective Time, Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to Discharge the 2014 Notes as
contemplated in clause (g) of Exhibit A to the Debt Financing Commitments.

  


 

  

(f) Parent shall (or the Company, if directed by Parent, shall), at a time
selected by Parent (such time to be in accordance with the terms of the Debt
Financing Commitments), commence a change of control offer to purchase all of
the 2019 Notes (in accordance with the requirements of the Indenture governing
such Notes) at the price required pursuant to the Indenture governing such
Notes using funds provided by Parent. The Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause their
respective Representatives to, provide all cooperation reasonably requested by
Parent in connection with such change of control offer for the 2019 Notes. The
closing of the change of control offer shall be conditioned on the occurrence
of the Closing, and the parties shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the
change of control offer to close on the Closing Date; provided that the
consummation of the change of control offer with respect to the 2019 Notes
shall not be a condition to Closing. Concurrent with the Effective Time, and
in accordance with the terms of the change of control offer for the 2019
Notes, the Surviving Corporation shall accept for purchase and purchase each
of the 2019 Notes properly tendered and not properly withdrawn in such change
of control offer using funds provided by or at the direction of Parent. Parent
hereby covenants and agrees to provide (or to cause to be provided)
immediately available funds to the Company for the full payment at the
Effective Time of all 2019 Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn to
the extent required pursuant to the terms of such change of control offer. If
all of the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the 2019 Notes is validly
tendered (and not validly withdrawn) in the change of control offer and/or the
Debt Tender Offer for the 2019 Notes, on the Closing Date, Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to Discharge the 2019 Notes as contemplated in
clause (h) of Exhibit A to the Debt Financing Commitments.

  


 

  

(g) Parent shall prepare all necessary and appropriate documentation in
connection with any change of control offer for the 2019 Notes or any Debt
Tender Offer, including the offer to purchase, related letter of transmittal,
and other related documents (collectively, the "Offer Documents"), and provide
the Company with a reasonable opportunity to comment and make reasonable
changes to such documents. Parent and the Company shall, and shall cause their
respective Subsidiaries to, reasonably

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

68  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

cooperate with each other in the preparation of the Offer Documents. The Offer
Documents (including all amendments or supplements) and all mailings to the
holders of the Notes in connection with any Debt Tender Offer or such change
of control offer shall be subject to the prior review of, and comment by, the
Company and Parent and shall be reasonably acceptable to each of them. If at
any time prior to the completion of the any Debt Tender Offer or change of
control offer any information in the Offer Documents should be discovered by
the Company and its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, or Parent, on the other,
which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Offer
Documents, so that the Offer Documents shall not contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, the party that
discovers such information shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
promptly notify the other party, and an appropriate amendment or supplement
prepared by Parent describing such information shall be disseminated by or on
behalf of the Company or its Subsidiaries to the holders of the Notes (which
supplement or amendment and dissemination may, at the reasonable direction of
Parent, take the form of a filing of a Current Report on Form 8-K).
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 6.20(g), the Company
shall and shall cause its Subsidiaries to comply with the requirements of Rule
14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other applicable Law to the extent such
Laws are applicable in connection with the any change of control offer for the
2019 Notes or any Debt Tender Offer and such compliance will not be deemed a
breach hereof.

  


 

  

(h) The Company shall waive any of the conditions to any change of control
offer for the 2019 Notes or any Debt Tender Offer (other than that the Merger
shall have been consummated and that there shall be no Order prohibiting
consummation of any Debt Tender Offer or such change of control offer) as may
be reasonably requested by Parent in writing and shall not, without the
written consent of Parent, waive any condition to any Debt Tender Offer or
such change of control offer or make any changes to any Debt Tender Offer or
such change of control offer other than as agreed between Parent and the
Company.

  


 

  

(i) In connection with the change of control offer for the 2019 Notes or any
Debt Tender Offer, Parent may select one or more dealer managers, information
agents, depositaries and other agents, in each case as shall be reasonably
acceptable to the Company, to provide assistance in connection therewith and
the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, enter into customary
agreements (including indemnities) with such parties so selected. Parent shall
pay the fees and out-of pocket expenses of any dealer manager, information
agent, depositary or other agent retained in connection with any Debt Tender
Offer or such change of control offer upon the incurrence of such fees and
out-of-pocket expenses.

  


 

  

(j) Parent shall promptly, upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company
for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs, fees and expenses
incurred by or on behalf of the Company at the request of Parent in connection
with the Company's compliance with its obligations under this Section 6.20,
including all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs, fees and expenses
incurred by or on

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

69  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

behalf of the Company in connection with any Debt Tender Offer, Discharge or
change of control offer made in respect of any series of Notes (including any
out-of-pocket costs, fees and expenses incurred in connection with the
preparation or distribution of any Offer Documents or other documents related
thereto). Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its
Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives for any liabilities incurred
by any of them in connection with any action taken by them to the extent
pursuant to this Section 6.20 with respect to any Debt Tender Offer, Discharge
or change of control offer (in each case other than as a result of the
Company's fraud or willful misconduct); provided, however, that the Parent
shall not have any obligation to indemnify and hold harmless any such party or
person to the extent such damages suffered or incurred are attributable to the
information provided by the Company that is finally determined by a court of
competent jurisdiction to have contained a material misstatement or omission.

  


 

  

(k) The Company shall be deemed to have satisfied each of its obligations set
forth in clauses (d) through (g) of this Section 6.20 (other than its
obligation to commence a Debt Tender Offer or change of control offer for the
2019 Notes) if the Company shall have used its reasonable best efforts (or
other specified level of efforts) to comply with such obligations, regardless
of the actual outcome of any Debt Tender Offer, Discharge or change of control
offer. No party hereto or any of its respective Affiliates (including, in the
case of Parent and Merger Sub, the Guarantors) shall have any liability or
obligation of any kind or nature whatsoever to any other party hereto or any
of such party's respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates or any of their
respective Representatives or shareholders in the event that the parties
hereto are unable to consummate the Merger or any of the Carveout Transactions
as a result of any Order (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) by any
Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction prohibiting, restraining,
enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the Merger or any of
the Carveout Transactions, whether on account of Transaction Litigation or
otherwise, in each case so long as such party has not otherwise breached this
Agreement.

Statutes; No Rights Agreement) shall be true and correct in all respects
(without giving effect to any materiality or Company Material Adverse Effect
qualifications set forth therein) as of the date of this Agreement and as of
the Closing Date as though made on and as of such date and time (except to the

earlier date, in which case such representation and warranty shall be true and
correct as of such earlier date), except for such inaccuracies as are de
minimis relative to each such representation and warranty taken as a whole;
and (ii) all other representations and warranties of the Company set forth in
this Agreement shall be true and correct (without giving effect to any
materiality or Company Material Adverse Effect qualifications set forth
therein) as of the date of this Agreement and as of the Closing Date as though
made on and as of such date and time (except to the extent that any such
representation and warranty expressly speaks as of an earlier date, in which
case such representation and warranty shall be true and correct as of such
earlier date); provided, however, that notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, the condition set forth in this Section 7.2(a)(ii) shall be deemed
to have been satisfied even if any such representations and warranties of the
Company are not so true and correct unless the failure of such representations
and warranties of the Company to be so true and correct, individually or in
the aggregate, has had or is reasonably likely to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect; and (iii) Parent shall have received at the Closing a
certificate signed on behalf of the Company by a senior executive officer of
the Company to the effect that such officer has read this Section 7.2(a) and
the conditions set forth in this Section 7.2(a) have been satisfied.

the date

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

71  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

of this Agreement, there shall not have occurred any Company Material Adverse
Effect that remains in effect.

  


 

  

SECTION 7.3. Conditions to Obligation of the Company. The obligation of the
Company to effect the Merger is also subject to the satisfaction or waiver at
or prior to the Effective Time of the following conditions:

Parent and Merger Sub set forth in this Agreement shall be true and correct in
all respects (without giving effect to any materiality qualifications set

though made on and as of such date and time (except to the extent that any
such representation and warranty expressly speaks as of an earlier date, in
which case such representation and warranty shall be true and correct as of
such earlier date), except where the failure of such representations and
warranties to be so true and correct would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be likely to prevent or materially impede the ability of
Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the Merger and the other Transactions and
(ii) the Company shall have received at the Closing a certificate signed on
behalf of Parent and Merger Sub by a senior executive officer of Parent to the
effect that such officer has read this Section 7.3(a) and the conditions set

SECTION 7.4. Frustration of Closing Conditions. None of the Company, Parent or
Merger Sub may rely on the failure of any condition set forth in Section 7.2
or 7.3, as the case may be, to be satisfied to excuse such party's obligation
to effect the Merger if such failure was caused by such party's failure to use
the standard of efforts required from such party to consummate the Merger and
the other Transactions, including as required by and subject to Sections 6.5
and 6.14.

  


 

  

ARTICLE VIII

Company and Parent.

  


 

  

SECTION 8.2. Termination by Either Parent or the Company. This Agreement may
be terminated and the Merger may be abandoned at any time prior to the
Effective Time by action of either Parent or the Company if:

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

72  

  

 

 

 

  


 

  

(a) the Merger shall not have been consummated by the date that is the 180th
day anniversary of the date hereof (the "Termination Date"), whether such date
is before or after the date of adoption of this Agreement by the shareholders
of the Company referred to in Section 7.1(a). Notwithstanding the foregoing,
(i) Parent shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
this Section 8.2(a) if the Company has the right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to Section 8.3(b) and (ii) the Company shall not have the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.2(a) if Parent has the
right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.4(b);

  


 

  

(b) the Shareholders Meeting shall have been held and completed and adoption
of this Agreement by the shareholders of the Company referred to in Section

consummation of the Merger or any of the Carveout Transactions shall become
final and non-appealable (whether before or after the adoption of this
Agreement by the shareholders of the Company referred to in Section 7.1(a)),

  


 

  

provided that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section
8.2 shall not be available to any party that has breached in any material
respect its obligations under this Agreement in any manner that shall have
been the primary cause of or the primary factor that resulted in the failure
of a condition to the consummation of the Merger to have been satisfied on or
before the Termination Date.

  


 

  

SECTION 8.3. Termination by the Company. This Agreement may be terminated and
the Merger may be abandoned by the Company:

  


 

  

(a) at any time prior to the time the Company Requisite Vote is obtained, if
(i) the Board of Directors of the Company authorizes the Company, subject to

Acquisition Agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal; (ii) immediately
prior to or substantially concurrently with the termination of this Agreement
the Company enters into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to a
Superior Proposal; and (iii) the Company immediately prior to or substantially
concurrently with such termination pays to Parent or its designee in

with the requirements of Section 6.2(c) (No Change of Recommendation or
Alternative Acquisition Agreement);

  


 

  

(b) at any time prior to the Effective Time, if there has been a breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made by Parent or Merger Sub
in this Agreement, or any such representation and warranty shall have become
untrue after the date of this Agreement, such that the conditions set forth in
Sections 7.3(a) or 7.3(b) would not be satisfied, and such breach or condition
is not curable or, if curable, is not

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

73  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

cured prior to the earlier of (i) the 30th day after written notice thereof is
given by the Company to Parent and (ii) the date that is three Business Days
prior to the Termination Date (the earlier of (i) and (ii), the "Breach End
Date"); provided, however, that the Company is not then in material breach of
this Agreement so as to cause any of the conditions set forth in Sections
7.2(a) or 7.2(b) not to be capable of being satisfied; or

  


 

  

(c) at any time prior to the Effective Time, if all of the conditions set
forth in Sections 7.1 and 7.2 have been satisfied and continue to be satisfied
(other than those conditions that by their nature cannot be satisfied other
than at the Closing) and the Company has indicated in writing that the Company
is ready, willing and able to consummate the Merger, and Parent and Merger Sub
fail to consummate the Merger within two Business Days after the date the
Closing should have occurred pursuant to Section 1.2 and the Company stood
ready, willing and able to consummate the Merger during such two Business Day
period.

  


 

  

SECTION 8.4. Termination by Parent. This Agreement may be terminated and the
Merger may be abandoned by Parent:

  


 

  

(a) at any time prior to when the Company Requisite Vote is obtained, if the
Board of Directors of the Company (i) shall have made and not withdrawn a
Change of Recommendation, (ii) shall have failed (or the Company shall have
failed) to include the Company Recommendation in the Proxy Statement or (iii)
shall have breached (or the Company shall have breached) in any material
respect its obligations under Section 6.2 and, in the case of this clause
(iii), such breach is not curable or, if curable, is not cured prior to the
earlier of (x) the 5th Business Day after written notice thereof is given by
Parent to the Company and (y) the date that is three Business Days prior to
the Termination Date; or

  


 

  

(b) at any time prior to the Effective Time, if there has been a breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made by the Company in this
Agreement, or any such representation and warranty shall have become untrue
after the date of this Agreement, such that the conditions set forth in
Sections 7.2(a) or 7.2(b) would not be satisfied, and such breach or condition
is not curable or, if curable, is not cured prior to the earlier of (i) the
30th day after written notice thereof is given by Parent to the Company and
(ii) the date that is three Business Days prior to the Termination Date;
provided, however, that Parent is not then in material breach of this
Agreement so as to cause any of the conditions set forth in Section 7.3(a) or
7.3(b) not to be capable of being satisfied.

  


 

  

SECTION 8.5. Effect of Termination and Abandonment.

  


 

  

(a) In the event of termination of this Agreement and the abandonment of the
Merger pursuant to this Article VIII, this Agreement shall become void and of
no effect with no liability to any Person on the part of any party hereto (or
of any of its Representatives or Affiliates); provided, however, that
notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the contrary, (i) except as
otherwise provided herein, no such termination shall relieve any party hereto
of any liability to pay the Termination Fee, the Parent

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

74  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

Termination Fee, the Parent Expenses, the Company Expenses or the expense and
indemnification obligations pursuant to this Section 8.5, Section 6.14(c),
Section 6.17, Section 6.18, Section 6.19 and Section 6.20 and (ii) the
provisions set forth in this Section 8.5 and Article IX shall survive the
termination of this Agreement.

  


 

  

(b) Termination Fee. In the event that:

  


 

  

(i) (x) before obtaining the Company Requisite Vote, this Agreement is
terminated by Parent or the Company pursuant to (1) Section 8.2(a) (the
section relating to the Termination Date) or (2) Section 8.2(b) (the section
relating to failure to receive shareholder approval), (y) any Person other
than the Guarantors and their Affiliates shall have made (and not subsequently
withdrawn prior to the event giving rise to such termination) a bona fide
Acquisition Proposal after the date of this Agreement but prior to such
termination and (z) within 12 months of such termination the Company shall
have entered into a definitive agreement with respect to an Acquisition
Proposal and such Acquisition Proposal is subsequently consummated or a
transaction contemplated by an Acquisition Proposal is otherwise consummated
within 12 months of such termination (provided that for purposes of this
clause (z) the references to "25%" in subsections (1) and (2) of the
definition of "Acquisition Proposal" shall be deemed to be references to
"50%");

  


 

  

(ii) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 8.4(a) (the
section relating to a Change of Recommendation); or

  


 

  

(iii) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 8.3(a)
(the section relating to an Alternative Acquisition Agreement);

  


 

  

then the Company shall (A) in the case of clause (i) of this Section 8.5(b),
substantially concurrently with the consummation of the Acquisition Proposal
referred to in sub-clause (i)(z) of this Section 8.5(b), (B) in the case of
clause (ii) of this Section 8.5(b), no later than three Business Days after
the date of such termination and (C) in the case of clause (iii) of this
Section 8.5(b), immediately prior to or substantially concurrently with such
termination, pay to Parent or its designee the Termination Fee by wire
transfer of immediately available funds (it being understood that in no event
shall the Company be required to pay the Termination Fee on more than one
occasion). "Termination Fee" shall mean an amount equal to $36,000,000. For
the avoidance of doubt, Parent shall have the right to assign the right to
receive the Termination Fee to one or more Persons in its sole discretion.

  


 

  

(c) Parent Termination Fee. In the event that this Agreement is terminated by
(i) the Company pursuant to Section 8.3(b) (the section relating to material
breach by Parent or Merger Sub) and the breach by Parent or Merger Sub giving
rise to such termination is the principal cause of the failure of the Merger
to be consummated, in such case, unless, prior to such termination, (A) Parent
and Merger Sub deliver written notice at least two (2) Business Days in
advance of the Breach End Date informing the Company that Parent and Merger
Sub would be ready, willing and able to consummate

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

75  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

the Merger in accordance with its terms no later than the Breach End Date and
(B) Parent and Merger Sub stood ready, willing and able to consummate the
Merger in accordance with its terms on the Breach End Date, (ii) the Company
pursuant to Section 8.3(c) (the section relating to failure to consummate on
the Closing Date specified by Section 1.2), (iii) Parent pursuant to Section
8.4(b) (the section relating to material breach by the Company) if (x) a
Company Material Adverse Effect has occurred and (y) no termination right
would have existed thereunder if each reference to "Company Material Adverse
Effect" in this Agreement (other than the references thereto in Section
5.1(a)(ii) and this Section 8.5(c)) had been replaced with a reference to
"Whole Company Material Adverse Effect" or (iv) by Parent or the Company
pursuant to Section 8.2(a) (the section relating to the Termination Date), if
(x) a Company Material Adverse Effect has occurred and (y) at the time of
termination, all of the conditions set forth in Sections 7.1 and 7.2 would
have been satisfied (including Section 7.2(a) but other than other conditions
that by their nature cannot be satisfied other than at the Closing, all of
which are capable of being satisfied at the closing) if each reference to
"Company Material Adverse Effect" in this Agreement (other than the references
thereto in Section 5.1(a)(ii) and this Section 8.5(c)) had been replaced with
references to "Whole Company Material Adverse Effect", then Parent shall, no
later than three Business Days after the date of such termination, pay or
cause to be paid to the Company (I) in the case of clause (i) or clause (ii)
of this Section 8.5(c), the Parent Termination Fee and (II) in the case of
clause (iii) or clause (iv) of this Section 8.5(c), the amount of the Company
Expenses, in each case, by wire transfer of immediately available funds (it
being understood that in no event shall Parent be required to pay the Parent
Termination Fee or the Company Expenses on more than one occasion or both the
Parent Termination Fee and the Company Expenses). "Parent Termination Fee"
shall mean an amount equal to $60,000,000. For purposes of this Agreement,
"Whole Company Material Adverse Effect" means a Company Material Adverse
Effect, except that, solely for purposes of this definition, (i) each
reference to "either (1) the Apparel Business, taken as a whole, (2) the Non-
Apparel Business, taken as a whole, or (3) the Stuart Weitzman Business, taken
as a whole" set forth in the definition of Company Material Adverse Effect
shall be deemed to be replaced with "the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken
as a whole" and (ii) each reference to "the Apparel Business, the Non-Apparel
Business or the Stuart Weitzman Business" set forth in the definition of
Company Material Adverse Effect shall be deemed to be a replaced with "the
Company and its Subsidiaries". "Company Expenses" means all reasonable and
documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses (including reasonable legal,
accounting and financial advisor fees and expenses, but excluding, for
avoidance of doubt, any success fees payable to any financial advisor that are
conditioned upon the occurrence of the Closing) actually incurred by the
Company and its Subsidiaries between the date of this Agreement and the
termination of this Agreement in connection with the Company's compliance with
the covenants set forth in this Agreement in furtherance of the Transactions
(and not including any fees or expenses incurred in connection with any
Acquisition Proposal), which amount shall not exceed $12,000,000 (the "Company
Expenses Cap"). Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything else to the contrary
herein, the parties agree that any amounts paid by Parent pursuant to Parent's
expense and indemnification obligations under Section 6.14(c), Section 6.17,
Section 6.18, Section 6.19 and Section

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

76  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

6.20 shall be considered Company Expenses and shall be included in any
calculation of the Company Expenses Cap on a dollar for dollar basis.

  


 

  

(d) Parent Expenses. In the event this Agreement is terminated by either
Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 8.2(b) (the section relating to a
failure to receive shareholder approval) or by Parent pursuant to Section
8.4(b) (the section relating to a material breach by the Company) as a result
of a material breach by the Company of this Agreement that is a consequence of
an act or failure to act by the Company with the Company having actual
knowledge that the taking of such act or failure to take such act would cause
a breach of this Agreement under circumstances in which the Termination Fee is
not then payable pursuant to Section 8.5(b), then the Company shall, following
receipt of an invoice therefor, promptly (in any event within three Business
Days) pay all of Parent's and its Affiliates' reasonable and documented out-
of-pocket fees and expenses (including reasonable legal fees and expenses)
actually incurred by Parent and its Affiliates on or prior to the termination
of this Agreement in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including the Financing) (the "Parent Expenses"), which amount
shall in no event exceed $12,000,000 in the aggregate, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to one or more accounts designated by Parent or
its designee; provided that the existence of circumstances which could require
the Termination Fee to become subsequently payable by the Company pursuant to
Section 8.5(b) shall not relieve the Company of its obligations to pay the
Parent Expenses pursuant to this Section 8.5(d); provided, further, that the
payment by the Company of Parent Expenses pursuant to this Section 8.5(d)
shall not relieve the Company of any subsequent obligation to pay the
Termination Fee pursuant to Section 8.5(b), but shall reduce, on a dollar for
dollar basis, any Termination Fee that becomes due and payable under Section
8.5(b). For the avoidance of doubt, Parent shall have right to assign the
right to receive the Parent Expenses to one or more Persons in its sole
discretion.

  


 

  

(e) The parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this Section 8.5
are an integral part of the Transactions, and that, without these agreements,
the parties would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company
fails to promptly pay the amounts due pursuant to Section 8.5(b) or Section
8.5(d) or Parent fails to promptly pay the amounts due pursuant to Section
8.5(c), and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent or Merger Sub, on the one
hand, or the Company, on the other hand, commences a suit that results in a
judgment against the Company for the amounts set forth in Section 8.5(b) or
Section 8.5(d) or any portion thereof or a judgment against Parent for the
amounts set forth in Section 8.5(c) or any portion thereof, the Company shall
reimburse Parent or Merger Sub, or any of their respective designees, on the
one hand, or Parent shall reimburse or cause the Company to be reimbursed, on
the other hand, such party's costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees) in
connection with such suit, together with interest on such amount or portion
thereof at the prime rate of Citibank N.A. in effect on the date such payment
was required to be made through the date of payment. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Agreement, (i) the Company's receipt of the Parent
Termination Fee or the Company Expenses, as the case may be, pursuant to this
Section 8.5 (and its rights to enforce the Guarantee with respect thereto and,
in the case the Parent Termination Fee or the Company Expenses are not timely

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

77  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

paid, the amounts described in the first sentence of this Section 8.5(e)), any
reimbursement and indemnification obligations of Parent pursuant to Sections
6.14(c), 6.17, 6.18, 6.19 or 6.20 and the Company's right to specific
performance of this Agreement pursuant to Sections 9.5(c) and 9.5(d) shall be
the sole and exclusive remedy of the Company and its Affiliates against
Parent, Merger Sub, the Equity Provider, the Financing Sources or any of their
respective former, current or future Affiliates, and any of the former,
current or future general or limited partners, shareholders, directors,
officers, employees, managers, members, controlling persons, advisors,
attorneys, representatives or agents of any of the foregoing and any heirs,
executors, successors or assigns of any of the foregoing, for any loss
suffered as a result of any breach of any covenant or agreement in this
Agreement or the failure of the Merger to be consummated, and upon payment of
such amounts, none of Parent, Merger Sub, the Equity Provider, the Financing
Sources or any of their respective former, current or future Affiliates, or
any of the former, current or future general or limited partners,
shareholders, directors, officers, managers, employees, members, controlling
persons, advisors, attorneys, representatives or agents of any of the
foregoing and any heirs, executors, successors or assigns of any of the
foregoing, shall have any further liability or obligation (whether in law or
in equity and whether based on contract, tort or otherwise) based upon,
relating to or arising out of this Agreement, the Debt Financing, the Debt
Financing Commitments (including any breach or alleged breach hereof or
thereof) or the Transactions and (ii) Parent's receipt of the Termination Fee
or the Parent Expenses, as the case may be, from the Company pursuant to this
Section 8.5 (plus, in the case the Termination Fee or the Parent Expenses are
not timely paid, the amounts described in the first sentence of this Section
8.5(e)) shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent, Merger Sub and their
respective Affiliates against the Company, its Subsidiaries and any of their
respective Affiliates, and any of the former, current or future general or
limited partners, shareholders, directors, officers, employees, managers,
members or agents of any of the foregoing for any loss suffered as a result of
any breach of any covenant or agreement in this Agreement or the failure of
the Merger to be consummated, and upon payment of such amounts, none of the
Company, its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Affiliates, any of the
former, current or future general or limited partners, shareholders,
directors, officers, employees, managers, members or agents of any of the
foregoing, shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or
arising out of this Agreement or the Transactions.

  


 

  

(f) The Company (on behalf of itself and any of its Affiliates, its
shareholders, directors, officers, employees, managers, members or agents of
any of the foregoing) hereby waives any rights or claims against any Financing
Source Related Party in connection with this Agreement, the Debt Financing
Commitment, the Debt Financing or in respect of any other document or any of
the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or theory of law or equity
(whether in tort, contract or otherwise) or in respect of any oral or written
representations made or alleged to be made in connection herewith or therewith
and the Company agrees not to directly or indirectly commence any action or
proceeding against any Financing Source Related Party in connection with this
Agreement, the Debt Financing Commitment, the Debt Financing or in respect of
any other document or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby
or theory of law or equity. In furtherance and not in limitation of the
foregoing waiver, it is acknowledged and agreed that no Financing Source
Related Party shall have any liability

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

78  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

for any claims or damages to the Company in connection with this Agreement,
the Debt Financing Commitment, the Debt Financing or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby. As used in this Agreement "Financing Sources
Related Parties" means each Financing Source, together with each former,
current and future Affiliate thereof and each former, current and future
officer, director, employee, partner, controlling person, advisor, attorney,
agent and representative of each such lender, other Person or Affiliate or the
heirs, executors, successors and assigns of any of the foregoing. Nothing in
this Section 8.5(f) shall limit, impair or otherwise modify (i) the rights of
any of the parties to the Debt Financing Commitments (including Parent, Merger
Sub or their respective Affiliates party to the Debt Financing Commitments)
enumerated in the Debt Financing Commitments in accordance with the express
terms and conditions thereof and (ii) any liability or obligation of any of
the Financing Sources, and/or any of the rights of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company or their respective Affiliates, under any of the definitive
documentation with respect to the Debt Financing.

PERFORMANCE.

  


 

  

(a) THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE DEEMED TO BE MADE IN AND IN ALL RESPECTS SHALL BE
INTERPRETED, CONSTRUED AND GOVERNED BY AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAW OF THE
STATE OF DELAWARE WITHOUT REGARD TO THE CONFLICTS OF LAW PRINCIPLES THEREOF TO
THE EXTENT THAT SUCH PRINCIPLES WOULD DIRECT A MATTER TO ANOTHER JURISDICTION,
EXCEPT THAT THE PROVISIONS OF THE LAWS OF THE COMMONWEALTH OF PENNSYLVANIA
SHALL APPLY (X) WITH RESPECT TO THE RIGHTS AND DUTIES OF THE BOARD OF
DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY AND (Y) WHERE SUCH PROVISIONS ARE OTHERWISE
MANDATORILY APPLICABLE; PROVIDED THAT, EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE EXPRESSLY PROVIDED
IN THE DEBT FINANCING COMMITMENTS, ANY LEGAL SUIT, ACTION, LITIGATION,
PROCEEDING OR CLAIM AGAINST ANY LENDERS, AGENTS OR ARRANGERS UNDER THE DEBT
FINANCING COMMITMENTS AND THEIR RESPECTIVE AFFILIATES, SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS
AND ANY OTHER FINANCING SOURCE RELATED PARTY (WHETHER IN LAW OR EQUITY OR IN
CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) SHALL BE GOVERNED, INCLUDING AS TO VALIDITY,
INTERPRETATION AND EFFECT, BY THE INTERNAL LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK. The
parties hereby irrevocably submit to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of
any Federal court located in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and any state
court located in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania (the "Chosen Courts") solely
in respect of the interpretation and enforcement of the provisions of this
Agreement and of the documents referred to in this Agreement, and in respect
of the Transactions, and hereby waive, and agree not to assert, as a defense
in any action, suit or proceeding for the interpretation or enforcement hereof
or of any such document, that it is not subject thereto or that such action,
suit or proceeding may not be brought or is not maintainable in the Chosen
Courts or that the Chosen Courts are an inconvenient forum or that the venue
thereof may not be appropriate, or that this Agreement or any such document
may not be enforced in or by such Chosen Courts, and the parties hereto
irrevocably agree that all claims relating to such action, suit or proceeding
shall be heard and determined in the Chosen Courts. The parties hereby consent
to and grant any such Chosen Court jurisdiction over the person of such
parties and, to the extent permitted by Law, over the subject matter of such
dispute and agree that mailing of process or other papers in connection with
any such action, suit or proceeding in the manner provided in Section 9.6 or
in such other manner as may be permitted by law shall be valid, effective and
sufficient service thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each of the parties
hereto agrees that it will not, and will not permit its

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

80  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

Affiliates to, bring or support any action, cause of action, claim, cross-
claim or third-party claim of any kind or description, whether in law or in
equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against any of the
Financing Sources and their respective former, current or future Affiliates
and their former, current or future general or limited partners, shareholders,
directors, officers, managers, employees, members, agents, representatives,
controlling persons, advisors or attorneys and any heirs, successors or
assigns of any of the foregoing in any way relating to this Agreement or any
of the Transactions, including with respect to any dispute arising out of or
relating in any way to the Debt Financing Commitments, the Debt Financing or
the performance thereof, in any forum other than the United States District
Court for the Southern District of New York or the Supreme Court of the State
of New York, New York County, located in the Borough of Manhattan in the City
of New York or, in either case, any appellate court thereof, and agree that
the waiver of jury trial set forth in Section 9.5(b) hereof shall be
applicable to any such proceeding.

  


 

  

(b) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES,
AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES
ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY ACTION,
SUIT OR PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT, THE CARVEOUT PURCHASE AGREEMENTS OR THE TRANSACTIONS (INCLUDING
WITH RESPECT TO THE DEBT FINANCING AND THE TRANSACTIONS RELATED THERETO). EACH
PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (i) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY
OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER
PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF SUCH ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING, SEEK TO
ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (ii) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED
THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (iii) EACH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER
VOLUNTARILY AND (iv) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT
BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION
9.5.

  


 

  

(c) The parties agree that (i) irreparable damage for which monetary damages,
even if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event
that the parties hereto do not perform the provisions of this Agreement
(including failing to take such actions as are required of it hereunder in
order to consummate the Transactions) in accordance with its specified terms
or otherwise breach such provisions, (ii) the provisions in Section 8.5 (A)
are not intended to and do not adequately compensate for the harm that would
result from a breach of this Agreement and (B) shall not diminish or otherwise
impair in any respect any party's right to specific enforcement and (iii) the
right of specific enforcement is an integral part of the Merger and the other
Transactions and without that right, none of the parties hereto would have
entered into this Agreement. The parties acknowledge and agree that the
parties shall be entitled to an injunction, specific performance and other
equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof, this being in

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

81  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

addition to any other remedy, subject to Section 9.5(d), to which they are
entitled at law or in equity. Without limitation of the foregoing and
notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the parties hereby
further acknowledge and agree that prior to the Closing, the Company shall be
entitled to seek specific performance to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of, and to prevent or cure breaches of Sections 6.5 and 6.14 by
Parent or Merger Sub. Each of Parent and Merger Sub agrees that it will not
oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and other equitable
relief on the basis that (x) the Company has an adequate remedy at law or (y)
an award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason
at law or equity. Any party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement shall not be required to provide any bond or
other security in connection with any such order or injunction.

  


 

  

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, including the
provisions of Section 9.5(c), it is explicitly agreed that the Company shall
be entitled to seek specific performance of Parent's obligation to cause the
Equity Financing to be funded to fund the Merger and to effect the Merger in
accordance with Section 1.2 in the event that, but only in the event that, (i)
all conditions in Sections 7.1 and 7.2 (other than those conditions that by
their nature cannot be satisfied until the Closing Date, but each of which
shall be capable of being satisfied on the Closing Date) have been satisfied
or waived at the time when the Closing would have occurred, (ii) the Debt
Financing (or, if alternative financing is being used pursuant to Section
6.14(a), pursuant to the commitments with respect thereto) has been funded or
will be funded at the Closing if the Equity Financing is funded at the
Closing, and (iii) the Company has irrevocably confirmed in writing that if
specific performance is granted and the Equity Financing and the Debt
Financing are funded, then it would take such actions that are within its
control to cause the Closing to occur pursuant to Section 1.2. For the
avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the Company be entitled to enforce or
seek to enforce specifically the obligation to cause the Equity Financing to
be funded or to complete the Merger if the Debt Financing or the alternative
financing as set forth in Section 6.14(a) pursuant to the commitments with
respect thereto has not been funded (or will not be funded at the Closing if
the Equity Financing is funded at the Closing). The Company shall be permitted
and entitled to seek both a grant of specific performance and payment of the
Parent Termination Fee; provided that under no circumstance shall the Company
be permitted or entitled to receive both (1) a grant of specific performance
to cause the Equity Financing to be funded and the Merger to be consummated
that results in the Closing and (2) payment of the Parent Termination Fee. For
the avoidance of doubt, (A) under no circumstances will the Company be
entitled to monetary damages in excess of (1) any amounts payable pursuant to
Section 8.5(c), (2) any reimbursement obligation of Parent pursuant to the
first sentence of Section 8.5(e) and (3) the reimbursement and indemnification
obligations of Parent contained in Sections 6.14(c), 6.17, 6.18, 6.19 and 6.20
and (B) under no circumstances will Parent be entitled to monetary damages in
excess of (1) any amounts payable pursuant to Section 8.5(b) or Section 8.5(d)
and (2) any reimbursement obligations of the Company pursuant to the first
sentence of Section 8.5(e).

except that the restrictions on prohibited discussions or arrangements and the

TRANSACTIONS, NOTWITHSTANDING THE DELIVERY OR DISCLOSURE TO THE OTHER OR THE
OTHER'S AFFILIATES, REPRESENTATIVES OF ANY DOCUMENTATION OR OTHER INFORMATION
WITH RESPECT TO ANY ONE OR MORE OF THE FOREGOING.

  


 

  

SECTION 9.8. No Third Party Beneficiaries. Except (i) as provided in Section

to the indemnification obligations of Parent pursuant to Section 6.14(c)

(Governing Law and Venue), Section 9.5(b) (Waiver of Jury Trial), Section 9.12
(Severability) and Section 9.14 (Assignment) (and the related defined terms
contained in the foregoing provisions), Parent and the Company hereby agree
that their respective representations, warranties and covenants set forth
herein are solely for the benefit of the other party hereto, in accordance
with and subject to the terms of this Agreement, and this Agreement is not
intended to, and does not, confer upon any Person other than the parties
hereto any rights or remedies hereunder, including the right to rely upon the
representations and warranties set forth herein. The parties hereto further
agree that the rights of third party beneficiaries under Section 6.11 shall
not arise unless and until the Effective Time occurs. The representations and
warranties in this Agreement are the product of negotiations among the parties
hereto and are for the sole benefit of the parties hereto. Any inaccuracies in
such representations and warranties are subject to waiver by the parties
hereto in accordance with Section 9.3 without notice or liability to any other
Person. In some instances, the representations and warranties in this
Agreement may represent an allocation among the parties hereto of risks
associated with particular matters regardless of the knowledge of any of the
parties hereto. Consequently, Persons other than the parties hereto may not
rely upon the representations and warranties in this Agreement as
characterizations of actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this
Agreement or as of any other date.

  


 

  

SECTION 9.9. Obligations of Parent and of the Company. Whenever this Agreement
requires an Affiliate of Parent to take any action, such requirement shall be
deemed to include an undertaking on the part of Parent to cause such Affiliate
to take such action. Whenever this Agreement requires an Affiliate of the
Company to take any action, such requirement shall be deemed to include an
undertaking on the part of the

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

85  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

Company to cause such Affiliate to take such action and, after the Effective
Time, on the part of the Surviving Corporation to cause such Affiliate to take
such action.

  


 

  

SECTION 9.10. Transfer Taxes. Except as provided in Section 4.2(b), all
transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other such Taxes
and fees (including penalties and interest) incurred in connection with the
Merger shall be paid by Parent and Merger Sub when due.

  


 

  

SECTION 9.11. Definitions. Each of the terms set forth in Annex A is defined
in the Section of this Agreement set forth opposite such term.

  


 

  

SECTION 9.12. Severability. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed
severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not
affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions hereof. If any
provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof to any Person or any
circumstance, is invalid or unenforceable, (a) a suitable and equitable
provision shall be substituted therefor in order to carry out, so far as may
be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid or
unenforceable provision and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and the
application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances shall not be
affected by such invalidity or unenforceability, nor shall such invalidity or
unenforceability affect the validity or enforceability of such provision, or
the application thereof, in any other jurisdiction.

  


 

  

SECTION 9.13. Interpretation; Construction.

  


 

  

(a) The table of contents and headings herein are for convenience of reference
only, do not constitute part of this Agreement and shall not be deemed to
limit or otherwise affect any of the provisions hereof. Where a reference in
this Agreement is made to a Section or Exhibit, such reference shall be to a
Section of or Exhibit to this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. Whenever
the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement,
they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation." The
words "date hereof" when used in this Agreement shall refer to the date of
this Agreement. The word "extent" in the phrase "to the extent" shall mean the
degree to which a subject or other thing extends, and such phrase shall not
mean simply "if". The words "made available to Parent" and words of similar
import refer to documents (i) posted to the Intralinks Datasite by or on
behalf of the Company or (ii) delivered in person or electronically to Parent,
Merger Sub or their respective representatives and advisors. All pronouns and
all variations thereof shall be deemed to refer to the masculine, feminine or
neuter, singular or plural, as the identity of the Person may require. Where a
reference in this Agreement is made to any agreement (including this
Agreement), contract, statute or regulation, such references are to, except as
context may otherwise require, the agreement, contract, statute or regulation
as amended, modified, supplemented, restated or replaced from time to time (in
the case of an agreement or contract, to the extent permitted by the terms
thereof); and to any section of any statute or regulation including any
successor to the section and, in the case of any statute, any rules or
regulations promulgated thereunder. All references to "dollars" or

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

86  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

"$" in this Agreement are to United States dollars. All references to "days"
shall be to calendar days unless otherwise indicated as a "Business Day."

  


 

  

(b) The parties have participated jointly in negotiating and drafting this
Agreement. In the event that an ambiguity or a question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly
by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or
disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provision of this
Agreement.

  


 

  

(c) Each party hereto has or may have set forth information in its respective
disclosure letter (each, a "Disclosure Letter") in a section thereof that
corresponds to the section of this Agreement to which it relates. The mere
inclusion of any item in any section or subsection of any party's Disclosure
Letter as an exception to any representation or warranty or otherwise shall
not, in and of itself, be deemed to constitute an admission by the applicable
party, or to otherwise imply, that any such item (i) has had or is reasonably
likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect or otherwise represents an
exception or material fact, event or circumstance for the purposes of this
Agreement, (ii) did not arise in the ordinary course of business or in a
manner consistent with past practice or (iii) meets or exceeds a monetary or
other threshold specified for disclosure in this Agreement. Inclusion of any
item in a Disclosure Letter shall not constitute, or be deemed to be, an
admission by any party to any third party of any matter whatsoever (including
any violation of applicable Law or breach of Contract), nor shall it be deemed
to establish a standard for materiality or a Company Material Adverse Effect.
Matters disclosed in any section or subsection of a party's Disclosure Letter
are not necessarily limited to matters that are required by this Agreement to
be disclosed therein. Such additional matters are set forth for informational
purposes only and do not necessarily include other matters of a similar nature
or impose any duty or obligation to disclose any information beyond what is
required by this Agreement, and disclosure of such additional matters shall
not affect, directly or indirectly, the interpretation of this Agreement or
the scope of the disclosure obligations hereunder. Headings inserted in the
sections or subsections of any party's Disclosure Letter are for convenience
of reference only and shall not have the effect of amending or changing the
express terms of the sections or subsections as set forth in this Agreement.

  


 

  

SECTION 9.14. Assignment. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to
the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors, legal
representatives and permitted assigns. No party to this Agreement may assign
any of its rights or delegate any of its obligations under this Agreement, by
operation of Law or otherwise, without the prior written consent of the other
party hereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to the mailing of the Proxy
Statement to the Company's shareholders, Parent may designate, by written
notice to the Company, another wholly owned direct or indirect Subsidiary to
be a Constituent Corporation in lieu of Merger Sub, in which event all
references herein to Merger Sub shall be deemed references to such other
Subsidiary, except that all representations and warranties made herein with
respect to Merger Sub as of the date of this Agreement shall be deemed
representations and warranties made with respect to such other Subsidiary as
of the date of such designation; provided that any such designation shall not
impede or delay the consummation of the Transactions or otherwise

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

87  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

materially impede the rights of the shareholders of the Company under this
Agreement. Any purported assignment in violation of this Agreement is void.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Parent and Merger
Sub may assign their rights under this Agreement (in whole or in part) to any
of the Financing Sources as collateral security.
