if  the amount of the re-calculated Purchase Price is less than the amount

decrease together with interest thereon from and including the  Effective
Date to the date of payment at the rate of seven percent (7%)  per annum,
calculated and compounded annually;  or

of  Closing using the amounts then set out in the Preliminary Closing 
Statement, then the Purchaser shall forthwith pay to the Vendor the amount 
of such increase together with interest thereon from and including the 
Effective Date to the date of payment at the rate of seven percent (7%)  per
annum, calculated and compounded annually.

States dollars at the exchange rate published in The Wall Street Journal five

or causes to be filed an amended Tax Return that is in  respect of, or
affects, any Taxes for which the Purchaser will seek  indemnification from
the Vendor, the Purchaser shall provide such Tax  Return(s) to the Vendor for
review in the manner prescribed by this  Subsection 6.2(c).

6.3 Tax Refunds for Pre-Closing Periods. The parties hereto agree that any
refunds of Taxes received by the Intercon Entities at any time in respect of
any Taxes paid by the Intercon Entities which are attributable to any Pre-
Closing Period (other than any such refund that was included in the
calculation of the Working Capital Amount of either Intercon or BLW, Inc. in
accordance with the applicable provisions of Article 3 in order to make the
adjustments contemplated in Sections 3.3 and 3.5) shall be solely for the
account of the Vendor and, upon receipt of any such refund of Taxes by an
Intercon Entity, the Purchaser shall cause such Intercon Entity to pay over
to the Vendor 100% of the total amount of such refund of Taxes (net only of
any income Taxes that, in accordance with applicable Laws, are required to be
paid by the such Intercon Entity on such refund of Taxes) within 15 days
following the receipt thereof by such Intercon Entity; provided that, there
shall be excluded from the scope of this Section 6.3 all tax refunds
attributable to the VAR Payments referred to in Subsection 3.8(c).

 

 

6.4 Allocation of Tax Liability.

 

 

       

(a)

    |  

The  Vendor shall pay or cause to be paid when due and payable all Taxes of 
each of the Intercon Entities, to the extent allocable to any Pre-Closing 
Period (including any pre-Effective Time portion of a Straddle Period) in 
excess of any such Tax amounts specifically included in the computation of 
the Working Capital Amount of either Intercon or BLW, Inc. in accordance 
with the applicable provisions of Article 3 and the Purchaser shall  so pay
or cause to be paid such Taxes for any Post-Closing Period  (including any
post-Effective Time portion of a Straddle  Period).

-48-  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

       

(b)

    |  

For  the purpose of allocating Taxes in respect of a Straddle Period
between  the pre-Effective Time portion and post-Effective Time portion of
such  Straddle Period, the Tax liabilities of the Intercon Entities shall
be  determined as follows:

    
---|--- 
   

 

 

       

 

    |  

(i)

    |  

the  amount of any Taxes which are:

    
---|---|--- 
   

 

 

       

 

    |  

(A)

    |  

based  on or measured by income or receipts of the Intercon Entities (such
as,  for example, but not limited to, income taxes);  or

    
---|---|--- 
   

 

 

       

 

    |  

(B)

    |  

based  on transactions, occurrences or events (such as, for example, but
not  limited to, land transfer taxes payable on the purchase or sale of
real  property, sales and use taxes and payroll taxes)

    
---|---|--- 
   

 

 

shall be apportioned between the Pre-Closing Period and the Post-Closing
Period based on an interim closing of the books as of the close of business
as at the Effective Time;

 

 

       

 

    |  

(ii)

    |  

the  amount of any Taxes of the Intercon Entities that are not reasonably 
apportioned based on an interim closing of the books but rather are 
applicable to a period of time (such as, for example, but not limited to, 
municipal property (or occupancy) taxes on real property and premiums paid 
under government health care programs) shall be apportioned to the  Pre-
Closing Period by multiplying the amount of such Taxes for the entire  period
by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in such  period
ending on the Effective Date and the denominator of which is the  total
number of days in the entire period, and the balance of any such  Taxes shall
be apportioned to the Post-Closing  Period;

    
---|---|--- 
   

 

 

       

 

    |  

(iii)

    |  

the  liability and deduction for franchise taxes based on income or gross 
receipts shall be determined on the basis of the period during which such 
income or gross receipts were earned and without regard to the period for 
which any privilege to exercise such franchise is granted;  and

    
---|---|--- 
   

 

 

       

 

    |  

(iv)

    |  

notwithstanding  anything in this Section 6.4(b) to the contrary, the amount
of any Taxes  related to transactions, occurrences or events occurring after
the  Effective Time and before the Time of Closing that are outside of the 
ordinary course of business of the Intercon Entities (and are not  Pre-
Closing Matters) shall be apportioned to the Pre-Closing Period  (examples
include Taxes related to the transfer of the Excluded Assets and  Taxes
related to the payment of the FS Loan  Amount).

    
---|---|--- 
   

 

 

       

(c)

    |  

The  Purchaser shall pay to the Vendor an amount equal to the VAR Tax
Benefit,  if any, actually realized for any Post-Closing Period by the
Purchaser,  any Subsidiary of the Purchaser or any consolidated, unitary or
affiliated  group of which any such entity is a member. Such payment shall 
be due five (5) Business Days after the date on which the Purchaser (or  any
Subsidiary of the Purchaser or any consolidated, unitary or affiliated  group
of which any such entity is a member) filed an annual (or part-year,  in the
case of a short tax year) federal, provincial or state income Tax  Return
with respect to the period for which the VAR Tax Benefit is  actually
realized. "VAR Tax Benefit" means  any reduction in U.S. and Canadian
federal, provincial or state income  Taxes of the Purchaser, any Subsidiary
of the Purchaser or any  consolidated, unitary or affiliated group of which
any such entity is a  member arising as a result of the payment of the VAR 
Payments.

6.5 Control of Pre-Closing Period Tax Audits.

 

 

       

(a)

    |  

The  Vendor shall, subject to Subsection 6.2(c) and Subsection 6.5(c), 
control the conduct (including the granting of any extension or waiver of  a
statute of limitations) of any Tax audit, assessment or examination (a  "Tax
Claim") for  Taxes relating to periods covered by Tax Returns described in 
Subsection 6.2(a) (whether or not a claim for indemnification has  been
made).

    
---|--- 
   

 

 

       

(b)

    |  

The  parties hereto agree that all costs and expenses related to the
matters  specified in Subsection 6.5(a) shall be paid in full by the Vendor 
(provided that, there shall not be any charge for the services of any 
employees of the Purchaser and the Intercon Entities who are involved in 
dealing with such matters).

    
---|--- 
   

 

 

       

(c)

    |  

For  any Tax Claim relating to Taxes for Straddle Periods, the Vendor or
the  Purchaser, as the case may be, shall have the right to participate in
any  such Tax Claim to the extent that such Tax Claim may affect Taxes for 
which such party is or may be liable under this  Agreement. Without the prior
written consent of the  indemnifying party, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, no  indemnified party (or any of its Affiliates) shall
agree or consent to  compromise or settle, either administratively or after
the commencement of  any such Tax Claim, or otherwise agree or consent to any
Tax liability, to  the extent that any such compromise, settlement, consent
or agreement may  affect Taxes for which the indemnifying party is liable
under  this Agreement.

    
---|--- 
   

 

 

       

(d)

    |  

If  a notice or other communication is received by an Intercon Entity or
the  Purchaser of either:

    
---|--- 
   

 

 

       

 

    |  

(i)

    |  

a  proposed Tax audit or examination of an Intercon Entity in respect of
any  Pre-Closing Period; or

    
---|---|--- 
   

 

 

       

 

    |  

(ii)

    |  

the  assessment of any Taxes against an Intercon Entity for any Pre-Closing 
Period,

    
---|---|--- 
   

 

 

such notice or other communication (any such notice or other communication
being referred to in this Section 6.5 as a "Tax Notice") shall be forthwith
provided to the Vendor in accordance with the requirements of Section 15.2;
provided that the failure to provide a Tax Notice or delay in providing the
Tax Notice to the Vendor will not relieve the Vendor of the Vendor's
obligations pursuant to Section 6.4 or Article 13, except to the extent that
the Vendor is materially prejudiced as a result thereof.

 

 

       

(e)

    |  

The  Vendor shall not settle or otherwise compromise a Tax Claim without
the  Purchaser's prior written consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably  withheld). The Vendor shall keep the Purchaser informed as to 
the status of such proceedings (including by providing copies of all  notices
received from and sent to the relevant Authority) and the  Purchaser shall
have the right to attend (and, to the extent that the  resolution of such Tax
Claim could materially adversely affect the  liability of the Purchaser or
any Intercon Entity for Taxes for which it  is not indemnified pursuant to
Section 13.1, participate in), using  counsel of its own choosing and at its
own expense, all proceedings  (including meetings and conference calls)
relating to any Tax  Claim.

    
---|--- 
   

 

 

6.6 Post Closing Tax Matters. The Vendor acknowledges that it
understands that the intention of the Purchaser, following the acquisition by
the Purchaser of the Purchased Shares, is to:

 

 

       

(a)

    |  

cause  the winding-up of Newco 1 pursuant to subsection 88(1) of the Tax 
Act;

    
---|--- 
   

 

 

       

(b)

    |  

amalgamate  the Purchaser with Intercon; and

    
---|--- 
   

 

 

       

(c)

    |  

take  such other steps as may be required or advisable such that the "cost
amounts" (as  defined in the Tax Act) to the entity formed on the
amalgamation of the  shares of FirstService (USA) Security Holdings, Inc. and
Newco 2,  respectively, will be determined in accordance with subsection
87(11) of  the Tax Act, including an addition to such cost amounts determined
under  paragraphs 87(11)(b) and 88(1)(d) of the Tax  Act.

    
---|--- 
   

 

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-50-  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

To assist in ensuring that the interests in such shares do not constitute
"ineligible property" within the meaning of paragraph 88(1)(c) of the Tax
Act, the Vendor represents and covenants that, except as otherwise provided
for in this Agreement:

 

 

       

(d)

    |  

the  Vendor and any Person with whom the Vendor does not deal at arm's
length  (within the meaning of the Tax Act) (a "Restricted Person") will 
not, without the prior written consent of the Purchaser, as part of the 
series of transactions or events that includes the acquisition by the 
Purchaser of Intercon (the "Acquisition Series"),  acquire any shares of the
capital stock of Tyco International, Ltd., any  debt of Tyco International,
Ltd., or any other security of Tyco  International, Ltd. or its Affiliates or
any Substituted Property;  provided that, such prohibition on the Vendor and
each Restricted Person  acquiring any debt of Tyco International, Ltd. or its
Affiliates shall not  extend to any debt that may arise in connection with
(or otherwise in  relation to) the transactions provided for in this
Agreement between the  Vendor and Restricted Persons, on the one hand, and
Tyco International,  Ltd. or any of its Affiliates, on the other  hand;

    
---|--- 
   

 

 

       

(e)

    |  

the  Vendor and any Restricted Person will not own, after the Closing Date,
any  shares of the capital stock of Tyco International, Ltd., any debt of
Tyco  International, Ltd., or any other security of Tyco International, Ltd.
or  its Affiliates or any Substituted Property that was acquired prior to
such  time as part of the Acquisition Series; and

    
---|--- 
   

 

 

       

(f)

    |  

the  Vendor will use all reasonable efforts to ensure  that:

    
---|--- 
   

 

 

       

 

    |  

(i)

    |  

any  corporation, partnership or trust in which the Vendor or any
Restricted  Person is, at any time during the course of the Acquisition
Series and  after the Closing Date, a "specified shareholder"  (for the
purposes of subparagraph 88(1)(c)(vi) of the Tax Act);  and

    
---|---|--- 
   

 

 

       

 

    |  

(ii)

    |  

any  corporation, partnership or trust in which the Vendor or any
Restricted  Person would be, at any time during the course of the Acquisition
Series  and after the Closing Date, a "specified shareholder"  (for the
purposes of subparagraph 88(1)(c)(vi) of the Tax Act) if all  the shares,
partnership interests and trust interests of such corporation,  partnership
or trust, respectively, then owned by the Vendor or any  Restricted Person
who acquired such shares or interests as part of the  Series that were owned
at that time by the Vendor or any Restricted  Person,

    
---|---|--- 
   

 

 

will not, without the prior written consent of the Purchaser, as part of
the Acquisition Series, acquire after the Closing Date any shares of the
capital stock of Tyco International, Ltd., any debt of Tyco International,
Ltd. or any other security of Tyco International, Ltd. or any of its
Affiliates or any Substituted Property.

 

 

6.7 Termination of Certain Plans. With respect to any frozen or
otherwise inactive United States Employee Benefit Plan that is a defined
contribution plan under Section 401(k) of the Code ("401(k) Plan"), the
Vendor shall authorize each of the Intercon Entities having any such 401(k)
Plan to terminate any such 401(k) Plan via board resolution, effective on the
day immediately preceding the Effective Date; and a copy of such board
resolution terminating any such 401(k) Plan shall be provided to the
Purchaser at the Time of Closing.

Guarantor under Section 3.7 shall also continue to apply fully to such
payment, reimbursement and other obligations of the Purchaser notwithstanding

7.12 Flexible Spending Account Reimbursement. The Purchaser and the Vendor
agree, with respect to each flexible spending reimbursement account under any
cafeteria plan qualifying under Section 125 of the Code that is sponsored by
an Intercon Entity (a "FSR Account"), that the Vendor shall cause each such
FSR Account that has a plan year that ends prior to the Effective Date to be
terminated and no new personnel accepted from and after the Agreement Date
for enrollment therein; and as to any other FSR Account, forthwith following

Effective Date, a calculation shall be made of the aggregate amount balance
of those participants in such FSR Account who were participants during such
plan year at any time prior to the Effective Time (collectively, the "Pre-
Closing Participants"); and:

 

 

       

(a)

    |  

if  such aggregate amount balance is less than $0, the Vendor shall pay to
the  Purchaser that amount which is equal to the result obtained when the 
amount by which $0 exceeds such aggregate amount balance is multiplied by  a
fraction, the numerator of which is equal to the number of days  comprising

and the denominator of which is  365;

if  such aggregate amount balance is greater than $0, the Purchaser shall

such  aggregate amount balance (or the portion thereof refundable to BLW,
Inc.  (or any successor thereof), as the case may be, net of any Taxes
required  to be paid by BLW, Inc. in respect of such refund) is multiplied by
a  fraction, the numerator of which is equal to the number of days
comprising  the period commencing on January 1, 2008 and ending on the
Effective Date  and the denominator of which is 365.

    
---|--- 
   

 

 

For the purposes hereof, the "aggregate amount balance" of an FSR Account as
at the time then being referred to shall be equal to the amount contributed
to such FSR Account by or on behalf of the Pre-Closing Participants in such
FSR Account in respect of the 2008 calendar year less the amount of
reimbursable claims paid from such FSR Account for or in respect of the Pre-
Closing Participants in such FSR Account in respect of the 2008 calendar
year.

referred to in Subsection 7.14(a) shall be subject to the prior  written
consent of the Vendor (which consent shall not be unreasonably  withheld but
may be conditioned in any reasonable manner). Each  Contract that
memorializes any such retention arrangement or otherwise  provides for the
replacement, amendment or termination of any existing  employment arrangement
or other Contract providing benefits to any such  individual, including with
respect to value appreciation right (and other  similar) payments, or for
consulting services to be performed by any such  individual following the
termination of employment, is referred  to in this Agreement as a
"Retention  Agreement". Provided that the Purchaser is acting in a  fair and
equitable manner, the Vendor shall not, and shall cause the  Intercon
Entities not to, endeavour to dissuade any employee of any  Intercon Entity
from accepting any Contract terms offered by the  Purchaser, and the Vendor

and approved for distribution, a copy of the annual financial statements of
the Intercon Entities as at March 31, 2008 and for the fiscal year of the

financial statements shall be completed and whether or not such completion
shall occur prior to the Time of Closing.

matters constituting the basis of the Loss at or before the Closing Date.

 

 

13.3 Indemnification Procedure.

 

 

       

(a)

    |  

If  a Person who is either a "Purchaser's Indemnified  Person" or a
"Vendor's Indemnified  Person" (such Person being sometimes referred to in
this  Article 13 as the "Indemnified Person")  wishes to assert a claim for
indemnity against a Person liable to it under  this Article 13 (such liable
Person being sometimes referred to in  this Article 13 as the "Indemnifier"),
it can  only do so by giving a notice in writing (a "Claim Notice") to the 
Indemnifier as soon as is reasonably practicable, which Claim Notice must 
provide reasonable particulars of the matters for which indemnity is then 
being sought and the amount of any actual Losses suffered, sustained or 
incurred by the Indemnified Person in connection with the matter in  respect
of which indemnity is so being sought or a good faith estimate  thereof.

which  to cure or rectify, at its sole cost, the matters for which indemnity
is  being sought, as specified in such Claim Notice, and the Indemnifier
shall  forthwith do all that is reasonably within its power to do so as to
cause  or effect such cure or rectification.

    
---|--- 
   

 

 

       

(c)

    |  

If  the matter for which indemnity is sought:

    
---|--- 
   

 

 

       

 

    |  

(i)

    |  

has  been fully cured or rectified to either the satisfaction of the
Purchaser  (if the Indemnified Person seeking indemnity for such matter is a
Person  who is a "Purchaser\'s  Indemnified Person") or the satisfaction of
the Vendor (if the  Indemnified Person seeking indemnity for such matter is a
Person who is a  "Vendor\'s Indemnified  Person"), acting reasonably, on or
prior to the expiration of the  Cure Period, the Indemnifier shall have no
further liability to the  Indemnified Person in respect thereof; or

    
---|---|--- 
   

 

 

       

 

    |  

(ii)

    |  

has  not been fully cured or rectified to either the satisfaction of the

Person who is a "Purchaser\'s Indemnified  Person") or the satisfaction of
the Vendor (if the Indemnified  Person seeking indemnity for such matter is a
Person who is a "Vendor\'s Indemnified  Person"), acting reasonably, prior to
the expiration of the Cure  Period, the Indemnifier shall, forthwith upon the
expiration of the Cure  Period, pay to the Indemnified Person the amount
payable in respect of  that matter pursuant to this Article 13.

indemnified under this Subsection 13.4(b)) and, once such $1,000,000  total
amount is reached, the Vendor\'s Indemnified Persons (and each of  them)
shall thereafter be entitled to indemnification in accordance with  this
Article 13 without any further deductible being applicable  thereto; and

    |  

(1)

    |  

unpaid  Taxes (including any fines, penalties and interest on such unpaid

(D)

    |  

any  payments in respect of indemnification for any Loss attributable to
fraud  or willful misrepresentation;

and for the avoidance of doubt any payments made in respect of the matters
subject to this Paragraph 13.4(c)(iii) shall not be counted against the

it  shall be permitted to aggregate multiple Losses that are similar in
nature  for the purposes of calculating whether such Losses exceed such
$25,000  threshold or the deductible applicable according to  Subsection
13.4(a) or 13.4(b), as the case may be, or both the  $25,000 threshold and
the applicable deductible;  and

    |  

(B)

    |  

in  the event that such Loss or series of similar Losses shall exceed
$25,000,  then the full amount of such Loss or series of similar Losses shall
be  taken into account in calculating whether the aggregate amount of
Losses  exceeds the applicable deductible; and

    
---|---|--- 
   

 

 

       

 

    |  

(v)

    |  

for  purposes of determining whether there has been a breach or inaccuracy of
a  representation or warranty of the Vendor in this Agreement in connection 
with the assertion of a claim for indemnification under Section 13.1 by  any
of the Purchaser's Indemnified Persons, or determining the amount of a  Loss
by any of them with respect to any asserted breach or inaccuracy,  such
determination shall be made without regard to "materiality", "Material
Adverse  Change" and similar qualifications.

Agreement or in any of the other Transaction Documents.

(a)

    |  

Notwithstanding  any other provision of this Article 13, if, in respect of
any matter  for which indemnity is claimed pursuant to this Article 13, the 
Vendor (if the Indemnified Person in relation to such matter is a Person  who
is a "Vendor\'s  Indemnified Person") or the Purchaser (if the Indemnified
Person in  relation to such matter is a Person who is a "Purchaser\'s
Indemnified  Person") shall receive any insurance proceeds under any policy
of  insurance contracted for by the Vendor or any Intercon Entity (each, an 
"Eligible Policy")  as compensation for such matter, the amount which the
Indemnifier is  liable to pay in respect of such matter shall be reduced by
the amount of  the insurance proceeds so received (net of any right of
recoupment by an  underwriter and net of any out of pocket expenses incurred
by the  recipient of such insurance proceeds in connection with pursuing
such  insurance recovery, including deductibles and increased insurance 
premiums) within twelve (12) months after making a claim for indemnity 
hereunder.

    
---|--- 
   

 

 

       

(b)

    |  

Each  of the Vendor and the Purchaser hereto agrees that it shall use 
commercially reasonable efforts to collect upon those Eligible Policies  then
in effect, if any, which provide coverage in respect of a matter for  which
indemnification is provided under this Article 13 (provided  that nothing in
this Section 13.7 shall be construed as imposing any  obligation to obtain or
maintain any such insurance policies or commence  any litigation by any party
hereto or any insurance company on behalf of a  party to this Agreement). The
foregoing shall not affect the  subrogation rights of any insurance company
making payments on account of  any insured.

(a)

"Purchaser\'s Indemnified  Person", in the capacity of an "Indemnified
Person"  under this Article 13, to act in good faith, use reasonable
efforts  to mitigate Losses, use similar discretion in the use of personnel
and the  incurring of expenses as it would use if it were acting entirely at
its  own cost and for its own account and consult regularly with the 
Indemnifier regarding the conduct of any proceedings or the taking of any 
action for which indemnification may be sought.

    
---|--- 
   

 

 

       

(b)

mitigate Losses, use similar discretion in the use of personnel and the 
incurring of expenses as it would use if it were acting entirely at its  own
