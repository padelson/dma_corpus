formed under the laws of Japan (" _Guarantor_ "), in favor of Mirant Asia-
Pacific Ventures, Inc., a Delaware corporation (" ** _Ventures_** "), and
Mirant Asia-Pacific Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation (" ** _Holdings_**
" and, each of Ventures and Holdings, a " ** _Seller_** " and together, " **

W I T N E S S E T H :

  

WHEREAS, Sellers and Tokyo Crimson Energy Holdings Corporation, a company
existing and organized under the laws of the Cayman Islands (Tokyo Crimson
Energy Holdings Corporation and its successors by law and permitted assigns,
" _Buyer_ "), have entered into that certain Stock and Note Purchase
Agreement, dated as of the date of this Guaranty (as it may be amended,
modified or supplemented from time to time in accordance with its terms, the
" _Stock and Note Purchase Agreement_ "), for the purchase by Buyer of all of
the ordinary shares of Mirant Asia-Pacific Limited, a Bermuda exempted
company, and certain intercompany notes held by Mirant Sweden International
AB (publ), a public limited liability company organized under the laws of
Sweden;

  

WHEREAS, Guarantor is an indirect fifty percent (50%) shareholder of Buyer;
and

  

WHEREAS, in connection with the execution of the Stock and Note Purchase
Agreement, the parties hereto wish to enter into this Guaranty pursuant to
which Guarantor agrees, subject to the terms, conditions and limitations
stated herein, to provide a guaranty of the payment obligations of Buyer
under the Stock and Note Purchase Agreement.

  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual terms, conditions and
other agreements set forth herein, the receipt and sufficiency of which are
hereby acknowledged, intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto
agree as follows:

  

 _Section 1._ Except as otherwise defined herein, capitalized terms used
herein shall have the meanings given to them in the Stock and Note Purchase
Agreement.

  

 _Section 2._ Guarantor hereby irrevocably, absolutely and unconditionally
guarantees the full and timely satisfaction by Buyer of all of Buyers
payment obligations to Sellers under the Stock and Note Purchase Agreement
and the other documents executed and delivered by Buyer to Sellers in
connection with the closing of the transactions contemplated under the Stock
and Note Purchase Agreement (collectively and, together with the Stock and
Note Purchase Agreement, the " _Closing Documents_ "), including, without
limitation, the payment of any and all Damages arising under the Closing
Documents for which Buyer is liable to Sellers (the " _Guaranteed
Obligations_ "); provided that Guarantors aggregate liability under this
Guaranty (including, without limitation, this Section 2) shall not, in any
event and under any circumstance and notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Guaranty or any agreement or document related
hereto, exceed the amount (such amount, the " _Guaranty Limit_ ") that is
equal to the positive mathematical result of (x) three hundred  

   

million US dollars (US$300,000,000) minus (y) the sum of (i) fifty (50%)
percent of any and all payments made by Buyer to Seller under the Stock and
Note Purchase Agreement (including, without limitation, any payments in
respect of the Purchase Price) and under the other Closing Documents and (ii)
any and all amounts drawn against the Letter of Credit procured by Guarantor
pursuant to Section 1.7 of the Stock and Note Purchase Agreement. Guarantor
agrees that, in the event that Buyer fails to timely satisfy any of its
payment obligations to Sellers under the Closing Documents, then Guarantor
will pay, subject to at all times the Guaranty Limit, such Guaranteed
Obligations in the place and stead of Buyer; it being acknowledged and agreed
that the Guaranty Limit shall only apply as a limitation of Guarantors
liability and payment obligations under this Guaranty and shall not apply as
a limitation of Buyers liability and payment obligations under the Closing
Documents. In the event Buyer becomes obligated to pay any Guaranteed
Obligations and fails to timely pay such obligations in accordance with the
terms of the Closing Documents, then Sellers may provide written notice to
Guarantor demanding that Guarantor either cause Buyer to pay the Guaranteed
Obligations or to pay, subject at all times to the Guaranty Limit, such
Guaranteed Obligations in the place and stead of Buyer.

  

 _Section 3._ Guarantor represents and warrants to Sellers as follows:

  

(a) It is duly organized, validly existing, and in good standing under the
laws of Japan. It has the power and authority to execute and deliver this
Guaranty and to perform its obligations hereunder.

  

(b) The execution and delivery by it of this Guaranty and the performance of
its obligations hereunder have been duly authorized by all necessary
corporate action.

  

(c) This Guaranty has been duly executed and delivered by it and constitutes
a valid and binding obligation of it, enforceable against it in accordance
with its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency and similar laws
affecting creditors rights generally and to general principles of equity.

  

(d) The execution and delivery by it of this Guaranty, and the performance by
it of its obligations hereunder, do not and will not (i) violate or
contravene any provision of its organizational documents, (ii) violate any
law or order of any Governmental Authority to which it is subject, or (iii)
conflict with or result in a breach of any material term or provision of or
constitute a default under or result in the maturing of any indebtedness
pursuant to any material indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan agreement,
or other material instrument to which it is a party or by which its
properties are bound.

  

(e) No notice or filing with, or approval of, any Governmental Authority is
required by it for the due execution, delivery or performance of this
Guaranty or for the validity or enforceability thereof.

  

 _Section 4._ The obligations of Guarantor hereunder shall remain in full
force and effect without regard to, and shall not be affected or impaired by
any of the following, any of which may be taken without the consent of, or
notice to, Guarantor:

  

(a) any lack of legality, validity or enforceability of the Closing Documents
or any of the payment obligations thereunder;

     

   

(b) any amendment, modification, addition, supplement or extension of or to
any part of the Closing Documents;

  

(c) any exercise or non-exercise by Sellers of any right or privilege under
the Closing Documents;

  

(d) any extension (including without limitation extensions of time for
payment), renewal, amendment, restructuring or restatement of, or any
acceptance of late or partial payments under, the Closing Documents;

  

(e) any bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, dissolution, liquidation or
similar proceeding relating to Buyer or any affiliate of Buyer (other than
Guarantor);

  

(f) the existence of any facts or circumstances which cause (or result in)
any of the representations or warranties of Buyer under the Closing Documents
to be inaccurate; or

  

(g) any other circumstance whatsoever (with or without notice to or knowledge
of Guarantor) which may or might in any manner or to any extent vary the
risks of Guarantor, or might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable
defense available to, or discharge of, a surety or a guarantor, including
without limitation, any right to require or claim that resort be had to Buyer
in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations.

  

 _Section 5._ The obligations of Guarantor hereunder are independent of the
obligations of Buyer and, in the event of any default hereunder, a separate
action or actions may be brought and prosecuted against Guarantor whether or
not Buyer is joined therein or a separate action or actions are brought
against Buyer. All remedies of Sellers are cumulative.

  

 _Section 6._ Guarantor unconditionally and irrevocably waives:

  

(a) demands, protests, or notices as the same pertain to Buyer;

  

(b) any right to require Sellers to proceed against Buyer or to exhaust any
security held by Sellers or to pursue any other remedy;

  

(c) any right to assert against Sellers, as a defense, counterclaim, set-off,
recoupment or cross claim in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations, any
defense (legal or equitable) or other claim which Guarantor may now or at any
time hereafter have against Buyer or any other person;

  

(d) any defense based upon an election of remedies by Sellers, unless the
same would excuse performance by Buyer, under the Closing Documents; and

  

(e) any duty of Sellers to advise Guarantor of any information known to
Sellers regarding Buyer or its ability to perform under the Closing
Documents.

  

 _Section 7._ Guarantors obligations under Section 2 hereof constitute a

1.4(c), (d) and (e) of the Stock and Note Purchase Agreement; (b) such time
as Buyers payment obligations shall have been fully performed or otherwise

     

   

extinguished under the Closing Documents; and (c) such time as Guarantor has
made payments under this Guaranty in the aggregate amount of the Guaranty
Limit.

  

 _Section 8._ The obligations of Guarantor under this Guaranty shall be
automatically reinstated if and to the extent that for any reason any payment
by or on behalf of Buyer or any other person in respect of the Guaranteed

of such obligations, whether as a result of any proceedings in bankruptcy or
reorganization or otherwise.
