in proportion to each applicable Stockholder\'s Pro Rata Escrow Basis, and
shall be reported by the Escrow Agent as income to such
applicable Stockholders.

  

 (d) _ Escrow Agent\'s Duties._ 

    

 (i) The Escrow Agent shall be obligated only for the performance of such duties as are specifically set forth herein, and as set forth in any additional written escrow instructions which the Escrow Agent may receive after the date of this Agreement which are signed by an officer of Parent and the Stockholder Representative, and may rely and shall be protected in relying or refraining from acting on any instrument reasonably believed to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper party or parties. The Escrow Agent shall not be liable for any act done or omitted hereunder as Escrow Agent while acting in good faith and in the exercise of reasonable judgment, except for gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the Escrow Agent. Any act done or omitted pursuant to the advice of counsel shall be conclusive evidence of such good faith, _provided_ that the Escrow Agent has exercised reasonable care in the selection of such counsel. 

  

 (ii) The Escrow Agent is hereby expressly authorized to disregard any and all warnings given by any of the parties hereto or by any other person, excepting only orders or process of courts of law, and is hereby expressly authorized to comply with and obey orders, judgments or decrees of any court. In case the Escrow Agent obeys or complies with any such order, judgment or decree of any court, the Escrow Agent shall not be liable to any of the parties hereto or to any other person by reason of such compliance, notwithstanding any such order, judgment or decree being subsequently reversed, modified, annulled, set aside, vacated or found to have been entered without jurisdiction. 

  

 (iii) The Escrow Agent shall not be liable in any respect on account of the identity, authority or rights of the parties executing or delivering or purporting to execute or deliver this Agreement or any documents or papers deposited or called for hereunder absent gross negligence or willful misconduct. 

   

 (iv) The Escrow Agent shall not be liable for the expiration of any rights under any statute of limitations with respect to this Agreement or any documents deposited with the Escrow Agent absent gross negligence or willful misconduct. 

  

 (v) In performing any duties under the Agreement, the Escrow Agent shall not be liable to any party for damages, losses, or expenses, except for gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent shall not incur any such liability for (A) any act or failure to act made or omitted in good faith, or (B) any action taken or omitted in reliance upon any instrument, including any written statement of affidavit provided for in this Agreement that the Escrow Agent shall in good faith believe to be genuine, nor will the Escrow Agent be liable or responsible for forgeries, fraud, impersonations, or determining the scope of any representative authority. In addition, the Escrow Agent may consult with legal counsel in connection with Escrow Agent\'s duties under this Agreement and shall be fully protected in any act taken, suffered, or permitted by him/her in good faith in accordance with the advice of counsel, provided, that, the Escrow Agent has exercised reasonable care in the selection of such counsel. The Escrow Agent is not responsible for determining and verifying the authority of any person acting or purporting to act on behalf of any party to this 

   

     
  

 Agreement. In no event shall the Escrow Agent be liable for punitive,
incidental or consequential damages.

  

 (vi) If any controversy arises between the parties to this Agreement, or with any other party, concerning the subject matter of this Agreement, its terms or conditions, the Escrow Agent will not be required to determine the controversy or to take any action regarding it. The Escrow Agent may hold all documents and the Escrow Fund and may wait for settlement of any such controversy by final appropriate legal proceedings. In such event, the Escrow Agent will not be liable for damage. The Escrow Agent shall comply with any and all information reporting and withholding Tax requirements arising in respect of the Escrow Fund. 

  

 (vii) Parent and the Surviving Corporation, and their respective successors and assigns, agree jointly and severally to indemnify and hold Escrow Agent harmless against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, and expenses, including reasonable costs of investigation, counsel fees, and disbursements that may be imposed on the Escrow Agent or incurred by Escrow Agent in connection with the performance of his/her duties under this Agreement, including, but not limited to, any litigation arising from this Agreement or involving its subject matter, except for gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the Escrow Agent. 

  

 (viii) The Escrow Agent may resign at any time upon giving at least thirty (30) days written notice to the parties; _provided, however,_ that no such resignation shall become effective until the appointment of a successor escrow agent which shall be accomplished as follows: the parties shall use their best efforts to mutually agree on a successor escrow agent within thirty (30) days after receiving such notice. If the parties fail to agree upon a successor escrow agent within such time, the Escrow Agent shall have the right to appoint a successor escrow agent authorized to do business in the State of California. The successor escrow agent shall execute and deliver an instrument accepting such appointment and it shall, without further acts, be vested with all the estates, properties, rights, powers, and duties of the predecessor escrow agent as if originally named as escrow agent. The Escrow Agent shall be discharged from any further duties and liability under this Agreement. 

    

 (e) _ Permitted Investments._ The Escrow Agent shall promptly invest the Escrow Fund pursuant to the written instructions of Parent, provided, however, such investments shall be limited to (i) money market accounts and money market mutual funds solely invested in treasury bills, treasury notes or any other direct obligations issued by or guaranteed in full as to principal and interest by the United States of America and certificates of deposit issued by a commercial bank located in the United States and incorporated under the laws of the United States or of any state and having capital, surplus and undivided profits of not less than one hundred million dollars ($100,000,000), (ii) obligations of or guaranteed by the U.S. government with a maturity of not more than 180 days, (iii) certificates of deposit with a maturity of not more than 180 days with a commercial bank having capital, surplus and undivided profits of not less than one hundred million dollars ($100,000,000), (iv) commercial paper with a maturity of not more than 180 days that is rated A-1, P-1 or better by Standard and Poor\'s Corporation or Moody\'s Investors Services, Inc. and (v) debt of or guaranteed by any state or political subdivision with a maturity of not more than 180 days that is rated A or better (the "Permitted Investments"). If Parent does not provide such written instructions to the Escrow Agent, the Escrow Fund shall be deposited in a money market account of U.S. Bank. Neither the Escrow Agent nor any other Person shall be liable or responsible in any manner for any depreciation resulting from any such Permitted Investment or any liquidation thereof, or for any costs in connection therewith, and all of said depreciation and costs shall be borne by the Escrow Fund. 

  

     

  

 (f) _ Fees._ All fees of the Escrow Agent for performance of its duties hereunder shall be paid by Parent. It is understood that the fees and usual charges agreed upon for services of the Escrow Agent shall be considered compensation for ordinary services as contemplated by this Agreement. In the event that the conditions of this Agreement are not promptly fulfilled, or if the Escrow Agent renders any service not provided for in this Agreement, or if the parties request a substantial modification of its terms, or if any controversy arises, or if the Escrow Agent is made a party to, or intervenes in, any litigation pertaining to this escrow or its subject matter, the Escrow Agent shall be reasonably compensated by Parent for such extraordinary services and reimbursed for all costs, attorney\'s fees, and expenses occasioned by such default, delay, controversy or litigation. 

   

 (g) _ Tax Reporting Documentation._ Within 90 days after the Closing Date, Parent shall deliver to the Escrow Agent an IRS Form W-8 or W-9, as applicable, and such other tax reporting documents that the Escrow Agent may request (collectively, the "Tax Reporting Documentation"), for Parent and each Stockholder.

ARTICLE X 
RECOURSE 

  

 10.1 _ Losses._ 

  

  

 (a) The Escrow Fund is available to compensate Parent (through a reduction in that portion of Cash Consideration constituting the Escrow Amount) for (i) any claims, losses, liabilities, damages, deficiencies, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys\' fees and expenses (hereinafter individually a "Loss" and collectively "Losses") incurred by Parent, its officers, directors, or the Surviving Corporation directly or indirectly as a result of any inaccuracy or breach of a representation or warranty of the Company contained in Article IV herein or (ii) out of pocket cash arising out of the Designated Leases commencing on January 1, 2002 (net of any cash deposit, insurance or indemnification proceeds and subtenancy fees actually received or offset other than the deposit on the Chesterfield License which deposit shall be returned to the landlord, MIC Real Estate, LLC, prior to the Closing Date); _provided, however,_ that in the case of the 110 William Lease, the commencement date for determining such expense shall be March 1, 2002 (as opposed to January 1). 

  

 (b) Parent may not receive any amount from the Escrow Fund for Losses unless and until Losses, as finally determined pursuant to the terms hereof, exceed $100,000 (the "Basket"). At such time, Parent may recover from the Escrow Fund any such Losses which exceed $50,000 (the "Deductible"). 

  

 (c) Parent shall not be entitled to any recourse against any Stockholder for Losses other than by way of the Escrow Fund except for Losses incurred by Parent relating to or arising, directly or indirectly, out of any breach of the representations and warranties set forth in the Specific Representations, claims for which in any event may not exceed the proceeds of the Escrow Fund and the Earnout or for fraud or willful misconduct. 

  

 (d) Any Loss from any breach of the Specific Representations shall first be applied against the Escrow Fund (if Parent has become aware of any such claim of Loss prior to the Escrow Expiration Date) in priority order before applying any such Loss to the Earnout. 

  

    
  

 (e) In no event may Parent, its officers, directors or Surviving Corporation be entitled to seek recourse against the Stockholders of the Company for any amount paid hereunder or otherwise, other than in accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions expressly provided herein. 

  

  

 10.2 _ Escrow Fund Disputes._ 

  

  

 (a) _ Claims Upon Escrow Fund._ Upon receipt by the Escrow Agent at any time on or before the last day of the Escrow Period of a certificate signed by any officer of Parent (an "Escrow Notice") ( _provided_ that in the case of any Escrow Notice delivered as a result of Section 10.1(a)(ii) such Escrow Notice shall not be delivered prior to October 1, 2002): (i) stating that Parent has paid or properly accrued, or reasonably expects to pay or properly accrue, Losses, and (ii) specifying in reasonable detail the individual items of Losses included in the amount so stated, the date each such item was paid or properly accrued or the basis for any liability reasonably expected to be incurred, and the nature of the misrepresentation or breach of warranty to which such item is related, the Escrow Agent shall, subject to and after giving effect to the provisions of Sections 10.2(b) and 10.2(c), transfer to Parent out of the Escrow Fund, as promptly as practicable, cash held in the Escrow Fund in an amount equal to any uncontroverted Losses. Such payment of cash from the Escrow Fund to Parent will be made in proportion to each applicable Stockholder\'s Pro Rata Escrow Basis. 

  

 (b) _ Objections to Escrow Notice._ At the time of delivery of any Escrow Notice to the Escrow Agent, a duplicate copy of such Escrow Notice shall be delivered to the Stockholder Representative and for a period of forty-five (45) days after such delivery, the Escrow Agent shall make no transfer to Parent of any amounts under the Escrow Fund pursuant to Section 10.2(a), unless the Escrow Agent shall have received written authorization from the Stockholder Representative to make such transfer. After the expiration of such forty-five (45) day period, the Escrow Agent shall transfer cash from the Escrow Fund in accordance with Section 10.2(a), _provided,_ that no such transfer may be made if the Stockholder Representative shall object in a written statement to the claim made in the Escrow Notice, and such statement shall have been delivered to the Escrow Agent prior to the expiration of such forty-five (45) day period and provided further that to the extent an Escrow Notice alleges only the basis for an anticipated liability, no amount shall be distributed until such liability is actually paid or accrued under GAAP. 

  

 (c) _ Resolution of Conflicts Regarding Escrow Notice; Arbitration._ 

    

 (i) In case the Stockholder Representative shall object in writing to any claim or claims made in any Escrow Notice as provided in Section 10.2(a) hereof, the Stockholder Representative and Parent shall attempt in good faith to agree upon the rights of the respective parties with respect to each of such claims. If the Stockholder Representative and Parent should so agree, a memorandum setting forth such agreement shall be prepared and signed by both parties and shall be furnished to the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely on any such memorandum and distribute cash from the Escrow Fund in accordance with the terms hereof and thereof. 

   

 (ii) If no such agreement can be reached after good faith negotiation, either Parent or the Stockholder Representative may demand arbitration of the matter unless the amount of the damage or loss is at issue in pending litigation with a third party, in which event arbitration shall not be commenced until such amount is ascertained or both parties agree to arbitration; and in either such event the matter shall be settled by arbitration conducted by three arbitrators. Parent and the Stockholder Representative shall each select one arbitrator, and the two arbitrators so selected shall select a third arbitrator. The arbitrators shall set a limited time period and establish procedures designed to reduce the cost and time for discovery while allowing the parties an opportunity, adequate in the sole judgment of the arbitrators, to discover relevant information from the opposing parties about the subject 

   

     
  

 matter of the dispute. The arbitrators shall rule upon motions to compel or
limit discovery and shall have the authority to impose sanctions, including
attorneys fees and costs, to the extent as a court of competent law or
equity, should the arbitrators determine that discovery was sought without
substantial justification or that discovery was refused or objected to without
substantial justification. The decision of a majority of the three
arbitrators as to the validity and amount of any claim in such Escrow Notice
shall be final, binding and conclusive. Such decision shall be written and
shall be supported by written findings of fact and conclusions which shall set
forth the award by the arbitrators. The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to act
in accordance with such decision and make or withhold payment out of the
Escrow Fund in accordance therewith.

  

 (iii) Judgment upon any award rendered by the arbitrators may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. Any such arbitration shall be held in San Francisco, California under the rules then in effect of the American Arbitration Association. In any arbitration hereunder in which any claim or the amount thereof stated in the Escrow Notice is at issue, Parent shall be deemed to be the prevailing party in the event that the arbitrators award is in an amount equal to at least ninety percent (90%) of the disputed amount; otherwise, the holders of Company Series A Preferred Stock and Company Series B Preferred Stock as represented by the Stockholder Representative shall be deemed to be the prevailing party. The non-prevailing party to an arbitration shall pay its own expenses, the fees of each arbitrator, the administrative costs of the arbitration, and the expenses, including without limitation, reasonable attorneys\' fees and costs, incurred by the other party to the arbitration; provided, however, that Parent shall have no recourse against the applicable Stockholders for such expenses unless there are funds remaining in the Escrow Fund, in which case the payment of such expenses shall be made out of the Escrow Fund only. Such payment of expenses from the Escrow Fund will be made in proportion to each applicable Stockholder\'s Pro Rata Escrow Basis. 

   

  

 10.3 _ Earnout Disputes._ 

  

  

 (a) _ Claims Upon the Earnout._ If Parent has stated in the applicable Earnout Notice that Parent intends to hold back a certain amount from the 2002 Earnout or 2003 Earnout, as the case may be, simultaneous with delivery of the applicable Earnout Notice, Parent shall have delivered to the Stockholder Representative a separate written notice (an 
 "Earnout Recourse Dispute Notice"): (i) stating that Parent has withheld a
specified amount from the 2002 Earnout or 2003 Earnout, as the case may be,
(ii) stating that Parent has paid or properly accrued Losses, or reasonably
expects to incur such Losses, (iii) specifying in reasonable detail the
individual items of Losses included in the amount so stated, the date each
such item was paid or properly accrued, the basis for any liability reasonably
expected to be incurred and the nature of the misrepresentation or breach of
warranty to which such item is related, and (iv) the determination by the
Escrow Agent that there are no funds remaining in the Escrow Fund.

   

 (b) _ Objections to Earnout Recourse Dispute Notice._ Stockholder Representative shall have forty-five (45) days to object in a written statement to the claim made in the Earnout Recourse Dispute Notice delivered by Parent. If Stockholder Representative does not object in a written statement to the Earnout Recourse Dispute Notice, then the amount held back by Parent shall be part of the calculation of Aggregate Earnout Consideration for purposes of 
_Exhibit B_, but not payable to the Stockholder Representative and shall be
deemed final, binding and conclusive, provided, however, that to the extent
an Earnout Recourse Dispute Notice alleges only the basis for an expected
liability, no amount shall be distributed until such liability is actually
paid or accrued under GAAP.

  

 (c) _ Resolution of Conflicts Regarding Earnout Recourse Dispute Notice; Arbitration._ 

  

    
   

 (i) In case the Stockholder Representative shall object in writing to any claim or claims made in any Earnout Recourse Dispute Notice as provided in Section 10.3(a) hereof, the Stockholder Representative and Parent shall attempt in good faith to agree upon the rights of the respective parties with respect to each of such claims. If the Stockholder Representative and Parent should so agree, a memorandum setting forth such agreement shall be prepared and signed by both parties. The Stockholder Representative shall be entitled to rely on any such memorandum and Parent shall promptly pay any cash or deliver any shares of Parent Common Stock from the 2002 Earnout or 2003 Earnout, as the case may be, to the Stockholder Representative due in accordance with such memorandum and the terms thereof. 

   

 (ii) If no such agreement can be reached after good faith negotiation, either Parent or the Stockholder Representative may demand arbitration of the matter unless the amount of the damage or loss is at issue in pending litigation with a third party, in which event arbitration shall not be commenced until such amount is ascertained or both parties agree to arbitration; and in either such event the matter shall be settled by arbitration conducted by three arbitrators. Parent and the Stockholder Representative shall each select one arbitrator, and the two arbitrators so selected shall select a third arbitrator. The arbitrators shall set a limited time period and establish procedures designed to reduce the cost and time for discovery while allowing the parties an opportunity, adequate in the sole judgment of the arbitrators, to discover relevant information from the opposing parties about the subject matter of the dispute. The arbitrators shall rule upon motions to compel or limit discovery and shall have the authority to impose sanctions, including attorneys fees and costs, to the extent as a court of competent law or equity, should the arbitrators determine that discovery was sought without substantial justification or that discovery was refused or objected to without substantial justification. The decision of a majority of the three arbitrators as to the validity and amount of any claim in such Earnout Recourse Dispute Notice shall be final, binding and conclusive. Such decision shall be written and shall be supported by written findings of fact and conclusions which shall set forth the award, judgment, decree or order awarded by the arbitrators. The Stockholder Representative shall be entitled to act in accordance with such decision and Parent shall promptly pay any cash or deliver any shares of Parent Common Stock from the 2002 Earnout or 2003 Earnout, as the case may be, due to the Stockholder Representative in accordance with such decision and the terms thereof. 

  

 (iii) Judgment upon any award rendered by the arbitrators may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. Any such arbitration shall be held in San Francisco, California under the rules then in effect of the American Arbitration Association. In any arbitration hereunder in which any claim or the amount thereof stated in the applicable Earnout Notice is at issue, Parent shall be deemed to be the prevailing party in the event that the arbitrators award is in an amount equal to at least ninety percent (90%) of the disputed amount; otherwise, the Stockholders as represented by the Stockholder Representative shall be deemed to be the prevailing party. The non-prevailing party to an arbitration shall pay its own expenses, the fees of each arbitrator, the administrative costs of the arbitration, and the expenses, including without limitation, reasonable attorneys\' fees and costs, incurred by the other party to the arbitration; provided, however, that no payment shall be made by the Stockholders unless there is an amount due and not otherwise paid to the Stockholders from the Earnout, in which case the payment of such expenses shall be made from an offset of the applicable Earnout payment due to them pursuant to Section 3.13. 

   

  

 10.4 _ Stockholder Representative; Power of Attorney._ 

  

  

 (a) In the event that the Merger is approved, effective upon such vote, and without further act of any Stockholder, Kinexus Representative LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, shall be appointed as Representative and attorney-in-fact (the "Stockholder Representative") for each 

  

    

 Stockholder of the Company (except such Stockholders, if any, as shall have
perfected their appraisal or dissenters\' rights under Delaware Law), for and
on behalf of Stockholders of the Company, to give and receive notices and
communications, to distribute cash or shares of Parent Common Stock from the
2002 Earnout or the 2003 Earnout, as the case may be, to object to any claims
asserted by Parent against the Escrow Fund, the 2002 Earnout or 2003 Earnout,
to agree to, negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises of, and demand
arbitration and comply with orders of courts and awards of arbitrators with
respect to such claims, to authorize delivery to Parent of cash from the
Escrow Fund in satisfaction of claims by Parent, to object to such deliveries,
to agree to, negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises of, and demand
arbitration and comply with orders of courts and awards of arbitrators with
respect to such claims, and to take all actions necessary or appropriate in
the judgment of Stockholder Representative for the accomplishment of the
foregoing. Such agency may be changed by the Stockholders of the Company from
time to time upon not less than thirty (30) days prior written notice to
Parent; _provided_ , that the Stockholder Representative may not be removed
unless holders of a two-thirds interest of the Escrow Fund (or if after the
Escrow Expiration Date, two-thirds interest of the Earnout) agree to the
removal and to the identity of the substituted Representative. Any vacancy in
the position of Stockholder Representative may be filled by approval of the
holders of a majority in interest of the Escrow Fund. No bond shall be
required of the Stockholder Representative, and the Stockholder
Representative shall not receive compensation for its services. Notices or
communications to or from the Stockholder Representative shall
constitute notice to or from each of the Stockholders of the Company.

  

 (b) The Stockholder Representative shall not be liable for any act done or omitted hereunder as Stockholder Representative while acting in good faith and in the exercise of reasonable judgment. The Stockholder Representative shall be entitled to rely on the stock transfer records of the Company immediately prior to Closing for any and all purposes of distributing or disseminating to the Stockholders any amounts delivered to the Stockholder Representative hereunder. 

  

  

 10.5 _ Actions of the Stockholder Representative._ A decision, act, consent or instruction of the Stockholder Representative shall constitute a decision of all the Stockholders for whom a portion of the Escrow Amount otherwise issuable to them is deposited in the Escrow Fund in the case of the Escrow Fund and to all of the Stockholders in the case of the Earnout and shall be final, binding and conclusive upon each of such Stockholders, and the Escrow Agent and Parent may rely upon any such decision, act, consent or instruction of the Stockholder Representative as being the decision, act, consent or instruction of each such Stockholder of the Company. The Escrow Agent and Parent are hereby relieved from any liability to any Person for any acts done by them in accordance with such decision, act, consent or instruction of the Stockholder Representative. 

  

 10.6 _ Third-Party Claims._ Parent shall notify the Stockholder Representative within ten (10) days of becoming aware of a third-party claim which may result in a demand against the Escrow Fund or the Earnout, as the case may be, and the Stockholder Representative, as representative for the Stockholders of the Company, shall be entitled, at his expense, to participate in any defense of such claim. Parent shall have the right in its sole discretion to control the defense of all such claims and to settle any such claim; _provided, however_ , that no settlement of any such claim with third-party claimants or other major decisions with respect to such claim in excess of $10,000 in related matters shall permit any claim against the Escrow Fund or the Earnout, except with the consent of the Stockholder Representative. In the event that the Stockholder Representative has consented to any such settlement and acknowledged that the claim is a valid claim against the Escrow Fund, the 2002 Earnout or the 2003 Earnout, as the case may be, and Stockholder Representative shall be deemed to have agreed to the claim by Parent against the Escrow Fund, the 2002 Earnout or the 2003 Earnout, as the case may be, in an amount equal to such settlement.

 (g) By Parent if it is not in material breach of its obligations under this Agreement and there has been upon a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of Company set forth in this Agreement, or if any representation or warranty of Company shall have become untrue, in either case such that the conditions set forth in Section 8.3(a) or Section 8.3(b) would not then be satisfied; _provided_ , that, if such inaccuracy in Company\'s representations and warranties or breach by Company is curable by Company through the exercise of its commercially reasonable efforts, then Parent may only terminate this Agreement under this Section 11.1(g) if the 

  

    
  

 breach is not cured within ten (10) days the date of written notice from

This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties. 

  

 11.4 _ Extension; Waiver._ At any time prior to the Effective Time, Parent and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other, may, to the extent legally allowed, (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations of the other party hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties made to such party contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto, and (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions for the benefit of such party contained herein.

 _Exhibit B 
_

  

Any amount payable under the 2002 Earnout or 2003 Earnout, as the case may
be, pursuant to Section 3.13 of the Merger Agreement shall be payable by
Stockholder Representative to the Stockholders of the Company in the
following order of priority:

  

 (1)

 The applicable amount of the 2002 Earnout or 2003 Earnout payable to the holders of Company Common Stock in accordance with Section 2.6(c) of the Merger Agreement.  


(2)

 An amount representing 1.25% of the 2002 Earnout or 2003 Earnout, as the case may be, to J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., as financial advisor payable in accordance with its letter agreement with the Company, dated September 4, 2001.  


(3)

 An amount equal to $100,000 to be payable to the Stockholder Representative representing reimbursement of all costs and expenses incurred by such Stockholder Representative.  


(4)

 As of the date of payment of any of the 2002 Earnout or 2003 Earnout, in the event that either (a) the Escrow Agent has delivered to Parent any amount from the Escrow Fund, (b) if after Escrow Expiration Date, the Escrow Agent has held back certain amounts from distribution to stockholders, in each case in accordance with the terms of this Merger Agreement, or (c) any amount shall have been withheld from payment of Cash Consideration by Parent because there shall exist certain Extraordinary Liabilities at Closing, any such amounts (the "Make-Whole Payments") will first be distributed by the Stockholder Representative to the applicable Stockholders on the Pro Rata Escrow Basis until each such Stockholder shall have received the amount of Cash Consideration allocated to him, her or it at Closing (before giving effect to the contributions to the Escrow Fund or the existence of Extraordinary Liabilities at Closing).  


(5)

 Any remaining amounts will be paid to the Stockholders of the Company in proportion to the applicable percentages set forth opposite its, his or her name on _Exhibit B_. Applicable percentages will be determined with reference to the calculation of Aggregate Earnout Consideration as of the date of such payment giving effect to each of the bands 1, 2, 3 and 4 (each, a "Band") set forth on _Exhibit B_. The methodology, by way of example, is as follows: if the 2002 Earnout is determined to be $15 million, the applicable percentage allocation for each applicable Stockholder shall be set forth in Band 1. If the 2003 Earnout is $100 million so that the Aggregate Earnout Consideration is $115 million, payments to such Stockholder would equal (a) $9,389,176.19 (i.e. the difference between the top valuation of Band 1 and the $15 million paid pursuant to the 2002 Earnout) _multiplied by_ the applicable percentage set forth in Band 1 _plus_ (b) $3,577,808.91 (i.e. the difference between the top valuation and the bottom valuation of Band 2) _multiplied by_ the applicable percentage set forth in Band 2, _plus_ (c) $74,085,399.14 (i.e. the difference between the top valuation and the bottom valuation of Band 3) _multiplied by_ the applicable percentage set forth in Band 3 _plus_  (d) $12,947,615.73 (i.e. the difference between the top valuation and the bottom valuation of Band 4) _multiplied by_ the applicable percentage set forth in Band 4.  


(6)

 If (a) any Make-Whole Payment shall have been made in respect of any amount held back by the Escrow Agent after the Escrow Expiration Date and (b) any payment shall have thereafter been released for payment to Stockholders by the Escrow Agent, such amount shall be deemed to be payable in the following order (i) _first_ to the applicable Stockholders on the Pro Rata Escrow Basis until such Stockholder shall have received the amount of Cash Consideration allocated to him, her or it at Closing (before giving effect to the contributions to the Escrow Fund or the existence of Extraordinary Liabilities at Closing) and (ii) _second_ to the applicable Stockholder in the applicable percentage set forth opposite its, his or her name on this _Exhibit B_ with reference to the amount of Aggregate Earnout Consideration as of the date of such release. 
  

For purposes hereof, "Aggregate Earnout Consideration" shall mean all amounts
paid or payable under the 2002 and 2003 Earnouts, as the case may be, to be
determined on a cumulative basis.

   EXHIBIT A-1

  

  

NEITHER THE WARRANT NOR THE SHARES OF STOCK ISSUABLE UPON EXERCISE HEREOF
HAVE BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE "ACT")
AND ANY STATE SECURITIES LAWS. NO SALE, TRANSFER OR OTHER DISPOSITION OF THIS
WARRANT OR SAID SHARES MAY BE EFFECTED WITHOUT (i) AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION
STATEMENT RELATED THERETO, (ii) AN OPINION OF COUNSEL FOR THE PURCHASER,
WHICH COUNSEL SHALL BE REASONABLY SATISFACTORY TO THE COMPANY, THAT SUCH
REGISTRATION IS NOT REQUIRED OR (iii) RECEIPT OF A NO-ACTION LETTER FROM THE
SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION TO THE EFFECT THAT REGISTRATION UNDER THE
ACT IS NOT REQUIRED.

  

 

 _STOCK PURCHASE WARRANT_

     Date of Issuance: January , 2002 |  | Certificate No. W-
  
---|---|--- 
     

 For value received, Advent Software, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), hereby grants to KWI Equity, LLC, a Delaware limited liability corporation, or its registered assigns (the " _Registered Holder(s)_ "), the right to purchase from the Company a total of 165,176 Warrant Shares (as defined herein) at a price per share of $.01, as adjusted from time to time hereunder (the " _Exercise Price_ "). The Exercise Price and number of Warrant Shares (and the amount and any kind of other securities) for which this Warrant is exercisable shall be subject to adjustment as provided herein. Certain capitalized terms used herein are defined in _Section 3_ hereof. 

  

 This Warrant is subject to the following provisions: 

  

 SECTION 1. _ Exercise of Warrant._ 

  

 1A. _ Exercise Period._ Subject to Section 2D, the purchase rights represented by this Warrant may be exercised, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time after the date hereof to and including 5:00 p.m., New York time, on January 1, 2003 or, if such day is not a business day, on the next preceding business day (the " _Exercise Period_ "). 

  

 1B. _ Exercise Procedure._ 

  

  

 (i) This Warrant shall be deemed to have been exercised when all of the following items have been delivered to the Company (the " _Exercise Time_ "): 

    

 (a) a completed Exercise Notice, as described in _Section 1C_ below, executed by the Person exercising all or part of the purchase rights represented by this Warrant (the " _Purchaser_ "); 

  

 (b) this Warrant; 

  

 (c) if the Purchaser is not the Registered Holder, an Assignment or Assignments in the form set forth in _Exhibit II_ attached hereto evidencing the assignment of this Warrant to the Purchaser; and 

   

 (d) either (i) a check or wire transfer payable to the Company in an amount equal to the product of the Exercise Price multiplied by the number of Warrant Shares being purchased upon such exercise (the " _Aggregate Exercise Price_ "), or (ii) the delivery of a notice to the Company that the Purchaser is exercising the Warrant (or a portion thereof) on a "cashless" basis by authorizing the Company to withhold from issuance the number of Warrant Shares 

   

     
  

 which when multiplied by the Fair Market Value of a Warrant Share is equal
to the Aggregate Exercise Price (and such withheld shares shall no longer be
issuable under this Warrant).

    

 (ii) Certificates for Warrant Shares purchased upon exercise of this Warrant shall be delivered by the Company to the Purchaser promptly after the date of the Exercise Time together with any cash payable in lieu of a fraction of a share pursuant to the provisions of _Section 14_ hereof. Unless this Warrant has expired or all of the purchase rights represented hereby have been exercised, the Company shall prepare a new Warrant, substantially identical hereto, representing the rights formerly represented by this Warrant which have not expired or been exercised and shall, within such ten (10)-day period, deliver such new Warrant to the Person designated for delivery in the Exercise Notice. 

  

 (iii) The Warrant Shares issuable upon the exercise of this Warrant shall be deemed to have been issued to the Purchaser at the Exercise Time, and the Purchaser shall be deemed for all purposes to have become the record holder of such Warrant Shares at the Exercise Time. 

  

 (iv) The issuance of certificates for Warrant Shares upon exercise of this Warrant shall be made without charge to the Registered Holder or the Purchaser for any issuance tax or other cost incurred by the Company in respect thereof in connection with such exercise and the related issuance of Warrant Shares. 

   

 (v) The Company shall not close its books against the transfer of this Warrant or of any Warrant Shares issued or issuable upon the exercise of this Warrant in any manner which interferes with the timely exercise of this Warrant. The Company shall from time to time take all such action as may be necessary to assure that the par value per share of the unissued Warrant Shares acquirable upon exercise of this Warrant is at all times equal to or less than the Exercise Price then in effect. In the event that the Company fails to comply with its obligations set forth in the foregoing sentence, the Purchaser may (but shall not be obligated to) purchase Warrant Shares hereunder at par value, and the Company shall be obligated to reimburse the Purchaser for the aggregate amount of consideration paid in connection with such exercise in excess of the Exercise Price then in effect. 

   

 (vi) The Company shall use commercially reasonably efforts to assist and cooperate with any Registered Holder or any Purchaser required to make any governmental filings or obtain any governmental approvals prior to or in connection with any exercise of this Warrant. 

  

 (vii) Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, if an exercise of all or any portion of this Warrant is to be made in connection with a registered public offering, a sale of the Company or any other contingent and specified transaction or event, such exercise may, at the election of the holder hereof, be conditioned upon the consummation of such transaction or event in which case such exercise shall not be deemed to be effective until the consummation of such transaction or event. 

   

 (viii) The Company shall at all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued Common Stock solely for the purpose of issuance upon the exercise of this Warrant, the maximum number of Warrant Shares issuable upon the exercise of this Warrant. All Warrant Shares which are so issuable shall, when issued and upon the payment of the applicable Exercise Price, be duly and validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and free from all liens and charges other than state and federal securities laws and restrictions. The Company shall take all such actions as may be necessary to ensure that all such Warrant Shares may be so issued without violation of any applicable law or governmental regulation or any requirements of any domestic securities exchange upon which shares of Common Stock or other securities constituting Warrant Shares may be listed (except for official notice of issuance which shall be immediately delivered by the Company upon each such issuance). The Company will use its best efforts to cause the 

  

    
  

 Warrant Shares, immediately upon such exercise, to be listed on any domestic
securities exchange upon which shares of Common Stock or other securities
constituting Warrant Shares are listed at the time of such exercise.

  

 (ix) If the Warrant Shares issuable by reason of exercise of this Warrant are convertible into or exchangeable for any other stock or securities of the Company, the Company shall, at the Purchaser\'s option and upon surrender of this Warrant by such Purchaser as provided above together with any notice, statement or payment required to effect such conversion or exchange of Warrant Shares, deliver to such Purchaser (or as otherwise specified by such Purchaser) a certificate or certificates representing the stock or securities into which the Warrant Shares issuable by reason of such conversion are convertible or exchangeable, registered in such name or names and in such denomination or denominations as such Purchaser has specified. 

  

 (x) The Company shall not, and shall not permit its subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, by any action (including reincorporation in a jurisdiction other than Delaware, amending its Certificate of Incorporation or through any Organic Change, issuance or sale of securities or any other voluntary action) avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of terms of this Warrant or impair or diminish its value (except for any action which ratably affects all Warrant Shares and shares of Common Stock), but shall at all times in good faith assist in the carrying out of all such terms of Warrant. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company shall (a) use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all such authorizations, exemptions, or consents from any public regulatory body having jurisdiction thereof as may be necessary to enable the Company to perform its obligations under this Warrant, and (b) not undertake any reverse stock split, combination, reorganization, or other reclassification of its capital stock which would have the effect of making this Warrant exercisable for less than one share of Common Stock. 

  

  

 1C. _ Exercise Notice._ Upon any exercise of this Warrant, the Purchaser shall deliver to the Company an Exercise Notice in substantially the form set forth as _Exhibit I_ hereto, except that if the Warrant Shares are not to be issued in the name of the Registered Holder, the Exercise Notice shall also state the name of the Person to whom the certificates for the Warrant Shares are to be issued, and if the number of Warrant Shares to be issued does not include all of the Warrant Shares purchasable hereunder, it shall also state the name of the Person to whom a new Warrant for the unexercised portion of the rights hereunder is to be issued. 

  

 SECTION 2. _ Adjustment of Exercise Price and Number of Shares._ In order to prevent dilution of the rights granted under this Warrant, the Exercise Price shall be subject to adjustment from time to time as provided in this _Section 2_, and the number of Warrant Shares obtainable upon exercise of this Warrant shall be subject to adjustment from time to time, each as provided in this _Section 2_. 

   

 2A. _ Subdivision or Combination of Common Stock._ If the Company at any time subdivides (by any stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, or otherwise) the Common Stock into a greater number of shares, the Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to such subdivision shall be proportionately reduced and the number of Warrant Shares obtainable upon exercise of this Warrant shall be proportionately increased. If the Company at any time combines (by reverse stock split or otherwise) the Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, the Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to such combination shall be proportionately increased and the number of Warrant Shares obtainable upon exercise of this Warrant shall be proportionately decreased. 

  

 2B. _ Merger, etc._ Prior to the consummation of any Organic Change other than a Change of Control (as defined below), the Company shall make appropriate provision to ensure that each Registered Holder of Warrants shall thereafter have the right to acquire and receive upon exercise thereof, in lieu of or addition to (as the case may be) the Warrant Shares immediately theretofore acquirable and receivable upon exercise of such Registered Holder\'s Warrants, such shares of stock, securities or assets as may be issued or payable with respect to or in exchange for the number of 

     

 Warrant Shares immediately theretofore acquirable and receivable upon
exercise of such Registered Holder\'s Warrants had such Organic Change not
taken place. In the event of a (i) merger or consolidation of the Company
with or into another corporation pursuant to which the stockholders of the
Company immediately price to such merger or consolidation control less than
50% of the voting securities of the surviving entity, (ii) sale of all or
substantially all of the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, or (iii)
sale of all or substantially all of the Company\'s Common Stock (in each case
a " _Change of Control_ ") then this Warrant and the purchase right
represented hereby shall expire as of the effective date of the Change of
Control.

  

 2C. _ Notices._ 

  

  

 (i) Immediately upon any adjustment of the Exercise Price, the Company shall give written notice thereof to the Registered Holder, setting forth in reasonable detail and certifying the calculation of such adjustment. 

  

 (ii) The Company shall give written notice to the Registered Holder at least twenty (20) days prior to the date on which the Company closes its books or takes a record (A) with respect to any dividend or distribution upon the Common Stock, (B) with respect to any pro rata subscription offer to holders of Common Stock, or (C) for determining rights to vote with respect to any Organic Change, Change of Control, dissolution or liquidation. 

  

 (iii) The Company shall also give written notice to the Registered Holder at least twenty (20) days prior to the date on which any Organic Change, Change of Control, dissolution, or liquidation shall take place. 

  

  

 SECTION 3. _ Definitions._ The following terms have the meanings set forth below: 

  

 3A. " _Change of Control_ " shall mean with respect to any Person, the occurrence of, or the taking of any corporate action to facilitate, any of the following: (i) the sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition, in one or a series of related transactions, of all or substantially all of the assets of that Person other than to a wholly owned subsidiary of such Person; (ii) the consolidation of that Person with another Person or the merger of that Person into another Person or of another Person into the first Person, or any such similar event pursuant to a transaction in which fifty percent (50%) or more of the voting shares of the Person are changed into or exchanged for cash, securities, or other property (other than any such transaction where the holders of the voting shares of the Person immediately prior to such transaction own, directly or indirectly, not less than a majority of the voting shares of the surviving or resulting person or Person immediately after such transaction); (iii) the adoption of a resolution or plan by the shareholders of the Person concerning the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of that Person; or (iv) the consummation of any transaction or series of related transactions (including any merger or consolidation) the result of which is that any Person (other than the first Person, any trustee or other fiduciary holding securities under an employee benefit plan of the first Person, or any corporation owned, directly or indirectly, by the shareowners of the first Person in substantially the same proportion as their ownership of stock of the first Person) is or becomes the "beneficial owner" (as such term is defined in Rule 13d-3 and Rule 13d-5 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934), directly or indirectly, of more than thirty percent (30%) of the voting shares of the first Person. For purposes of this definition, any transfer of an equity interest of a Person that was formed for the purpose of acquiring voting shares of a Person shall be deemed to be a transfer of such portion of such voting shares as corresponds to the portion of the equity of such Person that has been so transferred. 

  

 3B. " _Common Stock_ " means the Company\'s Common Stock, $0.01 par value per share. 

   

 3C. " _Fair Market Value_ " means (i) the average of the closing sales prices of the Common Stock on all domestic securities exchanges on which the Common Stock is listed, or (ii) if there have been no sales on any such exchange on any day, the average of the highest bid and lowest asked prices on all 

     

 such exchanges at the end of such day, or (iii) if on any day the Common
Stock is not so listed, the sales price for the Common Stock as of 4:00 P.M.,
New York time, as reported on the Nasdaq National Market, or (iv) if the
Common Stock is not reported on the Nasdaq National Market, the average of the
representative bid and asked quotations for the Common Stock as of 4:00 P.M.,
New York time, as reported on the Nasdaq interdealer quotation system, or any
similar successor organization, in each such case averaged over a period of
twenty-one (21) trading days consisting of the day as of which "Fair Market
Value" is being determined and the twenty (20) consecutive trading days prior
to such day. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if at any time of determination
either (x) the Common Stock is not registered pursuant to _Section 12_ of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and either listed on a
national securities exchange or authorized for quotation in the Nasdaq system,
or (y) less than 25% of the outstanding Common Stock is held by the public
free of transfer restrictions under the Securities Act, then Fair Market Value
shall mean the price that would be paid per share for the entire common equity
interest in the Company in an orderly sale transaction between a willing
buyer and a willing seller, taking into account the appropriate lack of
liquidity of the Company\'s securities, using valuation techniques then
prevailing in the securities industry and assuming full disclosure of all
relevant information and a reasonable period of time for effectuating such
sale. Fair Market Value shall be determined by the Company\'s Board of
Directors in its good faith judgment.

  

 3D. " _Organic Change_ " means any recapitalization, reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale of all or substantially all of the Company\'s assets or other transaction which is effected in such a way that holders of Common Stock are entitled to receive (either directly or upon subsequent liquidation) stock, securities, or assets with respect to or in exchange for Common Stock. 

  

 3E. " _Person_ " means (as the context requires) an individual, a corporation, a partnership, an association, a trust, a limited liability company, or other entity or organization. 

  

 3F. " _Securities Act_ " means the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. 

   

 3G. " _Warrant Shares_ " means shares of the Company\'s Common Stock issuable upon exercise of this Warrant. 

  

 SECTION 4. _ No Voting Rights; Limitations of Liability._ This Warrant shall not entitle the Registered Holder hereof to any voting rights or other rights as a stockholder of the Company. No provision hereof, in the absence of affirmative action by the Registered Holder to purchase Warrant Shares, and no enumeration herein of the rights or privileges of the Registered Holder shall give rise to any liability of such Registered Holder for the Exercise Price of Warrant Shares acquirable by exercise hereof or as a stockholder of the Company. 

  

 SECTION 5. _ Transferability._ This Warrant and the rights hereunder may not be transferred or assigned (other than a transfer pursuant to a public offering registered under the Securities Act, pursuant to Rule 144 or 144A promulgated under the Securities Act (or any similar rules then in effect), or to an affiliate of the Registered Holder), in whole or in part, without (i) compliance with applicable federal and state securities laws by the transferor and the transferee, and (ii) the delivery of investment representation letters and legal opinions reasonably satisfactory to the Company. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, this Warrant shall only be freely assignable by the original holder hereof to any of its affiliates, upon a Change of Control of such original holder to the successor(s) in interest of such original holder or as otherwise consented to by the Company. 

  

 SECTION 6. _ Legend._ Upon issuance, the Warrant Shares shall be imprinted with a legend substantially the following form: 

  

  

THIS SECURITY HAS NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS
AMENDED OR ANY STATE SECURITIES LAWS, AND MAY NOT BE SOLD, PLEDGED OR
OTHERWISE TRANSFERRED WITHOUT AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION THEREOF UNDER SUCH
ACT OR PURSUANT TO RULE 144 OR AN OPINION OF COUNSEL REASONABLY

  

    

SATISFACTORY TO THE CORPORATION AND ITS COUNSEL THAT SUCH REGISTRATION IS NOT
REQUIRED.

  

together with any legend required under applicable state securities laws.

  

  

 SECTION 7. _ Warrant Exchangeable for Different Denominations._ This Warrant is exchangeable, upon the surrender hereof by the Registered Holder at the principal office of the Company, for new Warrants of like tenor representing in the aggregate the purchase rights hereunder, and each of such new Warrants shall represent such portion of such rights as is designated by the Registered Holder at the time of such surrender. At the request of the Registered Holder (pursuant to a transfer of Warrants or otherwise), this Warrant may be exchanged for one or more Warrants to purchase Common Stock. The date the Company initially issues this Warrant shall be deemed to be the date of issuance hereof regardless of the number of times new certificates representing the unexpired and unexercised rights formerly represented by this Warrant shall be issued. All Warrants representing portions of the rights hereunder are referred to herein as the "Warrants." 

   

 SECTION 8. _ Replacement._ Upon receipt of evidence reasonably satisfactory to the Company (an affidavit of the Registered Holder shall be satisfactory) of the ownership and the loss, theft, destruction, or mutilation of any certificate evidencing this Warrant, and in the case of any such loss, theft, or destruction, upon receipt of indemnity reasonably satisfactory to the Company (provided, that if the Registered Holder is a financial institution or other institutional investor its own Agreement shall be satisfactory), or, in the case of any such mutilation upon surrender of such certificate, the Company shall (at its expense) execute and deliver in lieu of such certificate a new certificate of like kind representing the same rights represented by such lost, stolen, destroyed, or mutilated certificate and dated the date of such lost, stolen, destroyed, or mutilated certificate. 

  

 SECTION 9. _ Notices._ Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all notices and deliveries referred to in this Warrant shall be in writing and shall be delivered personally, by facsimile transmission (receipt verified), or sent by recognized express courier service requiring signature upon receipt, (i) to the Company, at its principal executive offices, and (ii) to a Registered Holder, at such Registered Holder\'s address as it appears in the records of the Company (unless otherwise indicated by any such Registered Holder). All notices shall be deemed effective upon receipt by the party to whom it is addressed. 

  

 SECTION 10. _ Amendment and Waiver._ Except as otherwise provided herein, the provisions of this Warrant may be amended and the Company may take any action herein prohibited, or omit to perform any act herein required to be performed by it, only if the Company has obtained the prior written consent of the Registered Holder. 

  

 SECTION 11. _ Warrant Register._ The Company shall maintain at its principal executive offices books for the registration and the registration of transfer of Warrants. The Company may deem and treat the Registered Holder as the absolute owner hereof (notwithstanding any notation of ownership or other writing thereon made by anyone) for all purposes and shall not be affected by any notice to the contrary. 

  

 SECTION 12. _ Fractions of Shares._ The Company may, but shall not be required to, issue a fraction of a Warrant Share upon the exercise of this Warrant in whole or in part. As to any fraction of a share which the Company elects not to issue, the Company shall make a cash payment in respect of such fraction in an amount equal to the same fraction of the Fair Market Value of a Warrant Share on the date of such exercise. 

   

 SECTION 13. _ Interpretation; Governing Law._ In this Warrant, the words "including" and "includes" shall be deemed to be followed by the phrase "without limitation." The headings of the several sections of this Agreement are intended for convenience of reference only and are not intended to affect the interpretation of this Warrant. This Warrant shall be governed by and interpreted in

JURISDICTION OF, AND VENUE IN, ANY STATE AND FEDERAL COURT OF COMPETENT
JURISDICTION LOCATED IN NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK OR SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA
IN CONNECTION WITH ANY DISPUTE UNDER THIS WARRANT

  

 SECTION 14. _ Independent Advisors._ Each party has relied on its own counsel and tax advisors in connection to this Warrant.
