----------------------- the Merger and without any action on the part of
Parent, Acquisition, the Company or the holders of any shares of Company
Common Stock or any shares of capital stock of Acquisition:   (a)
Conversion of Common Stock.  --------------------------   (i) Each share of
Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than shares of Company Common Stock owned by the
Company or any subsidiary of the Company, or Parent, Acquisition or any other
subsidiary of Parent (the "Excluded Shares")) shall, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into

Consideration"), less any required tax withholding.   (ii) All shares of
Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically
be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each certificate
previously representing any such shares shall thereafter represent only the
right to receive the Merger Consideration upon surrender of such certificates
in accordance with Section 2.2. The holders of such certificates previously
evidencing such shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such
shares of Company Common Stock as of the Effective Time except to receive the
Merger Consideration, and as otherwise provided herein or by law.   (b)
Capital Stock of Acquisition. Each share of the capital stock of 
---------------------------- Acquisition issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into one fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.   (c)
Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent Owned Stock. Each share of 
----------------------------------------------------- Company Common Stock
that is owned by the Company or by any subsidiary of the Company and each
share of Company Common Stock that is owned by Parent, Acquisition or any
other subsidiary of Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
automatically be cancelled and retired without any conversion thereof and no
Merger Consideration shall be delivered with respect thereto.   (d) Declared
and Unpaid Dividends. To the extent the record date for the 
----------------------------- Company\'s quarterly cash dividend of $0.15 per
share of Company Common Stock, as declared in accordance with past practice
followed prior to the date hereof, occurs before the Effective Time, and the
quarterly dividend is unpaid as of the Effective Time, such declared and
unpaid dividend shall be paid to the holders of Company Common Stock at the
Effective Time; provided, however, that the Company shall be entitled to
declare and pay only one such dividend after the date hereof.   3   
SECTION 2.2 Exchange of Certificates.  ------------------------   (a)
Promptly after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent (as defined below)
shall mail to each holder of record of Company Common Stock immediately prior
to the Effective Time (other than Excluded Shares) (i) a letter
of transmittal (the "Company Letter of Transmittal") (which shall specify
that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Company certificates representing shares of the Company Common Stock
(the "Certificates") shall pass, only upon delivery of such Certificates to
the Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions
as Parent shall reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger
Consideration with respect to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly
represented thereby.   (b) Prior to or contemporaneously with the Effective
Time, and subject to Section 4.5, Parent shall cause to be deposited with the
party specified by Parent as the exchange agent (the "Exchange Agent")
amounts sufficient in the aggregate to provide all funds necessary for the
Exchange Agent to make payments pursuant to Section 2.1(a)(i) hereof to
holders of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time who are to receive the Merger Consideration. Any interest,
dividends, or other income earned on the investment of cash deposited by
Parent with the Exchange Agent in accordance with this Section 2.2(b) shall
be for the account of and payable to Parent. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall transfer to the Exchange Agent cash in the amount of $165
million to be held by the Exchange Agent for the account of the Company but
to be transferred to the Exchange Agent as part of the Merger Consideration
at the Effective Time   (c) Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of
Certificates, together with the Company Letter of Transmittal, duly executed
and completed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and only upon such
surrender, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive, in
exchange therefor, and Parent shall promptly cause to be delivered by the
Exchange Agent to such holder, a check in the amount to which such holder is
entitled, after giving effect to any required tax withholdings. The
Certificates surrendered pursuant to this Section 2.2(c) shall forthwith be
cancelled. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen, mislaid or
destroyed, then upon receipt of an affidavit of that fact from the holder
claiming such Certificate to be lost, mislaid, stolen or destroyed and a lost
certificate indemnity, the Exchange Agent shall issue to such holder
the Merger Consideration into which the shares represented by such lost,
stolen, mislaid or destroyed Certificate shall have been converted.   (d)
No interest will be paid or will accrue on the amount payable upon
the surrender of any Certificate. If payment is to be made to a person other
than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, it shall be a
condition of such payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall be
properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for transfer, as determined by
the Exchange Agent or Parent, and that the person requesting such payment
shall pay any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the payment to a
person other than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered or
establish to the satisfaction of the Parent or the Exchange Agent that such
tax has been paid or is not payable. One hundred eighty (180) days following
the Effective Time, Parent shall be entitled to cause the Exchange Agent to
deliver to it any funds (including any interest received with respect
thereto) made available to the Exchange Agent which have not been disbursed
to holders of the Certificates formerly   4   representing shares of
Company Common Stock outstanding on the Effective Time, and thereafter such
holders shall be entitled to look to the Parent only as general creditors
thereof with respect to cash payable upon due surrender of their
Certificates. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by the holders of
Company Common Stock five (5) business days immediately prior to such time
the amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental
Entity shall become, to the extent permitted by applicable law, the property
of Parent free and clear of any claims or interest of any person previously
entitled thereto.   (e) In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company
Common Stock which is not registered in the transfer records of the Company,
the Merger Consideration may be paid or issued to a person other than the
person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such
Certificate, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect
such transfer, shall be properly endorsed with signature guarantees or
otherwise be in proper form for transfer, and the person requesting such
payment shall pay any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the
payment of the Merger Consideration to a person other than the registered
holder of such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of Parent that
such tax has been paid or is not applicable.   (f) The Merger Consideration
paid upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates in accordance with the
terms of this Article II shall be deemed to have been paid and issued in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock
theretofore represented by such Certificates. At the Effective Time, the
stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no
further registrations of transfers of shares of Company Common Stock
thereafter on the records of the Company.   SECTION 2.3 Stock Options. At
the Effective Time, each outstanding option  ------------- to purchase
shares of Company Common Stock (a "Company Stock Option" or, collectively,
the "Company Stock Options") issued pursuant to the Company\'s 1991 Stock
Option Plan (the "Stock Option Plan"), or otherwise, whether vested
or unvested, shall be canceled and each holder of a Company Stock Option
shall be entitled to receive, subject to applicable tax withholdings, if any,
promptly after the Effective Time, in exchange therefor cash in an amount
equal to the product of (i) the excess of the Merger Consideration over the
exercise price of such Company Stock Option, multiplied by (ii) the number of
shares subject to such Company Stock Option. The Company shall take all
action necessary to give effect to this Section 2.3.   SECTION 2.4 No
Liability. None of Parent, Acquisition, the Company or the 
------------ Exchange Agent shall be liable to any holder of shares of
Company Common Stock for any cash otherwise payable to such holder of shares
of Company Common Stock or paid to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.   SECTION 2.5
Dissenters\' Rights. Pursuant to the provisions of NRS Section 
------------------ 92A.390, the holders of Company Common Stock shall not
have any dissenters\' rights and shall be entitled to receive only the Merger
Consideration.   5    ARTICLE III  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE
COMPANY   Except in each case as publicly disclosed by the Company in the
Company SEC Reports (as defined below) filed prior to the date hereof or as
set forth on the Disclosure Schedule previously delivered by the Company to
Parent (the "Company Disclosure Schedule") (it being agreed that any
disclosure set forth on any particular schedule of the Company Disclosure
Schedules shall be deemed disclosed in another schedule of the Company
Disclosure Schedule if disclosure with respect to the particular schedule is
sufficient to make it reasonably clear to Parent the relevance of the
disclosure to such other schedule), the Company hereby represents and
warrants to each of Parent and Acquisition as follows:   SECTION 3.1
Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries. 
--------------------------------------------   (a) Each of the Company and
its subsidiaries (which reference throughout this Agreement shall include
directly and indirectly owned subsidiaries) is duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its
incorporation or organization and has all requisite corporate power and
authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its
businesses as now being conducted. The Company has heretofore delivered to
Acquisition or Parent accurate and complete copies of the Articles of
Incorporation and Bylaws (or similar governing documents), as currently

in violation of its Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws. None of the
Company\'s Significant Subsidiaries is in violation of its organizational

organizational documents except for violations which would not reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.   (b) Each of the
Company and its subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed and in good
standing to do business in each jurisdiction in which the property owned,
leased or operated by it or the nature of the business conducted by it makes
such qualification or licensing necessary, except in such jurisdictions where
the failure to be so duly qualified or licensed and in good standing
would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect.   The term "Company Material Adverse Effect" shall mean any change
or effect that, individually or in the aggregate, is or is reasonably likely
to be materially adverse to the business, assets, operations, results of
operations, prospects as identified in the Company\'s 2002 budget previously
delivered to Parent or financial condition of the Company and its
subsidiaries, taken as a whole other than any changes or effects arising out
of (i) general economic conditions, (ii) the financial markets and (iii) the
entering into or the public disclosure of this Agreement or the transaction
contemplated hereby.   (c) Section 3.1 of the Company Disclosure Schedule
identifies each subsidiary of the Company as of the date hereof and its
respective jurisdiction of incorporation or organization, as the case may
be.   6    SECTION 3.2 Capitalization of the Company and its
Subsidiaries.  --------------------------------------------------   (a) The

April 8, 2002, 56,680 shares of Class A Common Stock and 184,643 shares of

Schedule, there are no stockholder agreements, voting trusts or other
agreements or understandings to which the Company is a party or by which it
is bound relating to the voting or registration of any shares of capital
stock of the Company. Since April 8, 2002, there have been no issuances of
the Company\'s capital stock other than issuances pursuant to
outstanding Company Stock Options.   (b) Except as set forth in Section 3.2

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF  PARENT AND ACQUISITION   Except as set
forth on the Disclosure Schedule previously delivered by the Parent to the
Company (the "Parent Disclosure Schedule") (it being agreed that any
disclosure set forth on any particular schedule of the Parent Disclosure
Schedules shall be deemed disclosed in another schedule of the Parent
Disclosure Schedule if disclosure with respect to the particular schedule is
sufficient to make it reasonably clear to Company the relevance of
the disclosure to such other schedule), the Parent and Acquisition hereby
jointly represent and warrant to the Company as follows:   SECTION 4.1
Organization.  ------------   (a) Each of Parent and Acquisition is duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its
respective state of incorporation and has all requisite corporate power and
authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its
businesses as now being conducted. Parent has heretofore delivered to the
Company accurate and complete copies of the Articles of Incorporation and
Bylaws as currently in effect of Parent and Acquisition.   (b) Each of
Parent and Acquisition is duly qualified or licensed and in good standing to
do business in each jurisdiction in which the property owned, leased or
operated by it or the nature of the business conducted by it makes such
qualification or licensing necessary, except in such jurisdictions where the
failure to be so duly qualified or licensed and in good standing would not
have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.   The term "Parent Material Adverse
Effect" shall mean any change or effect that, individually or in the
aggregate, is or is reasonably likely to be materially adverse to the
business, assets, operations, results of operations, prospects or financial
condition of the Parent and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole other than any
changes or effects arising out of (i) general   20   economic conditions,
(ii) the financial markets and (iii) the entering into or the public
disclosure of this Agreement or the transaction contemplated hereby.  
SECTION 4.2 Authority Relative to this Agreement. Each of 
------------------------------------ Parent and Acquisition has all necessary
corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The execution and delivery
of this Agreement by Parent and the consummation by Parent of the
transactions contemplated hereby have been duly and validly authorized by the
boards of directors of Parent and Acquisition and by Parent as the sole
stockholder of Acquisition and no other corporate proceedings on the part of
Parent or Acquisition are necessary to authorize this Agreement or to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been duly
and validly executed and delivered by each of Parent and Acquisition and,
assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by the Company,
constitutes a valid, legal and binding agreement of each of Parent
and Acquisition enforceable against each of Parent and Acquisition in
accordance with its terms, except that (i) such enforcement may be subject to
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other
similar laws, now or hereafter in effect, affecting creditors\' rights
generally, and (ii) the remedy of specific performance and injunctive and
other forms of equitable relief may be subject to equitable defenses and to
the discretion of the court before which any proceeding therefor may be
brought.   SECTION 4.3 Information Supplied. None of the information 
-------------------- supplied by Parent or Acquisition in writing for
inclusion in the Proxy Statement will, at the time that the Proxy Statement
is mailed to the Company\'s stockholders or at the time of the Company
Stockholders\' Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading, except that no representation or
warranty is made by Parent with respect to statements made or incorporated by
reference therein based on information supplied by the Company for inclusion
or incorporation by reference therein.   SECTION 4.4 Consents and Approvals;
No Violations. Except as  ------------------------------------- set forth in
Section 4.5 of the Parent Disclosure Schedule, and except for filings,
permits, authorizations, consents and approvals as may be required under and
other applicable requirements of the Exchange Act, the HSR Act, foreign
antitrust laws and the filing of the articles of merger as required by the
NRS, no filing with or notice to, and no permit authorization, consent
or approval of, any Governmental Entity is necessary for the execution and
delivery by Parent or Acquisition of this Agreement or the consummation by
Parent or Acquisition of the transactions contemplated hereby, except where
the failure to obtain such permits, authorizations, consents or approvals or
to make such filings or give such notice would not have a Parent Material
Adverse Effect. Neither the execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement by Parent or Acquisition nor the consummation by Parent or
Acquisition of the transactions contemplated hereby will (a) conflict with or
result in any breach of any provision of the respective Articles of
Incorporation or Bylaws of Parent or Acquisition or any of Parent\'s other
subsidiaries, (b) result in a violation or breach of or constitute (with or
without due notice or lapse of time or both) a default (or give rise to any
right of termination, amendment, cancellation or acceleration or Lien) under
any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any material note, bond,
mortgage, indenture, lease, license, contract, agreement or other instrument
or obligation to which Parent or   21   Acquisition or any of Parent\'s
other subsidiaries is a party or by which any of them or any of their
respective properties or assets may be bound and which contemplates a payment
to or from Parent or Acquisition or any of Parent\'s other subsidiaries, or
(c) to Parent\'s knowledge, violate any order, writ, injunction, decree, law,
statute, rule or regulation applicable to Parent or Acquisition or any of
Parent\'s other subsidiaries or any of their respective properties or assets

commitment letters from Whitney V, L.P. and Golden Gate Private Equity, Inc.,
in each case as set forth in the Parent Disclosure Schedule (the debt

as collectively referred to as the "Financing Letters").   To the knowledge
of Parent and Acquisition, the proceeds of the financings as set forth in the
Financing Letters (the "Financings"), together with unrestricted and
available cash of the Company of at least $165 million are expected to be
sufficient to consummate the Merger, pay all fees and expenses related to any
of the foregoing, refinance up to $10.6 million of indebtedness of the
Company and provide working capital for Acquisition.   SECTION 4.6 No Prior
Activities. Except for obligations  ------------------- incurred in

engaged in any business or activity of any type or kind whatsoever or entered
into any agreement or arrangement with any person.   SECTION 4.7 Ownership

or understanding (other than this Agreement) for the purpose of acquiring,
holding or disposing of, in each case, shares of Company Common Stock.

Potential Acquirors.  -------------------------   (a) The Company agrees
that it shall cease (and will instruct its Representatives, as defined
herein, to cease) all existing negotiations with any third parties with
respect to a Takeover Proposal. Except as otherwise set forth in this Section
5.2, the Company shall not permit any of its subsidiaries to, nor authorize
nor permit any officer, director or employee of, or any investment banker,
attorney or other advisor or representative of the Company or any of
its subsidiaries ("Representatives") to, directly or indirectly: (i)
solicit, initiate, or encourage the submission of, any Takeover Proposal, or
take any other action to facilitate any inquiries or make any proposal that
constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to lead to, any Takeover Proposal,
(ii) engage in negotiations or discussions with, or furnish any information
or data, or afford access to the properties, books or records of the Company
or its subsidiaries to any third party relating to a Takeover Proposal, or
(iii) enter into any agreement with respect to any Takeover Proposal or
approve any Takeover Proposal. For purposes of this Agreement, "Takeover
Proposal" means any written proposal or offer (whether or not delivered to
the Company\'s stockholders generally) for a merger, consolidation,
recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction, purchase
of substantial assets, tender offer or other business combination involving
the Company or any of its subsidiaries or any proposal or offer to acquire in
any manner, directly or indirectly, a substantial equity interest in, or a
substantial portion of the assets or business of, the Company or any of its
subsidiaries, other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.  
(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement and
so long as the Company is in compliance with the provisions of Section
5.2(a), if the Company and its Board of Directors or the Special Committee
prior to the Company Stockholders\' Meeting determine in good faith after
discussion with independent counsel that an unsolicited Takeover
Proposal would likely result in a Superior Proposal and the Board of
Directors or the Special Committee determines in good faith that the failure
to participate in discussions or negotiations with or to furnish information
to the Potential Acquiror, as defined below, would be inconsistent with the
Board of Directors\' fiduciary duties under applicable law, then the Company
and its Board of Directors or Special Committee: (i) may participate in
discussions or negotiations (including, as a part thereof, make any
counterproposal) with or furnish information to any third party making an
unsolicited Takeover Proposal (a "Potential Acquiror"), and (ii) shall be
permitted to take and disclose to the Company\'s stockholders a position with
respect to any tender or exchange offer by a third party, or amend or
withdraw such position, pursuant to Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2 of the Exchange
Act.   26    (c) Any non-public information furnished to a Potential
Acquiror shall be pursuant to a confidentiality agreement substantially
similar to the confidentiality provisions of the confidentiality agreement
entered into between the Company and Whitney and Co., LLC.   (d) The Board of
Directors of the Company or the Special Committee shall not approve or
recommend, as the case may be, or propose to approve or recommend, as the
case may be, or enter into any agreement with respect to, any Takeover
Proposal unless the Board and the Special Committee determine in good faith,
after receiving advice from their financial advisor, that such Takeover
Proposal would, if so completed, result in a Superior Proposal. For purposes
of this Agreement, "Superior Proposal" means a written Takeover Proposal made
by a third party with respect to which: (i) the Board of Directors of the
Company and the Special Committee determine, based on such matters that they
deem relevant, including, without limitation, the likelihood of consummation,
the trading market, liquidity of any securities offered in connection with
the Takeover Proposal and the factors set forth in NRS Section 78.138, that
the Takeover Proposal is superior as compared with the Merger, and (ii) if
the Takeover Proposal (x) is subject to a financing condition or (y) involves
consideration that is not entirely cash or does not permit stockholders to
receive the payment of the offered consideration in respect of all shares
at the same time, the Company\'s Board of Directors and the Special Committee
have been furnished with the written opinion of Company Financial Advisor or
a nationally recognized financial advisor that (in the case of clause (x)),
the Takeover Proposal is readily financeable and (in the case of clause (y))
that the Takeover Proposal provides a higher value per share than the
consideration per share to be paid to the Company\'s stockholders pursuant to
the Merger.   (e) Except as set forth in this Section 5.2, neither the
Board of Directors of the Company, nor the Special Committee, shall (x)
withdraw or modify, or propose to withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to
Parent, the Board of Directors\' approval or recommendation of the Merger or
this Agreement, (y) approve any letter of intent, agreement in principle,
acquisition agreement or similar agreement (other than a confidentiality
agreement in connection with a Superior Proposal which is entered into by the
Company in accordance with Section 5.2(c)) relating to any Takeover Proposal
(each, an "Acquisition Agreement"), or (z) approve or recommend, or propose
to approve or recommend, any Takeover Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing
or anything else to the contrary contained in this Agreement, in response to
a Superior Proposal which was not solicited by the Company, and which did not
otherwise result from a breach of Section 5.2(a), the Board of Directors of
the Company may, subject to the immediately following sentence, terminate
this Agreement pursuant to and subject to the terms of Section 7.5 and,
concurrently with such termination, cause the Company to enter into an
Acquisition Agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal, but only if the
Company\'s Board of Directors determines, after consultation with its
independent counsel, that failure to terminate this Merger Agreement and
accept the Superior Proposal would be inconsistent with the Company\'s Board
of Directors fiduciary duties to stockholders. Such actions may be taken by
the Company\'s Board of Directors only if it has delivered to Parent prior to
or on the date of the Company Stockholders\' Meeting written notice of the
intent of the Company\'s Board of Directors to take the actions referred
to in the preceding sentence, together with a copy of the related
Acquisition Agreement and a description of any terms of the Takeover Proposal
not contained therein. The Board of Directors shall not terminate this
Agreement and enter into an Agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal
pursuant to this Section 5.2(e) until the end of the second business day
following delivery of such notice to Parent, after which the Board of
Directors, taking into   27   account such matters that they deem
relevant (including, without limitation, including, without limitation, the
likelihood of consummation, the trading market, liquidity of any securities
offered in connection with the Takeover Proposal and the factors set forth in
NRS Section 78.138, as well as any indications from Parent that it will make
an alternative proposal), may proceed with such Superior Proposal and enter
into an Acquisition Agreement in connection with the Superior Proposal.  
(f) The Company promptly, and in any event within 48 hours, shall advise the
Parent orally and in writing of the submission of any Takeover Proposal, the
identity of the person making any such Takeover Proposal and the material
terms of any such Takeover Proposal; provided, however, neither Parent nor
Acquisition shall interfere with the Company, the Board of Directors or
the Special Committee with respect to any such Takeover Proposal (including

Preparation of the Proxy Statement; Stockholders\' Meeting. 
---------------------------------------------------------   (a) As promptly
as reasonably practicable after the execution of this Agreement, the Company
shall prepare and file with the SEC the Proxy Statement. The Company shall
obtain and furnish the information required to be included in the Proxy
Statement and shall respond promptly to any comments made by the SEC with
respect to the Proxy Statement and cause the Proxy Statement and form
of proxy to be mailed to the Company\'s stockholders at the earliest
practicable date. Parent shall cooperate in the preparation of the Proxy
Statement and shall as soon as reasonably practicable after the date hereof
furnish the Company with all information for inclusion in the Proxy Statement
as the Company may reasonably request. The Company agrees, as to information
with respect to the Company, its officers, directors, stockholders and
subsidiaries contained in the Proxy Statement, and Parent agrees, as to
information with respect to Parent and its officers, directors, stockholders
and subsidiaries contained in the Proxy Statement that such information, at
the date the Proxy Statement is mailed and (as amended or supplemented) at
the time of the Company Stockholders Meeting, will not be false or misleading
with respect to any material fact, or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances in which they are made, not misleading. Parent and
its counsel shall be given the opportunity to review the Proxy Statement and
all amendments or supplements thereof prior to their being filed with the
SEC, and the Company shall not make any such filing without consulting with
Parent. The Company will advise Parent, promptly after it receives notice
thereof, of the time when the Proxy Statement has been cleared by the SEC or
any request by the SEC for an amendment of the Proxy Statement or comments
from the SEC thereon and proposed responses thereto or requests by the SEC
for additional information and Company shall furnish copies to Parent.
The Company, on the one hand, and Parent, on the other hand, agree to
promptly correct any information provided by either of them for use in the
Proxy Statement if any, if and to the extent that it shall have become
materially false or misleading, and the Company further agrees to take all
steps reasonably necessary to cause the Proxy Statement as so corrected to be
filed with the SEC and to use all reasonable efforts to cause the Proxy
Statement to be disseminated to the Company\'s stockholders, in each case, as
and to the extent required by applicable laws.   28    (b) Parent agrees
promptly to advise the Company if at any time prior to the Company
Stockholders\' Meeting any information provided by it in the Proxy Statement
is or becomes incorrect or incomplete in any material respect and to provide
the Company with the information needed to correct such inaccuracy or
omission. Parent will furnish the Company with such supplemental information
as may be necessary in order to cause the Proxy Statement, insofar as it
relates to Parent and its subsidiaries, to comply with applicable law after
the mailing thereof to the stockholders of the Company.   (c) The Company
agrees promptly to advise Parent if at any time prior to the Company
Stockholders\' Meeting any information provided by it in the Proxy Statement
is or becomes incorrect or incomplete in any material respect and to provide
Parent with the information needed to correct such inaccuracy or omission.
The Company will furnish Parent with such supplemental information as may be
necessary in order to cause the Proxy Statement, insofar as it relates to the
Company and its subsidiaries, to comply with applicable law after the mailing
thereof to the stockholders of the Company.   (d) Concurrently with the
filing of the Proxy Statement, Parent and Acquisition and their respective
affiliates (to the extent required by law) shall prepare and file with the
SEC, together with the Company, a Rule 13E-3 Transaction Statement on
Schedule 13E-3 (together with all supplements and amendments thereto, the
"Schedule 13E-3") with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. The Company shall promptly furnish to Parent all information
concerning the Company as may reasonably be requested in connection with the
preparation of the Schedule 13E-3. The Company shall promptly supplement,
update and correct any information provided by it for use in the Schedule
13E-3 if and to the extent that such information is or shall have become
incomplete, false or misleading. In any such event, Parent shall take
all reasonable steps necessary to cause the Schedule 13E-3 as so
supplemented, updated or corrected to be filed with the SEC and Parent and
Company shall take all reasonable steps to cause same to be disseminated to
the holders of Company Common Stock, in each case, as and to the extent
required by applicable federal securities laws. The Company and its counsel
shall be given an opportunity to review and comment on the Schedule 13E-3 and
each supplement, amendment or response to comments with respect thereto prior
to its being filed with or delivered to the SEC and Parent shall consider any
such comments in good faith. Parent agrees to provide the Company and its
counsel with copies of any comments that Parent or its counsel may receive
from the staff of the SEC promptly after receipt thereof.   (e) As soon as
reasonably practicable following the clearance of comments from the staff of
the SEC regarding the Proxy Statement, the Company shall call and hold the
Company Stockholders\' Meeting for the purpose of obtaining the Stockholder
Approval. Subject to the fiduciary duties of its Board of Directors, the
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to solicit proxies from its
stockholders and to secure the vote or consent of stockholders required by
applicable law or otherwise to obtain the Stockholder Approval. The Company,
through its Board of Directors, shall recommend to its stockholders
the obtaining of the Stockholder Approval, provided, however, that subject to
the provisions of Section 7.1, the Company\'s Board of Directors may
withdraw, modify or amend its recommendation if (i) the Company receives a
Superior Proposal and (ii) after complying with the provisions of Section 5.2
the Board of Directors by a majority vote determines in its good faith
judgment that it is required in order to comply with its fiduciary duties to
recommend the Superior Proposal.   29    SECTION 5.4 Access to
Information; Confidentiality. Upon notice 
-------------------------------------- by Parent and permission granted by
the Company, which shall not be unreasonably delayed or withheld, the Company
shall, and shall cause its subsidiaries to, afford Parent and its lenders and
other investors, and the officers, employees, accountants, counsel, financial
advisors and other representatives of Parent and its lenders and other
investors, reasonable access during normal business hours during the period
prior to the Effective Time, and in a manner reasonably designed to minimize
disruption to the operations of the Company and its subsidiaries, and to all
their respective properties, books, contracts, agreements, commitments,
returns, personnel and records and, during such period, the Company shall,
and shall cause each of its subsidiaries to, furnish promptly to Parent, (a)
a copy of each report, schedule, registration statement and other document
filed by it during such period pursuant to the requirements of federal or
state securities laws and (b) all other information concerning its
business, properties and personnel as Parent may reasonably request. Except
as required by law, each of the Company and Parent will hold, and will cause

accountants, counsel, financial advisers and other representatives and
affiliates to hold, any confidential information in accordance with the
confidentiality agreement entered into between the Company and Whitney and Co.,
LLC.   SECTION 5.5 Reasonable Efforts; Notification. 
--------------------------------   (a) Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of the Company, Parent and
Acquisition agrees (and shall cause their respective subsidiaries) to use
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to
do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties

ability of any party hereto to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby.   (b) The Company shall give prompt written notice to
Parent, and Parent shall give prompt written notice to the Company, of (i)
any representation or warranty made by it contained in this Agreement
becoming untrue or inaccurate in any Material Respect, as defined in Section

Respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied
by it under this Agreement, (iii) the occurrence of an event or events which
individually or in the aggregate, is reasonably likely to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect, or (iv) the commencement of or, to the extent the
Company has knowledge of the threat of, any litigation involving or affecting
the Company or any subsidiary, or any of their respective properties or
assets, or, to its knowledge, any employee, agent, director or officer of the
Company or any subsidiary, in his or her capacity as such or as a fiduciary
under a Benefit Plan of the Company or any subsidiary, which, if pending  
30   on the date hereof, would have been required to have been disclosed in
or pursuant to this Agreement or which directly relates to the consummation
of the Merger, or any material development in connection with any litigation
disclosed by the Company in or pursuant to this Agreement or the Company SEC
Reports. Each of Parent, Acquisition and the Company hereby represent that,
other than as previously disclosed to each other on the Disclosure Schedule
(which disclosures shall not constitute a breach), as of the date hereof they
do not have any actual knowledge of a breach of the representations and
warranties being made by such other party pursuant to this Agreement.  
SECTION 5.6 Stock Options. Each Company Stock Option outstanding 
------------- pursuant to the Stock Option Plan or otherwise, whether or not
then exercisable, shall be canceled as of the Effective Time and thereafter
only entitle the holder thereof, upon surrender thereof, to receive the
amount specified in Section 2.3, which cancellation shall be in accordance
with the terms of any Company Stock Option and Stock Option Plan. Prior to
the Effective Time, the Company shall mail to each Person who is a holder of
outstanding Company Stock Options granted pursuant to the Stock Option Plan
or otherwise a letter in a form reasonably acceptable to Parent which
describes the treatment of and payment for such options pursuant to this
Section 5.6 and provides instructions for use in obtaining payment for such
options hereunder.   SECTION 5.7 Takeover Statutes; Inconsistent Actions. If
any "fair  --------------------------------------- price," "moratorium,"
"control share," "business combination," "shareholder protection" or similar
or other anti-takeover statute or regulation (including, without limitation,
Sections 78.378 through 78.3793 and Sections 78.411 through 78.444 of the
NRS) shall become applicable to the Merger or any of the other transactions
contemplated hereby, the Company and the Board of Directors of the Company
shall grant such approvals and take all such actions so that the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated on the
terms contemplated hereby and otherwise eliminate the effects of such statute
or regulation on the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby.  
SECTION 5.8 Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance. 
------------------------------------------   (a) The Articles of
Incorporation and the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall contain the
provisions with respect to indemnification and exculpation from liability set
forth in the Company\'s Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws on the date of
this Agreement, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise
modified in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of
individuals who on or prior to the Effective Time were directors, officers,
employees or agents of the Company, unless such modification is required by
law.   (b) After the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall indemnify and hold harmless (and shall also advance expenses as
incurred to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law to) each person
who is or has been prior to the date hereof or who becomes prior to the
Effective Time an officer or director of the Company or any of the Company\'s
subsidiaries (the "Indemnified Persons") against (a) all losses, claims,
damages, costs, expenses (including, without limitation, counsel fees and
expenses), settlement payments or liabilities arising out of or in connection
with any claim, demand, action, suit, proceeding or investigation based in
whole or in part on or arising in whole or in part out of the fact that such
person is or was an officer or   31   director of the Company or any of
its subsidiaries whether or not pertaining to any matter existing or
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time and whether or not asserted or
claimed prior to or at or after the Effective Time ("Indemnified
Liabilities") and (b) all Indemnified Liabilities based in whole or in part
on or arising in whole or in part out of or pertaining to this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby, in each case to the fullest extent
required or permitted under applicable law or under the
Surviving Corporation\'s Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws. The parties
hereto intend, to the extent not prohibited by applicable law, that the
indemnification provided for in this Section 5.8(b) shall apply without
limitation to negligent acts or omissions by an Indemnified Person. Parent
hereby guarantees the payment and performance of the Surviving Corporation\'s
obligations in this Section 5.8(b). Each Indemnified Person is intended to be
a third party beneficiary of this Section 5.8(b) and may specifically enforce
its terms. This Section 5.8(b) shall not limit or otherwise adversely effect
any rights any Indemnified Person may have under any agreement with the
Company or under the Company\'s Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws.   (c)
For six years from the Effective Time, Parent shall maintain in effect
directors\' and officers\' liability insurance for current and
former officers and directors of the Company and its subsidiaries who are
currently covered by the Company\'s directors\' and officers\' liability
insurance policy (a copy of which has been heretofore made available to
Parent) on terms no less favorable to such indemnified parties than the terms
of such current insurance coverage in effect for the Company on the date
hereof and providing coverage only with respect to matters occurring prior to
the Effective Time, to the extent that such coverage can be maintained at an
annual net cost to the Surviving Corporation of not greater than 150% of the
annual premium for the Company\'s current insurance policies and, if such
coverage cannot be so maintained at such cost, providing as much of such
insurance as can be so maintained at a net cost equal to 150% of the annual
premium for the Company\'s current insurance policies.   (d) The
obligations of the Company, the Surviving Corporation and Parent contained in
this Section 5.8 shall be binding on the successors and assigns of Parent and
the Surviving Corporation. If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of
their successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other
person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of
its properties and assets to any person, then and in each such case, proper
provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set
forth in this Section 5.8.   SECTION 5.9 Fees and Expenses. Except as
provided in Section 7.5,  ----------------- whether or not the Merger is
consummated, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party
incurring such expenses. The Company shall not pay expenses of any individual
stockholder.   SECTION 5.10 Public Announcements. Parent and Acquisition, on
the  -------------------- one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, will
not issue any press release or other public statements with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger, without
first obtaining the prior consent of the other party; provided, however, in
the event of any press release that may be required by applicable law, court
process, or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any
national securities exchange or the   32   NASDAQ National Market, the
parties will use reasonable best efforts to consult with each other before
issuing, and to provide each other the opportunity to review and comment
upon, any such press release or other public statement.   SECTION 5.11
Status of Company Employees; Employee Benefits. 
----------------------------------------------   (a) For a period beginning
at the Effective Time and ending on the 90th day following the Effective
Time, Parent shall to the extent practicable cause the Surviving Corporation
to provide employee benefits and programs to the employees of the Company and
its subsidiaries who are employed by the Surviving Corporation or its
subsidiaries at the date hereof ("Company Employees") that, in the aggregate
are substantially comparable or more favorable, as a whole, than those in
existence as of the date hereof and disclosed in writing to Parent prior to
the execution hereof, except for those set forth in Section 5.11(a) of the
Parent Disclosure Schedule.   (b) To the extent Parent determines to cover
Company Employees under employee benefit plans and arrangements maintained by
Parent or its subsidiaries ("Parent Benefit Plans") instead of employee
benefit plans and arrangements of the Company, then for a period of ninety
(90) days following the Effective Time, any pre-existing condition exclusion
under any Parent Benefit Plan providing medical or dental benefits shall be
waived for any Company Employee who, immediately prior to commencing
participation in such Parent Benefit Plan, was participating in an Employee
Plan providing medical or dental benefits and had satisfied any pre-existing
condition provision under such Employee Plan (to the extent that such pre-
existing condition would have been waived under the similar Company benefit
plan, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time). Any expenses
that were taken into account under an Employee Plan providing medical or
dental benefits in which the Company Employee participated immediately
prior to commencing participation in a Parent Benefit Plan providing medical
or dental benefits shall be taken into account to the same extent under such
Parent Benefit Plan, in accordance with the terms of such Parent Benefit
Plan, for purposes of satisfying applicable deductible, coinsurance and
maximum out-of- pocket provisions and life-time benefit limits.   SECTION
5.12 Governmental Approvals. Parent shall use reasonable best 
---------------------- efforts to promptly prepare and file, but in any
event, will file no later than twenty days after the date hereof, all
necessary documentation to effect all applications, notices, petitions and
filings, to obtain as promptly as practicable all permits, registrations,
licenses, findings of suitability, consents, variances, exemptions, orders,
approvals and authorizations of all third parties and Governmental Entities
which are necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement ("Governmental Approvals") and shall file initial
applications and documents related to all such Governmental Approvals within
such time as necessary for such Governmental Approvals to be granted on or
before the Effective Time and shall act reasonably and promptly thereafter in
responding to additional requests in connection therewith.   SECTION 5.13
Japanese Subsidiary Minority Shares. Notwithstanding 
----------------------------------- anything contained in this Agreement to
the contrary, the parties hereby agree that, following the date hereof and
prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to negotiate, enter into and perform agreements or
arrangements providing for the   33   purchase, exchange, cancellation or
other disposal of the Japanese Subsidiary Minority Shares ("J-Sub Minority
Shares") such that the Company shall become the sole owner of all outstanding
shares of capital stock or other equity securities of Japanese Subsidiary
(other than director\'s qualifying shares). The consideration for the J-Sub
Minority Shares may consist of cash, Company Common Stock or other property;
provided that, unless Parent shall otherwise agree in writing, such
consideration shall not exceed $5,000,000 (with the value of any such
consideration that may consist of shares of Company Common Stock being equal
to the Merger Consideration per share of Company Common Stock and the value
of any other non-cash consideration being equal to the fair market
value thereof as determined by the Company\'s Board of Directors in the
exercise of its reasonable business judgment).   SECTION 5.14 Rights Plan.
The Company shall either (x) promptly  ----------- redeem all preferred
share purchase rights under the Rights Agreement (the "Rights Agreement")
dated July 27, 2000 between the Company and U.S. Stock Transfer Corporation
or (y) amend the Rights Agreement to exempt the Merger and the transaction
contemplated hereby from the Rights Agreement, and take all other action to
ensure that the Rights shall not become exercisable and no Distribution Date
(as such terms are defined in the Rights Agreement) shall occur thereunder
prior to the Closing Date.   SECTION 5.15 Indemnification by Company. The
Company shall  -------------------------- indemnify Parent, its
stockholders, Acquisition and their respective affiliates and each of their
respective current and former officers, directors, employees, agents and
representatives (individually an "Indemnitee" and collectively
the "Indemnitees"), to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, but
only with respect to any actual out-of-pocket defense cost or expense
incurred by an Indemnitee directly in connection with the defense of any
claim asserted against an Indemnitee which is directly based on an allegation
that an Indemnitee has induced or acted in concert with the Company or any of
its directors to act contrary to or in violation of any duty under applicable
law, to which the Company and any of its directors are subject, to the
extent, but only to the extent, such allegation directly relates to the
negotiation, execution or delivery of this Agreement by the parties hereto
(an "Indemnifiable Matter"); provided, however, in no event shall the Company
be responsible for indemnifying or making any payment to, or on behalf of,
any Indemnitee hereunder with respect to any settlement, judgment,
contribution, indemnification or similar payment made to or on behalf of any
party in connection with the settlement, disposition, resolution or dismissal
of any action, case, proceeding, allegation, arbitration or other similar
proceeding other than one requiring payment by Parent or Acquisition of fees
and expenses of counsel for the claiming party. Promptly after receipt by an
Indemnitee of notice of the assertion of any claim or the commencement of any
action against such Indemnitee in respect to which indemnity or reimbursement
may be sought against under this Section 5.15 (an "Assertion") such
Indemnitee shall notify the Company in writing of the Assertion, but the
failure to so notify shall not relieve the Company of any liability it may
have to such Indemnitee hereunder except to the extent that such failure
shall have actually prejudiced the Company in defending against such
Assertion. In the event that following receipt of notice from the Indemnitee,
the Company notifies the Indemnitee that the Company desires to defend the
Indemnitee against such Assertion, the Company shall have the right to defend
the Indemnitee by appropriate proceedings and shall have the sole power to
direct and control such defense. If any Indemnitee desires to participate in
any such defense it may do so at its sole cost and expense; provided that if
the defendants in any such action shall include the Company and/or  
34   its officers or directors as well as an Indemnitee and such Indemnitee
shall have received the written advice of counsel that there exist defenses
available to such Indemnitee that are materially different from those
available to the Company and/or such officers or directors, the Indemnitee
shall have the right to select one separate counsel (and one local counsel in
such jurisdictions as are necessary) reasonably acceptable to the Company to
participate in the defense of such action on its behalf, at the expense of
the Company. If any Indemnitee retains such counsel, then to the extent
permitted by law, the Company shall periodically advance to such Indemnitee
its reasonable legal and other out-of-pocket expenses relating to the
Indemnifiable Matter (including the reasonable cost of any investigation and
preparation incurred in connection therewith). No Indemnitee shall settle any
Assertion without the prior written consent of the Company, nor shall the
Company settle any Assertion in which an Indemnitee is named as a defendant
without either (i) the written consent of all Indemnitees against whom such
Assertion was made (which consents shall not be unreasonably withheld), or
(ii) obtaining an unconditional general release from the party making the
Assertion for all Indemnitees as a condition of such settlement. The
provisions of this Section 5.15 are intended for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by, the respective Indemnitees.   ARTICLE VI  CONDITIONS

Entity shall have issued an order, decree or ruling or taken any other
action permanently enjoining, restraining or otherwise prohibiting the
consummation of the Merger and such order, decree or ruling or other action
shall have become final and nonappealable;   (e) by either Parent or the
Company, if the Merger shall not have occurred by August 31, 2002 (the

representation or warranty set forth in this Agreement by the party seeking
to terminate this Agreement, provided that either Parent or the Company may
extend the Outside Date, but no more than three times in the aggregate, and
each time by one month, but in no event beyond November 30, 2002, by
providing written notice thereof to the other party between three (3) and
five (5) business days prior to the next scheduled Outside Date if (i) (x)
the Merger shall not have been consummated by such date because the requisite
Governmental Approvals required under Section 6.1(d) have not been obtained
and are still being pursued, or (y) the condition set forth in Section 6.1(e)
shall not have been fully satisfied and (ii) the party requesting
such extension has satisfied all the conditions to Closing required to be

hereunder), if any approval of the stockholders of the Company required for
the consummation of the Merger shall not have been obtained by reason of the
failure to obtain the required vote at a duly held meeting of the Company\'s
stockholders or at any adjournment or postponement thereof called for such
purpose;   (g) by Parent, if the Board of Directors of the Company
(i) withdraws or modifies adversely its recommendation of the Merger
following the receipt by the Company of a Takeover Proposal, or (ii)
recommends a Takeover Proposal to Company stockholders, provided that any
disclosure that the Board of Directors of the Company is compelled to make
with respect to the receipt of a proposal for a Takeover Proposal in order to
comply with its fiduciary duties or Rules 14d-9 or 14e-2 shall not constitute
the withdrawal or material weakening of such Board\'s recommendation so long
as the Company has otherwise complied in all material respects with Section
5.2; or   (h) by the Company if, as a result of a Superior Proposal,
the Board of Directors of the Company determines, in its good faith judgment
and in the exercise of its fiduciary duties that the failure to terminate
this Agreement and accept such Superior Proposal could be inconsistent with
the proper exercise of such fiduciary duties and the Company has otherwise
complied in all material respects with Section 5.2.   38    For purposes
of Sections 7.1(b), (c), (e) and (f), "Material Breach" shall mean (i) when
used in connection with a representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
made by the Company or Parent, as the case may be, set forth in this
Agreement which is qualified by materiality or by Company Material Adverse
Effect or Parent Material Adverse Effect, as the case may be, a breach in any
respect (taking into account such qualifications as to materiality or
by Company Material Adverse Effect or Parent Material Adverse Effect, as the
case may be); and (ii) when used in connection with a representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement made by the Company or Parent, as the case

their respective officers or directors, except as set forth in the last
sentence of Section 5.4, Section 5.9, Section 5.15, Section 7.5 and Article
VIII which shall survive termination and except to the extent that such
termination results from the willful breach by a party of any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement.   SECTION 7.3 Amendment. This Agreement may be amended by the 
--------- parties at any time before or after approval hereof by the
stockholders of the Company; provided, however, that after such stockholder
approval there shall not be made any amendment that by law requires further
approval by the stockholders of the Company without the further approval of
such stockholders. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument
in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties.   SECTION 7.4
Extension; Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective

waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained in
this Agreement or in any document delivered pursuant to this Agreement or (c)

part of a party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set
forth in an instrument in writing, signed on behalf of such party. The
failure of any party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this
Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of those rights.  
SECTION 7.5 Termination Fee; Expense Reimbursement. 
--------------------------------------   (a) The Company agrees that in
order to compensate Parent for the direct and substantial damages suffered by
Parent in the event of termination of this Agreement under certain

consummating a transaction regarding a Takeover Proposal as described in
Sections 7.5(a)(i)(y), 7.5(a)(ii)(y) and 7.5(a)(iii)(y), respectively. The
Termination Fee payable under Sections 7.5(a)(iv) shall be paid concurrently
upon receipt by the Company of notice of termination by Parent pursuant to
such Section 7.5(a)(iv). The Termination Fee payable under Sections 7.5(a)(v)
shall be paid concurrently upon notice of termination by the Company pursuant
to such Section 7.5(a)(v). The Termination Fee shall be reduced by any
Expenses paid under Section 7.5(b) so that in no event shall the aggregate of
the Termination Fee and Expenses exceed $27 million. Under no circumstances
shall the Company be required to pay more than one Termination Fee.   (b)
The Company agrees to pay Parent its Expenses (as defined below) if, but only
if: Parent or the Company shall terminate this Agreement pursuant to Sections
7.1(b), 7.1(e), 7.1(f), 7.1(g) or Section 7.1(h). The term "Expenses" shall
mean all actual and documented out-of-pocket expenses not exceeding $10
million in the aggregate incurred by Parent and its affiliates in connection
with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including,
without limitation, fees and expenses of accountants, attorneys and financial
advisors, all costs of Parent and its affiliates relating to the financing of
the Merger (including, without limitation, advisory and commitment fees and
reasonable fees and expenses of counsel to potential lenders), costs and
expenses otherwise borne by Parent and its affiliates pursuant to
Section 5.9. The Expenses payable under Section 7.5(b) shall be paid
concurrently with notice of termination of this Agreement by the Company or
Parent, as the case may be, and submission of appropriate documentation of
such out-of-pocket expenses. Under no circumstances shall the Company be
required to pay more than one payment of Expenses.   (c) All payments under
this Section 7.5 shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to an account designated by the recipient of such funds.   (d) The
Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 7.5 are an
integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that,
without these agreements, the Parent would not enter into this Agreement.
Accordingly, if the Company fails to promptly pay any amounts owing pursuant
to this Section 7.5 when due, the Company shall in addition thereto pay to
the Parent and its affiliates all costs and expenses (including fees and
disbursements of counsel) incurred in collecting such amounts, together with
interest on such amounts (or any unpaid portion thereof) from the date
such payment was required to be made until the date such payment is received
by the Parent and its affiliates at the prime rate of Citibank, N.A. as in
effect from time to time during such period. Payment of the  
40   Termination Fee and/or Expenses described in this Section 7.5 shall
constitute the sole and exclusive remedy of the Parent and Acquisition
against the Company for any damages suffered or incurred in connection with
this Agreement. It is specifically agreed that the amount to be paid pursuant
to this Section 7.5 represents liquidated damages and not a penalty. Any
amounts paid by Company to Parent pursuant to this Section 7.5 shall be
reduced by any amounts paid by Company to Parent pursuant to Paragraph N of
that certain Exclusivity Agreement, by and between the Company and Whitney and
Co., LLC dated March 6, 2002, as amended.   ARTICLE VIII  GENERAL
