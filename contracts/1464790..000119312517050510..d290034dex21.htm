AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (hereinafter called this " _Agreement_ "), dated
as of February 17, 2017, is by and between FBR and Co., a Virginia corporation
(the " _Company_ ") and B. Riley Financial, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("

RECITALS

WHEREAS, the parties intend that, on the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement, the Company shall merge with and into Parent (the

_VSCA_ ") and the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the "
_DGCL_ ") and this Agreement;

 

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company (the " _Company Board_ ") has
unanimously (i) adopted this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including the Merger, upon the terms and conditions set forth
in this Agreement, (ii) determined that this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement are fair to, and in the best interests of, the

"), and (iii) resolved to recommend that the holders of shares of Company
Common Stock approve the Merger and adopt this Agreement;

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of Parent (the " _Parent Board_ ") has
unanimously (i) approved and declared advisable this Agreement and the

and

WHEREAS, the Company and Parent desire to make certain representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the Merger and to set

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the representations, warranties, covenants
and agreements set forth in this Agreement and in the Voting Agreement, the

ARTICLE I

 

 _The Merger_

 

1.1. _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in this Agreement, at the Effective Time the Company shall be merged with and
into Parent in accordance with the VSCA and DGCL, and the separate corporate
existence of the Company shall thereupon cease. Parent shall be the surviving
corporation in the Merger (sometimes hereinafter referred to as the "
_Surviving Corporation_ ") and the separate corporate existence of the Company
with all of its rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises shall
continue unaffected by the Merger. The Merger shall have the effects
specified in this Agreement and in the applicable provisions of the VSCA and
DGCL.

1.2. _Closing_. Unless otherwise mutually agreed in writing between the
Company and Parent, the closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall take
place at the offices of Sullivan and Cromwell LLP, 1888 Century Park East, Suite
2100, Los Angeles, California 90067 at 9:00 a.m. on the first Business Day
(the " _Closing Date_ ") following the day on which the last to be satisfied
or waived of the conditions set forth in Article VII (other than
those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions) shall be satisfied
or waived in accordance with this Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement,
the term " _Business Day_ " shall mean any day ending at 11:59 p.m. (Eastern
Time) other than a Saturday or Sunday or a day on which banks in the City of
Los Angeles, the banks in the City of New York, the Department of State of
the State of Delaware or the State Corporate Commission of the Commonwealth
of Virginia is required or authorized by Law to close.

 



-2- 1.3. _Effective Time_. As soon as practicable following, and on the date
of, the Closing, the Company and Parent will (i) cause Articles of Merger (the
" _Articles of Merger_ ") to be executed and filed with the State Corporation
Commission of the Commonwealth of Virginia as provided in Section 13.1-720 of
the VSCA, (ii) cause a Certificate of Merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ")
to be executed, acknowledged and filed with the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware as provided in Section 252 of the DGCL and (iii) take such
other and further actions as may be necessary or required by applicable Law to
consummate and to make effective the Merger. The Merger shall become effective
on the date on which the last of the following actions shall have been
completed: (i) the Certificate of Merger is issued by the State Corporation
Commission of the Commonwealth of Virginia, (ii) the Certificate of Merger has
been duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, or
(iii) in either case, at such later time the parties agree that the Merger
shall become effective on the Closing Date at the actual time of the filing of
both the Articles of Merger and the Certificate of Merger, or at such later
time as may be agreed by the parties in writing and specified in the Articles
of Merger and the Certificate of Merger (the " _Effective Time_ ").

 

1.4. _The Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation_. The
certificate of incorporation of Parent as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation (the " _Charter_ "), until thereafter amended as provided therein
or by applicable Law.

 

1.5. _The Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation_. The bylaws of Parent as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation (the " _Bylaws_ "), until thereafter amended as provided
therein or by applicable Law.

 

1.6. _Directors of the Surviving Corporation_. At or prior to the
Effective Time, the Parent Board shall cause the number of directors that
will comprise the full board of directors of the Surviving Corporation from
and after the Effective Time to be eight. Of the members of the board of
directors of the Surviving Corporation from and after the Effective
Time, seven shall be the directors of Parent as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time, and one shall be a current director of the Company designated
by the Company, subject to the approval of Parents Corporate Governance
Committee (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld).

1.7. _Officers of the Surviving Corporation_. Unless otherwise determined
by Parent prior to the Effective Time, the officers of Parent immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation
as of the Effective Time until their successors have been duly elected or
appointed and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal
in accordance with the Charter and the Bylaws.

ARTICLE II

 

 _Merger Consideration; Effect of the Merger on Capital Stock_

 

2.1. _Merger Consideration; Conversion of Shares Company Common Stock_.

 

.

 



-3- (a) At the Effective Time, as a result of the Merger and without
any action on the part of the holder of any capital stock of the Company,
each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time (including any Company Restricted Shares that vest on or
prior to the Effective Time) other than Excluded Shares (such shares of
Company Common Stock, the " _Eligible Shares_ ") shall be converted into, and
become exchangeable for 0.671 (the " _Exchange Ratio_ ") shares of Parent
Common Stock (such number of shares of Parent Common Stock, the " _Merger
Consideration_ ").

(b) For the purposes of this Agreement, " _Excluded Shares_ " means shares
of Company Common Stock owned by Parent or any other direct or indirect wholly
owned Subsidiary of Parent and shares of Company Common Stock owned by the
Company or any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company.

2.2. _Conversion of Shares of Company Common Stock_. As a result of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any capital stock
of the Company, all of the Eligible Shares converted into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Article II shall cease to be
outstanding, shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist as of the Effective
Time, and each certificate formerly representing any of the Eligible Shares
(each, a " _Certificate_ ") and each book-entry account formerly representing
any non-certificated Eligible Shares (each, a " _Book-Entry Share_ ") shall
thereafter represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration and
the right, if any, to receive pursuant to Section 3.5 cash in lieu of
fractional shares into which such Eligible Shares have been converted pursuant
to this Section 2.2 and any dividends or other distributions pursuant to
Section 3.3.

 

2.3. _Cancellation of Excluded Shares_. Each Excluded Share shall, as a
result of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of such
Excluded Share, cease to be outstanding, be cancelled without payment of any
consideration therefor and shall cease to exist.

 

2.4. _Treatment of Company Equity Awards and Investor Option_.

 

(a) _Treatment of Options_. At the Effective Time, each outstanding option
to purchase shares of Company Common Stock (a " _Company Option_ ") under the
Stock Plan shall vest and, automatically and without any action on the part of
the holder thereof, cease to represent an option to purchase shares of Company
Common Stock and shall be converted into a number of shares of Parent Common
Stock equal to the quotient (rounded down to the nearest whole number) of (i)
the product of (A) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to
such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, _multiplied by_
(B) the Company Option Spread, _divided by_ (ii) the Parent Share VWAP. For
the avoidance of doubt, any Company Option which has an exercise price per
share of Company Common Stock that is greater than or equal to the Final
Company Pre-Dividend Price shall be cancelled at the Effective Time for no
consideration or payment. The " _Final Company Pre-Dividend Price_ " equals
the closing price of a share of Company Common Stock on the Trading Day
immediately prior to the Trading Day on which the Company Common Stock trades
ex-dividend with respect to the Per Share Pre-Closing Dividend, or if the
Company Common Stock does not ever trade ex-dividend, on the Trading Day
immediately prior to the Effective Time (as reported in _The Wall Street
Journal_ (Northeast edition) or, if not reported therein, in another
authoritative source mutually

 



-4-  selected by Parent and the Company). The " _Company Option Spread_ " means
the Final Company Pre-Dividend Price minus the exercise price per share of
Company Common Stock of the applicable Company Option prior to the Effective
Time. " _Trading Day_ " shall mean any day on which shares of Parent Common
Stock are traded on the NASDAQ Stock Market (the " _NASDAQ_ "). The " _Parent
Share VWAP_ " shall mean the volume weighted average price of a share of
Parent Common Stock for a ten (10) Trading Day period, starting with the
opening of trading on the eleventh (11th) trading day prior to the Closing
Date to the closing of trading on the second to last Trading Day prior to the
Closing Date, as reported by Bloomberg.

 

(b) _Company Restricted Shares_. At the Effective Time, each outstanding
share of restricted stock (a " _Company Restricted Share_ ") granted under
the Stock Plan shall, automatically and without any action on the part of the
holder thereof, cease to represent a restricted share of Company Common Stock
and shall be converted into (i) a number of restricted shares of Parent
Common Stock (each, a " _Parent Restricted Share_ ") equal to the Exchange
Ratio (rounded to the nearest whole number) and (ii) a Pre-Closing Dividend
Right. Except as specifically provided above, following the Effective Time,
each such Parent Restricted Share and Pre-Closing Dividend Right shall
continue to be governed by the same terms and conditions (including vesting
terms) as were applicable to the corresponding Company Restricted Share
immediately prior to the Effective Time. A " _Pre-Closing Dividend Right_ " is
the right to receive a cash payment equal to the Per Share Pre-Closing
Dividend (multiplied, in the case of Company RSUs and Company PSUs, by the
number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company RSU or
Company PSU, determined in accordance with Section 2.4(c) or Section 2.4(d),
as applicable).

 

(c) _Company RSUs_. At the Effective Time, each outstanding restricted
stock unit (a " _Company RSU_ ") granted under the Stock Plan, whether vested
or unvested, shall, automatically and without any action on the part of the
holder thereof, cease to represent a restricted stock unit denominated in
shares of Company Common Stock and shall be converted into (i) a restricted
stock unit denominated in shares of Parent Common Stock (a " _Parent Stock-
Based RSU_ ") and (ii) a Pre-Closing Dividend Right. The number of shares of
Parent Common Stock subject to each such Parent Stock-Based RSU shall be
equal to the product (rounded to the nearest whole number) of (x) the number
of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company RSU immediately
prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (y) the Exchange Ratio. Except as
specifically provided above, following the Effective Time, each such Parent
Stock-Based RSU and Pre-Closing Dividend Right shall continue to be governed
by the same terms and conditions (including vesting terms and taking into
account any accelerated vesting occurring as of the Effective Time) as were
applicable to the applicable Company RSU immediately prior to the Effective
Time.

 

(d) _Company PSUs_. At the Effective Time, each outstanding performance
stock unit (a " _Company PSU_ ") under the Stock Plan, whether vested or
unvested, shall, automatically and without any action on the part of the
holder thereof, cease to represent a performance stock unit denominated in
shares of Company Common Stock and shall be converted into (i) a Parent
Stock-Based RSU and (ii) a Pre-Closing Dividend Right. The number of shares of
Parent Common Stock subject to each such Parent Stock-Based RSU shall be equal
to the product (rounded to the nearest whole number) of (x) the greater of
(A) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the Company PSU
that would be earned based on

 



-5-  the Companys actual performance for the most recently completed fiscal
quarter prior to the Effective Time, as reasonably determined by the
compensation committee of the Company Board (the " _Company Compensation
Committee_ "), and (B) the level of achievement resulting in 50% of the number
of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the Company PSU being earned ,
_multiplied by_ (y) the Exchange Ratio. Except as specifically provided
above, following the Effective Time, each such Parent Stock-Based RSU and Pre-
Closing Dividend Right shall continue to be governed by the same terms and
conditions as were applicable to the applicable Company PSU immediately prior
to the Effective Time, except that performance-based vesting conditions will
no longer apply to such Parent Stock-Based RSU and Pre-Closing Dividend Right.

 

(e) _Investor Option_. At the Effective Time, each outstanding option to
purchase a share of Company Common Stock (an " _Investor Option_ ") granted
under the Stock Option Agreement, dated as of June 5, 2013, by and between the
Company and the investor that is a party thereto, whether vested or unvested,
shall, automatically and without any action on the part of the holder
thereof, cease to represent an option to purchase shares of Company Common
Stock and shall be converted into an option (a " _Parent Option_ ") to
purchase (i) that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock (rounded down
to the nearest whole share) equal to the product of (A) the number of shares
of Company Common Stock subject to such Investor Option immediately prior to
the Effective Time _multiplied by_ (B) the Pre-Closing Dividend Adjustment
Ratio _multiplied by_ (C) the Exchange Ratio, (ii) at an exercise price per
share of Parent Common Stock (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to
the quotient of (A) the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock of
such Investor Option _divided by_ (B) the Pre-Closing Dividend Adjustment
Ratio _divided by_ (C) the Exchange Ratio. Except as otherwise provided in
this Section 2.4(e), each such Parent Option shall continue to have, and
shall be subject to, the same terms and conditions as applied to the
corresponding Investor Option immediately prior to the Effective Time. The "
_Pre-Closing Dividend Adjustment Ratio_ " means a fraction, the numerator of
which is the Final Pre-Dividend Price and the denominator of which is the
excess of the Final Pre-Dividend Price _over_ the Per Share Pre-Closing
Dividend.

 

(f) _Company Actions_. At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the
Company Board and the Company Compensation Committee, as applicable, shall
adopt any resolutions and take any actions that are necessary to effectuate
the treatment of the Company Options, Company Restricted Shares, Company RSUs
and Company PSUs (the " _Company Equity Awards_ ") pursuant to Section 2.4(a)
through Section 2.4(d).

(g) _Parent Actions_. Parent shall take all corporate action necessary to
reserve for issuance a sufficient number of shares of Parent Common Stock for
delivery upon exercise or settlement of the Parent Restricted Shares and
Parent Stock-Based RSUs in accordance with this Section 2.4. As soon as
reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, if and to the extent
necessary to cause a sufficient number of shares of Parent Common Stock to be
registered and issuable under Parent Restricted Shares and Parent Stock-Based
RSUs, Parent shall file a post-effective amendment to the Form S-4 or
registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor or other appropriate
form) with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock subject to
Parent Restricted Shares and Parent Stock-Based RSUs and shall use its
reasonable commercial efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such

 _Delivery of Merger Consideration; Procedures for Surrender_

 

3.1. _Exchange Agent_. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall
deposit or cause to be deposited with a nationally recognized financial
institution selected by Parent with the Companys prior approval (which
approval shall not be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed) to serve
as the exchange agent (the " _Exchange Agent_ "), for the benefit of the
holders of Eligible Shares, (i) an aggregate number of shares of Parent Common
Stock to be issued in uncertificated form or book-entry form and (ii) an
aggregate amount of cash sufficient, in each case, for the Exchange Agent to
deliver the amounts required to be delivered in respect of Eligible Shares
pursuant to Section 2.1 and Section 3.5. In addition, Parent shall deposit or
cause to be deposited with the Exchange Agent, as necessary from time to time
after the Effective Time, any dividends or other distributions, if any, to
which the holders of Eligible Shares may be entitled pursuant to Section 3.3
with both a record and payment date after the Effective Time and prior to the
surrender of such Eligible Shares and cash in lieu of any fractional shares
payable pursuant to Section 3.5 (such amount of any dividends or other
distributions deposited with the Exchange Agent pursuant to this Section
3.1, together with the shares of Parent Common Stock and cash in lieu of any
fractional shares payable pursuant to Section 3.5, being hereinafter referred
to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any
purpose other than a purpose expressly provided for in this Agreement. The
cash portion of the Exchange Fund shall be invested by the Exchange Agent as
reasonably directed by Parent. Any interest and other income resulting from
such investment shall become a part of the Exchange Fund, and any amounts in
excess of the amounts payable under Section 3.5 shall be promptly returned to
Parent. No investment losses resulting from investment of the Exchange Fund
shall diminish the rights of any former holder of Eligible Shares to receive
the Merger Consideration as provided in this Agreement. Parent shall promptly
replace or restore the cash in the Exchange Fund so that the Exchange Fund is
at all times maintained at a level sufficient for the Exchange Agent to fully
satisfy such cash payment obligations.

3.2. _Procedures for Surrender_.

 

(a) Promptly after the Effective Time (and in any event within five
Business Days thereafter), the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Exchange
Agent to mail to each holder of record of Eligible Shares that are (a)
Certificates or (b) Book-Entry Shares not held through The Depositary Trust
Company (" _DTC_ ") notice advising such holders of the effectiveness of the
Merger, including (i) appropriate transmittal materials specifying that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares shall 

 



-7-  pass only upon delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu
of the Certificates, as provided in Section 3.7) or transfer of the Book-Entry
Shares to the Exchange Agent (including customary provisions with respect to
delivery of an "agents message" with respect to Book-Entry Shares), such
materials to be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent desires
with prior approval of the Company (such approval not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed) (the " _Letter of Transmittal_ "), and (ii)
instructions for surrendering the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu
of the Certificates) or transferring the Book-Entry Shares to the Exchange
Agent in exchange for the Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock, if any, to be issued or paid in consideration
therefor and dividends or distributions, in each case, to which such holders
are entitled pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. With respect to Book-
Entry Shares held through held through DTC, Parent and the Company shall
cooperate to establish procedures with the Exchange Agent and DTC to ensure
that the Exchange Agent will transmit to DTC or its nominees on the Closing
Date (or if Closing occurs after 11:30 a.m. (New York Time) on the Closing
Date, on the first Business Day after the Closing Date), upon surrender of
Eligible Shares held of record by DTC or its nominees in accordance with
DTCs customary surrender procedures, the Merger Consideration, cash in lieu
of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock, if any, to be issued or paid in
consideration therefor and dividends or distributions, in each case, to which
the beneficial owners thereof are entitled pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement.

 

(b) Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of Eligible Shares that are
Certificates, by physical surrender of such Certificate (or affidavit of loss
in lieu of a Certificate, as provided in Section 3.7) or that are Book-Entry
Shares, by book-receipt of an "agents message" by the Exchange Agent in
connection with the transfer of Book-Entry Shares, in accordance with the
terms of the Letter of Transmittal and accompanying instructions or, with
respect to Book-Entry Shares held through DTC, in accordance with DTCs
customary procedures and such other procedures as agreed by the Company,
Parent, the Exchange Agent and DTC, the holder of such Certificate or Book-
Entry Share shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (x) that number
of whole shares of Parent Common Stock that such holder is entitled to
receive pursuant to Article II and (y) a check in the amount (after giving
effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in Section 3.8) of (A) any
cash in lieu of fractional shares plus (B) any unpaid non-stock dividends
and any other dividends or other distributions that such holder has the right
to receive pursuant to the provisions of this Article III.

 

(c) No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due
surrender of Eligible Shares, and any Certificate or ledger entry relating to
Book-Entry Shares formerly representing shares of Company Common Stock that
have been so surrendered shall be cancelled by the Exchange Agent.

 

(d) In the event of a transfer of ownership of certificated Eligible Shares
that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, the proper
number of shares of Parent Common Stock, together with a check for any cash to
be paid upon due surrender of the Certificate and any other dividends or
distributions in respect thereof, may be issued and/or paid to such a
transferee if the Certificate formerly representing such Eligible Shares is
presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to
evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock
transfer Taxes have been paid or are not applicable, in each case, in form
and substance, reasonably satisfactory to the Exchange Agent. Payment of the
applicable Merger Consideration with respect to Book-Entry Shares shall only
be made to the Person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares are registered in
the stock transfer books of the Company.

 



-8- 3.3. _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares of Company
Common Stock_ ; Voting. All shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued
pursuant to the Merger shall be deemed issued and outstanding as of the
Effective Time and whenever a dividend or other distribution is declared by
Parent in respect of the Parent Common Stock, the record date for which is at
or after the Effective Time, that declaration shall include dividends or other
distributions in respect of all shares issuable pursuant to this Agreement. No
dividends or other distributions in respect of the Parent Common Stock shall
be paid to any holder of any unsurrendered Eligible Share until the
Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu of the Certificate as provided in
Section 3.7) or Book-Entry Share is surrendered for exchange in accordance
with this Article III. Subject to the effect of applicable Laws, following
such surrender, there shall be issued and/or paid to the holder of record of
the whole shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange for Eligible Shares
in accordance with this Article III, without interest, (i) at the time of
such surrender, the dividends or other distributions with a record date after
the Effective Time theretofore payable with respect to such whole shares of
Parent Common Stock and not paid and (ii) at the appropriate payment date,
the dividends or other distributions payable with respect to such whole shares
of Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time but with a
payment date subsequent to surrender. Holders of record of unsurrendered
Eligible Shares formerly representing shares of Company Common Stock shall be
entitled to vote after the Effective Time at any meeting of Parent
stockholders the number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock represented by
such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, regardless of whether such holders
have surrendered for exchange their Certificates or Book-Entry Shares.

 

3.4. _Transfers_. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no
transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of the shares of Company
Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 

3.5. __ _Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, no fractional shares of Parent Common Stock will be issued upon
the conversion of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.1. All
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock that a holder of Eligible Shares
would be otherwise entitled to receive pursuant to Section 2.1 shall be
aggregated and rounded to the nearest thousandth when expressed in decimal
form. Any holder of Eligible Shares otherwise entitled to receive a fractional
share of Parent Common Stock but for this Section 3.5 shall be entitled to
receive a cash payment (rounded to the nearest cent), which payment shall be
determined by multiplying (i) the average of the per share closing prices of
Parent Common Stock on the NASDAQ (as reported in _The Wall Street Journal_
(Northeast edition) or, if not reported thereby, another authoritative source)
for twenty full Trading Days ending on the fifth Business Day prior to the
Closing Date by (ii) the fraction of the share (rounded to the
nearest thousandth when expressed in decimal form) of Parent Common Stock
which such holder otherwise would be entitled to receive pursuant to Section
2.1. No holder of Eligible Shares shall be entitled by virtue of the right to
receive cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock described in
this Section 3.5 to any dividends, voting rights or any other rights in
respect of any fractional share of Parent Common Stock. The payment of cash in
lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock is not a separately
bargained-for consideration but merely represents a mechanical rounding-off of
the fractions in the exchange.

 



-9- 3.6. _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange
Fund (including the proceeds of any investments of the Exchange Fund and any
shares of Parent Common Stock) that remains unclaimed by the 180th calendar
day after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent. Any holder of
Eligible Shares who has not theretofore complied with this Article III shall
thereafter look only to Parent for delivery of any shares of Parent Common
Stock of such shareholders and payment of any cash, dividends and other
distributions in respect thereof payable and/or issuable pursuant to Section
2.1, Section 3.3 and Section 3.5, in each case, without any interest thereon.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, the Exchange Agent or
any other Person shall be liable to any former holder of shares of Company
Common Stock for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant
to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws. For the purposes of
this Agreement, the term " _Person_ " shall mean any individual, corporation
(including not-for-profit), general or limited partnership, limited liability
company, joint venture, estate, trust, association, organization, Governmental
Entity or other entity of any kind or nature.

3.7. _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any
Certificate representing Eligible Shares shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent,
the posting by such Person of a bond in customary amount and upon such terms
as may be reasonably required by Parent as indemnity against any claim that
may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent
will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the
shares of Parent Common Stock and any cash, unpaid dividends or other
distributions that would be payable or deliverable in respect thereof pursuant
to this Agreement had such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate
been surrendered.

3.8. _Withholding Rights_. Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any
holder of shares of Company Common Stock such amounts as it is required to
deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code
or any other applicable state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that
amounts are so withheld by Parent, such withheld amounts (i) shall be timely
remitted by Parent to the applicable Governmental Entity, and (ii) shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder
of shares of Company Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may
be.

 

3.9. _Appraisal Rights_. In accordance with Section 13.1-730 of the VSCA,
no appraisal rights shall be available to holders of shares of Company Common
Stock in connection with the Merger.

3.10. _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, if, from the date of this Agreement to the earlier
of the Effective Time and termination in accordance with Article VIII, the
issued and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock or securities
convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for shares of Company Common
Stock or the issued and outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock or

 



-10-  securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for shares of
Parent Common Stock, shall have been changed into a different number of shares
or securities or a different class by reason of any reclassification, stock
split (including a reverse stock split), stock dividend or distribution,
recapitalization, merger, issuer tender or exchange offer, or other similar
transaction, or a stock dividend with a record date within such period shall
have been declared, then the Merger Consideration, the Final Company Pre-
Dividend Price, the Pre-Closing Dividend Right and any similarly dependent
items shall be equitably adjusted to provide the holders of shares of
Company Common Stock and Parent the same economic effect as contemplated by
this Agreement prior to such event, and such items, so adjusted shall, from
and after the date of such event, be the Merger Consideration, the Final
Company Pre-Dividend Price, the Pre-Closing Dividend Right or other similarly
dependent item. Nothing in this Section 3.10 shall be construed to permit the
Company to take any action except to the extent consistent with, and not
otherwise prohibited by, this terms of this Agreement.

sentence of Section 6.1(a));

 

 _provided further_ that, with respect to clauses (A), (B), (D) and (G), such
change, event, occurrence or effect shall be taken into account

Governmental Entity (including the SEC and FINRA), including all reports,
registrations, declarations, notices, statements and filings required under
the Exchange Act, except for such filings which the failure to make or to make
timely would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to
have a Company Material Adverse Effect. As of their respective dates, all
such reports, registrations, declarations, notices, statements, and other
filings complied in all material respects with the Laws enforced or
promulgated by the Governmental Entity with which they were filed. Except for
normal examinations conducted by an SRO in the regular course of the business

the definition of Parent Material Adverse Effect;

 

(F) a decline in the market price or change in trading volume of the shares

Act since the Applicable Date (the forms, statements, reports and documents
filed or furnished to the SEC since the Applicable Date and those filed or
furnished to the SEC subsequent to the date of this Agreement, including any
amendments thereto, the " _Parent Reports_ "). Each of the Parent Reports, at
the time of its filing or being furnished complied, or if not yet filed or
furnished, will comply, in all material respects with the applicable
requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act, and any rules and regulations promulgated thereunder applicable to the

responsible for the preparation of Parents filings with the SEC and other
public disclosure documents. Parent maintains internal control over financial
reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15, as applicable, under the
Exchange Act). Such internal control

 



-37-  over financial reporting is effective in providing reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP and
includes policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of
records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the

assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and

regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or
disposition of Parents assets that could have a material effect on its
financial statements.

whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have
a significant role in Parents internal control over financial reporting.
Since the Applicable Date, no material complaints from any source regarding
accounting, internal accounting controls or auditing matters, and no concerns
from employees of Parent regarding questionable accounting or auditing
matters, have been received by Parent. Parent has provided or otherwise made

Parent or any of its officers, directors, employees or agents to Parents
chief legal officer, audit committee (or other committee designated for the
purpose) of the Parent Board or the Parent Board pursuant to the rules adopted
pursuant to Section 307 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act or any Parent policy
contemplating such reporting, including in instances not required by those
rules.

 

(e) Each of the consolidated balance sheets included in or incorporated by
reference into the Parent Reports (including the related notes and schedules)

respects, the consolidated financial position of Parent and its consolidated
Subsidiaries as of its date and each of the consolidated statements of
operations, comprehensive income, statements of equity and cash flows included

such businesses consistent with past practices and there has not been:

(a) any change with respect to any circumstance, occurrence or development

Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their employees or independent
contractors is pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened, nor has any

such "associated person" from becoming subject to a statutory disqualification
under the Exchange Act.

are subject to any cease-and-desist or other order or enforcement action

any Governmental Entity (including the SEC and FINRA), including all reports,
registrations, declarations, notices, statements and filings required under
the Exchange Act, except for such filings which the failure to make or to make

reports, registrations, declarations, notices, statements, and other filings
complied in all material respects with the Laws enforced or promulgated by
the Governmental Entity with which they were filed. Except for normal
examinations conducted by an SRO in the regular course of the business of the

reasonably be expected to be material to Parent and its Subsidiaries taken as
a whole.

directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the other partys
operations prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, each
party will exercise, consistent with the terms

 



-47-  and conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over its
and its Subsidiaries respective operations. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth in this Agreement, no consent of Parent or the Company
shall be required with respect to any matter set forth in this Section 6.1 or
elsewhere in this Agreement to the extent that the requirement of such consent
would, upon the advice of legal counsel, violate applicable Antitrust Laws.
Nothing in this Agreement, including any of the actions, rights or
restrictions set forth herein, will be interpreted in such a way as to require
compliance by any party hereto if such compliance would result in
the violation of any rule, regulation or policy of any Governmental Antitrust
Entity or applicable Law.

 

6.2. _Acquisition Proposals; Change of Recommendation_.

 

(a) At all times during the period commencing with the execution and
delivery of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier to occur of the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article VIII and the Effective Time,
except as expressly permitted by this Section 6.2, the Company shall not, and
none of its Subsidiaries nor any of the directors, officers and employees of
it or its Subsidiaries shall, and the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to instruct and cause its and its Subsidiaries investment bankers,
attorneys, accountants and other advisors or representatives (such directors,
officers, employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants and other
advisors or representatives, collectively, " _Representatives_ ") not to,
directly or indirectly:

 

(i) initiate, solicit, propose, knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate
any inquiry or the making of any proposal or offer that constitutes, or would
reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal (other than
discussions solely to clarify such proposal or offer);

 

(ii) engage in, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions with
or negotiations relating to any Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry, proposal
or offer that would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal
(other than to state that the terms of this provision prohibit such
discussions);

 

(iii) provide any information to any Person in connection with any
Acquisition Proposal or any proposal or offer that would reasonably be
expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal; or

(iv) otherwise knowingly facilitate any effort or attempt to make an
Acquisition Proposal.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 6.2(a), prior to
the time, but not after, the Requisite Company Vote is obtained in response to
an unsolicited, bona fide written Acquisition Proposal, the Company may:

 

(i) provide information in response to a request therefor (including non-
public information regarding the Company or any of its Subsidiaries) to the
Person who made such Acquisition Proposal, provided that such information has
previously been made available to, or is made available to, Parent prior to
or concurrently with the time such

 



-48-  information is made available to such Person and that, prior to furnishing
any such information, the Company receives from the Person making such
Acquisition Proposal an executed confidentiality agreement with terms not
less restrictive to the other party than the terms in the Confidentiality
Agreement are on Parent (it being understood that such confidentiality
agreement need not prohibit the making or amending of an Acquisition
Proposal to the extent such Acquisition Proposal is made directly to the
Company); _provided_ , _however_ , that if the Person making such Acquisition
Proposal is a competitor of the Company, the Company shall not provide any
commercially sensitive non-public information to such Person in connection
with any actions permitted by this Section 6.2(b) other than in accordance
with customary "clean room" or other similar procedures designed to limit the
disclosure of competitively sensitive information; and

(ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations with any such Person
regarding such Acquisition Proposal;

in each case, if, and only if, prior to taking any action described in clause
(i) or (ii) above, the Company Board determines in good faith after
consultation with outside legal counsel that (A) based on the information then
available and after consultation with its independent financial advisor
that such Acquisition Proposal either constitutes a Superior Proposal or
would reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal and (B) such
action is reasonably necessary in order for the directors to comply with their
fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

(c) The Company shall promptly (and, in any event, within 24 hours) give
notice to Parent if (i) any inquiries, proposals or offers with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal are received by, (ii) any information is requested in
connection with any Acquisition Proposal from, or (iii) any discussions or
negotiations with respect to an Acquisition Proposal are sought to be
initiated or continued with, it or any of its Representatives, setting forth
in such notice the name of such Person and the material terms and conditions
of any proposals or offers (including, if applicable, complete copies of any
written requests, proposals or offers, including proposed agreements) and
thereafter shall keep Parent reasonably informed, on a current basis (and, in
any event, within 24 hours), of the status and terms of any such proposals or
offers (including any amendments thereto) and the status of any such
discussions or negotiations, including any change in its intentions as
previously notified.

 

(d) _Definitions_. For purposes of this Agreement:

 

(i) " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means (A) any proposal, offer, inquiry
or indication of interest relating to a merger, joint venture, partnership,
consolidation, dissolution, liquidation, tender offer, recapitalization,
reorganization, spin-off, share exchange, business combination or similar
transaction involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (B) any
acquisition by any Person or group resulting in, or any proposal, offer,
inquiry or indication of interest that if consummated would result in, any
Person or group becoming the beneficial owner of, directly or indirectly, in
one or a series of related transactions, 15% or more of the total voting power
or of any class of equity securities of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, or 15% or more of the consolidated net revenues, net income or
total assets ( _it_ _being understood_ _that_ assets include, without
limitation, equity securities of Subsidiaries) of the Company, in each case
other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



-49- (ii) " _Superior Proposal_ " means an unsolicited, bona fide written
Acquisition Proposal made after the date of this Agreement that would result
in a Person or group becoming the beneficial owner of, directly or indirectly,
more than 50% of the total voting power of the equity securities of the
Company or more than 50% of the consolidated net revenues, net income or total
assets (including, without limitation, equity securities of its Subsidiaries),
of the Company that the Company Board has determined in good faith,
after consultation with outside legal counsel and its independent financial
advisor taking into account all legal, financial, financing and regulatory
aspects of the proposal, the identity of the Person(s) making the proposal and
the likelihood of the proposal being consummated in accordance with its
terms, that, if consummated, would result in a transaction (A) more favorable
to the Companys stockholders from a financial point of view than the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (B) is reasonably likely to be
completed, taking into account any regulatory, financing or approval
requirements and (C) for which financing, if a cash transaction (in whole or
in part) is fully committed (after taking into account any revisions to the
terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent pursuant to Section 6.2(f) of this
Agreement).

 

(e) Except as permitted by Section 6.2(f) and Section 6.2(g), the Company
Board, including any committee thereof agrees it shall not:

(i) withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify (or publicly propose or resolve
to withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify) the Company Recommendation with
respect to the Merger in a manner adverse to Parent;

 

(ii) approve or recommend, or publicly declare advisable or publicly
propose to enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding,
agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement, option
agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or other agreement
(other than a confidentiality agreement referred to in Section 6.2(a) entered
into in compliance with Section 6.2(a)) providing for any Acquisition Proposal
(an " _Alternative Acquisition Agreement_ ", and any of the actions set forth
in the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii), a " _Change of Recommendation_ "); or

(iii) cause or permit the Company to enter into an Alternative Acquisition
Agreement.

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
prior to the time the Requisite Company Vote is obtained the Company Board may
effect a Change of Recommendation in connection with an Acquisition Proposal
made after the date of this Agreement that did not arise from or in
connection with a material breach of the obligations set forth in this
Section 6.2, if (i) an unsolicited, bona fide written offer is made to the
Company and is not withdrawn and (ii) the Company Board determines in good
faith, after consultation with outside counsel and its independent financial
advisor, that (A) such offer constitutes a Superior Proposal and (B) such
action is reasonably necessary in order for the directors to comply with their
fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that a Change
of

 



-50-  Recommendation in response to a Superior Proposal may not be made unless and
until the Company has given Parent written notice of such action four Business
Days in advance, such notice to comply in form, substance and delivery with
the provisions of Section 6.2(c) and Section 9.6 of this Agreement, setting
forth in writing that management of the Company intends to recommend to the
Company Board that it take such action. After giving such notice and prior to
effecting such Change of Recommendation in connection with a Superior
Proposal, the Company shall negotiate in good faith with Parent (to the extent
Parent wishes to negotiate) to make such revisions to the terms of this
Agreement as would permit the Company Board not to effect a Change of
Recommendation in connection with a Superior Proposal. At the end of the four
Business Day period, prior to taking action to effect a Change of
Recommendation in response to a Superior Proposal, the Company shall take
into account any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent in
writing and any other information offered by Parent in response to the notice,
and shall have determined in good faith that the Superior Proposal would
continue to constitute a Superior Proposal if such changes offered in writing
were to be given effect. Any modification to any Acquisition Proposal will be
deemed to be a new Acquisition Proposal for purposes of Section 6.2(c) and
this Section 6.2(f) except that the advance written notice obligation set
forth in this Section 6.2(f) shall be reduced to three Business Days.

 

(g) Nothing contained in this Section 6.2 shall prohibit the Company from
complying with its disclosure obligations under U.S. federal or state Law
with regard to an Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that if such
disclosure has the effect of withdrawing or adversely modifying the Company
Recommendation, such disclosure shall be deemed to be a Change of
Recommendation and Parent shall have the right to terminate this Agreement as
set forth in Section 8.1(f); _it_ _being_ _understood_ that a "stop, look and
listen" or similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f)
under the Exchange Act shall not be deemed to be a Change of Recommendation.

 

(h) The Company shall, and shall cause its respective Subsidiaries and
Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated any
discussions and negotiations with any Person conducted heretofore with respect
to any Acquisition Proposal, or proposal that would reasonably be expected to
lead to an Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall promptly deliver a written
notice to each such Person providing only that the Company is ending all
discussions and negotiations with such Person with respect to any Acquisition
Proposal, or proposal or transaction that would reasonably be expected to lead
to an Acquisition Proposal and informing such Persons of the obligations
undertaken in this Section 6.2, which notice shall also request the prompt
return or destruction of all confidential information concerning the Company
and any of its Subsidiaries. The Company will promptly terminate all physical
and electronic data access previously granted to such Persons.

 

(i) During the period commencing with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement and continuing until the earlier to occur of the termination of
this Agreement pursuant to Article VIII and the Effective Time, the Company
shall not terminate, amend, modify or waive any provision of any
confidentiality, "standstill" or similar agreement to which the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries is a party and shall enforce, to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Law, the provisions of any such agreement,
including by obtaining injunctions to prevent any breaches of such agreements
and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions thereof. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Company

 



-51-  shall be permitted to terminate, amend, modify, waive or fail to enforce any
provision of any confidentiality, "standstill" or similar obligation of any
Person if the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with
its outside legal counsel, that such action is reasonably necessary in order
for directors to comply with their fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

 

6.3. _Joint Proxy/Prospectus Filing; Information Supplied_.

 

(a) Parent and the Company shall promptly prepare and file with the SEC the
Joint Proxy/Prospectus, and Parent shall prepare and file with the SEC the
Registration Statement on Form S-4 (which Registration Statement shall include
the joint proxy statement and prospectus (" _Joint Proxy/Prospectus_
") constituting a part thereof) (the " _Registration Statement_ ") as
promptly as practicable. Parent and the Company each shall use its reasonable
best efforts to have the Registration Statement declared effective under
the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after such filing, to maintain
such effectiveness for as long as necessary to consummate the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and to promptly thereafter
mail the Joint Proxy/Prospectus (including the Registration Statement) to the
respective shareholders of each of the Company and Parent.

 

(b) Each of the Company and Parent shall promptly notify the other of the
receipt of all comments (whether written or oral) from the SEC and of any
request by the SEC for any amendment or supplement to the Registration
Statement or the Joint Proxy/Prospectus or for additional information and
shall promptly provide to the other copies of all correspondence between it
and/or any of its Representatives and the SEC with respect to the Registration
Statement or Joint Proxy/Prospectus.

 

(c) Each of the Company and Parent agrees, as to itself and its
Subsidiaries, that none of the information supplied or to be supplied by it
or its Subsidiaries for inclusion or incorporation by reference in (i) the
Registration Statement will, at the time the Registration Statement becomes
effective under the Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of
a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and (ii) the Joint
Proxy/Prospectus and any amendment or supplement thereto will, at the date of
mailing to shareholders and at the times of the meetings of shareholders of
the Company and Parent to be held in connection with the Merger, contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading. The Company and Parent will cause the Joint Proxy/Prospectus
and Registration Statement to comply as to form in all material respects with
the applicable provisions of the Securities Act and the rules and regulations
thereunder.

 

(d) Each of Parent and the Company will provide their respective legal
counsel with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on drafts of the
Joint Proxy/Prospectus, the Registration Statement and other documents related
to the Company Shareholders Meeting or the Parent Stockholders Meeting, prior
to filing such documents with the applicable Governmental Entity and mailing
such documents to Parent and the Companys shareholders. Each party will
include in the Joint Proxy/Prospectus, the Registration Statement and such
other documents related to the Company Shareholders Meeting or the Parent 

 



-52-  Stockholders Meeting all comments reasonably and promptly proposed by the
other party or its legal counsel and each agrees that all information relating
to Parent and its Subsidiaries included in the Joint Proxy/Prospectus and the
Registration Statement shall be in form and content satisfactory to Parent,
acting reasonably, and all information relating to the Company and its
Subsidiaries included in the Joint Proxy/Prospectus and the Registration
Statement shall be in form and content satisfactory to the Company, acting
reasonably.

 

6.4. _Stockholders Meetings_.

 

(a) The Company will take, in accordance with applicable Law and its
articles of incorporation and bylaws, all action necessary to convene the
Company Shareholders Meeting as promptly as practicable after the Registration
Statement is declared effective to consider and vote upon the approval of this
Agreement and to cause such vote to be taken, and shall not postpone, recess
or adjourn such meeting except to the extent required by Law or, if as of the
time for which the Company Shareholders Meeting is then scheduled there are
insufficient shares of Company Common Stock represented (either in person
or by proxy) and voting to approve this Agreement or to constitute a quorum
necessary to conduct the business of the Company Shareholders Meeting. Parent
will take, in accordance with applicable Law and its certificate of
incorporation and bylaws, all action necessary to convene the Parent
Stockholders Meeting as promptly as practicable after the Registration

issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock in the Merger and the adoption of
this Agreement and to cause such vote to be taken, and shall not postpone,
recess or adjourn such meeting except to the extent required by Law or, if as
of the time for which the Parent Stockholders Meeting is then scheduled
there are insufficient shares of Parent Common Stock represented (either in
person or by proxy) and voting to approve this Agreement or to constitute a
quorum necessary to conduct the business of the Parent Stockholders Meeting.
Subject to Section 6.2 of this Agreement the Company Board and the Parent
Board shall recommend such adoption or approvals, as the case may be, and
shall take all lawful action to solicit such adoption or approvals.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in the
event that after the date of this Agreement, the Company Board makes a Change
of Recommendation, the Company shall nevertheless submit this Agreement to the
holders of Company Common Stock to obtain the Requisite Company Vote at the
Company Shareholders Meeting or at any adjournment, recess or postponement
thereof, unless this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with Section
8.1.

(c) The Company and Parent shall cooperate to schedule and convene such
shareholders meetings on the same date. The Company and Parent each agrees to
provide the other reasonably detailed periodic updates concerning proxy
solicitation results on a timely basis (including, if requested, promptly
providing daily voting reports).

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, on a date that is two Business Days
prior to the date the Company Shareholders Meeting or the Parent Stockholders
Meeting, as applicable is scheduled, (A) the Company or Parent, as applicable,
has not received proxies representing the Requisite Company Vote or the
Requisite Parent Vote, as applicable, whether or not a quorum is present or

Parent so requests shall, or Parent may, or if the Company so requests shall,
postpone, recess or adjourn, or make one or more successive postponements,
recesses or adjournments of, the Company Shareholders Meeting or the Parent
Stockholders Meeting, as applicable as long as the date of the Company
Shareholders Meeting or the Parent Stockholders Meeting, as applicable is not
postponed or adjourned more than ten calendar days in connection with any one
postponement, recess or adjournment or more than an aggregate of twenty

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, the
Company and Parent shall cooperate with each other and use (and shall cause
their respective Subsidiaries to use) their respective reasonable best efforts
to take or cause to be taken all actions, and do or cause to be done all
things, reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its part under this
Agreement and applicable Laws to consummate and make effective the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement as soon as reasonably
practicable, including preparing and filing as promptly as reasonably
practicable all documentation to effect all necessary notices, reports and

period thereof with respect to the Merger and (ii) the Company causing to be
filed no later than 10 Business Days after the date of this Agreement the
Broker-Dealer Subsidiaries Continuing Membership Application with FINRA
pursuant to FINRAs NASD Rule 1017 in connection with the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby) and to obtain as promptly as reasonably
practicable all consents, registrations, approvals, permits and
authorizations necessary or advisable to be obtained from any third party
and/or any Governmental Entity and/or any SRO in order to consummate the
Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including using their reasonable best efforts to agree to any requirements or
remedies imposed by any applicable Governmental Entity. Notwithstanding the
foregoing or anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in no event shall
either the Company or Parent or any of their respective Affiliates be
required to pay any consideration to any third parties or give anything of
value to obtain any such Persons authorization, approval, consent or waiver
to effectuate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, other than filing, recordation or similar fees.

(b) Subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information,
Parent and the Company shall have the right to review in advance and, to the
extent reasonably practicable, each will consult with the other on and
consider in good faith the views of the other in connection with, all of the
information relating to Parent or the Company, as the case may be, and any of
their respective Subsidiaries, that appears in any filing made with, or
written materials submitted to, any third party and/or any Governmental Entity
in connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including the Joint Proxy/Prospectus). Neither the Company nor
Parent shall permit any of its officers or any other representatives or agents
to participate in any meeting with any Governmental Entity in respect of any
filings, investigation or other inquiry relating to the transactions
contemplated hereby unless it consults with the other party in advance and, to
the extent not prohibited by such Governmental Entity,

 



-54-  gives the other party the opportunity to attend and participate thereat. The
Company and its Subsidiaries shall not agree to any actions, restrictions or
conditions with respect to obtaining any consents, registrations, approvals,
permits, expirations of waiting periods or authorizations in connection with
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement without
the prior written consent of Parent (which, subject to this Section 6.5, may
be withheld in Parents sole discretion). In exercising the foregoing rights,
each of the Company and Parent shall act reasonably and as promptly as
reasonably practicable.

 

(c) Without limiting the generality of the undertakings pursuant to this
Section 6.5, but subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this
Agreement, including Section 6.5(c)(i), each of the Company (in the case of
clauses (i) below) and Parent (in the case of clauses (i) and (ii) below)
agree to take or cause to be taken the following actions:

(i) the prompt provision to each and every federal, state, local or foreign
court or Governmental Entity with jurisdiction over enforcement of any
applicable antitrust or competition Laws (such Laws, " _Antitrust Laws_ ", and
any such Governmental Entity, a " _Governmental Antitrust Entity_ ") of non-
privileged information and documents requested by any Governmental Antitrust
Entity or that are necessary, proper or advisable to permit consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; 

(ii) the prompt use of its reasonable best efforts to take all reasonably
necessary, proper or advisable steps to (A) avoid the entry of, and (B)
resist, vacate, modify, reverse, suspend, prevent, eliminate or remove any
actual, anticipated or threatened permanent, preliminary or temporary
injunction or other order, decree, decision, determination or judgment
entered or issued, or that becomes reasonably foreseeable to be entered or
issued, in any proceeding or inquiry of any kind, in the case of each of the
foregoing clauses (A) and (B), that would reasonably be expected to delay,
restrain, prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit or make unlawful the
consummation of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement
neither this Section 6.5 nor the "reasonable best efforts" standard shall
require, or be construed to require Parent or the Company or any of their
respective Subsidiaries or other Affiliates, in order to obtain any consents,
registrations, approvals, permits and authorizations necessary or advisable
to be obtained from any third party and/or any Governmental Entity and/or any
SRO in order to consummate the Merger or any of the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or otherwise, to agree to, and neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates shall agree to without
Parents prior written consent, any conditions, remedies or requirements that,
individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to materially
and adversely limit or restrict the Companys business as currently conducted
or as currently contemplated to be conducted following the Merger (a "
_Burdensome Condition_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent can compel
the Company to take any of the actions referred to above (or agree to take
such actions) if such actions are only effective after the Effective Time.

 

6.6. _Status; Notifications_. Subject to applicable Law and as required by
any Governmental Entity, the Company and Parent each shall keep the other
apprised of the status of matters relating to completion of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including

 



-55-  promptly furnishing the other with copies of notices or other communications
received by Parent or the Company, as the case may be, or any of its
Subsidiaries, from any third party and/or any Governmental Entity with
respect to such transactions. The Company and Parent each shall give prompt
notice to the other of any change, fact or condition that has had or would
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect or a Parent
Material Adverse Effect, respectively, or of any failure of any condition to
the other partys obligations to effect the Merger.

 

6.7. _Information; Access and Reports_.

 

(a) Subject to applicable Law and the other provisions of this Section 6.7,
the Company and Parent each shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to), upon
request by the other, furnish the other with all information concerning
itself, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers and shareholders and such other
matters as may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with the
Joint Proxy/Prospectus, the Registration Statement or any other statement,
filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of Parent, the Company or
any of their respective Subsidiaries to any third party and/or
any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries
to), upon giving of reasonable notice by the other party, afford the others
officers and other authorized Representatives reasonable access, during
normal business hours following reasonable advance notice throughout the
period prior to the Effective Time, to its officers, employees, agents,
contracts, books and records (including the work papers of such partys
independent accountants upon receipt of any required consents from such
accountants), as well as properties, offices and other facilities, and, during
such period, each shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to)
furnish promptly to the other all information concerning its business,
properties and personnel as may reasonably be requested.

 

(b) The foregoing provisions of this Section 6.7 shall not require and
shall not be construed to require either the Company or Parent to permit any
access to any of its officers, employees, agents, contracts, books or records,
or its properties, offices or other facilities, or to permit any inspection,
review, sampling or audit, or to disclose or otherwise make available any
information that in the reasonable judgment of the Company or Parent, and in
the reasonable judgment of such partys outside legal counsel would (i) result
in the disclosure of any Trade Secrets of any third parties or violate the
terms of any confidentiality provisions in any agreement with a third party
entered into prior to the date of this Agreement if the Company or Parent, as
applicable, shall have used reasonable best efforts (without payment of
any consideration, fees or expenses) to obtain the consent of such third
party to such inspection or disclosure (ii) result in a violation of
applicable Laws, including any fiduciary duty, (iii) waive the protection of
any attorney-client privilege or (iv) result in the disclosure of any
sensitive or personal information that would expose the Company to the risk of
liability. In the event that Parent or the Company objects to any request
submitted pursuant to and in accordance with this Section 6.7 and withholds
information on the basis of the foregoing clauses (i) through (iv), the
Company or the Parent, as applicable, shall inform the other party as to
the general nature of what is being withheld and the Company and Parent shall
cooperate to make appropriate substitute arrangements to permit reasonable
disclosure that does not suffer from any of the foregoing impediments,
including through the use of reasonable best efforts to (A) obtain the
required consent or waiver of any third party required to provide such
information and (B)

 



-56-  implement appropriate and mutually agreeable measures to permit the
disclosure of such information in a manner to remove the basis for the
objection, including by arrangement of appropriate clean room procedures,
redaction or entry into a customary joint defense agreement with respect to
any information to be so provided, if the parties determine that doing so
would reasonably permit the disclosure of such information without
violating applicable Law or jeopardizing such privilege. Each of Parent and
the Company, as it deems advisable and necessary, may reasonably designate
competitively sensitive material provided to the other as "Outside Counsel
Only Material" or with similar restrictions. Such materials and the
information contained therein shall be given only to the outside counsel of
the recipient, or otherwise as the restriction indicates, and be subject to
any additional confidentiality or joint defense agreement between the
parties. All requests for information made pursuant to this Section 6.7 shall
be directed to the executive officer or other Person designated by the Company
or Parent, as the case may be. All information exchanged or made available
shall be governed by the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.

(c) To the extent that any of the information or material furnished
pursuant to this Section 6.7 or otherwise in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement may include material subject to the attorney-client privilege, work
product doctrine or any other applicable privilege concerning pending or
threatened legal proceedings or governmental investigations, the parties
understand and agree that they have a commonality of interest with respect to
such matters and it is their desire, intention and mutual understanding
that the sharing of such material is not intended to, and shall not, waive or
diminish in any way the confidentiality of such material or its continued
protection under the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other
applicable privilege. All such information that is entitled to protection
under the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other applicable
privilege shall remain entitled to such protection under these privileges,
this Agreement, and under the joint defense doctrine.

(d) No exchange of information or investigation by Parent or its
Representatives shall affect or be deemed to affect, modify or waive the
representations and warranties of the Company set forth in this Agreement, and
no investigation by the Company or its Representatives shall affect or be
deemed to affect, modify or waive the representations and warranties of
Parent set forth in this Agreement.

6.8. _Stock Exchange and Delisting_. Prior to the Closing Date, the
Company shall cooperate with Parent and use reasonable best efforts to take,
or cause to be taken, all actions, and do or cause to be done all things,
reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its part under applicable Laws
and rules and policies of the NASDAQ to enable the delisting by the Surviving
Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock from the NASDAQ and the
deregistration of the shares of Company Common Stock under the Exchange Act as
promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, and in any event no more
than ten days after the Effective Time.

6.9. _Publicity_. The initial press release with respect to the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated hereby shall be a joint press release
and thereafter the Company and Parent shall consult with each other, and
provide meaningful opportunity for review and give due consideration to
reasonable comment by the other party, prior to issuing any press releases or
otherwise making public announcements with respect to the Merger and the other
transactions

 



-57-  contemplated by this Agreement and prior to making any filings with any
third party and/or any Governmental Entity and/or any SRO (including any
national securities exchange) with respect thereto, except (i) as may be
required by applicable Law or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement

for the periods specified in each of clauses (i) through (iii), with (i)
during the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the first

_Parent Benefit Plan_ "), Parent shall cause each Continuing Employee to
receive service credit for service to the same extent such service credit was
granted under a comparable Plan immediately prior to the Effective
Time. Parent shall (i) waive all limitations as to preexisting conditions
exclusions, actively at work requirements, waiting periods and insurability
requirements with respect to participation and coverage requirements
applicable to 

 



-58-  the Continuing Employees (and any dependents or beneficiaries thereof) under

of) the Effective Time. In the event that Parent requests that the Company
401(k) Plan be terminated, the Company shall provide Parent with evidence
that such Plan has been terminated (the form and substance of which shall be

participant in the Company 401(k) Plan to participate in the Parent 401(k)
Plan effective as of the Effective Time, and (y) permit each Continuing
Employee to make rollover contributions of "eligible rollover distributions"
(within the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code, including of loans) in
the form of cash, shares of Parent Common Stock, notes (in the case of loans)
or a combination thereof, in an amount equal to the full account balance
distributed or distributable to such Continuing Employee from the Company
401(k) Plan to the Parent 401(k) Plan.

(d) Any broad-based written communications to the employees of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries pertaining to compensation or benefit matters that
are addressed in this Agreement or are related to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall be subject to the prior prompt review and
comment of the other party, and the party seeking to distribute any such
communication shall give reasonable and good faith consideration to any

parties to this Agreement, and no Continuing Employee (including
any beneficiary or dependent thereof) shall be regarded for any purpose as a
third-party beneficiary of this Agreement, and no provision of this Section

6.12. _Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, whether
or not the Merger is consummated, all costs and expenses incurred in
connection with the preparation, negotiation, execution and performance of
this Agreement and the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including all fees and expenses of its Representatives, shall be
paid by the party incurring such expense.

6.13. _Indemnification; Directors_ __ _and Officers_ __ _Insurance_.

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent agrees that it will
indemnify and hold harmless, to the extent provided pursuant to the Companys
articles of incorporation as of the date of this Agreement, each present and
former director, officer and employee of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (collectively, in each case, when acting in such capacity) (the "
_Indemnified Parties_ "), against any costs or expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities
incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative,
arising out of or related to such Indemnified Parties service as a
director, officer or employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries or services
performed by such Persons at the request of the Company or its Subsidiaries at
or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or
after the Effective Time, including actions to enforce this provision or any
other indemnification or advancement right of any Indemnified Party;
_provided_ that any Person to whom expenses are advanced provides an
undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined by final
adjudication that such person is not entitled to indemnification. Parent shall
not be required to indemnify any Indemnified Party pursuant hereto if it shall
be determined that the Indemnified Party acted in bad faith and not in a
manner such party believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of
the Company.

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall and, if the Company is
unable to, Parent shall as of the Effective Time obtain and fully pay the
premium for "tail" insurance policies for the extension of (i) the directors
and officers liability coverage of the Companys existing directors and
officers insurance policies, and (ii) the Companys existing fiduciary
liability insurance policies, in each case providing for coverage that serves
to reimburse the present and former director, officers and employees of the
Company with respect to events arising from facts or events which occurred
before the Effective Time for a claims reporting or discovery period of six
years from and after the Effective Time (the " _Tail Period_ ") from one or
more insurance carriers with the same or better credit rating as the Companys
insurance carrier as of the date hereof with respect to directors and
officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance
(collectively, " _D andO Insurance_") with terms, conditions, retentions and
limits of liability that are at least as favorable to the insureds as the
Companys existing policies with respect to matters existing or occurring at
or prior to the Effective Time (including in connection

 



-60-  with this Agreement or the transactions or actions contemplated hereby). If
the Company and Parent for any reason fail to obtain such "tail" insurance
policies as of the Effective Time, Parent shall continue to maintain in
effect for the Tail Period the DandO Insurance in place as of the date of this
Agreement with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are
at least as favorable to the insureds as provided in the Companys existing
policies as of the date of this Agreement, or Parent shall purchase comparable
DandO Insurance for the Tail Period with terms, conditions, retentions and
limits of liability that are at least as favorable as provided in the
Companys existing policies as of the date of this Agreement; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in no event shall the aggregate cost of the DandO Insurance
exceed during the Tail Period 300% of the current aggregate annual
premium paid by the Company for such purpose; and _provided_ , _further_ ,
that if the cost of such insurance coverage exceeds such amount, Parent shall
obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding
such amount.

 

(c) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under this
Section 6.13, upon learning of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, shall promptly notify Parent thereof, but the failure to so
notify shall not relieve Parent of any liability it may have to such
Indemnified Party except to the extent such failure materially prejudices the
indemnifying party. In the event any claim or claims are asserted or made
within the Tail Period, all rights to indemnification in respect of any such
claim or claims shall continue until final disposition of any and all such
claims. 

(d) If Parent or any of its respective successors or assigns (i) shall
consolidate with or merge into any other corporation or entity and shall not
be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger or (ii) shall transfer all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any individual, corporation or other entity, then, and in each such
case, proper provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns of
Parent shall assume all of the obligations set forth in this Section 6.13.

 

(e) The provisions of this Section 6.13 are intended to be for the benefit
of, and from and after the Effective Time shall be enforceable by, each of
the Indemnified Parties, who shall be third party beneficiaries of this
Section 6.13. The rights of the Indemnified Parties under this Section 6.13
are in addition to any rights such Indemnified Parties may have under the any
applicable Contracts or Laws.

6.14. _Takeover Statutes_. If any Takeover Statute is or may become
applicable to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, each of Parent and the Company and the Parent Board and the Company
Board, respectively, shall grant such approvals and take such actions as are
necessary so that such transactions may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement, as the case may be,
and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of such statute or
regulation on such transactions.

6.15. _Pre-Closing __Dividends_.

 

(a) The Company Board may, prior to the Closing but not earlier than
the 15th day prior to the anticipated Closing Date, declare and cause the

determined as follows (the " _Per Share Pre-Closing Dividend_"):

 



-61- (i) The Per Share Pre-Closing Dividend shall be equal to the sum of (x)
the Base Pre-Closing Dividend Per Share Amount plus (y) the Additional Pre-
Closing Dividend Per Share Amount, if any, in each case determined as follows:

 

(A) If Dividend Funds are equal to or less than $33,500,000 plus any

dividend equal to the quotient of Available Funds divided by Fully Diluted
Company Equity (the " _Base Pre-Closing Dividend Per Share Amount_");

 

(ii) If Available Funds exceed the amount that would result in a dividend
per share of Fully-Diluted Company Equity of $8.50 (such excess, the "
_Additional Available Funds_ "), then an additional amount determined as
follows:

 

(A) If Additional Available Funds are equal to or less than $5,000,000,
there shall be no additional amount;

(B) If Additional Available Funds are in excess of $5,000,000 (such excess,
the " _Excess Available Funds_ "), then an additional amount equal to the
quotient of (i)(y) the product of Excess Available Funds and (z) 0.70 divided
by (ii) Fully Diluted Company Equity (the " _Additional Pre-Closing Dividend
Per Share_"). Solely for purposes of the foregoing, the value of any Financial

including legal fees and related expenses, investment banking and opinion fees
and related expenses and accounting fees and related expenses, (y) any
accrued but unpaid compensation expenses related to any products,

 



-62-  services or transactions for which Cash and Cash Equivalents have been
received prior to the Closing, and (z) an amount equal to the commencement
bonus payable to the Companys Chief Executive Officer pursuant to the
employment agreement entered into between such officer and Parent as of the
date of this Agreement; (iv) " _Cash and Cash Equivalents_ " has the meaning
so classified under the applicable line item of the Companys consolidated

Value, (iii) the Pre-Closing Dividend and the calculation thereof, (iv) the

all relevant work papers, schedules, memoranda and other documents prepared
by the Company or its accountants in connection with the Pre-Closing Dividend,
as well as to executive, finance and accounting personnel of the Company and
any other information which Parent may reasonably request in connection with
its review of such documents.

take all such actions as may be necessary or appropriate to cause the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and any other dispositions of
equity securities of the Company (including derivative securities) or
acquisitions of shares of Parent Common Stock (including derivative
securities) in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
by any individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section
16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company or will become subject

of effecting the Merger by altering the Merger such that the Merger is a
merger of the Company with and into a direct or indirect wholly-owned limited
liability company Subsidiary of Parent that is disregarded from Parent for
U.S. federal income tax purposes instead of Parent with prior approval of the
Company (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), and the Company agrees to enter into such amendments in order to
give effect to such restructuring;  _provided_ that no such change or
amendment shall (and it shall be reasonable for the Company to withhold its

adjournment, recess or postponement thereof in accordance with this Agreement
at which a vote on the adoption of this Agreement was taken or (ii) if the
Requisite Parent Vote shall not have been obtained at the Parent Stockholders
Meeting or at any adjournment, recess or postponement thereof in accordance
with this Agreement at which a vote with respect to such approval was taken;

 



-67- (d) by either Parent or the Company, if any Order permanently
restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting consummation of the Merger
shall become final and non-appealable;

 

(e) by either Parent or the Company, if there has been a breach by the
Company, on the one hand, or Parent, on the other hand, of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement set forth in this Agreement,
or if any representation or warranty of Company, on the one hand, or Parent,
on the other hand, shall have become untrue, in either case such that
the conditions in Section 7.2(a) or Section 7.2(b), in the case of a breach
by the Company, or Section 7.3(a) or Section 7.3(b), in the case of a breach
by Parent, would not be satisfied (and such breach or failure to be true and
correct is not curable prior to the Outside Date, or if curable prior to the
Outside Date, has not been cured within the earlier of (i) thirty calendar
days after the giving of notice thereof by the non-breaching party to
the breaching party or (ii) three Business Days prior to the Outside Date);

(f) by Parent, prior to the time the Requisite Company Vote is obtained,
if the Company Board shall have:

(A) materially breached Section 6.2 (other than Section 6.2(c)),

(B) failed to include the Company Recommendation in the Joint
Proxy/Prospectus,

(C) made a Change of Recommendation, or

 

(D) failed to recommend, within ten Business Days after the commencement of
a tender or exchange offer for outstanding shares of Company Common Stock
(other than by Parent or an Affiliate of Parent), against acceptance of such
tender offer or exchange offer by its shareholders.

 

8.2. _Effect of Termination and Abandonment_.

 

(a) Except to the extent provided in Section 8.2(b) below, in the event of
termination of this Agreement and the abandonment of the Merger pursuant to
this Article VIII, this Agreement shall become void and of no effect with no
liability to any Person on the part of any party hereto (or any of its
Representatives or Affiliates); _provided_ ,  _however_ , and notwithstanding
anything in the foregoing to the contrary in this Agreement, (i) no such
termination shall relieve any party hereto of any liability or damages to the
other party hereto resulting from any willful and material breach of this
Agreement and (ii) the provisions set forth in this Section 8.2 and the second
sentence of Section 9.1 shall survive the termination of this Agreement.

 

(b) In the event that this Agreement is terminated:

 



-68- (i) by either the Company or Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(b) or Section
8.1(c)(i), and, in each case,

(A) a _bona fide_ Acquisition Proposal shall have been made to the Company
and its stockholders generally (whether or not conditional) or any Person
shall have publicly announced an intention to make an Acquisition Proposal
(whether or not conditional) with respect to the Company (and such
Acquisition Proposal or publicly announced intention shall not have been
publicly withdrawn on a _bona fide_ basis without qualification (1) at least
ten Business Days prior to the date of termination, with respect to
any termination pursuant to Section 8.1(b), or (2) at least five Business
Days prior to the date of the Company Shareholders Meeting, with respect to
termination pursuant to pursuant to Section 8.1(c)(i)), and

 

(B) within twelve months after such termination, (1) the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries shall have entered into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement
with respect to, or shall have consummated or shall have approved or
recommended to the Companys shareholders or otherwise not opposed, an
Acquisition Proposal, which Acquisition Proposal is subsequently consummated
(even if such consummation occurs after such twelve month period) or (2) there
shall have been consummated an Acquisition Proposal with respect to the
Company (where, for purposes of clause (A) of the definition of Acquisition
Proposal, the shareholders of the Company immediately preceding such
transaction hold less than 50% of the equity interests in the surviving or
resulting entity of such transaction and with "50%" being substituted in lieu
of "15%" in each instance thereof in clause (B) the definition of
"Acquisition Proposal" for this purpose); _provided_ that for purposes of this
Agreement, an Acquisition Proposal with respect to the Company shall not
be deemed to have been "publicly withdrawn" by any Person if, within twelve
months of a termination pursuant to Section 8.1(b) or Section 8.1(c)(i), the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall have entered into an
Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to, or shall have consummated
or shall have approved or recommended to the Companys shareholders or
otherwise not opposed, an Acquisition Proposal made by or on behalf of such
Person or any of its Affiliates, then immediately prior to or concurrently
with the occurrence of either of the events described in the foregoing clauses
(B)(1) or (B)(2), or

 

(ii) by Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(f)

 

then promptly, but in no event later than one Business Day after the date of
termination pursuant to 8.1(f) or the occurrence of either of the
events described in the foregoing clauses (b)(i)(B)(1) or (b)(i)(B)(2), the
Company shall pay a termination fee of $5,000,000 (the " _Termination Fee_ "),
to Parent by wire transfer of immediately available cash funds. In no event
shall the Company be required to pay the Termination Fee on more than one
occasion.

(c) The parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this Section
8.2 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
and that, without these agreements, the other parties would not enter into
this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails to promptly pay the amount
due pursuant to this Section 8.2, and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent
commences a suit that results in a judgment against the Company for the fees
or expenses set forth in this Section 8.2 or any portion of thereof, the
Company shall pay to Parent

 



-69-  its costs and expenses (including attorneys fees) in connection with such
suit, together with interest on the amount of the fee at the prime rate as
published in _The Wall Street Journal_ (Northeast edition) in effect on the
date such payment was required to be made from the date such payment was
required to be made through the date of payment.

 

(d) Except as provided in Section 8.2(a), the parties acknowledge that the
payment of the Termination Fee pursuant to this Section 8.2(b) is not a
penalty and shall constitute liquidated damages as a reasonable amount that
will compensate Parent in the circumstances upon which the Termination Fee is
payable for the efforts and resources expended and opportunity foregone with
respect to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
which would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision, and, from and
after such payment of the Termination Fee, the Company shall have no
further liability or obligations of any kind in connection with this
Agreement.

9.1. _Survival_. This Article IX and the agreements of the Company and
Parent contained in Article II, Article III, Section 6.10 ( _Employee
Benefits_ ), Section 6.11 ( _Taxation_ ), Section 6.12 ( _Expenses_ ) and
Section 6.13 ( _Indemnification; Directors_ __ _and Officers_ __
_ Insurance_ ) shall survive the consummation of the Merger. This Article IX,
the agreements of the Company and Parent contained in Section 6.12 (
_Expenses_ ), Section 8.2 ( _Effect of Termination and Abandonment_ ) and
the Confidentiality Agreement shall survive the termination of this
Agreement. All other representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in

termination of this Agreement.

 

9.2. _Amendment_ _; Waiver_. Subject to the provisions of applicable Law,
at any time prior to the Effective Time, this Agreement may be amended,
modified or waived if, and only if, such amendment, modification or waiver is
in writing and signed, in the case of an amendment or modification, by Parent
and the Company, or in the case of a waiver, by the party against whom the
waiver is to be effective. The conditions to each of the respective parties
obligations to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement are for the sole benefit of such party and may be waived by
such party in whole or in part to the extent permitted by applicable Law. No
failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, power or privilege
hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial
exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The rights and remedies
herein provided shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or
remedies provided by Law.

 

9.3. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts, each such counterpart being deemed to be an original
instrument, and all such counterparts shall together constitute the same
agreement. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page to this
Agreement by facsimile transmission or by email of a .pdf attachment shall be
effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement.

 



-70- 9.4. _Governing Law and Venue; Submission to Jurisdiction; Selection
of Forum; Waiver of Trial by Jury_.

(a) THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE DEEMED TO BE MADE IN AND IN ALL RESPECTS SHALL
BE INTERPRETED, CONSTRUED AND GOVERNED BY AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAW OF
THE STATE OF DELAWARE WITHOUT REGARD TO THE CONFLICTS OF LAW PRINCIPLES
THEREOF TO THE EXTENT THAT SUCH PRINCIPLES WOULD DIRECT A MATTER TO ANOTHER
JURISDICTION, EXCEPT THAT (I) THE INTERNAL AFFAIRS OF THE COMPANY, INCLUDING
FIDUCIARY DUTIES OF THE DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS OF THE COMPANY, AND (II) ALL
OTHER PROVISIONS OF, OR TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY, THIS AGREEMENT THAT ARE
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE REQUIRED TO BE GOVERNED BY VSCA SHALL BE GOVERNED BY
THE LAWS OF THE COMMONWEALTH OF VIRGINIA.

(b) Each of the parties to this Agreement agrees that it shall bring any
action or proceeding in respect of any claim arising under or relating to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement exclusively in
the courts of the State of Delaware and the Federal courts of the United
States of America located in the State of Delaware (the " _Chosen Courts_ ")
and, solely in connection with such claims, (i) irrevocably submits to the
exclusive jurisdiction of the Chosen Courts, (ii) waives any objection to the
laying of venue in any such action or proceeding in the Chosen Courts, (iii)
waives any objection that the Chosen Courts are an inconvenient forum or do
not have jurisdiction over any party to this Agreement and (iv) agrees that
mailing of process or other papers in connection with any such action or
proceeding in the manner provided in Section 9.6 or in such other manner as
may be permitted by Law shall be valid and sufficient service thereof.

(c) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES,
AND THEREFORE EACH PARTY HERETO IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES TO THE
FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY WITH
RESPECT TO ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING UNDER OR
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT.
EACH PARTY HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGES AND CERTIFIES (I) THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT
OR ATTORNEY OF THE OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT
SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING, SEEK TO
ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (II) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE
IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (III) IT MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND (IV)
IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT AND THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND
CERTIFICATIONS CONTAINED IN THIS SECTION 9.4(c).

 



-71- 9.5. _Specific Performance_. Each of the parties to this
Agreement acknowledges and agrees that the rights of each party to consummate
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement are
special, unique and of extraordinary character and that if for any reason any
of the provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or are otherwise breached, immediate and irreparable harm
or damage would be caused for which money damages would not be an adequate
remedy. Accordingly, each party agrees that, in addition to any other
available remedies a party may have in equity or at law, each party shall be
entitled to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement
and to obtain an injunction restraining any breach or violation or threatened
breach or violation of the provisions of this Agreement in accordance with
Section 9.4 without necessity of posting a bond or other form of security. In
the event that any action or proceeding should be brought in equity to
enforce the provisions of this Agreement, no party shall allege, and each
party hereby waives the defense, that there is an adequate remedy at law.

 

9.6. _Notices_. All notices, requests, instructions or other
communications or documents to be given or made hereunder by any party to the
other parties to this Agreement shall be in writing and (a) served by personal
delivery upon the party for whom it is intended, (b) by a nationally
recognized overnight courier service upon the party for whom it is intended,
(c) delivered by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, or

9.7. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including any exhibits hereto),
the Company Disclosure Letter, the Parent Disclosure Letter and the
Confidentiality Agreement, dated September 29, 2016 between Parent and the
Company (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ") constitute the entire agreement
among the parties to this Agreement with respect to the subject matter of this
Agreement and supersedes all prior agreements, understandings and
representations and warranties, whether oral or written, with respect to such
matters.

9.8. _Third Party Beneficiaries_. Parent and the Company hereby
agree that their respective representations, warranties and covenants set
forth in this Agreement are solely for the benefit of the other parties
hereto, in accordance with and subject to the terms of this Agreement, and
this Agreement is not intended to, and does not, confer upon any Person other
than the parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder, including, without
limitation, the right to rely upon the representations and warranties set
forth in this Agreement, except for the rights of third party beneficiaries
as are provided in Section 6.13 ( _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers
Insurance_), which shall not arise until after the Effective Time. The
representations and warranties in this Agreement are the product of
negotiations among the parties to this Agreement. Any inaccuracies in such
representations and warranties are subject to waiver by the parties to this
Agreement in accordance with Section 9.2 without notice or liability to any
other Person. In some instances, the representations and warranties in this
Agreement may represent an allocation among the parties to this Agreement of
risks associated with particular matters

 



-73-  regardless of the Knowledge of any of the parties to this Agreement.
Consequently, Persons other than the parties to this Agreement may not rely
upon the representations and warranties in this Agreement as
characterizations of actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this
Agreement or as of any other date.

 

9.9. _Fulfillment of Obligations_. Whenever this Agreement requires a
Subsidiary of Parent to take any action, such requirement shall be deemed to
include an undertaking on the part of Parent to cause such Subsidiary to take
such action. Whenever this Agreement requires a Subsidiary of the Company to
take any action, such requirement shall be deemed to include an undertaking
on the part of the Company to cause such Subsidiary to take such action. Any
obligation of one party to another party under this Agreement, which
obligation is performed, satisfied or fulfilled by an Affiliate of such
party, shall be deemed to have been performed, satisfied or fulfilled by such
party.

9.10. _Definitions_. Each of the terms set forth in Annex A shall have
the meaning set forth opposite such term.

 

9.11. _Severability_. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed
severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not
affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions of this
Agreement. If any provision of this Agreement, or the application of such
provision to any Person or any circumstance, is invalid or unenforceable, (a)
a suitable and equitable provision shall be substituted therefor in order to
carry out, so far as may be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of
such invalid or unenforceable provision and (b) the remainder of this
Agreement and the application of such provision to other Persons or
circumstances shall not be affected by such invalidity or unenforceability,
nor shall such invalidity or unenforceability affect the validity or
enforceability of such provision, or the application of such provision, in
any other jurisdiction.

9.12. _Interpretation; Construction_.

(a) The table of contents and headings herein are for convenience of
reference only, do not constitute part of this Agreement and shall not be
deemed to limit or otherwise affect any of the provisions hereof. All article,
section, subsection, schedules, annex and exhibit references used in this
Agreement are to articles, sections, subsections, schedules, annexes and
exhibits to this Agreement unless otherwise specified. The exhibits, schedules
and annexes attached to this Agreement constitute a part of this Agreement and
are incorporated herein for all purposes.

 

(b) If a term is defined as one part of speech (such as a noun), it shall
have a corresponding meaning when used as another part of speech (such as a
verb). Unless the context of this Agreement clearly requires otherwise, words
importing the masculine gender shall include the feminine and neutral genders
and vice versa. The words "includes" or "including" shall mean "including
without limitation," the words "hereof," "hereby," "herein," "hereunder" and
similar terms in this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as a whole
and not any particular section or article in which such words appear and any
reference to a Law shall include any rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder, and any reference to any Law in this Agreement shall only be a
reference to such Law as of the date of this Agreement. Currency amounts
referenced herein are in U.S. Dollars.

 



-74- (c) Whenever this Agreement refers to a number of days, such number
shall refer to calendar days unless Business Days are specified. Whenever any
action must be taken hereunder on or by a day that is not a Business Day, then
such action may be validly taken on or by the next day that is a Business Day.

 

(d) All accounting terms used herein and not expressly defined herein shall
have the meanings given to them under GAAP. 

(e) The parties have participated jointly in negotiating and drafting this
Agreement. In the event that an ambiguity or a question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly
by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or
disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provision of this
Agreement.

(f) The Company Disclosure Letter or the Parent Disclosure Letter may
include items and information the disclosure of which is not required either
in response to an express disclosure requirement contained in a provision of
this Agreement or as an exception to one or more representations or warranties
contained in Article IV or Article V or to one or more covenants contained in
Article VI. Inclusion of any items or information in the Company Disclosure
Letter or the Parent Disclosure Letter shall not be deemed to be an
acknowledgement or agreement that any such item or information (or any non-
disclosed item or information of comparable or greater significance) is
"material" or that, individually or in the aggregate, has had or
would reasonably be expected to have either a Company Material Adverse Effect
or Parent Material Adverse Effect or to affect the interpretation of such term
for purposes of this Agreement.

 

9.13. _Successors and Assigns_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of the parties and their respective successors, legal
representatives and permitted assigns. No party to this Agreement may assign
any of its rights or delegate any of its obligations under this Agreement, by
operation of Law or otherwise, without the prior written consent of the other
parties, except that Parent may assign any and all of its rights under this
Agreement, by written notice to the Company, to a wholly owned direct or
indirect Subsidiary to be a Constituent Corporation, in which event
all references to Parent in this Agreement shall be deemed references to such
other Subsidiary, except that all representations and warranties made in this
Agreement with respect to Parent as of the date of this Agreement shall be
deemed representations and warranties made with respect to such other
Subsidiary as of the date of such designation; _provided_ that any such
designation shall not prevent or materially impair or impede or delay the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or otherwise
materially impair or impede the rights of the stockholders of the Company
under this Agreement.

 



-75- IN WITNESS WHEREOF, this Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the
duly authorized officers of the parties to this Agreement as of the date
first written above.
