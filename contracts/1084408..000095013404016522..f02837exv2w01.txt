            (ii)  use their reasonable endeavours to procure that they accept
                  the Exercise Proposal and properly execute and return a form
                  of election in the form set out in the Exercise Proposal;

      (C)   to the extent that the Minor Sellers hold Unvested Options:

            (i)   notify them of the Unvested Options Proposal; and

                  the Unvested Options Proposal and properly execute and return
                  a form of election in the form set out in the Unvested Options
                  Proposal.

2.10  The Sellers will procure the grant by the Company to employees of the
      Group of such number of New Options and in such amounts as the Purchaser
      may require in writing to the Sellers' Representative within 5 Business
      Days of the date of this agreement, such New Options to be subject to the
      Unvested Options Proposal and in respect of a maximum of 10,000,000
      Ordinary Shares.

2.11  The Purchaser hereby offers to purchase, on the terms of and subject to
      the conditions of this agreement, at Completion, the Drag-Along Shares
      and, subject to issue after Completion, the Option Shares.

2.12  In accordance with the Articles of Association, the Preference
      Shareholders hereby consent to the Company taking any action, or
      permitting any action to be taken, to affect the transfer of the Shares
      pursuant to this agreement.

2.13  The Sellers shall procure that the Company shall not allot or issue any
      Ordinary Shares upon the exercise of Vested Options or Accelerated Options
      in the period from the date of signature of this agreement to the date of
      issue of the Drag-Along Notice.

2.14  The Company shall not allot or issue any Ordinary Shares upon the exercise
      of Vested Options or Accelerated Options in the period of 30 days from the
      date of issue of the Drag-Along Notice or until the day following the

      of, and holders of, any Ordinary Shares that fall to be issued as a result
      of acceptance of the Exercise Proposal promptly following the closing date
      for acceptance of the Exercise Proposal and in any case not less than one
      Business Day prior to the anticipated date of Completion.

2.15  To the extent relevant, the Preference Shareholders waive the requirement
      of article 14.1.3 of the Articles of Association that the consideration
      per Ordinary Share (on an as-converted basis) offered pursuant to the
      Offer be equal to or greater than the B Preference Share Conversion Price
      (as defined in the Articles of Association) multiplied by two.

2.16  The Purchaser shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
      consideration otherwise payable to any person (pursuant to this agreement,
      the Drag-Along Notice, the Exercise Proposal or otherwise) an amount equal
      to such amounts as it or the Company may be required to pay to any tax
      authority with respect to the making of such payment under any provision
      of Tax law. If the Purchaser so withholds amounts and duly accounts, or
      procures that the Company duly accounts, for such amounts to the
      appropriate Tax authority, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes
      as having been paid to the person in respect of which the Purchaser made
      such deduction and withholding.

            Completion)) from being satisfied on the date initially set for

      5.2 of the Articles of Association.

5.1   At Completion:

                                       18

            Escrow Agent for deposit into the Escrow Account.

5.2   In respect of clause 5.1(B) the Sellers and the Company will procure that
      the Sellers' Agent holds the part of the Purchase Price attributable to
      the Minor Sellers on trust and on behalf of such Minor Sellers and pay to

      Drag-Along Share within five Business Days following Completion and in
      relation to any Option Shares pay such amount as is due to them in
      accordance with the Exercise Proposal.

5.3   In respect of clause 5.1(C), each of the Sellers shall procure that, as
      set out in the Drag-Along Notice, the Minor Sellers who hold Draft-Along
      Shares shall agree to the withholding by the Purchaser of an amount
      equivalent to such part of the Escrow Amount as is attributable to the
      Drag-Along Shares and to the payment by the Purchaser of the amount so
      withheld into the Escrow Account so as to form part of the Escrow Amount.

5.4   Subject to the interests of the Purchaser therein and the restrictions set
      out in this agreement and the Escrow Agreement, the Sellers and the Minor
      Sellers (to the extent they hold Drag-Along Shares) shall be treated as
      the owner of the Escrow Amount. Any interest or other income earned
      thereon shall be owned by the Sellers and Minor Sellers (to the extent
      they hold Drag-Along Shares) and shall be released from the Escrow Account
      pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement.

5.5   The Escrow Agent shall hold the Escrow Amount and all interest and other
      amounts earned thereon in escrow subject to the terms and conditions of
      the Escrow Agreement, and the distribution of any funds from the Escrow
      Account shall be governed by the terms and conditions of the Escrow
      Agreement.

5.6   Following payment to the Sellers' Agent in accordance with clause 5.1(B),
      the Purchaser shall not be concerned with the distribution of such amounts
      between the Sellers and the Minor Sellers and such payment shall be a
      complete and valid discharge in respect of the amount so paid.

6.    COMPLETION

6.1   Completion shall take place at 2 p.m. on the Completion Date at the
      offices of the Purchaser's Solicitors at One Bunhill Row, London EC1Y 8YY.

      Seller complies fully with the requirements of Schedule 2 (Completion
      arrangements) so far as they relate to the Seller in question.

      any of the Sale Shares or the Drag-Along Shares unless the sale and
      purchase of all the Sale Shares and the Drag-Along Shares is completed
      simultaneously. This sub-clause shall not limit any other clause of this
      agreement and in particular clause 18 (Remedies and waivers).

6.5   If the obligations of the Sellers under sub-clause 6.2 and Schedule 2
      (Completion arrangements) are not complied with in a material manner on or
      prior to the Completion Date the Purchaser may:

      (A)   defer Completion (so that the provisions of this clause 6 shall
            apply to Completion as so deferred); or

      (B)   proceed to Completion as far as practicable (without limiting its
            rights under this agreement); or

      (C)   terminate this agreement by notice in writing to the Sellers'
            Representative.

6.6   If the agreement is terminated in accordance with sub-clause 6.5 in

      sub-clause 6.2, all obligations of the parties under this agreement shall
      end except for those expressly stated to continue without limit in time
      but (for the avoidance of doubt) all rights and liabilities of parties
      which have accrued before termination shall continue to exist.

6.7   Payment by telegraphic transfer for the consideration per Sale Share and
      Drag-Along Share stated in clause 4.2 (Consideration) in accordance with
      paragraphs 9 and 10 of Schedule 2 (Completion arrangements) shall
      constitute payment of the consideration for the Shares and shall discharge
      the obligations of the Purchaser under clause 2 (Purchaser's Offer and
      Drag-Along) and the Purchaser shall not be concerned to see that the
      moneys transferred are applied in paying the Sellers or the Minor Sellers
      in accordance with their respective entitlements.

7.    WARRANTIES AND COVENANTS

7.1   Subject to the limitations and exclusions set out in clause 8 (Purchaser's
      remedies and Warrantors' limitations on liability) and Schedule 4
      (Exclusions and limitations on liability):

      (A)   in respect of the Title and Capacity Warranties, each of the Sellers
            warrants to the Purchaser; and

      (B)   in respect of the Warranties other than the Title and Capacity
            Warranties, each of the Management Warrantors warrants to the
            Purchaser,

                                       20
<PAGE>

      that the relevant Warranties given are accurate in all respects at the
      date of this agreement and that the Warranties will continue to be
      accurate in all material respects (and for these purposes any
      qualification of a Warranty by reference to materiality shall be
      disregarded) up to and including Completion as if repeated immediately
      before Completion by reference to the facts and circumstances subsisting
      at that date on the basis that any reference in the Warranties, whether
      express or implied, to the date of this agreement is substituted by a
      reference to the Completion Date.

7.2   The Warranties are qualified by matters fairly disclosed in the Disclosure
      Letter in the absence of any fraud or dishonesty on the part of any of the
      Warrantors or their agents or advisers.

7.3   The Warrantors accept that the Purchaser is entering into this agreement
      in reliance upon the terms of the Warranties made by the Warrantors.

7.4   The Purchaser acknowledges that:

      (A)   the Warranties are the only warranties of any kind given by or on
            behalf of the Warrantors on which the Purchaser may rely on entering
            this agreement; and

      (B)   it does not rely on and has not been induced to enter into this
            agreement on the basis of any warranties, representations,
            covenants, undertakings or any other statement whatsoever other than
            expressly set out in this agreement or the Tax Covenant.

7.5   Both before or at the time of Completion the Management Warrantors
      undertake to disclose in writing to the Purchaser anything which is a
      breach of any of the Warranties immediately it comes to the notice of any
      of them save for any matter which as at the date of this agreement has
      been notified by the Purchaser to the Management Warrantors.

7.6   The Warrantors undertake (if any claim is made against any of them in
      connection with the sale of the Sale Shares to the Purchaser) not to make
      any claim against any member of the Group or any director, employee or
      adviser of any member of the Group on whom any of them may have relied
      before agreeing to any terms of this agreement or of the Tax Covenant or
      authorising any statement in the Disclosure Letter, but so that this shall
      not preclude any Warrantor from claiming against any other Warrantor under
      any right of contribution or indemnity to which he may be entitled.

7.7   Subject to clause 8.13, each of the Warranties shall be construed as a
      separate and independent warranty and (except where expressly provided to
      the contrary) shall not be limited or restricted by reference to or
      inference from the terms of any other Warranty or any other term of this
      agreement.

7.8   If any deductions or withholdings are required by law to be made from any
      of the sums payable in respect of any breach of any of the Warranties by
      the Warrantors, the Warrantors shall be obliged to pay to the Purchaser
      such sum (to be satisfied exclusively from the Escrow Account) as will,
      after the deduction or withholding has

                                       21
<PAGE>

      been made, leave the Purchaser with the same amount as it would have been
      entitled to receive in the absence of any such requirement to make a
      deduction or withholding.

7.9   The only Warranties which shall apply in relation to:

      (A)   property matters shall be those set out in paragraphs 13, 24 and 30
            of Schedule 3 (Warranties);

      (B)   environmental matters shall be those set out in paragraph 25 of
            Schedule 3 (Warranties);

      (C)   Intellectual Property Rights and Information Technology matters
            shall be those set out in paragraphs 4, 7, 8, 9,11,13,18.2 - 18.6,
            22, 23, 26.16(B) and 26.17 of Schedule 3 (Warranties);

      (D)   employment matters shall be those set out in paragraphs 7, 8,
            9,11.1(F), 13, 18.2-18.4, 18.6,19, 22,23,26,29 and 41 of Schedule 3
            (Warranties): and

      (E)   tax matters shall be the Tax Warranties.

7.10  The Sellers shall use reasonable endeavours to obtain counterparts of the
      Domain Name Transfer duly executed by the registrant of the Domain Name on
      or before Completion.

8.    PURCHASER'S REMEDIES AND WARRANTORS' LIMITATIONS ON LIABILITY

8.1   No liability shall attach to the Warrantors in respect of claims under the
      Warranties if and to the extent that the exclusions and limitations set
      out in Schedule 4 (Exclusions and limitations on liability) apply, in the
      absence of any fraud or dishonesty on the part of any of the Warrantors or
      their agents or advisers.

8.2   The total aggregate liability in respect of the Warranties (other than the
      Title and Capacity Warranties) the Tax Covenant and clauses 8.8 to 8.12,
      including all legal and other costs and expenses, shall not in any event
      exceed the amount in the Escrow Account (excluding any accrued interest)
      from time to time.

8.3   (A)   If, between the time of this agreement and Completion, the Purchaser
            becomes aware (whether it does so by reason of any disclosure made
            under clause 7 (Warranties and covenants) or not) that there has
            been a breach of the Warranties, clause 10 (Conduct of business
            before Completion) or Schedule 6 (Conduct of business before
            Completion), the Purchaser may terminate this agreement provided
            such breach constitutes a Material Adverse Effect but otherwise
            shall not be entitled to terminate this agreement.

      (B)   If the agreement is terminated in accordance with sub-clause 8.3(A)
            all obligations of the Purchaser under this agreement shall end
            except for those expressly stated to continue without limit in time
            but (for the avoidance of doubt) all rights and liabilities of the
            parties which have accrued before termination shall continue to
            exist.

                                       22
<PAGE>

      (C)   For the avoidance of doubt but without limiting clause 18 (Remedies
            and waivers), the Purchaser's right to terminate this agreement in
            accordance with sub-clause 8.3(A) is not exclusive of any rights,
            powers and remedies provided by law.

8.4   If a right to terminate this agreement under clause 8.3(A) arises which
      the Purchaser does not exercise prior to Completion or if, following
      Completion, the Purchaser becomes aware (whether it does so by reason of
      any disclosure made pursuant to clause 7 (Warranties and covenants) or
      not) that there has been any breach of the Warranties, clause 10 (Conduct
      of business before Completion) or Schedule 6 (Conduct of business prior to
      Completion), the Purchaser shall not be entitled to terminate this
      agreement but shall be entitled to claim damages or exercise any other
      right, power or remedy under this agreement.

8.5   If the Sellers default in the payment when due of any sum payable under
      this agreement (whether determined by agreement or pursuant to an order of
      a court or otherwise), the liability of the Sellers shall be increased to
      include interest on such sum from the date when such payment is due until
      the date of actual payment (as well after as before judgment) at a rate
      per annum of four per cent, above the base rate from time to time of
      National Westminster Bank PLC. Such interest shall accrue from day to day
      and shall be compounded annually.

8.6   The parties acknowledge that any claim pursuant to this clause 8
      (Purchaser's remedies and Warrantors' limitations on liability) that is:

      (A)   notified in writing by the Purchaser to the Escrow Agent and no
            objection to such claim is delivered by the Sellers' Representative
            to the Escrow Agent within 15 Business Days after delivery of such
            notice, both in accordance with the Escrow Agreement;

      (B)   agreed between the Sellers' Representative and the Purchaser; or

      (C)   proven in a court of competent jurisdiction,

      (A "SETTLED CLAIM"),

      shall be satisfied out of the Escrow Account in accordance with the Escrow
      Agreement.

8.7   The Sellers other than the Management Warrantors acknowledge that,
      notwithstanding that they are not individually providing the Purchaser
      with warranties in terms of the Warranties other than the Title and
      Capacity Warranties, and that they are not parties to the Tax Covenant,
      the amount of the Purchase Price payable to them is subject to reduction
      pursuant to the operation of the Escrow Agreement by reference to the
      amount of any claim in respect of such Warranties or under the Tax
      Covenant that is a Settled Claim or any amount payable under clauses 8.8
      to 8.12.

8.8   The Sellers agree that if the Purchaser can demonstrate that the actual
      Debt Repayment Amount at the close of business on the Completion Date is
      greater than the Debt Repayment Amount set out in the Debt Certificate,
      then the Purchaser shall be

                                       23
<PAGE>

      entitled within the 30 days following Completion to withdraw from the
      Escrow Account an amount equal to the difference in those amounts in
      accordance with the Escrow Agreement. No rights of withdrawal will apply
      after the aforementioned thirty day period has elapsed.

8.9   The Sellers agree that if the actual amount of the Company Transaction
      Liabilities exceeds the amount deducted from the Purchase Price in respect
      thereof in clause 4.1(D) (Consideration), then the Purchaser shall be
      entitled to withdraw from the Escrow Account an amount equal to the
      difference in those amounts in accordance with the Escrow Agreement.

8.10  The Sellers agree that if the Options Proposals extend to a number of
      Vested Options, Accelerated Options or Unvested Options (excluding the New
      Options) greater in the aggregate than the numbers set out in Schedule 7
      (Ownership of the Securities) the Purchaser shall be entitled to withdraw
      from the Escrow Account an amount equal to:

      (A)   any costs arising to the Company or any member of the Purchaser's
            Group by reason of the Exercise Proposal being applicable to a
            greater number of Vested Options, Accelerated Options or Unvested
            Options than the number specified in Schedule 7 (Ownership of the
            Securities); plus

      (B)   any difference in what the Purchase Price would have been if
            calculated using the actual number of Vested Options, Accelerated
            Options or Unvested Options instead of the number specified in
            Schedule 7 (Ownership of the Securites).

8.11  The Sellers agree that the Purchaser shall be entitled to withdraw from
      the Escrow Account an amount equal to any sum due and payable by the
      Company or any of the Subsidiaries under the Altavista OEM Distribution
      Agreement dated 29 January 2001 (as amended) in respect of under paid
      royalties at the Completion Date.

8.12

      (A)   Subject to the following sub-clauses of this clause and clause 8.14,
            the Purchaser shall be entitled to withdraw from the Escrow Account
            an amount equal to 50 per cent, of any IPR Claim Liabilities.

      (B)   The Sellers shall procure that the Sellers' Representative shall
            provide the Escrow Agent with confirmations and/or instructions as
            requested by the Escrow Agent and/or the Purchaser from time to time
            in respect of any withdrawals requested by the Purchaser which are
            permitted in accordance with this clause 8.12.

      (C)   The Purchaser undertakes that it shall not withdraw any sums from
            the Escrow Account pursuant to sub-clause (A) unless prior to any
            such withdrawal it has incurred an obligation in respect of the IPR
            Claim Liabilities of an amount equal to twice the sum which it
            proposes to withdraw from the Escrow Account, and the Purchaser
            shall upon request from time to time by the Sellers' Representative
            promptly provide reasonable evidence that it has incurred any such
            sums.

                                       24

      (D)   Following the first anniversary of the Completion Date and at and
            following such time as a determination by the Expert in accordance
            with clause 8.14 is received by the Purchaser and the Sellers'
            Representative (but not otherwise), the Purchaser shall, subject to
            sub-clause (C), be entitled to withdraw from the Escrow Account an
            amount representing 50 per cent, of the aggregate IPR Claim
            Liabilities it has incurred since the period from the first
            anniversary of the Completion Date, and thereafter 50 per cent, of
            any further IPR Claim Liabilities which are incurred by the
            Purchaser.

      (E)   To the extent that by reason of sums recovered by the Purchaser
            and/or any member of its Group from the person bringing the IPR
            Claim which are directly referable to that IPR Claim the amount
            actually contributed towards the IPR Claim Liabilities from the
            Escrow Account as a result of withdrawals by the Purchaser under
            this clause 8.12 exceeds 50 per cent of such IPR Claim Liabilities,
            the Purchaser shall procure that a payment is made promptly to the
            Seller's Agent on behalf of the Sellers and the Minor Sellers so
            that the aggregate amount contributed from the Escrow Amount does
            not exceed 50 per cent, of such IPR Claim Liabilities from time to
            time.

      (F)   For the avoidance of doubt neither clause 9 nor Schedule 4 shall
            apply to this clause 8.12.

8.13  Notwithstanding any other provision of this agreement and the Schedules to
      it, the Purchaser agrees that:

      (A)   it shall not be entitled to bring any claim for a breach of the
            Warranties or any of them to the extent that any such claim
            constitutes an IPR Claim; and

      (B)   the Sellers' sole liability and the Purchaser's sole remedy in
            respect of any IPR Claim shall be restricted to claims made pursuant
            to Clause 8.12 and not otherwise (save in the case of fraud on the
            part of any Seller) provided that the Purchaser shall remain
            entitled to terminate this agreement prior to Completion occurring
            if any IPR Claim should amount to a Material Adverse Effect.

8.14

      (A)   As soon as practicable following the notification by the Purchaser
            of an IPR Claim, the Purchaser and the Sellers' Representative shall
            meet (together with their respective counsel) with the intention of:

            (i)   agreeing upon procedures to establish an appropriate
                  proportion of the sum then held in the Escrow Account that
                  should, in accordance with the principles set out in this
                  clause, be retained in the Escrow Account following the first
                  anniversary of the Completion Date if the IPR Claim should not
                  by that time have given rise to a Settled Claim (the "RETAINED
                  AMOUNT");

            (ii)  subject to sub-clause (F), sharing information concerning the
                  IPR Claim;

                                       25
<PAGE>

            (iii) agreeing upon a law firm with expertise in the areas of law in
                  the jurisdiction relevant to the IPR Claim (an "EXPERT") who
                  shall, in the absence of agreement between the Purchaser and
                  the Sellers' Representative of the Retained Amount, be
                  instructed to advise the relevant members of the Purchaser's
                  Group and the Sellers' Representative jointly on the amount of
                  the Retained Amount.

      (B)   To the extent that at the first anniversary of the Completion Date:

            (i)   any IPR Claims have arisen that have not become Settled
                  Claims; and

            (ii)  the Purchaser and the Sellers' Representative have not agreed
                  the Retained Amount in respect of such IPR Claims,

            then, notwithstanding any other term of this agreement or the Escrow
            Agreement, no amount shall be released from the Escrow Account to
            either the Purchaser or the Sellers, the Purchaser shall cease to be
            entitled to withdraw sums from the Escrow Account in accordance with
            clause 8.12 pending determination of the applicable Retained Amount
            under this clause (after which point such right of withdrawal shall
            be as stated in clause 8.12(D)) and the Sellers' Representative
            shall be entitled to require that an Expert is instructed.

      (C)   The Expert shall be selected by the Purchaser, following
            consultation with the Sellers' Representative, within 10 Business
            Days of a request from the Sellers' Representative made on or after
            the first anniversary of the Completion Date.

      (D)   The terms of reference of the Expert shall be such as are agreed
            between the Purchaser and the Sellers' Representative (acting in
            good faith) but shall include that:

            (i)   the Expert should analyse the information available to the
                  Purchaser relating to each IPR Claim for which a Retained
                  Amount has not been agreed and seek the views of the Purchaser
                  and the Sellers' Representative (and their respective counsel)
                  on the merits of such IPR Claims;

            (ii)  the Expert, in light of the information available to him,
                  shall propose an amount that he believes should be reserved
                  from the Escrow Account on a reasonably prudent basis to meet
                  the IPR Claim Liabilities;

            (iii) the Expert shall act as an expert and not as an arbitrator and
                  his opinion of the quantum of the Retained Amount shall be
                  final and binding on the parties;

            (iv)  he shall be requested to provide his opinion as soon as
                  practicable following the date of his instruction and in any
                  event by no later than 90 Business Days following the date of
                  his instruction.

                                       26
<PAGE>

      (E)   Subject to sub-clause (F) below, the Purchaser shall procure that
            the Expert is provided promptly with all such information as he
            reasonably requests in relation to the IPR Claims which is available
            to the Purchaser or members of its Group and that the legal advisers
            to the relevant members of the Group co-operate with the Expert with
            respect to informing him of the status of and developments in
            respect of the IPR Claims.

      (F)   The procedures described in sub-clause (A)(i) to (iii) and the
            instructions to and terms of reference of the Expert set out in or
            established pursuant to this clause 8.14 shall not require the
            Purchaser or any member of its Group to disclose information to any
            person in circumstances where the privileged nature of such
            information may reasonably be concluded, on the basis of written
            legal advice obtained by the Purchaser from its external legal
            advisers, to be jeopardised. Where privilege may be so jeopardised,
            the Purchaser and the Sellers' Representative shall modify the
            process accordingly, whilst adhering as closely as possible to the
            principles established in this clause 8.14.

      (G)   The costs of the Expert shall be paid as to 50 per cent, out of the
            Escrow Account balance (and the Purchaser shall, and the Sellers
            shall procure that the Sellers' Representative shall, instruct the
            Escrow Agent to this effect) and as to 50 per cent, by the
            Purchaser.

8.15  Subject to clause 8.13, except as stated expressly in this clause, this
      clause and Schedule 4 (Limitations on liability) shall not limit any other
      clause of this agreement and in particular clause 18 (Remedies and
      waivers).

9.    NOTICE OF AND CONDUCT OF CLAIMS

9.1   If the Purchaser becomes aware of a matter which may give rise to any
      Claim or claim, action or demand against it or matter likely to give rise
      to any of these which may result in a Claim (other than a claim in respect
      of a breach of the Tax Warranties) (a "THIRD PARTY CLAIM"), the Purchaser
      shall as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter give notice thereof in
      writing to the Sellers' Representative, stating in reasonable detail the
      nature of the matter on a without prejudice basis, if practicable, the
      amount claimed, and the provisions of this agreement which the Purchaser
      alleges have been or may have been breached. The Purchaser shall give
      access to such books, records and personnel as the Sellers' Representative
      shall reasonably request.

9.2   If the Purchaser becomes aware of a Third Party Claim of which notice has
      been or may be given by the Purchaser under clause 9.1 the Purchaser
      shall, subject to being fully indemnified by the Sellers against all
      liabilities and reasonable costs incurred in doing so:

      (A)   take or procure such action to be taken as the Sellers'
            Representative shall reasonably request (having regard to the nature
            and size of the claim) to avoid, dispute, resist, appeal, compromise
            or defend such Third Party Claim or any adjudication in respect of a
            Third Party Claim;

                                       27
<PAGE>

      (B)   consult with the Sellers' Representative on all aspects of any
            proceedings in defence of a Third Party Claim;

      (C)   where the Sellers' Representative has confirmed that the matter
            giving rise to the Third Party Claim would be recoverable under the
            Warranties and the total amount of the Third Party Claim when
            aggregated with the amount of other claims notified exceeds the
            amount specified in paragraph 1 (A)(ii) of Schedule 4:

            (1)   not admit liability in respect of a Third Party Claim, nor
                  compromise, nor settle any proceedings in defence of a Third
                  Party Claim, without the written consent of the Sellers'
                  Representative (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld
                  or delayed); and

            (2)   ensure (or, as appropriate, shall co-operate to procure that
                  the Company shall ensure), at the request in writing of the
                  Sellers' Representative, that the Sellers are placed in a
                  position to take on or take over the conduct of all
                  proceedings and/or negotiations of whatsoever nature arising
                  in connection with the Third Party Claim in question and
                  provide (or, as appropriate, co-operate to procure that the
                  Company provides) such information and assistance as the
                  Sellers may reasonably require in connection with the
                  preparation for and conduct of such proceedings and/or
                  negotiations.

9.3   Nothing in sub-clause 9.1 or 9.2 shall restrict or limit the Purchaser's
      general obligation at law to mitigate a loss which it may incur as a
      result of a matter giving rise to a Claim.

9.4   Nothing in this clause 9 shall oblige the Purchaser or any member of the
      Purchaser's Group to take any steps or action or to procure or allow any
      steps or action to be taken that would be reasonably likely to have a
      prejudicial effect on any material corporate or business relationship, or
      on the business of the Purchaser's Group and the liability of the Sellers
      hereunder shall not be affected by any failure to mitigate loss resulting
      from any such determination made by the Purchaser in good faith.

10.   CONDUCT OF BUSINESS BEFORE COMPLETION

10.1  The Sellers will procure that, between the time of this agreement and
      Completion, each member of the Group will carry on business in the normal
      course and not do anything outside of the normal course without the
      consent in writing of the Purchaser (which shall not be unreasonably
      withheld). In particular, but without limitation, the matters listed in
      Schedule 6 (Conduct of business before Completion) shall require the prior
      consent in writing of the Purchaser.

10.2  The Purchaser acknowledges that the Company may satisfy all or any part of
      the Indebtedness on or before the Completion Date provided that the Net
      Working Capital of the Company does not fall below zero. The Sellers will
      procure that the Company will not do anything which will cause the Net
      Working Capital to fall below zero.

11.   SELLERS' REPRESENTATIVE AND SELLERS' AGENT

11.1  Each of the Sellers hereby agrees to appoint the Sellers' Representative,
      and the Sellers' Representative agrees to accept such appointment, as
      their respective attorney with full power and authority to act on their
      behalf (including by signing documents on their behalf) for all purposes
      and all circumstances contemplated by the Escrow Agreement and this
      agreement, including administering the rights of the Sellers under the
      Escrow Agreement and agreeing any Settled Claims in accordance with this
      agreement.

11.2  The Sellers hereby agree that the Sellers' Representative may enter into a
      written contract on terms to be agreed by them with the Sellers' Agent
      pursuant to which the Sellers' Agent may perform the functions
      contemplated by clause 2.9(A)(iv), clause 5.2 and certain other
      arrangements relating to the distribution of the Purchase Price and the
      Escrow Amount. If the written contract terminates for any reason prior to
      such functions being undertaken, the Sellers' Representative may enter
      into such other arrangements as he sees fit for the purposes of procuring
      that such activities are undertaken.

11.3  The Sellers' Representative shall have full authority to propose,
      negotiate and/or agree any modification to or variation of this agreement
      and the Escrow Agreement provided that any amendment to this agreement or
      the Escrow Agreement that may adversely affect the rights or obligations
      of any Seller under the Escrow Agreement shall require the prior written
      consent of such adversely affected Seller.

11.4  The Sellers' Representative shall use all reasonable efforts, based on
      contact information available to the Sellers' Representative, to keep the
      Sellers reasonably informed with respect to any claims against the Escrow
      Account. If at any time during the term of the Escrow Agreement the
      Sellers' Representative is likely to be absent from the United Kingdom for
      10 days or more, or otherwise is unable to act for any reason, he shall
      appoint an alternate by notice in writing to the Purchaser and to the
      Principal Sellers.

11.5  At any time during the term of the Escrow Agreement, the Sellers may
      appoint a new representative as the Sellers' Representative on 10 Business
      Days written notice to the new representative (copied to the Sellers'
      Representative) bearing the signatures of a majority of the Sellers.

11.6  If at any time the Sellers' Representative is unable or unwilling to act
      in his capacity as Sellers' Representative or resigns as Sellers'
      Representative, the Sellers may appoint a new representative as the
      Sellers' Representative on 10 Business Days written notice to the
      Purchaser (copied to the Sellers' Representative) bearing the signatures
      of a majority of the Sellers.

12.   RESTRICTIONS ON SELLERS' BUSINESS ACTIVITIES

      undertakes that he will not, either alone or in conjunction with or on
      behalf of any other person, do any of the following things:

                                       29

            agreement in competition with the business of any member of the
            Group as it is carried on at the date of Completion. This clause
            shall not prevent the holding of shares in a listed company for
            investment purposes only where such person does not exercise,
            directly or indirectly, any management function in the company
            concerned or any material influence in that company, which shall be
            taken to be the case if the shares do not confer more than five per
            cent, of the votes which could normally be cast at a general meeting
            of the company;

      (B)   disclose to any other person or use any information which is
            Confidential Business Information for so long as that information
            remains Confidential Business Information;

      (C)   without limitation to the provisions of this clause, in relation to
            a business which is competitive or likely to be competitive with the
            business of any member of the Group as carried on at the Completion
            Date, use any trade or business name or distinctive mark, style or
            logo used by or in the business of any member of the Group at any
            time during the two years before Completion or anything intended or
            likely to be confused with it;

      (D)   neither pending nor within two years after Completion, solicit the

                                       36

      for the attention of the Managing Director, Veritas Software Limited at

      Sellers shall be entitled by notice to the Purchaser to appoint a

      clause applying to service on an agent apply equally to service on a
      replacement agent.

      the Purchaser. Failure or delay in so doing shall not prejudice the
      effectiveness of service of the Service Document.

      courts of England and Wales/document relating to or in connection with any
      Proceedings.

            written policies (together with a description of any material
            unwritten policies) which apply to Group Employees are annexed to

            (ii)  the terms on which any Group Employee or director of any

            and such copies are true, complete and accurate in all material
            respects.

      (B)   There are 12 Contractors in total. The Disclosure Letter sets out
            all the terms on which each of these Contractors is engaged, and

      would require any member of the Group to give advance notice or provide
      severance pay or benefits upon termination of employment of any such
      employees. Each Contractor's engagement is terminable by the relevant
      member of the Group without any right to compensation on the date, or by
      giving the notice specified in, the disclosures against warranty 26.3(C).

26.6  No person other than a Group Employee or Contractor works in the business
      of any member of the Group. No Group Employee or Contractor is engaged
      (whether wholly or in part) to work outside the United Kingdom, the United
      States, Australia, the Netherlands, Denmark and Germany. The Disclosure
      Letter identifies which Group Employees and Contractors work in which
      jurisdiction.

      (B)   no change has been made in the terms of engagement of any
            Contractor,

      months from the date of this agreement.

26.9  (A)   No trade union, works council, staff association or other body
            representing employees is recognised in any way for bargaining,
            information or consultation purposes in relation to the Group
            Employees and there has neither been any request (whether verbal or
            written) for such recognition, nor, so far as each Management
            Warrantor is aware, is there any reason to expect such a request.

      (B)   No member of the Group is engaged or involved in any:

            (i)   formal dispute with any employee, or

            (ii)  dispute with any trade union, staff association or any other
                  body representing workers,

            and so far as each Management Warrantor is aware, there are no
            circumstances which may give rise to either of these things.

      (C)   No dispute has arisen within the last three years between any member
            of the Group and any group of employees or category of its employees
            (or any trade union, appropriate representatives or other body
            representing all or any of those employees).

26.10 No member of the Group has any outstanding undischarged liability to pay
      to any governmental or regulatory authority in any jurisdiction any
      contribution, Taxation or other impost arising in connection with the
      employment or engagement of personnel (including, without limitation,
      PAYE).

      administrative or criminal proceedings by or on behalf of any employee or
      former employee of any member of the Group including (without limitation)
      charges of unfair dismissal or labour practices or discrimination
      complaints are current or pending or (so far as each Management Warrantor
      is aware), threatened or expected.

26.12 No Group Employee will, as a result of the entering into of this Agreement
      or Completion, be entitled to receive any payment or benefit (including,
      without limitation, an enhanced severance package on a subsequent
      termination) or be entitled to treat either such event as amounting to a
      breach of his terms and conditions of employment or to treat himself as
      redundant or dismissed or released from any obligation.

26.13 No notice or communication has been given or statement or representation
      made by or on behalf of any member of the Group to any Group Employee
      concerning the sale and purchase of the Company or the Group which
      concerns or is reasonably likely to affect the employment of any Group
      Employee after Completion. Since the Accounts Date no amount has been paid
      or benefit provided to any employee or former employee other

                                       66

      than as required by the terms of that individual's service contract as
      disclosed in the Disclosure Letter. No member of the Group has promised to
      pay any amounts or provide any benefits to any employee or former employee
      where that promise may have given rise to an obligation to be satisfied on
      or after Completion other than to the extent required by the terms of that
      individual's service contract as disclosed in the Disclosure Letter.

26.14 Each member of the Group has complied at all times with all obligations
      owed to and in respect of its employees including under legislation,
      regulations, collective agreements and terms and conditions of employment.
      No liability has been incurred which remains outstanding by any member of
      the Group for breach of contract of employment or breach of applicable
      employment legislation. No member of the Group has in the last 12 months
      been a party to a relevant transfer (as defined in the Transfer of
      Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 1981).

26.15 A list of showing the total Group Employees (but not their names) who have
      been absent from work due to ill-health or injury for a total of 15 days
      or more over the 12 months prior to the date of this Agreement is set out
      in the Disclosure Letter. Each member of the Group has maintained records
      of terms and conditions of employment, payments of statutory sick pay and
      statutory maternity pay, PAYE and National Insurance deductions,
      disciplinary and health and safety matters, and records of working time,
      and all such records are adequate in all material respects. The Disclosure
      Letter details the periods of absence and any payments received or due to
      those Group Employees who are on long term sickness leave, maternity leave
      or other long term leave of absence and have a contractual or statutory
      right to return to work.

26.16 No member of the Group has ever had any dispute with an employee,
      director, former employee or former director or contractor or former
      contractor concerning:

      (A)   any actual or attempted competition or preparation to compete by
            that individual (whether on his own behalf or on behalf of any other
            person) with the business (or any part of the business) of any
            member of the Group, or

      (B)   any actual or attempted use or disclosure or preparation to use or
            disclose other than for the benefit of the Group any member of the
            Group's Intellectual Property, confidential information, trade
            secrets or business contacts (including customers, suppliers and
            staff).

26.17 No employee, director, contractor, former employee, former director or
      former contractor has ever claimed or disputed ownership of any member of
      the Group's Intellectual Property, confidential information (including,
      without limitation, business contacts) or trade secrets.

26.18 The Option Schemes have at all times complied with and been duly
      administered in accordance with and will until Completion continue to
      comply with and to be duly administered in accordance with, all applicable
      laws, regulations and requirements (including without limitation, the
      provisions of their governing documents). No options over shares in any
      member of the Group have been granted except under the rules of the Option
      Schemes. Schedule 7 (Ownership of the Securities) accurately details all

      outstanding options over shares in any member of the Group, showing who
      holds the options and whether they are vested or unvested, and the
      Disclosure Letter accurately details the terms to which they are subject
      (including without limitation the circumstances in which they become
      exercisable and their exercise price). All returns and notifications to
      the UK Inland Revenue or to tax authorities outside the UK which are
      required to be made in respect of the EMI options and any unapproved
      options have been duly made.

26.19 No claims or actions against any member of the Group under any worker's
      compensation policy or long-term disability policy are current or pending
      or (so far as each Management Warrantor is aware) threatened, or expected.

27.   THE ACCOUNTS AND TAX

27.1  No member of the Group has any liability in respect of Taxation (whether
      actual or contingent) that is not fully disclosed or provided for in the
      Accounts and, in particular, has no outstanding liability for:

      (A)   Taxation in any part of the world assessable or payable by reference
            to profits, gains, income, gross receipts or distributions earned,
            received or paid or arising or deemed to arise on or at any time
            prior to the Accounts Date or in respect of any period starting
            before the Accounts Date; or

      (B)   purchase, value added, sales or other similar tax in any part of the
            world referable to transactions effected on or before the Accounts
            Date

      that is not provided for in full in the Accounts.

27.2  The amount of the provision for deferred Taxation in the Accounts in
      respect of each member of the Group resident in the United Kingdom for Tax
      purposes was, at the Accounts Date, adequate and fully in accordance with
      accounting practices generally accepted in the United Kingdom and commonly
      adopted by companies carrying on businesses similar to those carried on by
      that member of the Group and, in particular, was in accordance with FRS 19
      (in the case of members of the Group incorporated in the United Kingdom).

27.3  If all facts and circumstances which are now known to each member of the
      Group or any of the Sellers had been known at the time the Accounts were
      drawn up, the provision for deferred Taxation that would be contained in
      the Accounts would be no greater than the provision which is so contained.

28.   TAX EVENTS SINCE THE ACCOUNTS DATE

      Since the Accounts Date:

      (A)   no member of the Group has declared, made or paid any distribution
            within the meaning of ICTA 1988;

      (B)   no accounting period of any member of the Group has ended;

<PAGE>

                                       68

      (C)   there has been no disposal of any asset (including trading stock) or
            supply of any service or business facility of any kind (including a
            loan of money or the letting, hiring or licensing of any property
            whether tangible or intangible) in circumstances where the
            consideration actually received or receivable for such disposal or
            supply was less than the consideration which could be deemed to have
            been received for tax purposes;

      (D)   no event has occurred which will give rise to a tax liability on any
            member of the Group (other than such member resident in the U.S. for
            Tax purposes) calculated by reference to deemed (as opposed to
            actual) income, profits or gains or which will result in any member
            of the Group becoming liable to pay or bear a tax liability directly
            or primarily chargeable against or attributable to another person,
            firm or company (other than any other member of the Group);

      (E)   no disposal has taken place or other event occurred which will or
            may have the effect of crystallising a liability to Taxation (other
            than in the U.S.) which should have been included in the provision
            for deferred Taxation contained in the Accounts if such disposal or
            other event had been planned or predicted at the Accounts Date;

      (F)   no member of the Group has made any payment or incurred any
            obligation to make a payment (in either case in excess of L20,000)
            which will not be deductible in computing trading profits for the
            purposes of corporation tax, or be deductible as a management
            expense of an investment company or a company with investment
            business;

      (G)   no member of the Group has been a party to any transaction for which
            any tax clearance provided for by statute has been or could have
            been obtained;

      (H)   no member of the Group has paid or become liable to pay or acted
            (directly or through an agent or other representative) in such
            manner as to incur a liability (or potential liability) to pay any
            interest or penalty in connection with any tax or otherwise paid any
            tax after its due date for payment or become liable to pay any tax
            the due date for payment of which has passed or become prospectively
            liable to pay any tax the due date for payment of which will arise
            in the 30 days after the date of this agreement.

29.   TAX RETURNS, DISPUTES, RECORDS AND CLAIMS, ETC.

29.1  Each member of the Group has made or caused to be made all proper returns
      required to be made, and has supplied or caused to be supplied all
      information required to be supplied, to any revenue authority, including
      (but without limitation) the Inland Revenue and H.M. Customs and Excise.

29.2  There are no disputes or disagreements which may in aggregate give rise to
      a liability to any member of the Group in excess of L20,000 outstanding
      nor are any contemplated at the date of this agreement with any revenue
      authority, including (but without limitation) the Inland Revenue and H.M.
      Customs and Excise, regarding liability or potential liability to any tax
      or duty (including in each case penalties or interest)

<PAGE>

                                       69

      recoverable from any member of the Group or regarding the availability of
      any relief from tax or duty to any member of the Group and there are no
      circumstances which make it likely that any such disputes or disagreements
      will commence.

29.3  The Company or one or more other members of the Group has sufficient
      records relating to past events, including any elections made, to
      calculate the tax liability or relief which would arise on any disposal or
      on the realisation of any material asset owned at the Accounts Date by any
      member of the Group or acquired by any such member since that date but
      before Completion.

29.4  Each member of the Group has duly submitted all claims and disclaimers or
      withdrawals of claims which have been assumed to have been made for the
      purposes of the Accounts.

29.5  The amount of tax chargeable on any member of the Group during any
      accounting period ended on or within six years before the Accounts Date
      has not, to any material extent, depended on any concession, agreement or
      other formal or informal arrangement with any revenue authority, including
      (but without limitation) the Inland Revenue or H.M. Customs and Excise.

29.6  No member of the Group has received any notice from any revenue authority,
      including (but without limitation) the Inland Revenue, which required or
      will or may require such member to withhold tax from any payment made
      since the Accounts Date or which will or may be made after the date of
      this agreement.

29.7  No member of the Group has been a member of an affiliated, consolidated,
      combined or unitary group.

29.8  No member of the Group which is a U.S. corporation is a party to, or has
      "participated", within the meaning of U.S. Treasury Regulations section
      1.6011-4(c)(3), in a "listed transaction" within the meaning of U.S.
      Treasury Regulations Section 1.6011-4(b)(2).

29.9  During the five-year period ending on the date hereof, no member of the
      Group was a distributing corporation or a controlled corporation in a
      transaction intended to be governed by Section 355 of the Code.

29.10 No election has been made under U.S. Treasury Regulations Section 1.7701-3
      or any similar provision of U.S. state or local Tax law to treat any
      member of the Group as an association, corporation or partnership, and no
      member of the Group is disregarded as an entity for U.S. federal, state or
      local Tax purposes.

29.11 No claim has been made by any revenue authority in a jurisdiction where
      the members of the Group do not file Tax returns that the Company is or
      may be subject to Taxation in that jurisdiction.

      stamping of which is required in order to establish or enforce a right for
      any member of the Group have been duly stamped.

30.2  Since the Accounts Date no member of the Group has incurred any liability
      to stamp duty reserve tax.

31.   VALUE ADDED TAX

31.1  Each of the Company and KVS Limited is treated for the purposes of section
      43 VATA 1994 as a member of a group of companies (the "VAT Group") of
      which the representative member is the Company (the "Representative
      Member") and no company which is not a member of the Group is a member of
      the VAT Group nor has any such company been a member of the VAT Group
      within the last six years.

31.2  The Representative Member has made, given, obtained and kept full,
      complete, correct and up-to-date returns, records, invoices and other
      documents appropriate or required for the purposes of VATA 1994 and is not

      Date, been registered for the purposes of VATA 1994 otherwise than as part
      of the VAT Group referred to in paragraph 31.1 above and no such member
      has, within that period, been a member of any other group for the purposes
      of VATA 1994.

31.5  Full details of any claim made by the Representative Member for bad debt
      relief under section 36 VATA 1994 have been disclosed in the Disclosure
      Letter.

31.6  There is no land in which any member of the Group has an interest, or over
      which any member of the Group has a right, or which any member of the
      Group has a licence to occupy, that is (in any such case) land in relation
      to which an election made under paragraph 2 of Schedule 10 to VATA 1994
      ("election to waive exemption") has effect or will have effect so as (in
      either such case) to render any supply made by any member of the Group of,
      or in respect of, any interest in, right over or licence to occupy such
      land a supply that will be taxable at the standard rate of VAT or (as the
      case may be) a supply that would be so taxable but for any disapplication
      of such election in circumstances prescribed by relevant provisions of
      VATA 1994.

31.7  The Disclosure Letter contains full details of any assets of each member
      of the Group to which the provisions of Part XV Value Added Tax

            of years), date of acquisition and cost of the asset; and

      (B)   the proportion of input tax for which credit has been claimed
            (either provisionally or finally in a tax year and stating which).

31.8  Neither the Representative Member nor any other member of the Group has,
      at any time within the last six years, acted as agent of any person not
      resident in the United Kingdom for the purposes of section 47 VATA 1994 or
      been appointed as a VAT representative of any person for the purposes of
      section 48 VATA 1994.

31.9  No member of the Group (other than the Company and KVS Limited) is
      registered for the purposes of VATA 1994 or is required to be so
      registered or has at anytime within the last six years been required to be
      so registered.

32.   DUTIES, ETC.

      All VAT, import duty and other Taxes or charges payable to H.M. Customs
      and Excise upon the importation of goods and all excise duties or taxes of
      a similar nature payable to H.M. Customs and Excise or any other revenue
      authority in respect of any assets (including trading stock) imported,
      owned or used by any member of the Group have been paid in full.

33.   TAX ON DISPOSAL OF ASSETS

      On a disposal of all its assets by any member of the Group for:

      (A)   in the case of each asset owned by that member of the Group at the
            Accounts Date, a consideration equal to the value attributed to that
            asset in preparing the Accounts; or

      (B)   in the case of each asset acquired since the Accounts Date, a
            consideration equal to the consideration given for the acquisition

            then either:

            (i)   in respect of any asset falling within (A) above, the
                  liability to tax (if any) which would be incurred by that
                  member of the Group in respect of that asset would not exceed
                  the amount taken into account in respect of that asset in
                  computing the maximum liability to deferred Taxation as stated
                  in the Accounts; or

            (ii)  in respect of any asset within (B) above, no tax liability

35.   NON-DEDUCTIBLE REVENUE OUTGOINGS

      No member of the Group is under any obligation to make any future payment
      (i) which has been taken into account in preparing the Accounts and is of
      a type which is currently treated as a deductible revenue outgoing or (ii)
      of a revenue nature which has not been taken into account in preparing the
      Accounts, provided that in either (i) or (ii) the payment is in excess of
      L20,000, which will be prevented (whether on the grounds of being a
      distribution or for any other reason) from being deductible for
      corporation tax purposes, whether as a deduction in computing the profits
      of a trade or as an expense of management or as a charge on income or as a
      non-trading debit under Chapter II Part IV Finance Act 1996, by reason of
      any statutory provision, other than section 74(1)(f) ICTA 1988 (capital).

36.   DEDUCTIONS AND WITHHOLDINGS

      Each member of the Group has made all deductions in respect, or on
      account, of any tax from any payments made by it which it is obliged or
      entitled to make and has accounted in full to the appropriate authority
      for all amounts so deducted.

37.   INTRA-GROUP TRANSACTIONS

      No member of the Group has, at any time within the last six years,
      acquired any asset from any other company (including another member of the
      Group) which was, at the time of the acquisition, a member of the same
      group of companies as that member for the purposes of section 171 of the
      TCGA 1992.

38.   RESIDENCE

38.1  The country which is given in Schedule 14 (Basic information about the
      Company) or Schedule 15 (Basic Information about the Subsidiaries) as the
      tax residence of the Company or any other member of the Group is the only
      country whose tax authorities seek to charge tax on the worldwide profits
      or gains of the Company for that member of the Group.

38.2  No member of the Group has ever paid tax on income, profits or gains to
      any tax authority in any other country except that mentioned in Schedule
      14 (Basic Information about the Company) or Schedule 15 (Basic information
      about the Subsidiaries) other than, in respect of any member of the Group
      resident in the U.S. for Tax purposes, amounts in respect of withholding
      tax.

39.   GROUP ARRANGEMENTS

39.1  The person specified as shareholder in Schedule 15 (Basic information
      about the Subsidiaries) which relates to each member of the Group (apart
      from the Company) is the beneficial owner of all the shares in that member
      of the Group and no such shares are held such that any profit on the sale
      of those shares would be a trading receipt.

39.2  There are no circumstances by virtue of which section 410 or 413 ICTA 1988
      would prevent each member of the Group being treated as a member of the
      same group of

<PAGE>

                                       73

      companies as each other such member for the purposes of Chapter IV Part X
      ICTA 1988 for any accounting period commencing on or before the date of
      this agreement.

39.3  No member of the Group resident in the United Kingdom for Tax purposes has
      made any surrender of or claim for (i) group relief or (ii) a refund of
      tax within section 102 Finance Act 1989 which involves any company which
      is not a member of the Group.

39.4  No member of the Group resident in the United Kingdom for Tax purposes has
      received any payment in respect of a surrender of group relief or of a tax
      refund which could, in any circumstances, be due to be repaid to any
      company other than another member of the Group.

40.   NON-ARM'S LENGTH TRANSACTIONS

      No member of the Group is a party to any transaction or arrangement under
      which it may be required to pay for any asset or services or facilities of
      any kind an amount which is in excess of the market value of that asset or
      services or facilities or will receive any payment for any asset or
      services or facilities of any kind that it has supplied or provided or is
      liable to supply or provide which is less than the market value of that
      asset or services or facilities.

41.   PENSIONS

41.1  Other than pursuant to the disclosed terms of the Pension Schemes and the
      US Employee Plans listed in the disclosures against warranty 41.8, there
      is no arrangement to which any member of the Group contributes or pays or
      is or may be required to contribute or pay or under which any member of
      the Group has any liability (whether such liability is actual, contingent
      or future) under which benefits of any kind (including without limitation,
      post-retirement medical benefits) are payable to or in respect of any
      person on retirement, death or disability or on the attainment of a
      specified age or on the completion of a specified period of service or at
      any time following retirement. Without limitation, no member of the Group
      has at any time participated in any pension scheme (whether or not a
      Pension Scheme) in respect of which it may be required to make a payment
      pursuant to Section 75 of the UK Pensions Act 1995, or otherwise as a
      result of the value of the scheme's liabilities exceeding the value of the
      scheme's assets.

41.2  No member of the Group has any obligation (whether actual, contingent or
      future) in relation to a Pension Scheme other than to pay contributions at
      the fixed rate shown in the Disclosure Letter in respect of those of its
      employees from time to time who are members of the Pension Scheme and no
      individual has or ever has had any entitlement or prospective right to
      benefits under a Pension Scheme other than to such benefits (if any) as
      may be purchased on the open market in exchange for the assets derived
      from those contributions in respect of the individual or from
      contributions made by the individual himself; in particular, no individual
      is entitled to benefits under a Pension Scheme calculated by reference to
      salary or earnings. No one other than Michael Hedger is or ever has been a
      member of the Kilo Software Directors Pension Trust, and other than on and
      in respect of his death no other person has or ever has had any right

<PAGE>

                                       74

      to benefit from that arrangement. The Kilo Software Directors Pension
      Trust is not contracted-out.

41.3  All the governing documents of the Pension Schemes (showing, without
      limitation, the terms on which employer and employee contributions must be
      paid) are scheduled to the Disclosure Letter as are all communications
      with members of the Pension Schemes which are not reflected in those
      governing documents, all agreements with insurance companies relating to
      the Pension Schemes, and any other material which would be required for a
      pension lawyer to make an informed assessment of each member of the
      Group's liabilities or potential liabilities in connection with each
      Pension Scheme. All employee communication material issued by or on behalf
      of any member of the Group (including without limitation, material
      relating to investment options under any group personal pension
      arrangement contributed to by any member of the Group) in relation to any
      Pension Scheme has at all times been true, complete and not misleading in
      all material respects and there have been no complaints concerning the
      administration of member requests to switch investment options under any
      Pension Scheme.

41.4  All contributions due from any member of the Group to the Pension Schemes
      have been made on or by the date due for payment and no member of the
      Group. The Kilo Software plc Death in Service Scheme governed by a trust
      deed dated 6 February 2002 (as amended) and the Group Income Protection
      Plan with Friends Provident (Policy No. G16718) are both exempt approved
      schemes. All benefits payable to or in respect of any employee of any
      member of the Group under the Kilo Software plc Death in Service Scheme
      governed by a trust deed dated 6 February 2002 (as amended) and the Group
      Income Protection Plan with Friends Provident (Policy No. G16718) are
      fully insured with and administered by an insurance company and no member
      of the Group has any administrative or compliance obligations or potential
      liabilities whatsoever in relation to any of the Pension Schemes (other
      than to pay fixed rate premiums and contributions at the rate set out in
      the Disclosure Letter). No member of the Group has done or omitted to do
      anything whereby any policy of insurance which insures any employee
      benefits may be avoided.

41.5  To the extent that any failure to do so might reasonably be expected to
      give rise to a liability on any member of the Group, the Pension Schemes
      have at all times complied with and been duly administered in accordance
      with and will until Completion continue to comply with and to be duly
      administered in accordance with, all applicable laws, regulations and
      requirements (including without limitation, the provisions of their
      governing documents). Each employee of each member of the Group (whether
      engaged on a full-time contract, a part-time contract, a fixed term
      contract or a permanent contract) is and has always been eligible to
      participate in the Pension Schemes on the same terms and basis as each
      other such employee.

41.6  No agreements undertakings or assurances have been given to any past,
      present or prospective officer or employee of any member of the Group as
      to the continuance, introduction, increase or improvement of any
      retirement, death or disability benefits.

41.7  There are not in respect of any of the Pension Schemes or the benefits
      thereunder any actions, suits or claims except for claims for benefits in
      the ordinary course pending or

<PAGE>

                                       75

      threatened in any forum, and so far as the Principal Sellers are aware
      there are no grounds on which to expect any such actions, suits or claims.

41.8  The Sellers have provided or made available to the Purchaser in the
      Disclosure Letter correct and complete copies of:

      (i)   all documents embodying each US Employee Plan, other than
            legally-mandated plans, programs and arrangements and each
            Employment Agreement including (without limitation) all amendments
            thereto and all related trust documents, administrative service
            agreements, group annuity contract, group insurance contracts,
