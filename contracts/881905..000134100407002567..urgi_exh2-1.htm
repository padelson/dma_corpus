**AGREEMENT  AND PLAN OF MERGER**

 

 

This  AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of September 10, 2007 (this  "
_Agreement_ "), is among Redcats USA, Inc., a Delaware corporation  ("
_Parent_ "), Boulevard Merger Sub, Inc., a newly formed Delaware  corporation
and a wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "), and  United
Retail Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the  " _Company_ "). Certain
capitalized terms used in this Agreement  are as defined in Section 8.11.

 

 

WHEREAS,  it is proposed that, on the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in  this Agreement, Merger Sub shall commence a cash tender offer (such
tender  offer, as it may be extended, amended and supplemented from time to
time as  permitted by this Agreement, the " _Offer_ ") to purchase all of the
issued  and outstanding shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share,
of the  Company (the " _Company Common Stock_ "), together with the
associated  Company Rights, at a price per share equal to $13.70, net to the
sellers in  cash  (such amount or any greater amount per share paid pursuant
to the Offer, the  " _Offer Price_ ");

 

 

WHEREAS,  it is proposed that, on the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in  this Agreement, following the consummation of the Offer, Merger Sub
shall merge  with and into the Company with the Company surviving as a wholly
owned  subsidiary of Parent (the " _Merger_ "), pursuant to which each
outstanding  share of Company Common Stock shall be converted into the right
to receive  the  Offer Price, except for (i) shares of Company Common Stock
to be canceled  pursuant to Section 2.7(b) and (ii) Dissenting Shares;

 

 

WHEREAS,  the respective Boards of Directors of the Company, Parent and
Merger Sub deem  it  advisable and in the best interests of their respective
stockholders that the  parties consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including  the Offer and the Merger, upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set  forth  in this Agreement;

 

 

WHEREAS,  the respective Boards of Directors of the Company, Parent (on its
own behalf  and  as the sole direct or indirect stockholder of Merger Sub),
and Merger Sub have  approved this Agreement and resolved that the
transactions contemplated by  this  Agreement are advisable and in the best
interests of their respective  stockholders, including the consummation of
the Offer and the Merger, upon  the  terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement and in  accordance with the relevant provisions of
the General Corporation Law of the  State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ ");

 

 

WHEREAS,  the Board of Directors of the Company resolved to recommend that
the holders  of  Company Common Stock (the " _Company Stockholders_ ")
accept the Offer,  tender their shares of Company Common Stock in the Offer,
and, to the extent  required by applicable Law, approve the Merger and adopt
this Agreement and  the  transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(including the Offer and the  Merger), in each case, upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth  in  this Agreement;

 

 

WHEREAS,  concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, the Company has
entered  into  employment agreement amendments with certain executive
officers of the Company,  to be in effect as of the Acceptance Time (the "
_Employment Agreements_ "),  a copy of which Employment Agreements are
attached as Annex B to this Agreement;  and

 

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

WHEREAS,  concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, Parent, the
Company and  Raphael Benaroya have entered into a share tender agreement,
dated as of the  date of this Agreement (the " _Tender Agreement_ "),
pursuant to which Mr.  Benaroya agrees to tender his shares of Company Common
Stock in the Offer,  a  copy of which Tender Agreement is attached as Annex
C to this  Agreement.

 

 

NOW,  THEREFORE, in consideration of the representations, warranties,
covenants and  agreements contained in this Agreement, the receipt and
adequacy of which are  acknowledged, and intending to be legally bound,
Parent, Merger Sub and the  Company agree as follows:

 

 

**ARTICLE  I**

 

 

**_THE  OFFER_**

 

 

Section  1.1 _The Offer_.

 

 

(a) Provided  that this Agreement shall not have been terminated in
accordance with Article  VII and none of the events or conditions set forth
in Annex A (other than clause  (e) of Annex A) shall have occurred and be
existing and shall not have been  waived in writing by Parent or Merger Sub
(the conditions set forth in Annex  A,  the " _Tender Offer Conditions_ "),
Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause  Merger Sub to, commence (within the
meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the U.S.  Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended (together with its rules and  regulations, the " _Exchange Act_ "))
the Offer, as promptly as reasonably  practicable after the date of this
Agreement and in any event within 15 Business  Days after the date of this
Agreement. Without the prior written  consent of the Company, Merger Sub
shall not (i) decrease the Offer Price or  change the form of consideration
payable in the Offer, (ii) decrease the number  of shares of Company Common
Stock sought to be purchased in the Offer, (iii)  impose conditions to the
Offer in addition to the Tender Offer  Conditions or amend any condition in a
manner that is adverse to the  holders of Company Common Stock, (iv) waive or
amend the Minimum Condition  (v) extend the Expiration Date (as defined
below) except as required or  permitted by this Section 1.1, or (vi) make any
other change to the terms of  the  Offer in a manner that is materially
adverse to the holders of Company Common  Stock; _provided_ that Merger Sub
expressly reserves the right to  increase the Offer Price and to waive any of
the Tender Offer Conditions other  than the Minimum Condition. The Company
agrees that no shares of  Company Common Stock held by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries will be  tendered in the Offer except for Company Common
Stock held in respect of the  Company\'s Supplemental Retirement Savings
Plan.

 

 

(b) Merger  Sub shall file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
(the  " _SEC_ ") a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with respect to the
Offer  on the date that the Offer is commenced, which Tender Offer Statement
shall  include an offer to purchase, form of transmittal letter and form of
notice  of  guaranteed delivery (together with any supplements or amendments
thereto,  collectively, the " _Offer Documents_ ") and, subject to the
Company\'s  compliance with Section 1.2(c), cause the Offer Documents to be
disseminated  to  the Company Stockholders in accordance with the applicable
requirements of  the  Exchange Act. The Offer Documents shall comply in all
material respects with  the  Exchange Act and, on the

 

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

date  first filed with the SEC and on the date first published, sent or given
to  the  Company Stockholders and on the Acceptance Date, shall not contain
any untrue  statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to  be  stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light  of  the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading, except that no  covenant, agreement, representation or warranty
is made by Parent or Merger  Sub  with respect to information supplied by
the Company for inclusion or  incorporation by reference in the Offer
Documents. The Company,  Parent and Merger Sub each agree promptly to correct
any information provided  by  it for use in the Offer Documents if and to
the extent that it shall have become  false or misleading in any material
respect, and Parent further agrees to take  all steps necessary to cause the
Offer Documents as so corrected to be filed  with the SEC and disseminated to
the Company Stockholders to the extent required  by applicable Law. The
Company shall promptly furnish to Parent and  Merger Sub all information
concerning the Company that is required or reasonably  requested by Parent or
Merger Sub in connection with the obligations relating  to  the Offer
Documents contained in this Section 1.1(b). The Company and  its counsel
shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on  the 
Schedule TO and the Offer Documents each time sufficiently in advance of any 
such document being filed with the SEC, and Parent and Merger Sub shall give 
reasonable and good faith consideration to any comments made by the Company 
and  its counsel. Parent and Merger Sub shall provide the Company and its 
counsel with (i) any comments or other communications, whether written or
oral,  that Parent, Merger Sub or their counsel may receive from time to time
from  the  SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule TO or Offer
Documents  promptly after receipt of those comments or other communications
and (ii) a  reasonable opportunity to participate in the response of Parent
and Merger  Sub  to those comments and to provide comments on that response
(to which reasonable  and good-faith consideration shall be given), including
by participating with  Parent and Merger Sub or their counsel in any
discussions or meetings with  the  SEC.

 

 

(c) Subject  to the terms and conditions set forth in the Offer Documents,
the Offer shall  remain open until midnight, New York City time, at the end
of the twentieth  (20th) Business Day after the date that the Offer is
commenced (the  " _Expiration Date_ "), unless the period of time for which
the Offer is open  shall have been extended pursuant to, and in accordance
with, this Section  1.1(c) or as may be required by applicable Law, in which
event the term  "Expiration Date" shall mean the latest time and date as the
Offer, as so  extended may expire. If any of the conditions of the Offer are
not satisfied  or  waived on any Expiration Date, Merger Sub shall extend
the Offer from time  to  time for one or more periods of time up to 10
Business Days (or such longer  period as the Company may agree in writing)
per extension until such conditions  of the Offer have been satisfied or
waived; _provided_ that  Merger Sub shall not be required to extend the Offer
after 150  days following the date that the Offer is commenced. Merger Sub 
shall extend the Offer for any period required by any rule, regulation, 
interpretation or position of the SEC or its staff applicable to the Offer. 
Merger Sub shall not extend the Offer if all of the conditions of the  Offer
are satisfied or waived and it is permitted under applicable Law to accept 
for payment and pay for tendered shares. If all of the Tender Offer 
Conditions are satisfied but the number of shares of Company Common Stock
that  have been validly tendered and not withdrawn in the Offer and accepted
for  payment, together with any shares of Company Common Stock then owned by
Parent,  is less than 90% of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock,
Merger  Sub  may, without the consent of the Company, commence a subsequent
offering  period (as provided in Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act) for
three (3) to  twenty (20) Business Days to acquire outstanding shares of
Company Common  Stock.

 

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

(d) Subject  to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and to
satisfaction  or  waiver of the Tender Offer Conditions, Merger Sub shall,
and Parent shall cause  it to, as soon as practicable after the Expiration
Date, accept for payment  and  pay for all shares of Company Common Stock
that have been validly tendered  and  not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer.
If Merger Sub shall commence a  subsequent offering period in connection with
the Offer, Merger Sub shall  accept for payment and pay for all additional
shares of Company Common Stock  validly tendered during such subsequent
offering period.

 

 

(e) Merger  Sub shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise  payable pursuant to the Offer (or in connection with
any subsequent offering  period) any such amounts as are required to be
deducted and withheld with  respect to the making of such payment under the

provision of state, local or  foreign tax Law.

 

 

Section  1.2 _Company  Action_.

 

 

(a) The  Company approves of and consents to the Offer, and represents and
warrants  that  the Board of Directors of the Company, at a meeting duly
called and held, has,  subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this
Agreement, unanimously  (i)  approved this Agreement, and deemed this
Agreement, the Offer, the Merger and  the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement advisable, fair to and in the  best interests of the Company
Stockholders; (ii) approved this Agreement and  the  transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including the Offer and the Merger,  in all
respects, and such approval constitutes approval of the Offer, the  Merger,
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement  and  the
Tender Agreements for purposes of Section 203 of the DGCL and the Company\'s 
Rights Plan; and (iii) resolved to recommend that the Company Stockholders 
accept the Offer, tender their shares of Company Common Stock in the Offer, 
and,  to the extent required by applicable Law, approve the Merger and adopt
this  Agreement (the " _Company Recommendation_ "). The Company consents  to
the inclusion of such approval and the Company Recommendation in the Offer 
Documents, subject to Section 5.3(b).

 

 

(b) The  Company agrees to file with the SEC, as soon as reasonably
practicable on the  day that the Offer is commenced, a
Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on  Schedule 14D-9 pertaining to the
Offer (together with any amendments or  supplements thereto, the " _Schedule
14D-9_ ") that, subject to Section  5.3(b), contains the Company
Recommendation and to promptly mail the Schedule  14D-9 to the Company
Stockholders together with the Offer Documents and cause  the Offer Documents
and the Schedule 14D-9 to be disseminated to the Company  Stockholders in
accordance with the applicable requirements of the Exchange  Act. The
Schedule 14D-9 shall comply in all material respects with  the Exchange Act
and, on the date filed with the SEC and on the date first  published or sent
or given to the Company Stockholders and on the Acceptance  Date, shall not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to  state  any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make 
the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were 
made, not misleading, except that no covenant, agreement, representation or 
warranty is made by the Company with respect to the information supplied by 
Parent or Merger Sub for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the
Schedule  14D-9. The Company, Parent and Merger Sub each agree promptly to
correct  any information provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9 if
and  to

 

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

the  extent that it shall have become false or misleading in any material
respect,  and the Company further agrees to take all steps necessary to cause
the Schedule  14D-9 as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and disseminated
to the Company  Stockholders to the extent required by applicable Law. Parent
and  Merger Sub shall promptly furnish to the Company all information
concerning  Parent and Merger Sub that is required or reasonably requested by
Company in  connection with the obligations relating to the Schedule 14D-9
contained in  this  Section 1.2(b). Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel
shall be given a  reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the
Schedule 14D-9 each time  sufficiently in advance of its filing with the SEC,
and the Company shall give  reasonable and good faith consideration to any
comments made by Parent, Merger  Sub or their counsel. The Company shall
provide Parent and its  counsel with (i) any comments or other
communications, whether written or oral,  that the Company or its counsel may
receive from time to time from the SEC  or  its staff with respect to the
Schedule 14D-9 promptly after receipt of  those comments or other
communications and (ii) a reasonable opportunity to  participate in the
response of the Company to those comments and to provide  comments on that
response (to which reasonable and good-faith consideration  shall be given),
including by participating with the Company or its counsel  in  any
discussions or meetings with the SEC.

 

 

(c) In  connection with the Offer, the Company promptly will furnish (or
cause its  transfer agent to furnish) Parent and Merger Sub with mailing
labels, security  position listings and any available listing or computer
files containing the  names and addresses of the Company Stockholders, each
as of a recent date,  and  shall furnish Merger Sub with such additional
information and assistance  (including updated lists of the Company
Stockholders, mailing labels and lists  of securities positions) as Merger
Sub or its agents may reasonably request  in  communicating the Offer (and
the Offer Documents, including all amendments  and  supplements to the Offer
Documents) to the record and beneficial holders of  shares of Company Common
Stock. Except as required by applicable Law,  and except as necessary to
communicate the Offer, the Merger or the transactions  contemplated by this
Agreement to the Company Stockholders, Parent and Merger  Sub (and their
respective representatives) shall hold in confidence the  information
contained in any such labels, listings and files, shall use such  information
solely in connection with the Offer and the Merger, and,  if this Agreement
is terminated or the Offer is otherwise terminated, shall  promptly deliver
or cause to be delivered to the Company or destroy all copies  of such
information, labels, listings and files then in their possession or  in  the
possession of their agents or representatives.

 

 

(d) The  Company grants to Parent and Merger Sub an irrevocable option (the "
_Merger  Option_ ") to purchase up to that number of newly issued shares of
Company  Common Stock (the " _Merger Option Shares_ ") equal to the number of
shares  of Company Common Stock that, when added to the number of shares of
Company  Common Stock owned by Parent and Merger Sub immediately following
consummation  of the Offer, shall constitute one share more than 90% of the
shares of Company  Common Stock then outstanding on a fully diluted basis
(after giving effect  to  the issuance of the Merger Option Shares) for
consideration per Merger Option  Share equal to the Offer Price.

 

 

(e) The  Merger Option shall be exercisable only after the purchase of and
payment for  shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer by Parent
or Merger Sub  as  a result of which Parent and Merger Sub own beneficially
at least  80% **** of the outstanding shares of Company Common  Stock. The
Merger Option shall not be exercisable if the  number

 

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

of  shares of Company Common Stock subject thereto exceeds the number of
authorized  shares of Company Common Stock available for issuance.

 

 

(f) In  the event that Parent or Merger Sub wish to exercise the Merger
Option, Merger  Sub shall give the Company one (1) Business Day\'s prior
written notice  specifying the number of shares of Company Common Stock that
are owned by Parent  and Merger Sub immediately following consummation of the
Offer and specifying  a  place and a time for the closing of the purchase.
The Company shall,  as soon as practicable following receipt of such notice,
deliver written notice  to Merger Sub specifying the number of Merger Option
Shares. At the  closing of the purchase of the Merger Option Shares, Parent
or Merger Sub shall  pay to the Company an amount equal to the product of (i)
the number of shares  of  Company Common Stock purchased pursuant to the
Merger Option, multiplied by  (ii)  the Offer Price, which amount shall be
paid in cash (by wire transfer or  cashier\'s check) or, at the election of
Parent or Merger Sub, by delivery of  a  promissory note having full
recourse to Parent.

 

 

Section  1.3 _Board of  Directors_.

 

 

(a) Subject  to compliance with applicable Law, promptly upon the acceptance
for payment  of  shares of Company Common Stock by Parent or Merger Sub or
any of their  affiliates pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of the
Offer (the  " _Acceptance_ _Time_ ") and from time to time thereafter, and
subject  to Section 1.3(c), Merger Sub shall be entitled to designate up to
such number  of directors, rounded to the nearest whole number constituting
at least a  majority of the directors, on the Board of Directors of the
Company as will  give  Merger Sub representation on the Board of Directors
of the Company equal to  the  product of the number of directors on the
Board of Directors of the Company  (giving effect to any increase in the
number of directors pursuant to this  Section 1.3) and the percentage that
the number of shares of Company Common  Stock beneficially owned by Parent or
its Affiliates bears to the total number  of shares of Company Common Stock
then outstanding, and the Company shall use  reasonable best efforts to, upon
Parent\'s request, promptly, at Parent\'s  election, either increase the size
of the Board of Directors of the Company  or  seeking and accepting the
resignation of such number of directors as is  necessary to enable Parent\'s
designees to be elected to the Board of Directors  of the Company and to
cause Parent\'s designees to be so elected. At  such times, subject to
Section 1.3(c), the Company will cause individuals  designated by Parent to
constitute such number of members of each committee  of  the Board of
Directors of the Company, rounded up to the next whole number,  that 
represents the same percentage as such individuals represent on the Board of 
Directors of the Company, other than any committee of the Board of Directors 
of  the Company established to take action under this Agreement which
committee  shall be composed only of Independent Directors (as defined in
Section  1.3(c)).

 

 

(b) The  Company\' obligation to appoint designees to the Board of Directors
of the  Company shall be subject to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and
Rule 14f-1  under the Exchange Act. The Company shall promptly take all
action  required pursuant to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1
under  the  Exchange Act in order to fulfill its obligations under this
Section  1.3, and shall include in the Schedule 14D-9 such information with
respect  to  the Company and its officers and directors as is required
pursuant to such  Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 under the
Exchange Act in  order  to fulfill its obligations under this Section 1.3
and the U.S. federal  securities Laws. Parent shall provide to the Company,

 

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

6  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

and  shall be solely responsible for, the information and consents with
respect  to  Parent and its designees, officers, directors and affiliates
required by Section  14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 under the
Exchange Act.

 

 

(c) In  the event that Parent\'s designees are elected or designated to the
Board of  Directors of the Company, then, until the Effective Time, the
Company shall  cause the Board of Directors of the Company to have at least
two (2) directors  who are (i) directors on the date of this Agreement and 
(ii) independent directors for purposes of the continued listing 
requirements of the Nasdaq Global Market (" _NASDAQ_ ") (such directors,  the
" _Independent Directors_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that, if  any
Independent Director is unable to serve due to death or disability or any 
other reason (including as a result of removal for cause pursuant to the
last  sentence of this Section 1.3(c)), the remaining Independent Directors
shall  be  entitled to elect or designate another individual (or
individuals) who serve(s)  as a director (or directors) on the date of this
Agreement ( _provided_ that  no such individual is an employee of the Company
or its subsidiaries) to fill  the vacancy, and such director (or directors)
shall be deemed to be an  Independent Director (or Independent Directors) for
purposes of this  Agreement. If no Independent Director remains prior to the
Effective  Time, a majority of the members of the Board of Directors of the
Company at  the  time of the execution of this Agreement shall be entitled
to designate two  (2)  persons to fill such vacancies; _provided_ that such
individuals shall not  be employees or officers of the Company, Parent or
Merger Sub and shall be  reasonably satisfactory to Parent, and such persons
shall be deemed Independent  Directors for purposes of this Agreement.
Following the Acceptance  Time and prior to the Effective Time, Parent and
Merger Sub shall not cause  any  amendment or termination of this Agreement,
any extension by the Company of  the  time for the performance of any of the
obligations or other acts of Merger  Sub  or Parent or waiver of any of the
Company\'s rights under this Agreement or  other  action adversely affecting
the rights of the Company Stockholders (other than  Parent or Merger Sub), to
be effected without the affirmative vote of a majority  of the Independent
Directors. Following the Acceptance Time and prior  to the Effective Time,
neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall take any action  to  remove any
Independent Director unless the removal shall be for  cause.

as soon as  practicable on the Closing Date, the parties shall file with the
Secretary  of  State of the State of Delaware a certificate of merger

duties of the Company  and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and
duties of the Surviving  Corporation.

 

 

Section  2.5 _Certificate of  Incorporation and By-laws of the Surviving
Corporation_. Unless  otherwise agreed by Parent and the Company, the
certificate of incorporation  and  by-laws of the Company, as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time,  shall be the certificate of
incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving  Corporation until thereafter
amended as provided therein or by applicable Law  and subject to Section 5.7
hereof.

 

 

Section  2.6 _Directors and Officers of  the Surviving Corporation_.

 

 

(a) Each  of the parties hereto shall take all necessary action to cause the
directors  of  Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time to be the
directors of the  Surviving Corporation immediately following the Effective

the Merger and without  any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company or the holders of  any  shares of Company Common Stock or any shares
of capital stock of Merger  Sub:

 

 

(a) _Capital  Stock of Merger Sub_. Each share of capital stock, par value
$0.01  per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the  Effective Time shall be converted into and become one validly issued,
fully  paid  and nonassessable share of

 

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

common  stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Surviving Corporation and
shall  constitute the only outstanding shares of the Surviving  Corporation.
From and after the Effective Time, all certificates, if  any, representing
shares of capital stock of Merger Sub shall be deemed for  all  purposes to
represent the number of shares of common stock of the Surviving  Corporation
into which they were converted in accordance with the immediately  preceding
sentence.

 

 

(b) _Cancellation  of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock_. Any shares of
Company  Common Stock that are owned by the Company as treasury stock, and
any shares  of  Company Common Stock owned by Parent or Merger Sub, shall be
automatically  canceled and shall cease to exist and no consideration shall
be delivered in  exchange therefor.

 

 

(c) _Conversion  of Company Common Stock_. Each share of Company Common
Stock  issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other
than  shares to be canceled in accordance with Section 2.7(b) and
Dissenting  Shares), including any shares held by the trustee for the
Company\'s Retirement  Savings Plan and Supplemental Retirement Savings Plan
(the " _Retir_ _ement  Plans_ ") which shall be considered issued and
outstanding, shall be converted  into the right to receive an amount of cash,
without interest, equal to the  Offer Price (the " _Merger Consideration_ ").
As of the Effective  Time, all such shares of Company Common Stock shall no
longer be outstanding  and  shall automatically be canceled and shall cease
to exist, and each holder of  a  certificate (or evidence of shares in book-
entry form) which immediately prior  to the Effective Time represented any
such shares of Company Common Stock (each,  a " _Certificate_ ") shall cease
to have any rights with respect thereto,  except the right to receive the
Merger Consideration to be paid in consideration  therefor upon surrender of
such Certificate in accordance with Section 2.8(b),  without interest.

 

 

Section  2.8 _Exchange of  Certificates_.

 

 

(a) _Paying  Agent_. Not less than three (3) Business Days prior to the 
Effective Time, Parent shall designate a United States bank or trust company 
reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as agent for the benefit of the 
holders of shares of Company Common Stock in connection with the Merger (the 
" _Paying Agent_ ") to receive, on terms reasonably acceptable to the 
Company, for the benefit of holders of shares of Company Common Stock, the 
aggregate Merger Consideration to which holders of shares of Company Common 
Stock shall become entitled pursuant to Section 2.7(c). The Paying  Agent
shall also act as the agent for the Company Stockholders for the purpose  of
holding the Certificates and shall obtain no rights or interests in the 
shares represented by such Certificates. Parent shall deposit the  aggregate
Merger Consideration with the Paying Agent by wire transfer of  immediately
available funds at or prior to the Effective Time. Such  aggregate Merger
Consideration deposited with the Paying Agent shall, pending  its
disbursement to such holders, be invested by the Paying Agent in: (i)  direct
obligations of the United States of America, (ii) obligations for which  the
full faith and credit of the United States of America is pledged to provide 
for the payment of principal and interest or (iii) money market funds
investing  solely in a combination of the foregoing. Parent shall promptly 
replace any funds deposited with the Paying Agent that are lost through any 
investment.

 

 

(b) _Payment  Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time (but in no
event  more than five (5) Business Days thereafter), Parent or the
Surviving  Corporation shall

 

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

cause  the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate
whose shares  of the Company Common Stock were converted into the right to
receive the Merger  Consideration (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall
specify that delivery  shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass,  only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to
the Paying Agent, and  which shall be in such form and shall have such other
customary provisions  (including customary provisions with respect to
delivery of an "agent\'s message"  with respect to shares held in book-entry
form) as Parent may reasonably  specify) and (ii) instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of the  Certificates in exchange for payment of the
Merger  Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to 
the Paying Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed 
and  validly executed in accordance with the instructions (and such other
customary  documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent), the
holder of  such  Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor the Merger  Consideration, without interest, for each share of
Company Common Stock formerly  represented by such Certificate, and the
Certificate so surrendered shall  forthwith be canceled. If payment of the
Merger Consideration is to  be made to a Person other than the Person in
whose name the surrendered  Certificate is registered, it shall be a
condition of payment that (x) the  Certificate so surrendered shall be
properly endorsed or shall otherwise be  in  proper form for transfer and
(y) the Person requesting such payment shall have  paid any transfer and
other taxes required by reason of the payment of the  Merger Consideration to
a Person other than the registered holder of such  Certificate surrendered or
shall have established to the reasonable satisfaction  of the Surviving
Corporation that such tax either has been paid or is not  applicable. Until
surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.8,  each Certificate shall be
deemed at any time after the Effective Time to  represent only the right to
receive the Merger Consideration as contemplated  by  this Article II,
without interest.

 

 

(c) _Transfer  Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Company Stock_. The
Merger  Consideration paid in respect of shares of Company Common Stock upon
the  surrender for exchange of Certificates in accordance with the terms of
this  Article II shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of
all rights  pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock previously
represented by  such  Certificates, and at the Effective Time, the stock
transfer books of the Company  shall be closed and thereafter there shall be
no further registration of  transfers on the stock transfer books of the
Surviving Corporation of the shares  of Company Common Stock that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective  Time. From and after the
Effective Time, the holders of Certificates  that evidenced ownership of
shares of Company Common Stock outstanding  immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with  respect to such shares of
Company Common Stock, except as otherwise  provided for in this Agreement or
by applicable Law. Subject to the  last sentence of Section 2.8(e), if, at
any time after the Effective Time,  Certificates are presented to the
Surviving Corporation for any reason, they  shall be canceled and exchanged
as provided in this Article II.

 

 

(d) _Lost,  Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate shall
have  been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that
fact  by  the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if  required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond,
in such reasonable  amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any
claim that may be made  against it with respect to such Certificate, the
Paying Agent will pay, in  exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate, the applicable Merger  Consideration to be

 

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

paid  in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented
by such  Certificate, as contemplated by this Article II.

 

 

(e) _Termination  of Fund_. At any time following six months after the
Closing Date,  the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the
Paying Agent to  deliver to it any funds (including any interest received
with respect thereto)  that had been made available to the Paying Agent and
which have not been  disbursed to holders of Certificates, and thereafter
such holders shall be  entitled to look only to Parent or the Surviving
Corporation (subject to  abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws)
as general creditors thereof  with respect to the payment of any Merger
Consideration that may be payable  upon  surrender of any Certificates held
by such holders, as determined pursuant  to  this Agreement, without any
interest paid. Any amounts remaining  unclaimed by such holders at such time
at which such amounts would otherwise  escheat to or become property of any
Governmental Authority shall become,  to the extent permitted by applicable
Law, the property of Parent, free and  clear of all claims or interest of any
Person previously entitled.

 

 

(f) _Withholding  Taxes_. Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation and
the  Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration  otherwise payable to a holder of shares of Company Common
Stock, Options,  SARs or Restricted Shares pursuant to this Agreement such
amounts as may be  required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the
making of such payment  under the Code, or under any provision of state,
local or foreign tax  Law. To the extent amounts are so withheld and paid
over to the  appropriate taxing authority, such withheld amounts shall be
treated for all  purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person
in respect of  which  such deduction and withholding was made.

 

 

Section  2.9 _Appraisal  Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the  contrary, shares of Company Common Stock that are issued and
outstanding  immediately prior to the Effective Time and which are held by a
stockholder  who  did not vote in favor of the Merger (or consent to the
Merger in writing) and  who is entitled to demand and properly demands
appraisal of such shares pursuant  to, and who complies in all respects with,
the provisions of Section 262 of  the  DGCL (a " _Dissenting Stockholder_
"), shall not be converted into or be  exchangeable for the right to receive
the Merger Consideration (the  " _Dissenting Shares_ "), but instead such
holder shall be entitled to  payment of the fair value of such shares in
accordance with the provisions  of  Section 262 of the DGCL (and at the
Effective Time, such Dissenting Shares  shall  no longer be outstanding and
shall automatically be canceled and shall cease  to  exist, and such holder
shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto,  except the right to
receive the fair value of such Dissenting Shares in  accordance with the
provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL), unless and until  such holder shall
have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn  or  lost rights
to appraisal under the DGCL or it is determined that such holder  does not
have appraisal rights. If any Dissenting Stockholder shall  have failed to
perfect or otherwise shall have effectively withdrawn, waived  or  lost such
right or it is determined that such holder does not have appraisal  rights,
such holder\'s shares of Company Common Stock shall thereupon be treated  as
if they had been converted into and become exchangeable for the right to 
receive, as of the Effective Time, the Merger Consideration for each such
share  of Company Common Stock, in accordance with Section 2.7, payable
without any  interest thereon. The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt
notice of  any demands for appraisal of any shares of Company Common Stock,
attempted  withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served
pursuant to  the

 

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

DGCL  and received by the Company relating to stockholders\' rights of
appraisal,  and  (ii) the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and
proceedings with  respect to demands for appraisal under the DGCL, except as
required by  applicable Law. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
not, without  the  prior written consent of Parent or as otherwise required
by an order, decree,  ruling or injunction of a court of competent
jurisdiction, make any payment  with  respect to, or settle or compromise or
offer to settle or compromise, any such  demand, or agree to do any of the
foregoing.

 

 

Section  2.10 _Company Stock  Options_. At the Effective Time, all options
(other than  Out-of-the-Money Options), whether vested or unvested,
outstanding and  unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time that
represent the right  to  acquire shares of Company Common Stock (each, an "
_Option_ ") granted under  any plan or contract listed on Section 2.10 of the
Company Disclosure Schedule  (a " _Company Stock Plan_ ") shall, without any
further action by the Company  or the Surviving Corporation, cease to exist
and shall be converted into the  right to receive, in full satisfaction of
such Option, a cash amount equal  to  the Option Consideration (if any) for
each share of Company Common Stock then  subject to the Option.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent and the  Company shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from the Option Consideration  otherwise payable such
amounts as may be required to be deducted and withheld  with respect to the
making of such payment under the Code, or any provision  of  state, local or
foreign tax Law. For purposes of this Agreement,  " _Option Consideration_ "
means, with respect to any share of Company Common  Stock issuable under a
particular Option, an amount equal to the excess, if  any,  of (i) the
Merger Consideration per share of Company Common Stock over (ii)  the 
exercise price payable in respect of such share of Company Common Stock
issuable  under such Option. Cash payments to be made to holders of Options 
pursuant to this Section 2.10 shall be made to the extent practicable
through  the Company\'s payroll processing system on the Closing Date, or if
not  practicable checks for such payment shall be drawn by the Surviving
Corporation  in immediately available funds and sent by overnight courier to
the holders  promptly after the Effective Time (but in no event more than one
Business Day  thereafter). In the event that the exercise price per share of

unreasonably  withheld, conditioned or delayed) of Parent, prepare and file
with the SEC  the  Proxy Statement. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company will

Merger Sub and any other Subsidiary  of  Parent, at least 90% of the
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock, the  parties agree to take all
necessary and appropriate action to cause the Merger  to become effective as
soon as

(e) Parent  shall continue to hold all shares acquired in the Offer through
the Merger  and  shall vote, or cause to be voted, all of the Company Common
Stock acquired  in  the Offer or otherwise then owned by it, Merger Sub or
any of Parent\'s other  Subsidiaries in favor of the approval and adoption of

Section  5.3 _No  Solicitation_.

 

 

(a) The  Company shall not, nor shall it authorize or permit any of its
Subsidiaries,  any  of its or their respective directors, officers or
employees or any investment  banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant
or other advisor, agent or  representative retained by the Company or any
Subsidiary in connection with  the  Transactions (collectively, "
_Representatives_ ") to, directly or indirectly  through another Person,
except as otherwise provided below, (i) solicit,  initiate, or knowingly
encourage or facilitate (including by way of furnishing  information), any
inquiries or the making, submission or announcement of, any  proposal or
offer that constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a Takeover 
Proposal or (ii) other than informing persons of the provisions contained in 
this Section 5.3, enter into, continue or participate in any discussions or 
negotiations regarding any Takeover Proposal, or furnish any information 
concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries to any Person in connection with 
any  Takeover Proposal, or otherwise cooperate with or take any other action
to  knowingly facilitate any effort or attempt to make or implement a
Takeover  Proposal. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 5.3 to the 
contrary, at any time prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company may, upon a 
good  faith determination by the Company\'s Board of Directors (after
receiving the  advice of its outside counsel) that failure to take such
action would be  reasonably likely to result in a breach of the Company\'s
Board of Directors\'  fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company
under applicable Law, and  after giving Parent prompt written notice of such
determination, (A) in response  to an unsolicited _bona fide_ written
Takeover Proposal made after the  date of this Agreement that the Company\'s
Board of Directors determines in  good  faith (after consultation with
outside counsel and receiving the advice of  a  financial advisor of
nationally recognized reputation) constitutes or may result  in a Superior
Proposal, furnish information with respect to the Company and  its 
Subsidiaries to the Person making such Takeover Proposal (and its 
Representatives) pursuant to a confidentiality agreement containing terms
and  conditions no more favorable to such Person than those contained in
the  Confidentiality Agreement, dated June 25, 2007 (as it may be amended
from time  to time, the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), between Parent and
the  Company, are to Parent, except that such confidentiality agreement
between  the  Company and such Person shall not contain any provisions that
would prevent  the  Company from complying with its obligations to provide
the required disclosure  to Parent pursuant to this Section 5.3 and shall
permit such Person to make  a  Takeover Proposal; _provided_ that all such
information (to the extent  that such written information that has not been
previously provided or made  available to Parent) is provided or made
available to Parent and (B) in response  to an unsolicited _bona fide_
written Takeover Proposal made after the  date of this Agreement that the
Company\'s Board of Directors determines in  good  faith (after consultation
with outside counsel and receiving the advice of  a financial advisor of
nationally recognized reputation) constitutes or is  reasonably likely to
result in a Superior Proposal, participate in discussions  or negotiations
with the Person making such Takeover Proposal (and its  Representatives)
regarding such

 

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

38  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

Takeover  Proposal. Upon execution of this Agreement, the Company shall,
and  shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and their respective
Representatives to,  immediately cease and cause to be terminated all
existing discussions or  negotiations with any Person previously conducted
with respect to any Takeover  Proposal, and will request, to the extent
permitted under the applicable  confidentiality agreement, the prompt return
of any confidential information  previously furnished to such Persons that
has not been previously returned  to  the Company. Any violation of the
restrictions set forth in this  Section 5.3 by any Representative of the
Company or its Subsidiaries shall  be  deemed to be a breach of this Section
5.3 by the Company.

 

 

(b) Except  as expressly permitted by this Section 5.3(b), the Board of
Directors of the  Company shall not (i)(A) withdraw, modify or qualify, in a
manner adverse to  Parent, the recommendation by such Board of Directors that
stockholders of  the  Company accept the Offer, tender their shares of
Company Common Stock in the  Offer and adopt this Agreement or (B) adopt,
recommend or propose publicly  to  adopt or recommend, to the stockholders
of the Company a Takeover Proposal  (any  action described in this clause
(i) being referred to as a " _Company Adverse  Recommendation Change_ ") (it
being understood and agreed that any "stop, look  and listen" communication
by the Board of Directors to the stockholders of  the  Company pursuant to
Rule 14d-9(f) of the Exchange Act shall not constitute  a  Company Adverse
Recommendation Change) or (ii) authorize the Company or any  of  its
Subsidiaries to enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of 
understanding, agreement in principle or merger, acquisition or similar 
agreement with respect to, or that is intended to or could reasonably be 
expected to lead to any Takeover Proposal (other than a confidentiality 
agreement referred to in Section 5.3(a)) (each, a " _Company Acquisition 
Agreement_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to  the
Acceptance Time and subject to the proviso of this sentence: (x) the Board 
of Directors of the Company may make a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change,  upon a good faith determination by the Company\'s Board of Directors
(after  receiving the advice of its outside counsel) that failure to take
such action  would be reasonably likely to result in a breach of the
Company\'s Board of  Directors\' fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the
Company under applicable  Law, and (y) if the Board of Directors of the
Company receives a Takeover  Proposal that such Board of Directors reasonably
determines (after  receiving the advice of its outside counsel and receiving
the advice of a  financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation)
constitutes a Superior  Proposal, and that was unsolicited after the date of
this Agreement and did  not  otherwise result from a breach of this Section
5.3, the Company or its  Subsidiaries may enter into a Company Acquisition
Agreement with respect to  such  Superior Proposal if the Company shall have
complied with the provisions of  the  following sentence and, concurrently
with entering into such Company Acquisition  Agreement, terminated this
Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(d)(ii) and paid  the  Termination Fee and
Expense Payment pursuant to Section 7.3(a); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that
the Company shall not be entitled to exercise its right  to  make a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change, terminate this Agreement pursuant  to Section
7.1(d)(ii) or enter into any Company Acquisition  Agreement unless: (1) the
Company has provided to Parent five (5)  Business Days prior written notice
(an " _Alternative Transaction Notice_ "),  which Alternative Transaction
Notice shall specify that the Board of Directors  of the Company is prepared
to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change,  terminate this Agreement
pursuant to Section 7.1(d)(ii) and/or enter into any  Company Acquisition
Agreement, as applicable, and, in the case of a Takeover  Proposal that the
Board of Directors has determined constitutes a Superior  Proposal, shall
attach the most current version of any written agreement  relating to such
Takeover Proposal and contain a description of any other  material terms of
such

 

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

39  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

Takeover  Proposal and advising Parent that the Board of Directors of the
Company has  determined that such Takeover Proposal is a Superior Proposal
and that the  Board  of Directors of the Company intends to enter into an
agreement providing for  such Superior Proposal, (2) during such five (5)
Business Day period, if  requested by Parent, the Company has engaged in
good-faith negotiations with  Parent to amend this Agreement in such a manner
that the Takeover Proposal  that  was determined to constitute a Superior
Proposal no longer is a Superior  Proposal and (3) on midnight, New York
time, at the end of the fifth  (5th) Business Day following the date of
receipt of the Alternative Transaction  Notice (or, in the event that the
Takeover Proposal has been materially revised  or modified, at the end of
midnight, New York time, on the fifth (5th) Business  Day following the date
of receipt of notice of such material revision or  modification, if later),
such Takeover Proposal has not been withdrawn and  continues to constitute a
Superior Proposal (taking into account all changes  to  the terms of this
Agreement proposed by Parent). It is understood and  agreed that an
Alternative Transaction Notice shall be required for a Company  Adverse
Recommendation Change, regardless of whether it was made in response  to  or
as a result of a Superior Proposal.

 

 

(c) In  addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in Sections
5.3(a) and  5.3(b), the Company shall promptly (and in any event within
twenty-four (24)  hours of learning of the relevant information) advise
Parent in writing of  any  Takeover Proposal and the material terms and
conditions of any such Takeover  Proposal (including any changes thereto)
and, unless such disclosure would  be  reasonably likely to result in a
breach of the Company's Board of Directors' fiduciary duties to the
stockholders of the Company under applicable Law, the  identity of the Person
making any such Takeover Proposal. The Company  shall keep Parent fully
informed of the status and material terms (including  any  change to the
material terms of such Takeover Proposal) of any Takeover  Proposal, and
shall provide Parent with copies of all Takeover Proposals (and  amendments
or material modifications of such Takeover Proposals) and related 
agreements, draft agreements exchanged by the parties and modifications 
thereof.

 

 

  (d) For purposes of this  Agreement:

 

 

" _Takeover  Proposal_ " means any inquiry, proposal or offer from any Person
(other than  Parent and its Subsidiaries) relating to any (A) direct or
indirect acquisition  or purchase, in one transaction or a series of related
transactions, of assets  of the Company and its Subsidiaries (including
securities of Subsidiaries,  but  excluding sales of assets in the ordinary
course of business consistent with  past practice) equal to 15% or more of
the Company\'s consolidated assets or  to  which 15% or more of the
Company\'s revenues, net income or earnings on a  consolidated basis are
attributable, (B) acquisition of 15% or more of the  outstanding Company
Common Stock, (C) tender offer or exchange offer that if  consummated would
result in any Person beneficially owning 15% or more of the  outstanding
Company Common Stock or any other class of equity securities of  the 
Company or (D) merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination, 
recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution, joint venture or similar
transaction  involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; in each case,
other than  the  Transactions.

 

 

" _Superior  Proposal_ " means a _bona fide_ written Takeover Proposal
obtained not  in breach of this Section 5.3 to acquire, directly or
indirectly, for  consideration consisting of cash and/or securities, more
than 75% of the  outstanding Company Common Stock

 

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

40  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

or  more than 75% of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries on a 
consolidated basis, made by a third party, and which is otherwise on terms 
and  conditions which the Board of Directors of the Company determines in its
good  faith and reasonable judgment (after consultation with a financial
advisor  of  national reputation and in light of all relevant circumstances,
including all  the terms and conditions of such proposal and this Agreement)
to be (A) more  favorable to the Company Stockholders from a financial point
of view than the  Offer, the Merger and the other Transactions, (B) is
reasonably likely to  be consummated on the terms so proposed, taking into
account all relevant  financial, regulatory, legal and other aspects of such
proposal, including  any  conditions; and (C) for which financing, to the
extent required, is then  fully committed or which, in the good-faith
judgment of the Board of Directors  of the Company (based on the advice of a
financial advisor of national  reputation), is reasonably capable of being
timely financed by such third  party.

 

 

(e) Nothing  in this Section 5.3 shall prohibit the Board of Directors of the
Company from  taking and disclosing to the Company Stockholders a position
contemplated by  Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A
promulgated under  the Exchange Act, or other applicable Law, if such Board
of Directors  determines, after consultation with outside counsel, that
failure to so disclose  such position could constitute a violation of
applicable Law; _provided_   that in no event shall the Company or its Board
or Directors or any committee  of  the Board of Directors take, or agree or
resolve to take, any action prohibited  by Section 5.3(b).

 

 

Section  5.4 _Reasonable Best  Efforts_.

 

 

(a) Subject  to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the
parties hereto shall  cooperate with the other parties and use (and shall
cause their respective  Subsidiaries to use) their respective reasonable best
efforts to promptly (i)  take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do, or
cause to be done, all  things, necessary, proper or advisable to cause the
conditions to Closing to  be  satisfied as promptly as practicable and to
consummate and make effective,  in  the most expeditious manner practicable,
the Transactions, including preparing  and filing promptly and fully all
documentation to effect all necessary filings,  notices, petitions,
statements, registrations, submissions of information,  applications and
other documents (including any required or recommended filings  under
applicable Antitrust Laws), and (ii) obtain all approvals, consents, 
registrations, permits, authorizations and other confirmations from any 
Governmental Authority necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the 
Transactions. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Antitrust Laws_ "  means the
Sherman Act, as amended, the Clayton Act, as amended, the HSR Act,  the 
Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, and all other applicable Laws
issued  by any Governmental Authority that are designed or intended to
prohibit,  restrict or regulate actions having the purpose or effect of
monopolization  or  restraint of trade or lessening of competition through
merger or  acquisition.

 

 

(b) In  furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, (i) each party
hereto agrees  to make an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report
Form pursuant to  the  HSR Act with respect to the Transactions as promptly
as practicable, and in  any  event within ten(10) Business Days of the date
of this Agreement, and to supply  as promptly as practicable any additional
information and documentary material  that may be requested pursuant to the
HSR Act and use its reasonable best  efforts to take, or cause to be taken,
all other actions consistent  with

 

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

41  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

this  Section 5.4 necessary to cause the expiration or termination of the
applicable  waiting periods under the HSR Act as soon as practicable; and
(ii) the Company  and Parent shall each use its reasonable best efforts to
(x) take all action  necessary to ensure that no state takeover statute or
similar Law is or becomes  applicable to any of the Transactions and (y) if
any state takeover statute  or  similar Law becomes applicable to any of the
Transactions, take all action  necessary to ensure that the Transactions may
be consummated as promptly as  practicable on the terms contemplated by this
Agreement and otherwise minimize  the effect of such Law on the Transactions.

 

 

(c) Each  of the parties hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i)
cooperate  in  all respects with each other in connection with any filing or
submission with  a  Governmental Authority in connection with the
Transactions and in connection  with any investigation or other inquiry by or
before a Governmental Authority  relating to the Transactions, including any
proceeding initiated by a private  party, and (ii) promptly notify the other
party of any written communication  to  that party from the Federal Trade
Commission, the Antitrust Division of the  Department of Justice, any State
Attorney General or any other Governmental  Authority and permit the other
party to review in advance any proposed  communication to any of the
foregoing, (iii) consult with the other party prior  to participating in any
substantive meeting, telephone call or discussion with  any Governmental
Authority in respect of any filings, investigation or inquiry  concerning
this Agreement or the Merger and provide the other party the  opportunity to
attend and participate in any such meeting, telephone call or  discussion,
and (iv) furnish the other party with copies of all correspondence,  filings,
and written communications (or a reasonably detailed summary of any  oral
communications) between them and their respective representatives on the  one
hand, and any Governmental Authority or members of their respective staffs 
on the other hand, with respect to this Agreement and the Merger.

 

 

(d) In  furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties
contained  in  this Section 5.4, each of the parties hereto shall use its
reasonable best  efforts to resolve such objections, if any, as may be
asserted by a Governmental  Authority or other Person with respect to the
Transactions. Without  limiting any other provision of this Agreement, Parent
and the Company shall  each use their reasonable best efforts to (i) avoid
the entry of, or to have  vacated or terminated, any decree, order or
judgment that would restrain,  prevent or delay the consummation of the
Transactions, on or before the  Walk-Away Date, and (ii) avoid or eliminate
each and every impediment under  any  Antitrust Law that may be asserted by
any Governmental Authority with respect  to  the Transactions so as to
enable the consummation of the Transactions to occur  as soon as reasonably
possible (and in any event no later than the Walk-Away  Date), in each case,
as may be required in order obtain any approvals from  any  Governmental
Authority necessary to consummate the Transactions or to avoid  the  entry
of, or to effect the dissolution of, any injunction, temporary restraining 
order, or other order in any suit or proceeding, which would otherwise have 
the  effect of preventing or materially delaying the consummation of the 
Transactions; _provided_ , _however_ , that, notwithstanding anything to  the
contrary in this Agreement, in connection with any filing or submission 
required or action to be taken by either Parent or the Company to consummate 
the  Transactions, in no event shall Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or
Affiliates  be obligated to propose or agree to accept any undertaking or
condition, to  enter into any consent decree, to make any divestiture or
accept any operational  restriction, or take or commit to take any action (i)
the effectiveness or  consummation of which is not conditional on the
consummation of the Offer and  the Merger or (ii) that individually or in the

 

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

42  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

aggregate  is or would reasonably be expected to be materially adverse (with
materiality,  for purposes of this provision, being measured in relation to
the size of the  Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole) to (A) the
Company and its  Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or Parent and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a  whole, either before or after giving effect to the
Offer or the Merger, or  (B) Parent's ownership or operation of any material
portion of the business  or assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken
as a whole (a  " _Materially Burdensome Condition_ "). The Company shall
agree,  if requested by Parent in writing, to commit to take any of the
forgoing actions  with respect to the assets or business of the Company in
furtherance of this  Section 5.4; _provided_ , _however_ , that any such
action may be  conditioned upon the consummation of the Merger and other
Transactions  contemplated by this Agreement.

 

 

(e) To  the extent requested by Parent, the Company and its Subsidiaries
shall use  all  reasonable efforts to cooperate with Parent in obtaining
title insurance with  respect to the Owned Real Property, including execution
and delivery of title  affidavits and other documents reasonably requested by
Parent\'s title  insurer.

 

 

Section  5.5 _Public  Announcements_. The initial press release with respect
to the  execution of this Agreement shall be a joint press release to be
reasonably  agreed upon by Parent and the Company. Parent and the Company
shall  consult with each other before issuing, and, to the extent
practicable, give  each other the reasonable opportunity to review and
comment upon, any press  release or other public statements with respect to
the transactions contemplated  by this Agreement or the Tender Agreement,
including the Offer and the Merger,  and shall not issue any such press
release or make any such public statement  prior to such consultation, except
as may be required by applicable Law, court  process or by obligations
pursuant to any listing agreement with any national  securities exchange or
national securities quotation system.

 

 

Section  5.6 _Access to Information;  Confidentiality_. Subject to
applicable Laws relating to the  exchange of information, from the date of
this Agreement until the Effective  Time, the Company shall afford to Parent
and Parent\'s Representatives reasonable  access during normal business hours
to the Company\'s properties, books, records  and personnel and the Company
shall furnish promptly to Parent such other  information concerning its
business and properties as Parent may from time  to  time reasonably
request, _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall  not be required to
provide access to any information or documents which would,  in the
reasonable judgment of the Company, (i) breach any agreement of the  Company
or any of its subsidiaries with any third-party, (ii) constitute a  waiver of
the attorney-client or other privilege held by the Company, (iii)  otherwise
violate any applicable Laws or (iv) which would result in a competitor  of
the Company or any of its subsidiaries receiving material information which 
is competitively sensitive; _provided_ , _further_ , however, that the 
Company will use its reasonable best efforts to obtain any required consents 
for  the disclosure of such information or documents and take such other
action  (such  as the redaction of identifying or confidential information
or entry into a  joint defense agreement or other arrangement to avoid loss
of attorney client  privilege) with respect to such information or documents
as is necessary to  permit disclosure to Parent and Parent\'s
Representatives. Until the  Effective Time, the information provided will be
subject to the terms of the  Confidentiality Agreement.

Section  5.7 _Indemnification and  Insurance_.

 

 

(a) Parent  shall cause (including by providing adequate funding to) the
Surviving  Corporation to assume the obligations with respect to all rights
to  indemnification and exculpation from liabilities, including advancement
of  expenses, for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time  now  existing in favor of the current or former directors or officers
of the Company  and its Subsidiaries (each, an " _Indemnitee_ " and,
collectively, the  " _Indemnitees_ ") as provided in the Company Charter
Documents or any  written indemnification Contract between such directors or
officers and the  Company (in each case, as in effect on the date hereof),
without further action,  as of the Effective Time, and such obligations shall
survive the Merger and  shall continue in full force and effect in accordance
with their terms, along  with the indemnification obligations of the
Surviving Corporation set forth  in  Section 5.7(a) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule. Without limiting  the foregoing, Parent, for a period of
at least six years after the Effective  Time, shall cause the certificate of
incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving  Corporation (or any successor) to
contain provisions no less favorable to the  Indemnitees with respect to
limitation of liabilities of directors and officers  and indemnification than
are set forth as of the date of this Agreement in  the  Company Charter
Documents, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed  or  otherwise
modified in a manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder  of
the Indemnitees. Parent shall cause (including by providing adequate  funding
to) the Surviving Corporation to, honor all of its indemnification 
obligations existing as of the Effective Time.

 

 

(b) For  the six-year period commencing immediately after the Effective Time,
Parent  shall maintain in effect directors\' and officers\' liability
insurance covering  acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time with respect  to  those persons who are currently (and any additional
persons who at or prior  to  the Effective Time become) covered by the
Company\'s directors\' and officers\'  liability insurance policies on terms
with respect to such coverage, and in  amount, not less favorable to such
individuals than those of such policies  in  effect on the date of this
Agreement (or Parent may substitute therefor  policies, issued by reputable
insurers, of at least the same coverage with  respect to matters occurring
prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ that  any substitution or replacement
of existing policies shall not result in any  gaps or lapses of coverage with
respect to facts, events, acts or omissions  occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time)); _provided_ , _however_ ,  that, if the aggregate annual
premiums for such insurance shall exceed 200%  of  the current aggregate
annual premiums, then Parent shall provide or cause to  be  provided a
policy for the applicable individuals with the best coverage as  shall  then
be available at the sum of (i) an annual premium of 200% of the  current
aggregate annual premiums plus (ii) the unearned portion of the  premium paid
by the Company for the current year for such  insurance.

 

 

(c) The  provisions of this Section 5.7 are intended to be for the benefit
of, and shall  be enforceable by, each Indemnitee, his or her heirs and his
or her  representatives and, in addition to, and not in substitution for, and
shall  not  impair any other rights to indemnification or contribution that
any such Person  may have by contract, under the Company Charter Documents,
or the comparable  organization documents of the Surviving Corporation or any
of its  subsidiaries, under applicable Law, or otherwise. Parent shall
ensure  that the Surviving Corporation complies with all of its obligations
under this  Section 5.7.

Section  5.8 _[Intentionally  Omitted]_.

 

 

Section  5.9 _Fees and  Expenses_. Except as provided in Section 7.3, all
fees and  expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
Transactions shall  be paid by the party incurring such fees or expenses,
whether or not the  Transactions are consummated; _provided_ that the fees
and expenses of  printing and mailing the Tender Offer Documents, all filing
and other fees  paid  to the SEC in connection with the Offer and the Merger
and all filing fees  associated with the HSR Act shall be borne equally by
Parent and the  Company.

 

 

Section  5.10 _Employee Matters_.

 

 

(a) Subject  to Section 5.10(c), during the period of twelve (12) months
immediately  following the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the
Surviving  Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, provide those employed by the
Company  and  its Subsidiaries at the Effective Time (the " _Company
Employees_ ") with at  least the level of salary as in effect at the
Effective Time; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that employment shall be "at will",
except as set forth in  the  Employment Agreements.

 

 

(b) For  the first six-month merchandising season commencing after the
Effective Time,  Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation and
its Subsidiaries  to,  continue incentive compensation award programs in
accordance with past practice  under the Company Plans listed on Section
5.10(b) of the Company Disclosure  Schedule. For the avoidance of doubt, if
the Effective Time occurs  after the end of the six-month merchandising
season ending February 2, 2008,  the  Company shall be entitled to continue
the Company\'s currently existing incentive  compensation award programs in
accordance with past practice through the end  of  the six-month
merchandising season beginning February 3, 2008.

 

 

(c) Section  5.10(a) to the contrary notwithstanding, Parent shall, or shall
cause the  Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, provide each
Company Employee  who  incurs a termination of employment during the period
of twelve (12) months  immediately following the Effective Time with
severance payments and severance  benefits that are no less favorable than
the severance payments and severance  benefits to which such employee would
have been entitled with respect to such  termination immediately prior to the
Effective Time as disclosed in Section  5.10(c) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule.

 

 

(d) For  a period of twelve (12) months immediately following the Effective
Time, Parent  shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to, provide  Company Employees with employee benefit and
Retirement Plans, programs, and  arrangements (other than equity-based plans)
that are no less favorable in  the  aggregate than the employee benefit and
retirement savings plans, programs  and arrangements (other than equity-based
plans) provided by the Company and  its  Subsidiaries to Company Employees
immediately prior to the Effective Time;  _provided_ , _how_ _ever_ , that
employment shall be "at will"  except as set forth in the Employment
Agreements. **** Without  limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent
shall, or shall cause the  Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, (i)
waive any  preexisting condition limitations otherwise applicable to Company
Employees  and their eligible dependents under any plan of Parent or its
Subsidiaries  that  provides health benefits in which Company Employees may
be eligible to  participate following the Closing Date, other than any
limitations

 

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

45  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

that  were in effect with respect to such employees as of the Closing Date
under  the  analogous Company Plan, (ii) honor any deductible, co-payment
and out-of-pocket  maximums incurred by the Company Employees and their
eligible dependents under  the health plans in which they participated
immediately prior to the Closing  Date during the portion of the calendar
year prior to the Closing Date in  satisfying any deductibles, co-payments or
out-of-pocket maximums under health  plans of Parent and its Subsidiaries in
which they are eligible to participate  after the Closing Date in the same
plan year in which such deductibles,  co-payments or out-of-pocket maximums
were incurred, (iii) honor the Company\'s  expense reimbursement policy, (iv)
waive any waiting period limitation or  evidence of insurability or at work
requirement that would otherwise be  applicable to a Company Employee and his
or her eligible dependents on or after  the Closing Date, in each case to the
extent such Company Employee or eligible  dependent had satisfied any similar
limitation or requirement under an analogous  Company Plan prior to the
Closing Date and (v) credit Company Employees with  the  amount of current
year vacation time that shall have been accrued and  unpaid at the Effective
Time. Following the Closing Date, Parent  shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, honor  in accordance with
their respective terms, all Company Plans. Parent  acknowledges that, except
as set forth on Section 5.10(d) of the Company  Disclosure Schedule, the
consummation of the Merger shall constitute a "Change  of Control" or "Change
in Control" as applicable, for purposes of each Company  Plan listed on
Section 5.10(d) of the Company Disclosure Schedule in which  that  concept
is relevant.

 

 

(e) This  Section 5.10 shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit
of each  of  the parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this Article V,
express or  implied, is intended to confer upon any other Person any rights
or remedies  of  any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Section
5.10.

 

 

(f)   Nothing contained in this Agreement shall (i) constitute or be deemed
to be  an  amendment to any Company Plan or any other compensation or
benefit plan, program  or arrangement of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries; (ii) prevent the  amendment or termination of any Company Plan
or interfere with the right or  obligation of Parent or its Affiliates to
make such changes as are necessary  to  conform with applicable Law
(including without limitation Section 409A of the  Code); or (c) limit the
right of Buyer or any of its Affiliates to terminate  the  employment of any
employee at any time.

 

 

(g)   If the Company or any of its Subsidiaries enters into, adopts, amends,
modifies  or terminates any Arrangements to Covered Securityholders, the
Company intends  that all such amounts payable under such Arrangements (i)
shall be paid or  granted as compensation for past services performed, future
services to be  performed, or future services to be refrained from
performing, by the Covered  Securityholders (and matters incidental thereto)
and (ii) shall not be  calculated based on the number of shares tendered or
to be tendered into the  Offer by the applicable Covered Securityholder. If
there has been any  adoption, approval, amendment or modification of any
Arrangement, either prior  to or after the date of this Agreement, the
Company agrees that, upon the  request of Parent, the Compensation Committee
of the Board of Directors of  the  Company, consisting solely of independent
directors, shall approve  resolutions approving such adoption, approval,
amendment or modification as  an  employment compensation, severance or
other employee

 

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

46  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

benefit  arrangements, in accordance with the requirements of Rule
14d-10(d)(2) under  the  Exchange Act and the instructions thereto.

 

 

Section  5.11 _Updated  Information_. Prior to the Closing, the Company
shall give written  notice to Parent of the occurrence, or failure to occur,
after the date of  this  Agreement, of any event which occurrence or failure
has caused or would be  reasonably likely to cause any representation or

terminate this Agreement under this Section 7.1(b)(i) shall not be available

(i) if  Parent or Merger Sub shall have breached or failed to perform any of
its  representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this 
Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (A) would result in (1) any 
representation or any representation or warranty of Parent and Merger Sub 
contained in this Agreement not being true and correct (without giving
effect  to  any qualifications or limitations as to materiality or Parent
Material Adverse  Effect set forth therein) except, in the case of this
clause (1), to the extent  that the facts or matters as to which such
representation or warranty is not  so  true and correct, individually or in
the aggregate, have not had and could  not  reasonably be expected to have a
Parent Material Adverse Effect or (2) a  failure by Parent or Merger Sub to
perform in all material respects its  agreements, covenants and obligations
required to be performed by it under  this  Agreement at or prior to such
time and (B) is not cured, or is incapable of  being cured, by Parent or
Merger Sub within thirty (30) calendar days following  receipt of written

Sub by the Walk-Away Date); or

on the date such  agreement is entered into or on the date that such Takeover
Proposal is  consummated, whichever is earlier, by wire transfer of same-day
funds, an  additional amount equal to one-half of the Termination  Fee;
_provided_ , _however_ , that for the purpose of this Section  7.3(b), all
references in the definition of Takeover Proposal to "15%" shall  instead be
deemed to refer to "a majority".

 

 

(c) Each  of the Company and Parent acknowledges that the agreements
contained in this  Section 7.3 are an integral part of the Transactions and
that, without these  agreements, Parent could not enter into this Agreement.
Accordingly,  in the event that the Company shall fail to pay the Termination
Fee or Expense  Payment when due, the Company, shall reimburse Parent for all
costs and expenses  incurred or accrued by it (including reasonable fees and
expenses of counsel)  in  connection with the collection under and

50  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

payment  at the prime rate of Citibank, N.A, in effect on the date that such
payment  was  required to be made.

 

 

(d) The  parties agree that the payment of the Termination Fee and/or Expense
Payments  shall be the sole and exclusive remedy available to Parent and
Merger Sub with  respect to this Agreement and the Transactions in the event
any payment of  the  Termination Fee and/or Expense Payments become due and
payable under the terms  of this Agreement, and, upon payment of the
applicable amount, the Company  shall  have no further liability to Parent
and Merger Sub hereunder.

exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver of rights, nor
shall  any single or partial exercise of such rights preclude any other or
further  exercise of such rights or the exercise of any other right

or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing
