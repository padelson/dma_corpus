(iii) _minus_ the Company Closing Debt Amount,

 



 

(iv) _minus_ the Newco Equity Amount,

 



 

(v) _minus_ the Company Transaction Expenses,

 



      
 

 



 

(vi) _plus_ the Working Capital Surplus Amount (if any),

 



 

(vii) _minus_ the Working Capital Deficit Amount (if any).

 



 

The Purchase Price shall be subject to adjustment in accordance with _Section
2.4_. An example calculation of the Purchase Price is set forth on _Exhibit
F_ for illustrative purposes only.

 



 

(b) At the Closing, Buyer shall:

 



 

(i) pay or cause to be paid to Seller the Estimated Purchase Price by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by Seller
prior to the Closing Date;

 



 

(ii) deliver or cause to be delivered to the holders of the Refinancing
Indebtedness, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, such cash
amounts as are necessary to discharge in full the Refinancing Indebtedness
pursuant to the Payoff Letters; and

 



 

(iii) pay or cause to be paid the Company Transaction Expenses, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds, pursuant to the Transaction Expense
Invoices (other than any such Company Transaction Expenses that are subject to
withholding, which shall be paid through the Companys payroll promptly
following the Closing, and any Employer Taxes).

 



 

(c) At the Closing, Newco shall issue the Newco Equity and admit Seller as a
member of Newco with respect to the Newco Equity on the terms and conditions
set forth in the Amended and Restated Newco Operating Agreement.

 



 

(d) To the extent any change of control severance amounts will become payable
on or after Closing under the Contracts set forth on _Schedule 1.1(a)_, as in
effect on the date of this Agreement, upon termination of the employment of
the employees party thereto, which termination of employment occurs within one
year after the Closing Date (such amounts, including the employer portion of
any employment, payroll, unemployment and similar Taxes related thereto,
collectively, " _Post-Closing Employee Payments_ "), Seller will be
responsible for these amounts and agrees to reimburse Holdings, Newco and
Buyer for any Post-Closing Employee Payments actually paid to the relevant
employees; _provided_ , _however_ , that if any amount that otherwise would
have been treated as a Post-Closing Employee Payment was treated as a Company
Transaction Expense or Company Indebtedness, then such amount shall not be
treated as a Post-Closing Employee Payment and shall not be reimbursed by
Seller under this Section 2.2(d) as the result of such amount having reduced
the Purchase Price.

 



 

2.3 _Closing_.

 



 

Unless this Agreement is earlier terminated in accordance with this Agreement,
the closing of the Contemplated Transactions (the " _Closing_ ") shall take
place at 10:00 A.M. local time on the third Business Day immediately following
the day on which the last of the conditions set forth in _Article VII_ (other
than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing,
but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions) are satisfied
or waived in accordance with this Agreement, or on such other date as Holdings
and Seller may otherwise

 



      
 

 



 

agree in writing; provided, that, notwithstanding the satisfaction or waiver
of the conditions set forth in _Article VII_ (other than those conditions
that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of those conditions), if the Marketing Period has not
ended at least two (2) Business Days prior to such time, then Holdings shall
not be required to effect the Closing until the earliest of (subject to the
continued satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in _Article VII_
at such time), (i) any Business Day during the Marketing Period as may be
specified by Holdings on no less than two (2) Business Days prior written
notice to Seller (it being understood that such date may be conditioned upon
the simultaneous completion of the Debt Financing), (ii) the second (2nd)
Business Day after the final day of the Marketing Period or (iii) such other
date, time or place as agreed to in writing by Holdings and Seller. The day on
which the Closing actually occurs is referred to herein as the " _Closing
Date_." The Closing shall be held by the electronic exchange of documents and
signatures unless another method or place is agreed to in writing by Holdings
and Seller.

 



 

2.4 _Closing Date Estimates; Purchase Price Adjustment_.

 



 

(a) _Estimated Company Closing Balance Sheet and Estimated Company Closing
Statement_. Seller shall prepare and provide to Holdings no later than three
(3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date an estimated consolidated balance
sheet of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the Reference Time (the "
_Estimated Company Closing Balance Sheet_ "), together with a written
statement (the " _Estimated Company Closing Statement_ ") setting forth in
reasonable detail its good faith estimated calculations of the Company Closing
Cash Amount, Company Closing Debt Amount, the Company Net Working Capital, the
Final Reference Amount, the Company Transaction Expenses, and the Purchase
Price and the Rollover Ratio calculated based on such estimates together with
copies of Payoff Letters for all Refinancing Indebtedness and Transaction
Expense Invoices for all Company Transaction Expenses. The Estimated Company
Closing Balance Sheet and the Estimated Company Closing Statement will be
prepared in accordance with the Company Accounting Principles and the
definitions of Company Closing Cash Amount, Company Closing Debt Amount,
Company Net Working Capital, the Final Reference Amount, the Company
Transaction Expenses, the Purchase Price and the Rollover Ratio herein. The
Purchase Price payable at the Closing pursuant to _Section 2.2(b)_ (the "
_Estimated Purchase Price_ ") shall be calculated using the Estimated Company
Closing Statement (subject to any adjustments contemplated by the final
sentence of this _Section 2.4(a)_) and the amounts reflected thereon).
Following the delivery of the Estimated Company Closing Balance Sheet and the
Estimated Company Closing Statement, Seller shall provide Holdings and its
representatives reasonable access to the work papers and other books and
records of the Company and its Subsidiaries for purposes of assisting Holdings
and its representatives in their review of the Estimated Company Closing
Balance Sheet and the Estimated Company Closing Statement. The foregoing
calculations of the Company Closing Cash Amount, Company Closing Debt Amount,
the Company Net Working Capital, the Final Reference Amount, the Company
Transaction Expenses, the Purchase Price and the Rollover Ratio shall be
subject to the reasonable review of Holdings. If Holdings notifies Seller at
any time prior to the Closing of any reasonable objections with respect to any
component of such calculations, then Holdings and Seller shall work in good
faith to revise such calculations as necessary to resolve Holdings objections
such that the calculations are consistent with the requirements of, and
definitions set forth in, this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that if,
after such good faith discussions, Holdings and Seller are not able to resolve
Holdings objections

 



      
 

 



 

within three (3) Business Days after receipt by Holdings of the Estimated
Company Closing Statement, the Estimated Purchase Price shall be calculated
based on the Estimated Company Closing Statement as provided by Seller to
Holdings pursuant to the first sentence of this _Section 2.4(a)_ with such
revisions as have been agreed.

 



 

(b) _Proposed Final Company Closing Balance Sheet and Proposed Final Closing
Statement_. Within ninety (90) calendar days after the Closing Date, Holdings
shall prepare or cause to be prepared, and will provide to Seller a
consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the
Reference Time (the " _Proposed Final Company Closing Balance Sheet_ "),
together with a written statement (the " _Proposed Final Company Closing
Statement_ ") setting forth in reasonable detail its proposed final
determinations of the Company Closing Cash Amount, Company Closing Debt
Amount, Company Net Working Capital, the Final Reference Amount, Company
Transaction Expenses and the Purchase Price. The Proposed Final Company
Closing Balance Sheet and Proposed Final Company Closing Statement will be
prepared in accordance with the Company Accounting Principles and the
definitions of Company Closing Cash Amount, Company Closing Debt Amount,
Company Net Working Capital, the Final Reference Amount, Company Transaction
Expenses and Purchase Price herein. Subject to entry into customary and
reasonable non-disclosure and/or non-reliance agreements, if any are required
by the Companys accountants, Seller and its representatives shall have
reasonable access to the work papers and other books and records of the
Company and its Subsidiaries for purposes of assisting Seller and its
representatives in their review of the Proposed Final Company Closing Balance
Sheet and the Proposed Final Company Closing Statement.

 



 

(c) _Dispute Notice_. The Proposed Final Company Closing Balance Sheet and the
Proposed Final Company Closing Statement (and the proposed final
determinations of the Company Closing Cash Amount, Company Closing Debt
Amount, Company Net Working Capital, the Final Reference Amount, Company
Transaction Expenses and the Purchase Price set forth therein) will be final,
conclusive and binding on the parties unless Seller provides a written notice
(a " _Dispute Notice_ ") to Holdings no later than the forty-fifth (45th) day
after the delivery of the Proposed Final Company Closing Balance Sheet and the
Proposed Final Company Closing Statement. Any Dispute Notice must set forth in
reasonable detail (i) any item on the Proposed Final Company Closing Balance
Sheet or the Proposed Final Company Closing Statement which Seller believes
has not been prepared in accordance with this Agreement (such disputed
amounts, the " _Disputed Amounts_ ") and (ii) Sellers alternative calculation
of each such Disputed Amount and the Purchase Price. Any item or amount set
forth in the Proposed Final Company Closing Balance Sheet or the Proposed
Final Company Closing Statement to which no specific dispute is raised in the
Dispute Notice will be final, conclusive and binding on the parties on the
forty-sixth (46th) day after the delivery to Seller of the Proposed Final
Company Closing Balance Sheet and the Proposed Final Company Closing
Statement.

 



 

(d) _Resolution of Disputes_. Holdings and Seller will in good faith attempt
to promptly resolve any Disputed Amounts and agree upon the Final Purchase
Price (as defined below). Holdings and Seller acknowledge and agree that the
Federal Rules of Evidence Rule 408 shall apply to Holdings and Seller during
such negotiations and any subsequent dispute arising therefrom. Beginning
twenty (20) Business Days after delivery of any Dispute Notice pursuant to
_Section 2.4(c)_, either Holdings or Seller may provide written notice to the
other (the " _Dispute Submission Notice_ ") that it elects to submit the
Disputed Amounts to Ernst and Young

 



      
 

 



 

LLP or another nationally recognized independent accounting firm chosen
jointly by Holdings and Seller (the " _Accounting Firm_ "). In the event that
Ernst and Young LLP has not agreed to act as the Accounting Firm and an
alternative Accounting Firm has not been selected by mutual agreement of
Holdings and Seller within ten (10) Business Days following the giving of the
Dispute Submission Notice, each of Holdings and Seller shall promptly select a
nationally recognized independent accounting firm and promptly cause such two
accounting firms to mutually select a third nationally recognized independent
accounting firm to act as the Accounting Firm within twenty (20) Business Days
of the giving of the Dispute Submission Notice. The Accounting Firm will
promptly, in accordance with the rules set forth in the Accounting Firms
engagement letter and its customary practices (it being agreed and understood
that the Accounting Firm shall act as an arbitrator to determine such Disputed
Amounts), review only those unresolved Disputed Amounts specifically set forth
and objected to in the Dispute Notice and resolve the dispute with respect to
each such remaining Disputed Amount in accordance with this Agreement. In any
such case, the Accounting Firm shall render a written decision as to each
unresolved Disputed Amount, including a statement in reasonable detail of the
basis for its decision and its calculation of the Final Purchase Price based
on such decision, and such decision shall be based solely on (x) the Proposed
Final Closing Statement, the Dispute Notice and any presentations and
information provided by Holdings and Seller, and not on independent review,
and (y) whether the remaining Disputed Amounts contained mathematical errors
or were inconsistent with the Company Accounting Principles or the definitions
and the other applicable provisions of this Agreement. In no event shall the
decision of the Accounting Firm provide for a calculation of any Disputed
Amount that is (i) less than the lower calculation thereof shown in the
disputed Proposed Final Closing Statement or in the Dispute Notice or (ii)
greater than the higher calculation thereof shown in the disputed Proposed
Final Closing Statement or in the Dispute Notice. Holdings and Seller shall
not have any ex parte communications with the Accounting Firm and any
presentations and information provided to the Accounting Firm by a party shall
be concurrently provided to the other party. The fees and expenses of the
Accounting Firm shall be apportioned among Seller and Holdings based upon the
relative extent to which the positions of Seller and Holdings are upheld by
the Accounting Firm. The relative extent to which such positions are upheld
will be determined by comparing (x) the difference between the actual Purchase
Price as finally determined pursuant to this _Section 2.4(d)_ and the
Purchase Price assuming all of the positions asserted by Holdings in the
Proposed Final Company Closing Statement had been upheld in their entirety by
the Accounting Firm and (y) the difference between the actual Purchase Price
as finally determined pursuant to this _Section 2.4(d)_ and the Purchase
Price assuming all of the positions asserted by Seller in the Dispute Notice
had been upheld in their entirety by the Accounting Firm. By way of
illustration, if Holdings calculations would have resulted in a $100,000 net
payment from Seller to Holdings, Seller calculations would have resulted in a
$100,000 net payment to Seller from Holdings and the Accounting Firms final
determination results in an aggregate net payment of $50,000 to Seller under
_Section 2.4(e)_, Holdings and Seller shall pay 75% and 25%, respectively, of
such fees and expenses. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, all
other costs and expenses incurred by the parties in connection with resolving
any Disputed Amounts hereunder before the Accounting Firm shall be borne by
the party incurring such cost and expense. The decision of the Accounting Firm
with respect to any Disputed Amounts submitted to it will be final, conclusive
and binding on the parties. Each of the parties to this Agreement agrees to
use its commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with the Accounting Firm
(including by

 



      
 

 



 

executing a customary engagement letter reasonably acceptable to it) and to
cause the Accounting Firm to resolve any such dispute as soon as practicable
after the commencement of the Accounting Firms engagement.]

 



 

(e) _Purchase Price Adjustment_. As used herein, the " _Final Purchase Price_
" shall mean (i) if a Dispute Notice is not delivered within the forty-five
(45) day period provided in _Section 2.4(c)_, the Purchase Price reflected in
the Proposed Final Company Closing Statement as prepared by Holdings or (ii)
if such a Dispute Notice is delivered within the forty-five (45) day period
provided in _Section 2.4(c)_, the Purchase Price as finally determined
pursuant to the dispute resolution provisions of this _Section 2.4_
reflecting (x) adjustments agreed to in writing by Holdings and Seller with
respect to any matters raised in the Dispute Notice that are resolved by
agreement of the parties and (y) adjustments made pursuant to the decision of
the Accounting Firm with respect to any Disputed Amounts that are resolved by
the Accounting Firm in accordance with _Section 2.4(d)_. If the Final
Purchase Price differs from the Estimated Purchase Price, (A) Buyer shall pay
(or cause to be paid) to Seller by wire transfer of immediately available
funds the amount, if any, by which such Final Purchase Price exceeds the
Estimated Purchase Price (without any interest thereon) or (B) Seller shall
pay to Buyer by wire transfer of immediately available funds the amount, if
any, by which the Estimated Purchase Price exceeds such Final Purchase Price
(without any interest thereon). Any such payment shall be made within five (5)
Business Days of the determination of the Final Purchase Price pursuant to
this _Section 2.4_.

 



 

(f) _Tax Matters_. Payment of any amount owed pursuant to this _Section 2.4_
shall be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for federal, state,
local and non-U.S. income Tax purposes.

 



 

(g) _Buyer Net Debt Amount_. Buyer shall prepare and provide to Seller no
later than three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date a certificate
setting forth a good faith estimated calculation of the Buyer Net Debt Amount
as of the Closing together with reasonable supporting documentation.

 



 

2.5 _Withholding_.

 



 

Holdings, Buyer, the Company, Seller and each other applicable withholding
agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts payable
pursuant to this Agreement any withholding Taxes or other amounts required
under the Code or any applicable Law to be deducted and withheld and any
amounts so deducted or withheld shall be timely remitted by the withholding
party to the applicable Taxing Authority. Upon becoming aware of any such
withholding obligation, the withholding party shall provide notice to the
Person with respect to whom such withholding obligation applies and shall
cooperate with such Person to the extent reasonable, in the context of the
timing of the Closing and the need to withhold at the Closing, to obtain
reduction of or relief from such deduction or withholding. To the extent that
any such amounts are deducted or withheld and remitted by the withholding
party to the applicable Taxing Authority, such amounts shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made.

 



      
 

 



 

ARTICLE III 
_Representations and Warranties Regarding the Company_

 



 

Except as set forth in the corresponding sections of the Company Disclosure
Schedule (it being agreed that any matter disclosed in the Company Disclosure
Schedule with respect to any section of this Agreement shall be deemed to have
been disclosed with respect to any other section to the extent the
applicability thereto is reasonably apparent on its face), each of the Company
and Seller hereby represents and warrants to Buyer, Holdings and Newco as
follows:

 



 

3.1 _Organization and Power_.

 



 

The Company and each of its Subsidiaries is a corporation or legal entity duly
incorporated, organized or formed, validly existing and in good standing under
the Laws of its respective jurisdiction of incorporation, organization or
formation. The Company has full power and authority to execute, deliver and
perform this Agreement and to consummate the Contemplated Transactions. The
Company and each of its Subsidiaries has all power and authority, and
possesses all governmental licenses and permits necessary to enable it, to own
or lease and to operate its properties and assets and carry on its business as
currently conducted, except such power, authority, licenses and permits the
absence of which do not have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company
and each of its Subsidiaries are duly licensed or qualified to do business and
are in good standing in the jurisdictions set forth on _Section 3.1_ of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, which are the only jurisdictions where the nature
of the property owned or leased by the Company or its Subsidiaries or the
nature of the business conducted makes such qualification necessary, except
where failure to so qualify would not, individually or in the aggregate, be
reasonably expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. True and
complete copies of the Company Charter Documents, each as in effect as of the
date of this Agreement, have previously been made available by the Company to
Holdings. Each Company Charter Document is in full force and effect as of the
date of this Agreement, and the Company and its Subsidiaries are not in
material violation of their respective Company Charter Documents.

 



 

3.2 _Authorization and Enforceability_.

 



 

The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the performance by the
Company of the Contemplated Transactions that are required to be performed by
the Company have been duly authorized by the Company and no other corporate
proceedings on the part of the Company (including, without limitation, any
shareholder or board of directors vote or approval) are necessary to authorize
the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement or the consummation
of the Contemplated Transactions that are required to be performed by the
Company. This Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by
the Company, and, assuming due execution and delivery of this Agreement by
Buyer, Holdings, Newco and Seller, constitutes a valid and legally binding
agreement of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with
their terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization and other Laws
of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors rights and to
general equity principles.

 



       
 

 



 

3.3 _Capitalization of the Company and its Subsidiaries_.

 



 

(a) _The Company_. The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of
10,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of which 10 shares
are issued and outstanding and owned of record and beneficially by Seller
(prior to giving effect to the Rollover). All outstanding shares of Common
Stock are duly authorized, have been validly issued and are fully paid and
non-assessable, were not issued in violation of any preemptive or similar
rights, and were issued in compliance with applicable securities Laws or
exemptions therefrom. Except for the shares of Common Stock owned and held by
Seller, no other Equity Securities of the Company are issued, reserved for
issuance or outstanding. No bonds, debentures, notes or other Indebtedness
that have the right to vote on any matters on which stockholders of Company
may vote are issued or outstanding (or which is convertible into or
exchangeable for, Equity Securities having such rights). There are no rights
to subscribe for or to purchase, or any agreements providing for the issuance
(contingent or otherwise) of, any Equity Securities of the Company. There are
no outstanding obligations of the Company or any its Subsidiaries to
repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any Equity Securities of the Company.
There are no outstanding options, warrants, calls, convertible securities,
exchangeable securities, rights, puts, commitments or agreements of any
character, written or oral, to which the Company is or will be a party or by
which it is bound providing for the issuance, delivery, sale, transfer,
registration, disposition or acquisition, repurchase or redemption of any of
the Companys Equity Securities or obligating the Company to grant, extend or
enter into any such option, warrant, call, convertible security, exchangeable
security, right, put, commitment or agreement. There are no outstanding or
authorized stock appreciation, phantom stock or other similar rights with
respect to the Company. There are no stockholder agreements, voting trusts,
proxies or other similar contracts, agreements, arrangements, commitments,
plans or understandings relating to the voting, dividend, ownership or
transfer rights of any Equity Securities of the Company.

 



 

(b) _Subsidiaries_. _Section 3.3(b)(i)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule
sets forth a true and correct list of all Subsidiaries of the Company, listing
for each Subsidiary of the Company its name, its jurisdiction of
incorporation, organization or formation, its authorized Equity Securities,
the number and type of its issued and outstanding Equity Securities and the
current record and beneficial ownership of such Equity Securities. All the
outstanding Equity Securities of each of the Companys Subsidiaries are
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable (to the extent applicable), have
not been issued in violation of any preemptive or similar rights, and, other
than the outstanding Equity Securities of the Company Professional
Associations, are owned, directly or indirectly, by the Company free and clear
of any Lien other than Company Permitted Liens. Except as set forth in
_Section 3.3(b)(ii)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, there are no rights
to subscribe for or to purchase, or any agreements providing for the issuance
(contingent or otherwise) of, any Equity Securities of the Companys
Subsidiaries. There are no outstanding or authorized stock appreciation,
phantom stock or other similar rights with respect to any of the Companys
Subsidiaries. Except as set forth in _Section 3.3(b)(iii)_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, none of the Companys Subsidiaries is a party to any
right of first refusal, right of first offer, proxy, voting agreement, voting
trust, registration rights agreement, shareholders agreement or similar
agreement with respect to the sale or voting of any Equity Securities of the
Companys Subsidiaries. Except as set forth in _Section 3.3(b)(i)_ of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, neither the Company nor any Subsidiary of the
Company owns

 



      
 

 



 

or controls any Equity Security or other interest, or has the right to acquire
any Equity Securities, of any other corporation, partnership, limited
liability company or other business entity.

 



 

3.4 _No Violation_.

 



 

The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of this Agreement,
consummation of the Contemplated Transactions that are required to be
performed by the Company and compliance with the terms of this Agreement will
not (a) conflict with or constitute or result in any violation of any
provision of the Company Charter Documents, (b) assuming that all consents,
approvals and authorizations contemplated by _Section 3.5_ have been obtained
and all filings described therein have been made, conflict with or constitute
or result in any violation of any Law applicable to the Company or to any of
its Subsidiaries or by which its or any of their respective properties is
bound or affected in any material respect, (c) except as set forth in _Section
3.4_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, conflict with, constitute or result
in any violation or default (with or without notice or passage of time, or
both) under, or give rise to a right of termination, modification,
cancellation or acceleration of any obligation under any Company Material
Contract to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or any
material Company Permit, or (d) result in the creation of, or require the
creation of, any Lien upon any shares of capital stock of the Company other
than Company Permitted Liens, except, in the case of clause (c), to the extent
such conflict, violation, default, termination, modification, cancellation or
acceleration would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

3.5 _Governmental Authorizations and Consents_.

 



 

No consents, licenses, permits, waivers, approvals or authorizations of, or
registrations, notices, declarations or filings with, any Governmental
Authority (" _Governmental Consents_ ") are required to be obtained or made by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the execution,
delivery and performance of this Agreement or the consummation by the Company
of the Contemplated Transactions, other than (a) a filing with the FTC and the
DOJ under the HSR Act, (b) those Governmental Consents listed in _Section
3.5_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, and (c) those Governmental Consents
for which the failure to obtain such Governmental Consents would not be
reasonably expected to be, individually or in the aggregate, material to the
Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole.

 



 

3.6 _Financial Statements_.

 



 

(a) _Section 3.6(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth (i) the
audited consolidated balance sheets of the Company and the Subsidiaries of the
Company as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2016 and the related
consolidated statements of operations, changes in shareholders equity and
cash flows for the years then ended, together with appropriate notes to such
financial statements and accompanied by the report of the Companys
independent public accountants with respect thereto (the " _Audited Company
Financial Statements_ "), and (ii) the unaudited consolidated balance sheet of
the Company and the Subsidiaries of the Company as of August 31, 2017 (the "
_Company Current Balance Sheet Date_ " and such balance sheet, the " _Company
Current Balance Sheet_ ") and the related consolidated statements of
operations and cash flows for the eight (8)-month period then ended (the

 



      
 

 



 

" _Unaudited Company Financial Statements_ " and, together with the Audited
Company Financial Statements, the " _Company Financial Statements_ "). The
Company Financial Statements and, upon and following delivery, the
Supplemental Financial Statements (i) have been prepared in accordance with
GAAP consistently applied throughout the periods indicated (except that the
Unaudited Company Financial Statements do not contain all the notes that may
be required by GAAP and are subject to normal, recurring year-end adjustments
consistent with past practice that would not, individually or in the
aggregate, be material in amount), (ii) were derived from the historical
accounting records of Seller, and (iii) fairly present the financial position
and related results of operations, cash flows and Sellers net investment in a
manner consistent with how Seller managed the Company and its Subsidiaries.
None of the Company or the Seller makes any representation or warranty with
regard to accounts receivable reserves of the Company and its Subsidiaries set
forth in the Company Financial Statements and the Supplemental Financial
Statements so long as such reserves are maintained consistent with past
practices of the Company.

 



 

(b) The Company and its Subsidiaries do not have any liability, commitment,
debt or obligation of any nature whatsoever, whether direct or indirect,
absolute or contingent, accrued or unaccrued, that would be required to be
disclosed or reserved against on an audited consolidated balance sheet (or in
the notes thereto) prepared in accordance with GAAP, other than those (i) that
are reflected on the most recent balance sheet of the Company and its
Subsidiaries included in the Unaudited Company Financial Statements; (ii) that
have arisen or are incurred since the Company Current Balance Sheet Date in
the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice (none of which
is a liability for breach of contract or violation of Law); (iii) that are
taken into account in the calculation of the Purchase Price as Company
Indebtedness or Company Transaction Expenses; or (iv) that, individually or in
the aggregate, would not be reasonably expected to be material to the Company
and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole.

 



 

(c) _Section 3.6(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule lists all Company
Indebtedness outstanding as of the date of this Agreement.

 



 

(d) Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries maintains and complies in all
material respects with a system of accounting controls sufficient to provide
reasonable assurances that (i) its business is operated, in all material
respects, in accordance with managements general or specific authorization
and with applicable Laws, (ii) material transactions are recorded as necessary
to permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP and to
maintain accountability for material items therein and (iii) access to
properties and assets is permitted, in all material respects, in accordance
with managements general or specific authorization. Except as set forth on
_Section 3.6(d)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, in the past two (2)
years there has not been (x) any significant deficiency or material weakness
in any system of internal accounting controls used by the Company or its
Subsidiaries, (y) any fraud with respect to the Company or its Subsidiaries
that involves any of the management or other employees of the Company or its
Subsidiaries who have a role in the preparation of financial statements or the
internal accounting controls used by the Company or its Subsidiaries or (z)
any claim or written allegation regarding any of the foregoing.

 



      
 

 



 

3.7 _Absence of Certain Changes_.

 



 

Since the Company Current Balance Sheet Date through the date hereof, each of
the Company and its Subsidiaries has conducted its business in the ordinary
course and in a manner consistent with past practice, and since December 31,
2016 through the date hereof, there has not been any event, circumstance or
change in the businesses, operations or financial conditions of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries that has had or would reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, except as reflected on the Company
Financial Statements or set forth in _Section 3.7_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, since the Company Current Balance Sheet Date through the date
hereof, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has:

 



 

(a) acquired (including by merger, consolidation, acquisition of stock or
equity) a substantial portion of the assets of, any Person, or business or
division thereof which acquisition provides for a total financial commitment
of the Company and/or any of its Subsidiaries in excess of $2,500,000 (other
than inventory in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice);

 



 

(b) incurred, assumed, guaranteed or discharged any Company Indebtedness,
except in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice;

 



 

(c) amended, modified or authorized the amendment of any Company Charter
Documents;

 



 

(d) declared or paid any non-cash dividend or made any non-cash distribution
in respect of any of its Equity Securities or issued, sold or otherwise
permitted to become outstanding any Equity Securities, or split, combined,
reclassified, repurchased or redeemed any of its Equity Securities;

 



 

(e) sold, leased, transferred, mortgaged, assigned or encumbered any of the

promulgated under the Securities Act.

 



 

(c) Seller has been advised that the offer and sale of the Newco Equity has
not been registered under the Securities Act or any other securities Laws,
that the Newco Equity may not be offered, sold or otherwise disposed of unless
such offer and sale are registered thereunder or an exemption from

period of time. Seller also understands (i) that Newco does not have any
intention of registering the offer and sale of the Newco Equity under the
Securities Act or any other securities Laws, (ii) as of the date of this

of the Securities and Exchange Commission or any other Governmental Authority.

 



 

(e) Seller is not a "bad actor," as that term is defined in paragraph (d) of
Rule 506 of the Securities Act, and Newco may therefore rely on any exemption

ARTICLE V 
_Representations and Warranties of Buyer, Holdings and Newco_

 



 

Except as set forth in the corresponding sections of the Buyer Disclosure
Schedule (it being agreed that any matter disclosed in the Buyer Disclosure
Schedule with respect to any section of this Agreement shall be deemed to have
been disclosed with respect to any other section to the extent the
applicability thereto is reasonably apparent on its face), each of Buyer,
Holdings and Newco hereby represents and warrants to Seller as follows:

 



 

5.1 _Organization and Power_.

 



 

Each of Holdings, its Subsidiaries (including Buyer) and Newco is a
corporation or legal entity duly incorporated, organized or formed, validly
existing and in good standing under the Laws of its respective jurisdiction of
incorporation, organization or formation. Each of Buyer, Holdings and Newco
has full power and authority to execute, deliver and perform this Agreement
and to consummate the Contemplated Transactions. Each of Holdings and Newco
and each of their respective Subsidiaries has all power and authority, and
possesses all governmental licenses and permits necessary to enable it, to own
or lease and to operate its properties and assets and carry on its business as
currently conducted, except such power, authority, licenses and permits the
absence of which do not have a Buyer Material Adverse Effect. Holdings, Newco,
and each of their respective Subsidiaries are duly licensed or qualified to do
business and are in good standing in the jurisdictions set forth on _Section
5.1_ of the Buyer Disclosure Schedule, which are the only jurisdictions where
the nature of the property owned or leased by Holdings or its Subsidiaries or
the nature of the business conducted makes such qualification necessary,
except where failure to so qualify would not, individually or in the
aggregate, be reasonably expected to have a Buyer Material Adverse Effect.
Each Buyer Charter Document is in full force and effect as of the date of this
Agreement, and none of Holdings, Newco or any of their respective Subsidiaries
is in material violation of its respective Buyer Charter Documents.

 



 

5.2 _Authorization and Enforceability_.

 



 

The execution and delivery of this Agreement, and the performance by Buyer,
Holdings and Newco of the Contemplated Transactions that are required to be
performed by Buyer, Holdings and Newco have been duly authorized by Buyer,
Holdings and Newco and no other proceedings on the part of Buyer, Holdings or
Newco (including, without limitation, any stockholder, member, manager or
board of directors vote or approval) are necessary to authorize the execution,
delivery and performance of this Agreement, or the consummation of the

 



      
 

 



 

Contemplated Transactions that are required to be performed by Buyer, Holdings
and Newco. This Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by
Buyer, Holdings and Newco, and, assuming due execution and delivery of this
Agreement by the Company and Seller, constitutes a valid and legally binding
agreement of each of Buyer, Holdings and Newco, enforceable against Buyer,
Holdings and Newco in accordance with its terms, subject to bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization and other Laws of general applicability relating to
or affecting creditors rights and to general equity principles.

Agreement, Buyer has no reason to believe that it will be unable to satisfy
any condition to the Debt Financing set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter on
a timely basis or that the Debt Financing will not be available to the Buyer
at the Closing, including any reason to believe on the date of this Agreement
that the Commitment Party will not perform its funding obligations under the

conditions.

Affiliates combines in such a transaction, is not engaged primarily in a
Restricted Business (as such term is defined in the Amended and Restated Newco
Operating Agreement).

 



 

6.4 _Certain Tax Matters_.

 



 

(a) _Tax Return Preparation_.

 



 

(i) Seller shall include the income of the Company (including any deferred
items triggered into income by Treasury Regulation section 1.1502-13 and any
excess loss account taken into income under Treasury Regulation section
1.1502-19) on Sellers consolidated U.S. federal income Tax Return and any
applicable state unitary, combined or consolidated Tax Returns for all taxable
periods through the end of the Closing Date and shall pay any U.S. federal and
state income Taxes attributable to such income (" _Seller Group Income Taxes_
"). Any deductions for payments of Company Transaction Expenses shall be
allocated to Sellers consolidated U.S. federal Tax Return in accordance with
Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-76(b)(1). The income of the Company shall
be apportioned to the period up to and including the Closing Date and the
period after the Closing Date by closing the books of the Company as of the
end of the Closing Date, and Seller shall indemnify and hold harmless
Holdings, Newco, Buyer, the Company and the Companys Subsidiaries for any
Seller Group Income Taxes and for the reasonable out-of-pocket costs and
expenses, including reasonable professional fees and disbursements, of
asserting its rights with respect to such Seller Group Income Taxes under this
_Section 6.4(a)(i)_.

 



 

(ii) The Company shall (and Seller shall cause the Company to) prepare, or
cause to be prepared, and file, or cause to be filed, on a timely basis all
Tax Returns of the Company and its Subsidiaries that are due with respect to a
Pre-Closing Tax Period (other than Tax Returns described in _Section
6.4(a)(i)_) and shall pay all Taxes shown as due with respect to such Tax
Returns. Seller shall indemnify and hold harmless Holdings, Newco, Buyer, the
Company and the Companys Subsidiaries for any Pre-Closing Taxes and for the
reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses, including reasonable professional
fees and disbursements, with respect to Pre-Closing Taxes, except for Taxes
specifically taken into account in Company Net Working Capital as finally
determined.

 



      
 

 



 

(iii) The Company shall (and Holdings shall cause the Company to) prepare, or
cause to be prepared, and file, or cause to be filed, on a timely basis all
Tax Returns of the Company and its Subsidiaries that are due after the Closing
Date and that include a Pre-Closing Tax Period (other than Tax Returns
described in _Sections 6.4(a)(i)_ and _(ii)_ ). All such Tax Returns shall be
prepared in a manner consistent with past practice of the Company and its
Subsidiaries unless otherwise required by applicable Law. The Company shall
(and Holdings shall cause the Company to) provide Seller with a draft copy of
each such Tax Return at least twenty (20) days prior to the filing of such Tax
Return for its review and comment and, with respect to each such Tax Return,
shall make such changes that are reasonably requested by Seller and shall not
file such Tax Return without the prior written consent of Seller, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. The
Company shall (and Holdings shall cause the Company to) timely pay all Taxes
shown as due with respect to Tax Returns filed pursuant to this _Section
6.4(a)(iii)_. Within ten (10) Business Days of Sellers receipt of written
notice that the Company intends to file any such Tax Return, Seller shall pay
to the Company an amount equal to any Tax liabilities with respect to such Tax
Returns that are Pre-Closing Taxes that were unpaid as of the Closing Date,
except to the extent such Tax liabilities were specifically included in
Company Net Working Capital as finally determined. Within fifteen (15) days of
filing any Tax Return that includes a Pre-Closing Tax Period, the Company
and/or Holdings shall pay to Seller the amount, if any, by which any amount
paid (or deemed to have been paid) as of the Closing in respect of such Tax
Return exceeds the liability of the Company for any Pre-Closing Taxes with
respect to such Tax Return. For the avoidance of doubt, Pre-Closing Taxes
shall be considered to be paid as of the Closing Date to the extent the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries has made estimated or similar Tax payments
or has otherwise pre-paid any Taxes, including by applying any entitlement to
a refund of, or credit for, Taxes against any current or future Tax liability.

 



 

(iv) Holdings and the Company shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, and
file, or cause to be filed, on a timely basis all Tax Returns of the Company
Professional Associations that are due after the Closing Date. All such Tax
Returns that include a Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be prepared in a manner
consistent with past practice of the Company and each such Company
Professional Association unless otherwise required by applicable Law.

 



 

(v) Except to the extent required pursuant to a final determination by a
Taxing Authority, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall (and
Holdings shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries not to) amend any Tax
Return with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period without the prior written
consent of Seller, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed.

 



 

(b) _Tax Contests_. Holdings shall notify Seller within ten (10) Business Days
after receipt of written notice of any pending or threatened Tax Contest which
may give rise to an indemnification payment under this _Section 6.4_. Seller
shall notify Holdings within ten (10) Business Days after receipt of written
notice of any pending or threatened Tax Contest related to Seller Group Income
Taxes. Holdings shall control the conduct of all Tax Contests and Seller may,
at its own expense, observe the defense of such Tax Contests and employ
counsel of its own choice in connection with such Tax Contests. Holdings shall
(x) keep Seller informed with respect to all matters relating to such Tax
Contests, (y) upon request of Seller, reasonably consult with Seller regarding
the conduct of such Tax Contests.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) _Cooperation on Tax Matters_. The Company shall (and Holdings shall cause
the Company to) and Seller shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent
reasonably requested by the other party, in connection with the filing of Tax
Returns pursuant to this _Section 6.4_ and any Tax Contest. Such cooperation
shall include the retention and (upon the other partys request) the provision
of records and information which are reasonably relevant to any such Tax
Contest and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to
provide additional information and explanation of any material provided
hereunder. The Company and Seller agree (and Holdings shall cause the Company)
(x) to retain all books and records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to
the Company relating to any Pre-Closing Tax Period until the expiration of the
statute of limitations (and, to the extent notified by the Company or Seller,
any extensions thereof) of the respective taxable periods, and to abide by all
record retention agreements entered into with any Taxing Authority, and (y) to
give the other party reasonable written notice prior to transferring,
destroying or discarding any such books and records and, if the other so
requests, the Company shall (and Holdings shall cause the Company to) or
Seller shall, as the case may be, allow the other to take possession of such
books and records.

 



 

(d) _Certain Taxes_. Any Transfer Taxes shall be paid one-half by Buyer and
one-half by Seller. The party required by Law to do so shall (or shall cause
its Affiliate to) file all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with
respect to all such Transfer Taxes and, if required by applicable Law, the
other parties will, and will cause their Affiliates to, join in the execution
of any such Tax Returns and other documentation, and the aggregate out-of-
pocket fees and expenses incurred in the preparation of such Tax Returns will
be borne one-half by Buyer and one-half by Seller.

 



 

(e) _Refunds; Carryforwards and Carrybacks_. The Company shall pay, or cause
the applicable Company Subsidiary (and Holdings shall cause the Company or the
applicable Subsidiary) to pay, to Seller the amount of any refund or credit of
Pre-Closing Taxes claimed on any Tax Return prepared and filed pursuant to
_Sections 6.4(a)(ii)_ and _(iii)_ above within fifteen (15) days after any
such refund is received or the benefit of any such credit is received through
a reduction of a Tax payment, net of any Taxes or out-of-pocket costs and
expenses, including reasonable professional fees and disbursements, incurred
in connection with the receipt of such refund or credit, except to the extent
such refunds or credits were included in Company Net Working Capital as
finally determined; for avoidance of doubt, the Company shall be entitled to
any other refund or credit of Pre-Closing Taxes (other than refunds with
respect to any Tax return described in _Section 6.4(a)(i)_). To the extent
permitted by Law, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall elect to carry
forward any Tax attribute (including without limitation any net operating
loss, charitable contribution, or other item) arising after the Closing Date
that could otherwise be carried back into a Pre-Closing Tax Period in which
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries was included in a Tax Return of the
Seller Group. To the extent such carrybacks are required by Law, the Company
shall be entitled to the benefit of any refund, credit, or reduction in Tax
realized by the Seller Group as a result of such carryback and the Seller
shall pay, or cause the applicable Seller Group member to pay, to the Company
the amount of any refund or credit realized, reduced by any Taxes or other
costs, including reasonable professional fees and disbursements, incurred in
connection with the obtaining or receipt of such refund, as a result of such
carryback within fifteen (15) days after a refund is received or the benefit
of any credit is received through a reduction of a Tax payment, except to the
extent such refunds or credits were included in Company Net Working Capital as
finally determined; _provided_ , that in

 



      
 

 



 

the event any such claim of refund or credit is subsequently limited or
disallowed by the relevant Taxing Authority, Buyer and the Company shall
promptly repay the amount of such refund or credit to Seller and Buyer and the
Company shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller for any Tax or other
liabilities related to such refund and any reasonable out-of-pocket costs and
expenses, including reasonable professional fees and disbursements, incurred
in connection with such limitation or disallowance. For purposes of this
_Section 6.4(e)_, if Seller reimburses Holdings or Buyer for Post-Closing
Employee Payments and any reduction in Tax is realized by Buyer, any
Subsidiary of Buyer, the Company, or any Subsidiary of the Company with
respect to a Post-Closing Employee Payment in the year such amount is paid by
Buyer, any Subsidiary of Buyer, the Company, or any Subsidiary of the Company,
such reduction, as calculated under this _Section 6.4(e)_, shall be
considered a refund of Pre-Closing Taxes described in the first sentence of
this _Section 6.4(e)_ received by the Buyer thirty (30) days after the
applicable entity or entities have filed the Tax Return for the Tax period
that includes the payment of a Post-Closing Employee Payment. For purposes of
the preceding sentence, the reduction shall be calculated as the excess (if
any) of Taxes for such Tax period that such entity would be required to pay
without reduction for allowable deductions for Post-Closing Employee Payments
over the actual amount of Taxes for such Tax period actually payable by such
entity taking Post-Closing Employee Payments into account treating allowable
Tax deductions for a Post-Closing Employee Payment as the last item deducted
in computing Taxes. Any amount required to be paid by the Company, Buyer or
any of their Subsidiaries to the Seller under this _Section 6.4(e)_ shall be
reduced by any unreimbursed amounts owed from the Seller to the Company, Buyer
or any of their Subsidiaries under _Section 2.2(d)_ and _Section 6.4_.

 



 

(f) _Tax Sharing Agreements_. All Tax sharing agreements, Tax indemnification
agreements, or similar agreements with respect to or involving the Company or
its Subsidiaries and any other Person shall be terminated on or before Closing
Date and all effects of such terminations shall be deemed to occur before the
Closing Date. After the Closing Date, neither Holdings nor its Subsidiaries
shall be bound by any such terminated Tax sharing agreements, Tax
indemnification agreements or similar agreements or have any liability
thereunder.

 



 

(g) The parties agree to treat the Reorganization and the Rollover as a
transaction that qualifies as an exchange described in Section 351 of the Code
for federal income tax purposes, and as an exchange under any analogous
provision of state or local income tax law. The parties will file all Tax
Returns in a manner consistent with that position. In addition, each party
will, and will cause its Subsidiaries to, avoid taking steps that would cause
the Reorganization and the Rollover to fail to qualify as an exchange
described in Section 351.

 



 

6.5 _Employee Matters_.

 



 

(a) For a period of one (1) year following the Closing Date (but not beyond
any individuals termination of employment), Buyer shall, or shall cause one
of its Affiliates to, provide to each employee of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries who continues to be employed by the Company or any of the
Subsidiaries of the Company on or after the Closing Date (the " _Company
Employees_ ") to receive either (i) the base salary, hourly wages and target
cash bonus opportunity amount that are no less than those that were provided
to such Company Employee immediately prior to the Closing, or (ii) the base
salary, hourly wages and target cash

 



      
 

 



 

bonus opportunity amount that are no less than those that are provided to an
employee of the Buyer or its Subsidiaries that is similarly situated to such
Company Employee (it being understood that the selection of (i) or (ii) at any
given time shall be in Buyers sole discretion). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, none of Buyer, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates
shall be obligated to continue to employ any Company Employee for any specific
period of time following the Closing Date.

 



 

(b) For a period of one (1) year following the Closing Date (but not beyond
any individuals termination of employment), Buyer shall, or shall cause its
Affiliates to, provide the Company Employee with either (i) employee benefits
(excluding benefits under any defined benefit pension, change in control,
retention, nonqualified deferred compensation, retiree welfare or equity or
equity-based plan or arrangement and excluding benefits and compensation
provided for in _Section 6.5(a)_ and _Section 6.18_) that are no less
favorable in the aggregate to the employee benefits (excluding benefits under
any defined benefit pension, change in control, retention, nonqualified
deferred compensation, retiree welfare or equity or equity-based plan or
arrangement and excluding benefits and compensation provided for in _Section
6.5(a)_ and _Section 6.18_) as those provided to the Company Employees
immediately prior to the Closing, or (ii) employee benefits (excluding
benefits under any defined benefit pension, change in control, retention,
nonqualified deferred compensation, retiree welfare or equity or equity-based
plan or arrangement and excluding benefits and compensation provided for in
_Section 6.5(a)_ and _Section 6.18_) that are no less favorable in the
aggregate to the employee benefits (excluding benefits under any defined
benefit pension, change in control, retention, nonqualified deferred
compensation, retiree welfare or equity or equity-based plan or arrangement
and excluding benefits and compensation provided for in _Section 6.5(a)_ and
_Section 6.18_) provided to an employee of the Buyer or its Subsidiaries that
is similarly situated to such Company Employee (it being understood that the
selection of (i) or (ii) at any given time shall be in Buyers sole
discretion). Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Buyer, the Company nor any
of their respective Affiliates shall be obligated to continue to employ any
Company Employee for any specific period of time following the Closing Date.

 



 

(c) For purposes of participation of a Company Employee in any "employee
benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, whether or not subject to
ERISA), or other employee benefit plans or compensation arrangements
maintained by Buyer or its Affiliates (including the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries after the Closing) (a " _Buyer Benefit Plan_ "), each Company
Employee shall be credited with all years of service for which such Company
Employee was credited under the comparable Company Plan in which such Company
Employee participated prior to the Closing, except to the extent such credit
would result in a duplication of benefits. In addition, and without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, Buyer shall use commercially reasonable
efforts, or shall cause its Affiliates to use commercially reasonable efforts:
(i) to enable each Company Employee to be immediately eligible to participate,
without any waiting time, in any and all Buyer Benefit Plans to the extent
that coverage under such Buyer Benefit Plans replaces coverage under
comparable Company Plans in which such Company Employee participated; and (ii)
for purposes of each Buyer Benefit Plan providing medical, dental,
pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any Company Employee, to cause (A)
all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of
such Buyer Benefit Plan to be waived for such Company Employee and his or her
covered dependents to the extent so waived or satisfied under the comparable
Company Plan immediately prior to the Closing,

 



      
 

 



 

and (B) any eligible expenses incurred by such Company Employee and his or her
covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Company Benefit
Plan ending on the date such Company Employees participation in the
corresponding Buyer Benefit Plan begins to be taken into account under such
Buyer Benefit Plan for the plan year in which such Company Employees
participation in such Buyer Benefit Plan begins for purposes of satisfying all
deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to
such Company Employee and his or her covered dependents for such year as if
such amounts had been paid in accordance with such Buyer Benefit Plan.

 



 

(d) Buyer shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, (i) credit each of the
Company Employees with an amount of paid vacation and sick leave days
following the Closing Date equal to the amount of vacation time and sick leave
days each such Company Employee has accrued but not yet used or cashed out as
of the Closing Date under the vacation and sick leave policies of the Company
and its Subsidiaries as in effect immediately prior to the Closing Date, but
only to the extent such amounts are treated as a "current liability" in
Company Net Working Capital and (ii) allow each of the Company Employees to
use such accrued vacation and sick leave days at such times as each would have
been allowed under the vacation and sick leave policies of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as in effect immediately prior to the Closing Date as set forth
on _Section 6.5(d)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

 



 

(e) Provided that, no later than the Closing Date, Seller provides Holdings
with a complete and accurate list of all Company Employees who have
experienced an employment loss within the meaning of the Worker Adjustment and
Retraining Notification Act (" _WARN_ ") or similar Laws or regulations of any
jurisdiction relating to any plant closing or mass layoff (or similar
triggering event) within ninety (90) days of the Closing Date, along with the
work location, date of hire and full- or part-time status of such Company
Employees, Buyer shall be solely responsible for compliance with WARN and
similar Laws or regulations of any jurisdiction relating to any plant closing
or mass layoff (or similar triggering event) resulting from the Companys or
Buyers actions with respect to the Company Employees after the Closing Date.

 



 

(f) This Agreement is not intended to and shall not be construed to (i) amend,
modify or terminate or be the adoption of any Company Plan, any Buyer Benefit
Plan or any other employee benefit plan, program or arrangement (whether or
not subject to ERISA), (ii) affect Holdings or, following the Closing, the
Companys or any of its Subsidiaries ability to (A) amend, modify or
terminate any Company Plan, any Buyer Benefit Plan or any other employee
benefit plan, program or arrangement or (B) terminate the employment or
service or any employee, director, officer or independent contractor. Nothing
in this _Section 6.5_ shall confer upon any Person that is not a party to
this Agreement (including any current or former employee, director, officer or
independent contractor of the Company or Subsidiary of the Company) any right
to enforce any provision of this Agreement.

 



 

(g) The Company shall terminate the U.S. HealthWorks Holding Company Inc. Long
Term Incentive Plan (the " _LTIP_ ") (including all performance periods then
in progress) with effect as of the Closing Date and shall provide Holdings
with evidence of such termination that is reasonably acceptable to Holdings.
From and after the termination of the LTIP and the Closing, no Person shall be
entitled to earn any additional amounts under the LTIP. Nothing in

 



      
 

 



 

this _Section 6.5(g)_ shall limit the ability of the Company to make payments
due under any Contract set forth on _Schedule 1.1(a)_ in connection with the
termination of such Contract prior to the Closing.

 



 

(h) Neither the Company nor any of its Affiliates shall permit (i) any person
who is not a participant in the U.S. HealthWorks Deferred Compensation Plan,
effective as of June 30, 2014, as amended from time to time (the " _Deferred
Compensation Plan_ ") as of the date immediately preceding the date of this
Agreement to become a participant in the Deferred Compensation Plan from and
after the date of this Agreement and (ii) any new deferral election to be made
under the Deferred Compensation Plan from and after the date of this
Agreement. The Company may terminate the Deferred Compensation Plan at any
time in accordance with the terms thereof and applicable Law.

 



 

6.6 _Indemnification of Directors and Officers_.

 



 

(a) For a period of six (6) years from and after the Closing Date, the Company
shall, and Buyer shall cause the Company to, fulfill and honor in all respects
the obligations of the Company to those persons who served as directors or
officers of the Company at any time at or prior to the Closing (and those
persons who served as directors or officers of any Subsidiary of the Company
at any time at or prior to the Closing) pursuant to (i) any indemnification
provisions under the certificate of organization, bylaws or other organization
or formation documents of the Company (and the Subsidiaries of the Company) as
in effect on the date of this Agreement and (ii) any indemnity agreements
between the Company (or the Subsidiaries of the Company) and any such persons
as in effect on the date of this Agreement and set forth in _Section 6.6(a)_
of the Company Disclosure Schedules (the persons entitled to be indemnified
pursuant to such provisions and such indemnity agreements being referred to
collectively as the " _D andO Indemnified Parties_"). To the extent permitted by
Law, from and after the Closing Date through the sixth (6th) anniversary of
the Closing Date, the Company shall, and Buyer shall cause the Company and its
Subsidiaries to, maintain the provisions with respect to indemnification and
exculpation from liability as set forth in the certificate of organization,
bylaws or other organization or formation documents of the Company (and its
Subsidiaries) as of the date of this Agreement, which provisions shall not be
amended, repealed or otherwise modified during such period in any manner that
would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any DandO Indemnified Party.

 



 

(b) The Company and its Subsidiaries shall obtain as of the Closing Date a
"tail" insurance policy with a claims period of six (6) years from the Closing
Date with at least the same coverage and amounts, and containing terms and
conditions that are not less advantageous to the directors, managers and
officers (as applicable) of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries, as the
directors and officers insurance policy or policies in effect as of the date
of this Agreement, in each case with respect to claims arising out of or
relating to events which occurred on or prior to the Closing Date (including
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement). The
premium for such insurance policy shall be a Company Transaction Expense.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) This _Section 6.6_ shall survive the Closing Date, is intended to benefit
and may be enforced by Seller and the DandO Indemnified Parties, and shall be
binding on all successors and assigns of Buyer and the Company.

 



 

6.7 _Preservation of Business Records_.

 



 

For a period of six (6) years from the Closing Date or such longer time as may
be required by Law:

 



 

(a) Buyer shall not and shall cause its Affiliates not to dispose of or
destroy any of the Business Records of the Company and its Subsidiaries
relating to periods prior to the Closing without first offering to turn over
possession thereof to Seller by written notice to Seller at least sixty (60)
days prior to the proposed date of such disposition or destruction.

 



 

(b) Buyer shall and shall cause its Affiliates to allow Seller and its agents
access to all Business Records of the Company and its Subsidiaries relating to
periods prior to the Closing on reasonable notice and at reasonable times at
Buyers principal place of business or at any location where any such Business
Records are stored, and Seller shall have the right, at its own expense, to
make copies of any such Business Records, in each case solely to the extent as
is necessary for financial reporting and accounting matters, the preparation
and filing of any Tax Return, the defense of any Tax claim, any Proceeding
relating to the ownership or operation of the Company or its Subsidiaries
prior to the Closing (other than a Proceeding among the parties relating to
the Contemplated Transactions), or in connection with any disclosure
obligation; _provided_ , that any such access or copying shall be had or done
in such a manner so as not to unduly interfere with the normal conduct of
Buyers business.

 



 

(c) Buyer shall and shall cause its Affiliates to make available to Seller
upon reasonable notice to Buyer and at reasonable times and upon written
request (i) Buyers personnel to assist Seller in locating and obtaining any
Business Records, and (ii) any personnel of Buyer or the Company whose
assistance or participation is reasonably required by Seller or any of its
Affiliates in anticipation of, or preparation for, any Proceeding relating to
the ownership or operation of the Company or its Subsidiaries prior to the
Closing (other than a Proceeding among the parties relating to the
Contemplated Transactions). Seller shall reimburse Buyer for Buyers
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in performing the covenants
contained in this _Section 6.7_ and shall take all steps such that fulfilling
Sellers requests under this _Section 6.7(c)_ does not unduly interfere with
the normal conduct of Buyers business.

 



 

6.8 _Proprietary Information_.

 



 

(a) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company was routinely supplied copies of
proprietary and confidential information relating to strategic, technical,
and/or marketing plans of Seller and its Affiliates and their various
operations unrelated to the Company and its Subsidiaries (" _Seller
Confidential Information_ "). Although Seller has attempted to recover such
Seller Confidential Information from the Company, some may still be present
within the Company. Each of Holdings and Newco therefore agrees that it and
its controlled Affiliates will not knowingly use or disclose such information
for any purpose whatsoever. The obligations of Holdings, Newco and their
respective controlled Affiliates under this _Section 6.8(a)_ shall not

 



      
 

 



 

apply to Seller Confidential Information which (i) is or becomes generally
available to the public without breach of the commitment provided for in this
_Section 6.8(a)_; (ii) is required to be disclosed by Law; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, in any such case, Holdings or Newco (as applicable) shall
notify Seller (to the extent permitted by Law) prior to disclosure and agrees
that Seller may take at Sellers sole cost and expense appropriate measures to
preserve the confidentiality of such Seller Confidential Information; (iii) is
received by Holdings, Newco, or any of their respective Affiliates or
representatives on a non-confidential basis from a source other than Seller,
the Company or its Subsidiaries not in violation of a confidentiality
obligation to Seller or (iv) is independently developed by Holdings, Newco, or
any of their respective Affiliates or representatives without reference to or
use of any Seller Confidential Information.

 



 

(b) Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates and direct its
representatives to, keep confidential and not disclose to any other Person or
use for its own benefit or the benefit of any other person or entity any
confidential information, proprietary information, technology, know-how, trade
secrets (including all results of research and development), industrial
designs, customer lists, franchises, inventions or other intellectual property
regarding Holdings, Newco, the Company, their respective Subsidiaries or their
business and operation (" _Company Confidential Information_ ") in its
possession or control. The obligations of Seller under this _Section 6.8(b)_
shall not apply to Company Confidential Information which (i) is or becomes
generally available to the public without breach of the commitment provided
for in this _Section 6.8(b)_; (ii) is required to be disclosed by Law;
_provided_ , _however_ , that, in any such case, Seller shall notify Holdings
(to the extent permitted by Law) prior to disclosure and agrees that Holdings
may take at Holdings sole cost and expense appropriate measures to preserve
the confidentiality of such Company Confidential Information; (iii) is
received by Seller, its Affiliates or its representatives on a non-
confidential basis from a source other than Holdings, Newco, the Company or
their respective Subsidiaries or representatives not in violation of a
confidentiality obligation to Holdings, Newco, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or (iv) is independently developed by Seller, or their respective
Affiliates or representatives without reference to or use of any Company
Confidential Information

 



 

6.9 _Non-Solicitation_.

 



 

(a) Between the date hereof and the earlier of two (2) years after the Closing
or the termination of this Agreement, Holdings and Newco shall not, and shall
cause their respective controlled Affiliates not to, knowingly solicit any
employees of Seller or its Affiliates (including the Company with respect to
periods prior to Closing) who Holdings or Newco first learned of in connection
with or as a result of the Contemplated Transactions, to leave the employ of
Seller or its controlled Affiliates (including the Company with respect to
periods prior to Closing), as applicable, or violate the terms of their
contracts, or any employment arrangements, with Seller or its controlled
Affiliates, as applicable; _provided_ , that nothing in this _Section 6.9(a)_
shall prohibit Holdings, Newco or any of their respective controlled
Affiliates from soliciting or employing any such employee as a result of (x) a
general solicitation to the public or general advertising, including through
internet job postings or the use of a search firm or other employment agency
(so long as not specifically directed by Holdings, Newco or their respective
controlled Affiliates at such employees) or (y) the solicitation of any
individual whose employment with Seller or its controlled Affiliates has been
terminated for at least six (6) months at the time of such solicitation or
hiring.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) Between the date hereof and the earlier of two (2) years after the Closing
or the termination of this Agreement, Seller shall not, and shall cause its
controlled Affiliates not to, knowingly solicit any employees of Holdings,
Newco or their respective controlled Affiliates (including the Company with
respect to periods following Closing) who Seller first learned of in
connection with or as a result of the Contemplated Transactions (it being
understood that for periods following Closing, with respect to the employees
of the Company and its Subsidiaries, the obligations of Seller pursuant to
this Section 6.9(b) shall apply irrespective of whether Seller first learned
of any employees in connection with or as a result of the Contemplated
Transactions), to leave the employ of Holdings, Newco or their respective
controlled Affiliates (including the Company with respect to periods following
Closing), as applicable, or violate the terms of their contracts, or any
employment arrangements, with Holdings, Newco or their respective controlled
Affiliates, as applicable; _provided_ , that nothing in this _Section 6.9(b)_
shall prohibit Seller or any of its controlled Affiliates from soliciting or
employing any such employee as a result of (x) a general solicitation to the
public or general advertising, including through internet job postings or the
use of a search firm or other employment agency (so long as not specifically
directed by Seller or its controlled Affiliates at such employees) or (y) the
solicitation of any individual whose employment with Holdings, Newco or their
respective controlled Affiliates has been terminated for at least six (6)
months at the time of such solicitation or hiring.

 



 

6.10 _Public Announcements_.

 



 

The initial press release regarding this Agreement and the Contemplated
Transactions shall be made at such time and in such form as Holdings and
Seller agree; _provided_ , that in the event that the parties cannot agree,
either party shall be permitted to make any disclosure required by Law. Prior
to the Closing, none of Holdings, Newco, the Company or Seller will issue or
make (or permit any controlled Affiliate to issue or make) any subsequent
press release or public statement with respect to this Agreement or the
Contemplated Transactions without (a) the prior consent of Holdings, in the
case of Seller or the Company, or (b) the prior consent of Seller, in the case
of Holdings or Newco, except as may be required by Law; _provided_ , that the
party proposing to issue any press release or similar public announcement or
communication in compliance with any such disclosure obligations required by
Law shall use commercially reasonable efforts to consult in good faith with
the other party before doing so. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, the Financing Sources, their representatives and Holdings and Newcos
professional advisors may (i) publish "tombstones" or other customary
announcements which do not contain pricing details that are not otherwise
publicly available and (ii) make public statements and/or communications in
connection with the Debt Financing (or any alternative financing) so long as
such statements or communications are afforded confidential treatment to the
same extent as other confidential information customarily provided to Persons
in the context of similar financings. For the avoidance of doubt, disclosures
to Governmental Authorities in connection with the parties efforts to obtain
approval and/or early termination under the HSR Act and to make any related
filing shall be deemed not to violate this Agreement.

 



       
 

 



 

6.11 _Commercially Reasonable Efforts_.

 



 

Except as otherwise set forth in _Section 6.3_, subject to the terms and
conditions set forth herein and to applicable legal requirements, each of the
parties shall cooperate and use their respective commercially reasonable
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate action, and do, or
cause to be done, and assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing,
all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, in
the most expeditious manner practicable, the Contemplated Transactions,
including the satisfaction of their respective conditions set forth in
_Article VII_; provided that nothing in this _Section 6.11_ shall be
construed to require a party to waive any condition set forth in _Article
VII_. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain as promptly as practicable any
necessary consents, approvals, waivers and authorizations of, actions or non-
actions by, and make, as promptly as reasonably practicable, all necessary
filings and submissions with, any third party or Governmental Authority in
connection with the Contemplated Transactions (including under those Contracts
set forth on _Schedule 6.11_); _provided_ that in no event shall the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries be obligated to pay any fee, penalty or other
consideration, or modify any Contract, to obtain any consent, approval,
clearance, order, waiver or authorization in connection with the Contemplated
Transactions under any Contract. The provisions of this _Section 6.11_ shall
not apply to consents, notices and approvals related to the HSR Act, all of
which are governed by the provisions of _Section 6.3_.

 



 

6.12 _Use of Name_.

 



 

On and after the Closing Date, except as provided in this _Section 6.12_,
none of Holdings, Newco, Buyer or any of their respective Subsidiaries shall,
and none of them shall knowingly assist any other Person to, in any way adopt,
use or seek to use in any manner the name "Dignity Health". On and after the
Closing Date, none of Holdings, Newco, Buyer or any of their respective
Subsidiaries shall challenge, and none of them shall knowingly assist any
other Person in challenging, by cancellation, opposition or otherwise, the
validity of the "Dignity Health" name or Sellers ownership thereof or title
thereto. In no event shall Holdings, Newco, Buyer or any of their respective
Subsidiaries knowingly use the "Dignity Health" name after the Closing in any
manner likely to cause confusion, or to cause mistake or to deceive as to the
affiliation, connection, or association of Holdings, Newco, Buyer or any of
their respective Affiliates with Seller, or as to the origin, sponsorship, or
approval of such products or services. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller
hereby grants to Holdings, Newco and their Subsidiaries the limited and non-
exclusive right and license (which right and license shall not be transferable
or sublicensable) to use the "Dignity Health" name and associated marks solely
in connection with the operation of the Company and its Subsidiaries (and
subject at all times to Sellers right to exercise quality control with
respect to the use of the "Dignity Health" name and the goodwill associated
therewith) (a) for a period of one hundred eighty (180) days after the Closing
Date in the process of exhausting the inventory of printed purchase orders,

6.13 _Intercompany Arrangements_.

 



 

(a) As of the Closing, the coverage under all insurance policies maintained by
Seller or any of its Affiliates related to the Company and/or any of its
Subsidiaries shall cease and continue in force only for the benefit of Seller
and its Affiliates (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries); _provided_ ,
that coverage under such insurance policies shall continue in force for the
benefit of the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to occurrences prior
to the Closing Date in accordance with the terms of such insurance policies.
Holdings agrees to arrange for its own account insurance policies with respect
to the Company and its Subsidiaries covering all periods beginning from and
after the Closing and agrees not to seek (and to cause the Company and its
Subsidiaries not to seek from and after the Closing), through any means, to
benefit from any of the insurance policies maintained by Seller or any of its
Affiliates which may provide coverage for claims relating in any way to the
Company and/or any of its Subsidiaries, other than such claims with respect to
occurrences prior to the Closing Date which shall continue following the
Closing to be covered by Seller and its Affiliates pursuant to the terms of
the applicable insurance policies. Holdings further acknowledges and agrees
that Buyer, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall not be entitled to
any reimbursement or repayment of premiums paid by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries under any insurance policies for which coverage is being
terminated as of Closing.

 



 

(b) Seller shall settle, by dividends, whether actual or deemed, by capital
contributions, whether actual or deemed, or otherwise, as the case may be, in
a manner determined by Seller, all inter-company receivables and/or payables
outstanding between Seller and its Affiliates (other than the Company and its
Subsidiaries) on the one hand, and the Company and its Subsidiaries on the
other hand, prior to the Closing Date, other than such obligations that will
be settled as Refinancing Indebtedness.

 



 

(c) Seller shall cause all agreements between Seller and its Affiliates (other
than the Company and its Subsidiaries) on the one hand, and the Company and
its Subsidiaries on the other hand, other than those agreements listed on
_Section 6.13(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, to be terminated on or
prior to the Closing Date and all resulting payments to be settled on or
before the Closing Date.

 



 

(d) Seller has informed Holdings that Seller or one of its Subsidiaries has
caused to be issued, for the benefit of the Company and/or its Subsidiaries,
the letters of credit listed on _Section 6.13(d)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule (the " _Existing Letters of Credit_ "). Effective as of the Closing,
provided that Seller has given to Holdings sufficient information to allow
Holdings to do so, Holdings shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
substitute replacement letters of credit (" _Replacement Letters of Credit_ ")
for the Existing Letters of Credit and arrange for return and cancellation of
the Existing Letters of Credit without further liability to Seller, the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries; _provided_ , _however_ , that if Seller
has not provided such sufficient information to Holdings prior to the Closing,
Holdings will use commercially reasonable efforts to substitute the
Replacement Letters of Credit following the Closing as soon as practicable
after Seller provides such sufficient information to Holdings.

 



      
 

 



 

6.14 _Financing_.

 



 

(a) Holdings shall use its reasonable best efforts to consummate the Debt
Financing on the terms and conditions described in the Debt Commitment Letter
prior to the Closing (including the exercise of any "flex provisions"),
including using reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in effect the Debt
Commitment Letter and to satisfy on a timely basis (or obtain the waiver of)
all conditions and covenants applicable to Holdings in the Debt Commitment
Letter and such definitive agreements to be entered into pursuant to the Debt
Commitment Letter that are to be satisfied by Holdings and are within its
control and (ii) cause the Commitment Party to fund the Debt Financing (
_provided_ that Holdings and its Affiliates shall not be obligated to initiate
or threaten to initiate a Proceeding against any Financing Sources). At the
reasonable request of Seller, Holdings shall keep Seller reasonably informed
of the status of its efforts to arrange the Debt Financing and provide to
Seller copies of the material definitive agreements for the Debt Financing.
From the date hereof until the Closing Date, Holdings shall promptly notify
Seller in writing of (A) any actual material breach or material default by
Holdings or, to the Knowledge of Buyer, any other party with respect to any
Debt Commitment Letter or any condition precedent which Holdings believes will
not be satisfied by the Closing and (B) any material dispute between or among
any parties to any Debt Commitment Letter that would result or reasonably be
likely to result in all or a portion of the Debt Financing not being available
to Holdings at the Closing. In the event that all or a portion of the Debt
Financing becomes unavailable on the terms contemplated in the Debt Commitment
Letter, Holdings shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i) arrange
replacement financing, on terms that are not less favorable to Holdings than
the terms contained in the Debt Commitment Letter, from alternative sources as
promptly as practicable in an amount sufficient to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) obtain new financing commitment and
fee letters with respect to such replacement financing, copies of which shall
be promptly provided to the Seller. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this _Section 6.14_ or in any other provision of this Agreement or
otherwise, Holdings shall have the right from time to time to amend, restate,
replace, supplement or otherwise modify, or waive any of its rights under, the
Debt Commitment Letter and/or substitute other debt or equity financing for
all or any portion of the Debt Financing from the same and/or alternative
financing sources; _provided_ , that Holdings shall not consent to (i) any
waiver, amendment or modification to the Debt Commitment Letter if such
waiver, amendment or modification would change the conditions precedent set
forth therein (unless such changed conditions precedent would not be
reasonably expected to prevent or materially delay the consummation of the
Debt Financing), materially delay the funding of the commitments thereunder,
reduce the aggregate cash amount of the funding commitments under the Debt
Commitment Letter to be funded on the Closing Date (except as set forth in any
"flex provisions"), make the funding under the Debt Commitment Letter less
likely to occur, adversely affect the ability of Buyer to enforce its rights
under the Debt Commitment Letters or otherwise adversely affect the ability of
Holdings to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
delay the Closing (collectively, the " _Restricted Commitment Letter
Amendments_ ") ( _provided_ that, for the avoidance of doubt, subject to the
limitations set forth in this _Section 6.14_, Holdings may amend the Debt
Commitment Letter to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication
agents or similar entities that have not executed the Debt Commitment Letter
as of the date of this Agreement, but only if the addition of such additional
parties, individually or in the aggregate, would not result in the occurrence
of a Restricted Commitment Letter Amendment) or (ii) early termination of the
Debt Commitment Letter.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) For the purposes of the Agreement (other than with respect to
representations made by Holdings as of the date of this Agreement), references
to (i) "Debt Financing" shall include the financing contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letter as permitted to be amended, modified, supplemented,
restated, replaced or substituted by _Section 6.14(a)_, (ii) "Debt Commitment
Letter" shall include any amendment, modification, restatement, supplement and
replacement or substitution permitted by _Section 6.14(a)_ and (iii)
"Commitment Party" and "Financing Sources" shall include lenders and other
financing sources (including underwriters, placement agents and initial
purchasers) providing the Debt Financing pursuant to any amendment,
modification, restatement, supplement and replacement permitted by _Section
6.14(a)_.

 



 

(c) Prior to the Closing, the Company agrees to provide, and to cause its
Subsidiaries (other than the Professional Associations) to provide, and to use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Professional Associations and the
officers, employees, advisors and other representatives of the Company and its
Subsidiaries to provide, Holdings with such cooperation and assistance in
connection with the arrangement of the Debt Financing as may be reasonably
requested by Holdings, including (i) participating in a reasonable number of
meetings, presentations, road shows, due diligence sessions, sessions with
prospective Financing Sources, including direct contact between senior
management and the other representatives of the Company, on the one hand, and
the actual and potential Financing Sources, on the other hand and sessions
with rating agencies at times and locations mutually agreed, (ii) assisting
with the preparation of materials for rating agency presentations, bank
information memoranda, offering documents, prospectuses, private placement
memoranda, confidential information memoranda, lender and investor
presentations, business projections, marketing materials and similar documents
required in connection with the Debt Financing, (iii) furnishing Holdings and
any actual and potential Financing Sources with the Required Information and
such other historical financial information regarding the Company as may be
reasonably requested by Holdings or as is customary for the arrangement,
marketing, syndication, execution and consummation of the financings
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter and/or any alternative financing
(including any debt securities to be issued in lieu of any portion thereof)
(for the avoidance of doubt, such information shall not include any
information and data regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries that would be
required by Regulation S X Rule 3 09, Rule 3 10 and Rule 3 16 and Items 301,
302, 307, 308, 402, 601, of Regulation S K and other customary exceptions

(v) assisting in the preparation, execution and delivery of one or more credit
agreements, indentures, purchase agreements, pledge and security documents and
other definitive financing documents as may be reasonably requested by
Holdings; (vi) cooperating with the marketing efforts of Holdings and its
Financing Sources for any of such Debt Financing; (vii) facilitating the
granting of a security interest (and perfection thereof) in collateral and
delivering guarantees, mortgages and other definitive financing documents or
other certificates or documents as may be reasonably be requested by Holdings,
including obtaining releases of existing Liens; _provided_ that any such
obligations and releases of Liens contained in all such agreements and
documents shall be subject to the occurrence of the Closing; (viii)
cooperating in satisfying the conditions precedent set forth in

 



      
 

 



 

the Debt Commitment Letter or any definitive document relating to the Debt
Financing to the extent the satisfaction of such condition requires the
cooperation of, or is within the control of, the Company and its Subsidiaries;
(ix) to the extent requested no later than ten (10) Business Days prior to the
Closing Date, furnishing no later than three (3) Business Days prior to the
Closing Date all documentation and other information required by a
Governmental Authority under applicable "know your customer" and anti-money
laundering rules and regulations, including the U.S.A. Patriot Act of 2001,
(x) using reasonable best efforts to obtain corporate, credit, facility and
securities ratings from rating agencies, (xi) using reasonable best efforts to
ensure that the Financing Sources benefit materially from existing lending
relationships of the Company and its Subsidiaries; _provided_ that such
requested cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing
operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries and (xii) cooperating
reasonably with the Financing Sources due diligence, to the extent customary
and reasonable. Seller, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not be
required, under the provisions of this _Section 6.14_ or otherwise in
connection with the Debt Financing, to pay any commitment or other similar
fee, or bear any cost or expense, or make any payment to obtain consent or to
incur any liability with respect to the Debt Financing or cause or permit any
Lien to be placed on any of their respective assets prior to the Closing Date
(except to the extent the payment of such costs, expenses, fees or incurrence
of such liabilities is contingent upon the occurrence of the Closing or if
such amounts are to be reimbursed or indemnified as Financing Cooperation
Obligations). Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) no obligation of the Company
and its Subsidiaries under any certificate, document or instrument shall be
effective until the Closing Date (other than customary authorization letters
in connection with any marketing materials) and none of the Company and its
Subsidiaries shall be required to take any action under any certificate,
document or instrument (other than this Agreement) that is not contingent upon
the Closing, and Persons who are directors of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries prior to Closing in their capacity as such shall not be required
to pass resolutions or consents to approve or authorize the execution of the
Debt Financing, (b) none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, nor any of
their respective directors, officers, employees, representatives or agents,
shall be required to provide any legal opinion or other opinion of counsel
prior to the Closing Date in connection with the Debt Financing and (c) the
Company and its Subsidiaries shall not be obligated to provide (and Holdings
shall not disclose) any information about the Company and its Subsidiaries
that is a trade secret or would result in a waiver of the attorney-client or
similar privilege, or information that would violate confidentiality
obligations owing to third parties (except that information may be disclosed
by the Company and its Subsidiaries to potential sources of capital and to
rating agencies and prospective lenders and investors during any syndication
of the Debt Financing, subject to customary confidentiality arrangements with
such Persons regarding such information). Holdings shall indemnify and hold
harmless Seller, the Company and its Subsidiaries and their Affiliates and
their respective officers, directors, employees, investment bankers,
attorneys, accountants, consultants and other authorized agents, advisors or
representatives from and against any and all liabilities, losses, damages,
claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards, judgments and penalties suffered or
incurred by them in connection with the arrangement of the Debt Financing
(other than to the extent such losses arise from the willful misconduct or
gross negligence of Seller, the Company or its Subsidiaries) (collectively,
the " _Financing Cooperation Indemnity_ "). Whether or not the Closing Date
occurs, Holdings shall, promptly upon request by the Company, reimburse the
Company for all reasonable, documented, out-of-pocket costs incurred by the
Company and its Subsidiaries in connection

 



      
 

 



 

with this _Section 6.14_, including legal fees, accounting fees and other
fees and expenses (together with the Financing Cooperation Indemnity, the "
_Financing Cooperation Obligations_ "). The Company hereby consents to the use
of its and its Subsidiaries logos in connection with the Debt Financing;
provided, that such logos are used solely in a manner that is not intended to,
or reasonably likely to, harm or disparage or adversely affect the reputation
or goodwill of, Seller, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

 



 

(d) Without limiting the generality of _Section 6.14(c)_, from the date
hereof until the Closing, the Company shall deliver to Holdings and the
Financing Sources (i) within one-hundred and twenty (120) days after the end
of any fiscal year ending after the date hereof, audited consolidated balance
sheets and related consolidated statements of operations, changes in
shareholders equity and cash flows of Company and its Subsidiaries for such
fiscal year, and (ii) within thirty (30) days after the end of any calendar
month, beginning with (and including) September 2017, unaudited consolidated
balance sheets and related consolidated statements of operations and cash
flows of Company and its Subsidiaries for each such calendar month ending at
least thirty (30) days prior to the Closing Date (collectively, the "
_Supplemental Financial Statements_ ").

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Holdings
acknowledges and agrees that the obtaining of the Debt Financing, or any
alternative financing, is not a condition to Closing.

 



 

6.15 _No Solicitation_.

 



 

From the date of this Agreement through the Closing, Seller, the Company and
its Subsidiaries shall not, and Seller, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall
not permit their officers, directors, representatives or agents to, directly

negotiations with, or provide any information or assistance to, any Person or
group of Persons (other than Holdings or its Affiliates) concerning any
merger, sale of assets or sale of equity of, or similar transaction involving,
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

Proceedings commenced, or to such partys knowledge, threatened in writing,
against Seller, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Holdings, as
applicable, that are related to the Contemplated Transactions and (c) any

inaccuracy or misrepresentation of a representation or warranty of such party
set forth in this Agreement or any breach or non-performance of a covenant,
agreement or other obligation of such party set forth in this Agreement (i)
that has had or would reasonably be expected to have, either individually or
in the aggregate with all other such matters, in the case of the Company, its
Subsidiaries and Seller, a Company Material Adverse Effect or, in the case of
Holdings or its Subsidiaries, a Buyer Material Adverse Effect, or (ii) which
it believes would or would be reasonably expected to cause a condition to
Closing set forth in _Article VII_ to not be satisfied. In no event shall (x)
the

 



      
 

 



 

delivery of any notice by a party pursuant to this _Section 6.16_ limit or
otherwise affect the respective rights, obligations, representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties or the conditions to the

with Holdings efforts to make effective the RandW Policy at the Closing and, at
and prior to the Closing, provide assistance as reasonably requested by

representatives). The premiums related to, and all the other costs and
expenses relating to the origination of the RandW Policy shall be paid by Buyer,
as and when required in accordance with the terms of the RandW Policy and, for
the avoidance of doubt, shall not be considered Company Transaction Expenses.
Holdings shall not (and shall not permit any other Person insured under the
RandW Policy to) terminate, amend, alter or waive any rights or remedies under
the RandW Policy in a manner that would be materially adverse to Seller without
the prior written consent of Seller (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed).

participants of such program, a copy of the form of the employee retention
program that was executed by each of the participants, the amount of severance
and the vesting terms for each of the participants is attached hereto as

payable under the Retention Program are the sole responsibility of Holdings.
Neither the Seller nor, prior to Closing, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries will make any changes, amendments or adjustments to the Retention
Program (including the admission of any new participants) without Holdings
prior written consent.

 



 

6.19 _Redemption and Reorganization_.

ARTICLE X 
_Survival; Indemnification_

 



 

10.1 _Survival_.

 



 

Each of Holdings, Newco, Buyer, Seller and the Company, intending to modify
any applicable statute of limitations, agree that (a) all of the
representations and warranties of the Company or Seller in this Agreement or
the Disclosure Schedules (other than the Company Fundamental Representations)
and in any certificate or other instrument delivered pursuant hereto shall
survive the Closing until the date that is twelve (12) months after the
Closing Date, (b) all of the representations and warranties of Buyer, Holdings
and Newco in this Agreement or the Disclosure Schedules (other than the Buyer
Fundamental Representations) and in any certificate or other instrument
delivered pursuant hereto shall terminate effective as of the Closing and
shall not survive the Closing for any purpose, (c) all of the Company
Fundamental Representations and Buyer Fundamental Representations shall
survive the Closing until the date that is the later of (i) six (6) years
after the Closing Date and (ii) the expiration of the statute of limitations
applicable to the subject matter underlying the relevant Company Fundamental
Representation, and (d) all covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement shall survive the Closing until ninety (90) days following the date
all performance thereunder was due to be performed (and if no such period is
specified, such covenant or agreement shall survive until the expiration of
the applicable statute of limitations) (the last day of the survival period of
any such representation or warranty, or covenant or other agreement, as
applicable, its " _Survival_

 



      
 

 



 

 _Termination Date_ "). With respect to any claims that were asserted in
writing on or prior to the applicable Survival Termination Date, the
underlying representation, warranty, covenant, obligation or other agreement,
as applicable, shall survive as to such claim until it is finally resolved in
accordance with this _Article _X.

 



 

10.2 _Indemnification of Buyer Indemnitees_.

 



 

(a) Subject to the limitations contained in this Agreement, from and after the
Closing, Holdings, Newco, Buyer, the Company, its Subsidiaries and each of
their respective directors, officers, managers, employees, agents,
representatives, equityholders, successors, assigns and Affiliates
(collectively, the " _Buyer Indemnitees_ ") shall be indemnified and held
harmless by Seller from and against any and all Losses incurred by them in
connection with, caused by or resulting or arising out of (i) any breach or
inaccuracy of any representation or warranty of the Company or Seller
contained in this Agreement or the Disclosure Schedules (other than the
Company Fundamental Representations) or the certification of such
representations and warranties set forth in the certificate contemplated by
_Section 8.1_, (ii) any breach or inaccuracy of any Company Fundamental
Representation or the certification of such representations and warranties set
forth in the certificate contemplated by _Section 8.1_, or (iii) any breach
of or failure to perform any covenant, obligation or other agreement of
Seller, the Company or its Subsidiaries contained in this Agreement required
to be performed (A) prior to the Closing by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or (B) by Seller (collectively, " _Buyer Losses_ ").

 



 

(b) Recovery by the Buyer Indemnitees of Buyer Losses in aggregate will be
subject to the following limitations:

 



 

(i) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary (except in the case of
Fraud), the Buyer Indemnitees shall not be entitled to indemnification for
Buyer Losses validly claimed under _Section 10.2(a)(i)_ unless and until
Buyer Losses in an aggregate amount greater than $3,765,000 (the "
_Deductible_ ") have been validly claimed under _Section 10.2(a)(i)_, and
once the Deductible is exceeded, then the Buyer Indemnitees shall be entitled
to indemnification only for the amount of Buyer Losses validly claimed under
_Section 10.2(a)(i)_ in excess of the Deductible.

 



 

(ii) With respect to Buyer Losses claimed pursuant to _Section 10.2(a)(i)_
(except in the case of Fraud with respect thereto) and subject to _Section
10.2(b)(i)_, the aggregate amount of Buyer Losses for which the Buyer
Indemnitees shall be indemnified by the Seller shall not exceed an amount
equal to $3,765,000 (the " _Cap_ ").

 



 

(iii) With respect to Buyer Losses pursuant to _Section 10.2(a)(i)_ (except
in the case of Fraud with respect thereto) and subject to _Section
10.2(b)(i)_, a Buyer Indemnitee shall recover such Buyer Losses (A) first,
from the Seller until all Buyer Losses recovered from the Seller pursuant to
_Section 10.2(a)(i)_ (taken together with Buyer Losses recovered from the
Seller pursuant to _Section 10.2(a)(ii)_, if any) equal the Cap and (B)
second, under the RandW Policy in accordance with its terms.

 



      
 

 



 

(iv) Solely with respect to Buyer Losses claimed pursuant to _Section
10.2(a)(ii)_, the Buyer Indemnitees shall recover such Buyer Losses (A) first,
from the Seller until all Buyer Losses recovered from the Seller pursuant to
_Section 10.2(a)(ii)_ (taken together with Buyer Losses recovered from the
Seller pursuant to _Section 10.2(a)(i)_, if any) equal the Cap, (B) second,
under the RandW Policy in accordance with its terms and subject to the following
sentence and (C) third, directly from the Seller until all Buyer Losses
recovered from the Seller under this _Article X_ equal the Aggregate
Liability Cap. The Buyer Indemnitees shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to recover Buyer Losses under the RandW Policy, even if the retention under the
RandW Policy will only be exceeded by virtue of such Buyer Losses; _provided_
that the Buyer Indemnitees may concurrently seek recovery from the Seller
(subject to the limitations set forth in this Section 10.2 _)_ and the RandW
Policy and any recoveries from the Seller shall be subject to the Buyer
Indemnitees reimbursement obligations set forth in the last sentence of
_Section 10.2(b)(vi)_.

 



 

(v) Seller shall not have any liability, individually or in the aggregate,
under this _Article _X in excess of an amount equal to the Base Purchase
Price _minus_ the Newco Equity Amount (the " _Aggregate Liability Cap_ "). For
the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this clause (v) permits any recovery
against the Seller for any amounts claimed for any breach or inaccuracy of any
representation or warranty of the Company or Seller contained in this
Agreement or the Disclosure Schedules (other than the Company Fundamental
Representations) in an amount, when aggregated with all other breaches of
representations or warranties of the Company or Seller contained in this
Agreement or the Disclosure Schedules (other than the Company Fundamental
Representations) that exceeds the Cap.

 



 

(vi) The amount of any and all Buyer Losses indemnifiable under this Agreement
shall be determined net of (i) any accruals or reserves included in Company
Net Working Capital to the extent specifically established with respect to the
matters with which such Buyer Losses relate and (ii) any amounts recovered by
the Buyer Indemnitee, Buyer or any of their respective Affiliates with respect
to such Buyer Losses from any third party or under or pursuant to any
insurance policy pursuant to which or under which such Buyer Indemnitee, Buyer
or any of their respective Affiliates has rights (other than recoveries under
the RandW Policy, unless and to the extent such proceeds are recovered in
respect of breaches of or inaccuracies in the Company Fundamental
Representations in excess of the retention under the RandW Policy), it being
understood that any amounts recovered under or pursuant to any insurance
policy shall be calculated net of any reasonable costs associated with
pursuing such insurance proceeds, including any deductible, co-pay and
reasonable out-of-pocket costs. If any of the Buyer Indemnitees, Buyer or any
of their respective Affiliates receive such recovery from any third party or
under or pursuant to any insurance policy after receipt of payment from Seller
(other than the RandW Policy, unless and to the extent such proceeds are
recovered in respect of Company Fundamental Representations in excess of the
retention under the RandW Policy), then such Buyer Indemnitee shall promptly pay
over to Seller the amount so recovered (after deducting therefrom the amount
of all reasonable expenses incurred in procuring such recovery), but not in
excess of any amount previously paid by Seller to such Buyer Indemnitee in
respect of such matter.

 



 

(c) Holdings shall, and shall cause all Buyer Indemnitees to, take all steps
required by Law or reasonably requested by Seller to mitigate Buyer Losses
upon becoming

 



      
 

 



 

aware of any event giving rise thereto; _provided_ that under no circumstances
shall this _Section 10.2(c)_ require Holdings or any Buyer Indemnitee to (i)
bring a Proceeding or pursue any insurance or indemnification to mitigate any
Buyer Losses or (ii) take any action that is detrimental in any material
respect to Holdings or such Buyer Indemnitee or otherwise disrupts the ongoing
business operations of Holdings or such Buyer Indemnitee. For the avoidance of
doubt, any reasonable costs of Holdings or a Buyer Indemnitee incurred in
connection with any mitigation undertaken pursuant to this _Section 10.2(c)_
shall be deemed "Buyer Losses."

 



 

(d) For purposes of determining the existence of any breach or inaccuracy of
any representation or warranty (including the certification of such
representations and warranties set forth in the certificate contemplated by
_Section 8.1_), or calculating the amount of any Losses incurred in
connection therewith, any and all references to "material" or "Company
Material Adverse Effect" (or other correlative or similar terms or
limitations) shall be disregarded; _provided_ , _however_ , that this _Section
10.2(d)_ shall not apply to the representations and warranties set forth in
_Section 3.6(b)_ or the first sentence of _Section 3.7_.

 



 

(e) For purposes of any claims against a party, " _Fraud_ " means actual and
intentional fraud by such party which is the direct cause of an alleged Loss,
and fraud by one entity shall not be attributed to any other entity.

 



 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this _Article _X,
claims made under the RandW Policy shall not be subject to the limitations set
forth in this _Section 10.2_.

 



 

10.3 _Indemnification of Seller Indemnitees_.

 



 

(a) Subject to the limitations contained in this Agreement, from and after the
Closing, Seller, and its directors, officers, employees, agents,
representatives, stockholders, successors, assigns and Affiliates
(collectively, " _Seller Indemnitees_ ") shall be indemnified and held
harmless by Buyer from and against any and all Losses incurred by them in
connection with, caused by or resulting or arising out of (i) any breach or
inaccuracy of any Buyer Fundamental Representation or the certification of
such representations and warranties set forth in the certificate contemplated
by _Section 9.1_, or (ii) any breach of or failure to perform any covenant,
obligation or other agreement of Buyer, Holdings or Newco contained in this
Agreement required to be performed by Buyer, Holdings or Newco and any
inaccuracy in the certificate provided pursuant to _Section 8.1_ with respect
to such covenants, obligations or other agreements (collectively " _Seller
Losses_ ").

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, in no event (except
in the case of Fraud) shall Buyer, Holdings and Newco be liable under this
_Article X_ in the aggregate for more than an amount equal to the Newco
Equity Amount.

 



 

10.4 _Notice and Determination of Claims_.

 



 

(a) Each claim for indemnification for any Losses may only be asserted on or
prior to the applicable Survival Termination Date; _provided_ , that as to any
Losses for which a Claim Notice has been given in accordance with the
requirements of this _Article X_ on or prior to the applicable Survival
Termination Date, the indemnification obligation hereunder shall

 



      
 

 



 

continue until the liability to be satisfied, if any, shall have been finally
resolved in accordance with this _Article X_.

 



 

(b) If any Buyer Indemnitee or Seller Indemnitee wishes to make a claim for
indemnification under this _Article X_, such Person (individually or
collectively, the " _Claiming Party_ ") shall deliver a notice describing in
reasonable detail the Loss and the method of computation of such Loss, and
containing a reference to the provisions of this Agreement in respect of which
such Loss has occurred, (a " _Claim Notice_ ") to Seller (in the case of a
Claim Notice delivered by any Buyer Indemnitee) or to Holdings (in the case of
a Claim Notice delivered by any Seller Indemnitee), as applicable (Seller or
Holdings, as applicable, the " _Indemnifying Party"_ ) promptly after becoming
aware of such claim, and shall provide the Indemnifying Party with all
material facts giving rise to such claim for indemnification hereunder and any
other information with respect thereto as the Indemnifying Party may
reasonably request, in each case only to the extent permitted by Law and then
available or known. The failure to promptly deliver a Claim Notice shall not
release the Indemnifying Party from its obligations under this _Article X_,
except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced by
such failure.

 



 

(c) Until the twentieth (20th) Business Day following delivery of a Claim
Notice, a written, good faith objection (an " _Objection_ ") to the claim made
in such Claim Notice may be delivered by the Indemnifying Party to the
Claiming Party.

 



 

(d) With respect to Buyer Losses, if Seller elects not to or otherwise fails
to deliver an Objection in accordance with _Section 10.4(c)_ within twenty
(20) Business Days after receipt of a Claim Notice with respect to
indemnification for a specified amount of Buyer Losses, such claim specified
in such Claim Notice shall be conclusively deemed a liability of Seller and
Seller shall deliver to Holdings, for its account or for the account of each
Buyer Indemnitee named in such Claim Notice, an amount equal to the portion,
if any, of Buyer Losses to be paid by Seller directly in accordance with this
_Article X_.

 



 

(e) With respect to Seller Losses, if Holdings elects not to or otherwise
fails to deliver an Objection in accordance with _Section 10.4(c)_ within
twenty (20) Business Days after receipt of a Claim Notice with respect to
indemnification for a specified amount of Seller Losses, such claim specified
in such Claim Notice shall be conclusively deemed a liability of Holdings and
Holdings or its designee shall deliver to Seller, for its account or for the
account of each Seller Indemnitee named in such Claim Notice, an amount equal
to the Seller Losses to be paid by Holdings in accordance with this _Article
X_.

 



 

10.5 _Resolution of Conflicts_.

 



 

In respect of any Objection properly delivered, the Claiming Party shall
deliver a written response to the Indemnifying Party. If following delivery of
such response there remains a dispute as to any claims, the Claiming Party and
the Indemnifying Party shall attempt in good faith for thirty (30) days to
agree upon the rights of the respective parties with respect to each of such
claims. If no such agreement can be reached after good faith negotiation, the
matter shall be resolved in accordance with _Section 12.11_.

 



      
 

 



 

10.6 _Third Person Claims_.

 



 

(a) If the Claiming Party seeks indemnification under this _Article X_ with
respect to any pending or threatened action at law or suit in equity by a
third Person against such Claiming Party (each such action being a " _Third
Person Claim_ "), the Indemnifying Party will be entitled, if (i) the Third
Person Claim involves solely monetary damages and the Indemnifying Party
expressly agrees in writing with the Claiming Party that, as between the two,
the Indemnifying Party is solely responsible to satisfy and discharge the
Third Person Claim and (ii) the Indemnifying Party so elects by written notice
delivered to the Claiming Party no later than thirty (30) days after receiving
the Claim Notice, to conduct and control the defense of such Third Person
Claim with counsel chosen by it and approved by the Claiming Party (which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), and in
any such case the Claiming Party shall cooperate in connection therewith and
shall furnish such records, information and testimony and attend such
conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials and appeals as may be
reasonably requested by the Indemnifying Party in connection therewith;
_provided_ , that the Claiming Party may participate in, through counsel
chosen by it and at its own expense, the defense of any such Third Person
Claim as to which the Indemnifying Party has elected to conduct and control
the defense thereof, except that the Claiming Party shall not be provided the
opportunity to so participate to the extent the Indemnifying Party reasonably
determines that such participation could result in the loss of any attorney-
client privilege or right under the work-product doctrine in respect of such
Third Person Claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnifying Party
shall not be entitled to conduct or control the defense of a Third Person
Claim (or shall surrender the control of a Third Person Claim) if (v) the
Indemnifying Party has not elected to assume the defense of such Third Person
Claim in accordance with, or has otherwise breached, this _Section 10.6(a)_;
(w) the Claiming Party seeks recovery under the RandW Policy in connection with
such Third Person Claim (which for the avoidance of doubt, Holdings and/or the
insurer under the RandW Policy shall have the right to control (whether directly
or indirectly)); (x) the Third Person Claim involves criminal actions or
allegations of criminal conduct, or claims for or reasonably expected to
result in claims for specific performance, injunction or other equitable or
non-monetary relief; (y) a defense available to the Claiming Party cannot be
asserted by the Indemnifying Party; or (z) representation of the Indemnifying
Party and the Claiming Party by the same counsel would, in the reasonable
opinion of the Claiming Partys counsel, create a conflict of interest. After
the expiration of the thirty (30)-day period contained in the first sentence
of this _Section 10.6(a)_, unless the Indemnifying Party has assumed the
defense of a Third Person Claim in accordance with this _Section 10.6(a)_,
the Claiming Party shall have the right to undertake the defense of such Third
Person Claim on behalf of and for the account and risk of the Indemnifying
Party subject to the right of the Indemnifying Party to assume the defense of
such Third Person Claim pursuant to this _Section 10.6(a)_; _provided_ ,
that, if pursuant to the terms set forth in this _Article X_ the Indemnifying
Party is responsible to satisfy and discharge any Third Person Claim in whole
or in part, the Indemnifying Party may participate in, through counsel chosen
by it and at its own expense, the defense of any such Third Person Claim as to
which the Claiming Party conducts and controls the defense to the extent that
such participation does not interfere with the defense of such Third Person
Claim or could not reasonably be expected to adversely affect the attorney-
client, work-product or similar privilege of the Claiming Party. If the
Claiming Party is defending the Third Person Claim, the Indemnifying Party
shall reimburse the Claiming Party for reasonable attorneys fees and
disbursements incurred by the Claiming Party in connection with

 



      
 

 



 

defending any Third Person Claim to the extent the Indemnifying Party is
responsible to satisfy and discharge such Third Person Claim pursuant to the
terms set forth in this _Article X_.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, neither the Indemnifying
Party nor the Claiming Party shall admit any liability with respect to, or
settle, compromise, discharge or consent to the entry of judgment with respect
to, any Third Person Claim without the prior written consent of the Claiming
Party or the Indemnifying Party, respectively (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). For the avoidance of doubt,
the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party shall not be required if
the Indemnifying Party would not be responsible to satisfy and discharge the
Losses resulting from such Third Person Claim.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 10.6_, with
respect to any Third Person Claim related to Tax, to the extent the procedures
in this _Section 10.6_ are inconsistent with _Section 6.4_, _Section 6.4_
shall control.

 



 

10.7 _Exclusive Remedy_.

 



 

Except with respect to Fraud, any remedies provided by _Section 12.15_ or
claims pursuant to _Section 2.4_ or _Section 6.4_, if the Closing occurs,
this _Article X_ shall constitute the sole and exclusive remedy for monetary
damages with respect to this Agreement or otherwise arising out of, concerning
or relating, directly or indirectly, to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this _Article
X_ shall limit (a) any Buyer Indemnitees rights to recovery under the RandW
Policy or (b) any Persons rights or obligations under the Amended and
Restated Newco Operating Agreement.

 



 

ARTICLE XI

(c) by written notice from Holdings, if a breach of any representation or
warranty or failure to perform any covenant, agreement or other obligation of
the Company or Seller set forth in this Agreement shall have occurred, which
breach or failure to perform (i) would give rise to or constitute, if
occurring or continuing on the Closing Date, the failure of a condition set
forth in _Sections 7.1_ , _7.3(a)_ , _7.3(b)_ or _7.3(c)_ and (ii) after
receipt by Seller of written notice from Holdings of such breach or failure to
perform, cannot be or has not been cured on or prior to the End Date;
_provided_ , that Holdings, Newco or Buyer is not then in material breach with
respect to any of its representations, warranties, covenants or other

 



      
 

 



 

agreements contained in this Agreement, which breach, either individually or
in the aggregate with all other breaches by Holdings, Newco and Buyer, would
give rise to or constitute, if occurring or continuing on the Closing Date,
the failure of a condition set forth in _Sections 7.1_ or _7.2_ ;

 



 

(d) by written notice from Seller, if a breach of any representation or
warranty or failure to perform any covenant, agreement or other obligation of
Holdings, Newco or Buyer set forth in this Agreement shall have occurred,
which breach or failure to perform (i) would give rise to the failure of a
condition set forth in _Section 7.1_, _7.2(a)_ , _7.2(b)_ or _7.2(c)_ , and
(ii) after receipt by Holdings of written notice from Seller of such breach or
failure to perform, cannot be or has not been cured on or prior to the End
Date; _provided_ , that neither Seller nor the Company is then in material
breach with respect to any of its representations, warranties, covenants or
other agreements contained in this Agreement, which breach, either

Company, would give rise to or constitute, if occurring or continuing on the
Closing Date, the failure of a condition set forth in _Sections 7.1_ or _7.3_
;

 



 

(e) by written notice from Seller, if (i) as of the date the Closing should
occur pursuant to _Section 2.3_, all of the conditions set forth in _Sections
7.1_ and _7.3_ (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied by actions taken at the Closing but which would have been satisfied
assuming a Closing would occur) have been satisfied or, in the sole and
absolute discretion of Holdings, waived by Holdings; (ii) Seller has
irrevocably confirmed in writing to Holdings (x) that all of the conditions
set forth in _Section 7.2_ (other than those conditions that by their nature
are to be satisfied by actions taken at the Closing) have been satisfied or
have been waived by Seller and (y) Seller is prepared to consummate the
Closing; (iii) Buyer fails to consummate the Closing within five (5) Business
Days of the later of receipt of the notice contemplated by this _Section
11.1(e)_ and the date the Closing should have occurred pursuant to _Section
2.3_; and (iv) Seller stood ready, willing and able to complete the Closing
during such five (5) Business Day Period;

 



 

(f) by written notice from either Seller or Holdings to the other party, at
any time after July 22, 2018 (the " _End Date_ ") if the Closing shall not
have occurred on or prior to such date; _provided_ , that the right to
terminate this Agreement under this _Section 11.1(f)_ shall not be available
to such party if the breach of or inaccuracy in any representation or warranty
or breach or failure to perform any covenant, agreement or other obligation of
such party (or in the case of Seller, of the Company) set forth in this
Agreement has been the primary cause of or resulted in the failure of the
Closing to occur on or before such date;

 



 

(g) by written notice from Holdings, if a Company Material Adverse Effect
shall have occurred; or

 



 

(h) by written notice from Seller, if a Buyer Material Adverse Effect shall
have occurred.

 



      
 

 



 

11.2 _Procedure and Effect of Termination_.

 



 

In the event of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 11.1_,
written notice thereof shall be given by a terminating party to the other

Holdings investigation of the Company and its Subsidiaries from the Company

permitted to retain any copies of such documents and information to the extent
required to comply with applicable Law or any bona fide internal document

11.3 _Buyer Termination Fee_.

 



 

(a) If this Agreement is terminated by Seller pursuant to _Section 11.1(d)_
or _Section 11.1(e)_ (each, a " _Specified Termination_ "), then, in the
event of such Specified Termination, Buyer shall pay or cause to be paid to
Seller a fee, in cash, equal to $25,000,000 (the " _Buyer Reverse Termination
Fee_ "). If this Agreement is terminated by (i) Seller or (ii) Buyer (solely
at such a time at which Seller could otherwise terminate this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 11.1(f)_) pursuant to _Section 11.1(f)_ at a time at
which the conditions to Closing set forth in either _Section 7.1(a)_ or
_Section 7.1(b)_ (but for purposes of _Section 7.1(a)_, only if such
Restraint is attributable to an antitrust Law) shall have not been fulfilled,
but all other conditions to Closing shall be or shall be capable of being
fulfilled (assuming the Closing were to occur on

 



       
 

 



 

the End Date) (together with the Specified Terminations, each a " _Triggering
Termination_ "), Buyer shall pay or cause to be paid to Seller a fee, in cash,
equal to $17,500,000 (the " _Buyer HSR Termination Fee_ ").

 



 

(b) The Buyer Reverse Termination Fee or the Buyer HSR Termination Fee, if
any, shall be paid to Seller within five (5) Business Days following a
Triggering Termination, it being understood and agreed that, notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, (i) in no event shall Buyer be
required to pay or cause to be paid both the Buyer Reverse Termination Fee or
the Buyer HSR Termination Fee, or the Buyer Reverse Termination Fee and/or the
Buyer HSR Termination Fee on more than one occasion and (ii) in no event shall
Seller be entitled to both (x) receive either the Buyer Reverse Termination
Fee or the Buyer HSR Termination Fee and (y) specific performance of Buyers,
Holdings and Newcos obligation to pay the Purchase Price and effect the
Closing (it being understood and agreed that such specific performance shall
be available to Seller pursuant to, and only to the extent permitted by,
_Section 12.15_).

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, (i) in the
event that Buyer, Holdings or Newco fails to effect the Closing for any reason
or no reason or otherwise breaches this Agreement (or any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement herein) prior to the Closing or otherwise
fails to perform hereunder prior to the Closing (whether willfully,
intentionally, unintentionally or otherwise), then, except for (x) the right
of Seller to specific performance pursuant to, and only to the extent
expressly permitted by, _Section 12.15_ and (y) the Financing Cooperation
Obligations, Sellers right (subject to the terms, conditions and limitations
hereof) to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 11.1(d)_, _Section
11.1(e)_ or _Section 11.1(f)_ and receive from or on behalf of Buyer the
Buyer Reverse Termination Fee or the Buyer HSR Termination Fee, as applicable,
pursuant to _Section 11.3(a)_ shall be the sole and exclusive right and
remedy (whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) of
Seller, the Company, their respective successors and permitted assigns, and
any Person claiming by, through or on behalf of any of them (it being
expressly agreed that no other Person shall have any right or remedy in such
circumstances) against any Person (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the
Financing Parties), arising out of or relating to (A) this Agreement, (B) any
breach by Buyer, Holdings or Newco of any representation, warranty, covenant,
obligation or agreement in this Agreement or Buyers, Holdings or Newcos
failure to perform under this Agreement, (C) the failure of Buyer, Holdings or
Newco to consummate the Closing, (D) the Contemplated Transactions, and (E)
the Debt Commitment Letter, and (ii) upon payment of the Buyer Reverse
Termination Fee or the Buyer HSR Termination Fee, as applicable, none of
Seller, the Company, their respective successors and permitted assigns, or any
Person claiming by, through or on behalf of any of them (it being expressly
agreed that no other Person shall have any right or remedy in such
circumstances) shall have any right or remedy (whether at law, in equity, in
contract, in tort or otherwise) with respect to any of the matters described
in clauses (A) through (E) inclusive of the immediately preceding subsection
(i) or for Intentional Breach.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in the event
that Seller is paid the Buyer Reverse Termination Fee or the Buyer HSR
Termination Fee, the receipt of such fee by Seller shall not be deemed a
penalty, but shall be deemed to be liquidated damages for any and all losses
or damages suffered or incurred by Seller, the Company or any other Person
with respect to the matters described in clauses (A) through (E) inclusive of
_Section_

 



      
 

 



 

 _11.3(c)(i)_ and, if applicable, Buyers Intentional Breach, and none of
Seller, the Company or any other Person shall have any other right or remedy
(whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) against Buyer,
Holdings, Newco or any other Person (it being expressly agreed that no other
Person shall have any right or remedy in such circumstances), except for the
Financing Cooperation Obligations.

 



 

(e) The provisions of _Sections 11.3(b)_ , _11.3(c)_ and _11.3(d)_ and this
_Section 11.3(e)_ are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by, Buyer, Holdings, Newco and any other Person against whom any
right or remedy is sought. The parties agree that the agreements contained in
this _Section 11.3_ are an integral part of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby and, without these agreements, the parties
would not enter into this Agreement. In light of the difficulty of accurately
determining actual damages with respect to the foregoing matters, the Buyer
Reverse Termination Fee or the Buyer HSR Termination Fee, as applicable,
constitutes a reasonable estimate of the Losses that will be suffered if this
Agreement is terminated or the Contemplated Transactions are otherwise
abandoned or not consummated (in each case, in the circumstances in which such
fees are payable) and constitutes liquidated damages (and not a penalty).

 



 

ARTICLE XII

shall be paid by Seller and all such expenses incurred by the Company or its
Subsidiaries after the Closing shall be paid by Buyer; _provided_ , _however_

the Company and the Subsidiaries of the Company for any such pre-Closing

12.3 _Governing Law_.

 



 

This Agreement shall in all respects be governed by, and construed and
enforced in accordance with, the laws (excluding conflict of laws rules and
principles) of the State of Delaware applicable to agreements made and to be
performed entirely within such State, including all matters of construction,
validity and performance; provided that any Proceeding, dispute or other
controversy against any Financing Source or any Financing Party arising out of
or relating to this Agreement or to the Debt Financing shall be governed by,
and construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of New York.

 



 

12.4 _Entire Agreement_.

 



 

This Agreement, together with the Exhibits hereto, the Company Disclosure
Schedule, the Buyer Disclosure Schedule, the Amended and Restated Newco
Operating Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire
agreement of the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersede
all prior Contracts or agreements, whether oral or written.

 



      
 

 



 

12.5 _Severability_.

 



 

The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed severable. Whenever possible,
each provision or portion of any provision of this Agreement shall be
interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable Law.
Should any provision of this Agreement or the application thereof to any
Person or circumstance be held invalid or unenforceable to any extent: (a)
such provision shall be ineffective to the extent, and only to the extent, of
such unenforceability or prohibition and shall be enforced to the greatest
extent permitted by Law, (b) such unenforceability or prohibition in any
jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision as
applied (i) to other Persons or circumstances or (ii) in any other
jurisdiction, and (c) such unenforceability or prohibition shall not affect or
invalidate any other provision of this Agreement.

 



 

12.6 _Amendment_.

 



 

Neither this Agreement nor any of the terms hereof may be terminated, amended,
supplemented or modified orally, but only by an instrument in writing signed
by the Company, Buyer, Holdings, Newco and Seller; _provided_ , that the
observance of any provision of this Agreement may be waived in writing by the
party that will lose the benefit of such provision as a result of such waiver.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this _Section 12.6_,
none of _Section 11.3(c)_, _Section 11.3(e)_, _Section 12.3_, _Section
12.8_, _Section 12.11(b)_, _Section 12.14(b)_ and this sentence may be
modified or amended in a manner that is adverse in any respect to any
Financing Party without the prior written consent of such Financing Party (and
any such consent of such Financing Party, to the extent given, shall be
effective with respect to such Financing Party and with respect each of their
respective Affiliates and any other Person constituting a Financing Party due
to its relationship with any such Financing Party).

 



 

12.7 _Effect of Waiver or Consent_.

 



 

No waiver or consent, express or implied, by any party to or of any breach or
default by any other party in the performance by such other party of its
obligations hereunder shall be deemed or construed to be a consent or waiver
to or of any other breach or default in the performance by such other party of
any other obligations of such party hereunder. No single or partial exercise
of any right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to
enforce any right or power, shall preclude any other or further exercise
thereof or the exercise of any other right or power. Failure on the part of a
party to complain of any act of any other party or to declare any other party
in default, irrespective of how long such failure continues, shall not
constitute a waiver by such party of its rights hereunder until the applicable
statute of limitation period has run.

 



 

12.8 _Parties in Interest; Limitation on Rights of Others_.

 



 

The terms of this Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure to the benefit
of, the parties hereto and their respective legal representatives, successors
and permitted assigns. Except as expressly set forth in _Section 6.6_,
_Section 11.3_ and _Article _X, nothing in this Agreement, whether express
or implied, shall be construed to give any Person (other than the parties
hereto and their respective legal representatives, successors and permitted
assigns and as

 



      
 

 



 

expressly provided herein) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under
or in respect of this Agreement or any covenants, conditions or provisions
contained herein, as a third party beneficiary or otherwise; provided,
however, that the Financing Parties shall be express third-party beneficiaries
of, and shall be entitled to rely on and enforce, this _Section 12.8_,
_Section 11.3(c)_, _Section 11.3(e)_, _Section 12.3_, _Section 12.6_,
_Section 12.11(b)_ and _Section 12.14(b)_.

 



 

12.9 _Assignability_.

 



 

This Agreement shall not be assigned in whole or part by the Company or Seller
without the prior written consent of Holdings. Subject to _Section 6.19(b)_,
this Agreement shall not be assigned in whole or part by Buyer, Holdings or
Newco without the prior written consent of Seller and any purported assignment
without such consent shall be null and void; _provided_ that Buyer, Holdings
and Newco may assign or pledge any or all of its rights and interests
hereunder to one or more of its respective Affiliates or to any provider of
the Debt Financing or any agent or trustee thereof as collateral security in
connection with the Debt Financing, without the prior written consent of any
other party hereto.

 



 

12.10 _Disclosure Schedules_.

 



 

No reference to or disclosure of any item or other matter in the Company
Disclosure Schedule or the Buyer Disclosure Schedule shall be construed as an
admission or indication that such item or other matter is material (nor shall
it establish a standard of materiality for any purpose whatsoever) or that
such item or other matter is required to be referred to or disclosed in the
Company Disclosure Schedule or the Buyer Disclosure Schedule. The information
set forth in the Company Disclosure Schedule and the Buyer Disclosure Schedule
is disclosed solely for the purposes of this Agreement, and no information set
forth therein shall be deemed to be an admission by any party hereto to any
third party of any matter whatsoever, including any violation of Law or breach
of any Contract. The Company Disclosure Schedule and the Buyer Disclosure
Schedule and the information and disclosures contained therein are intended
only to qualify and limit the representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements of the Company and Seller, on the one hand, and Buyer, Holdings and
Newco, on the other hand, respectively, contained in this Agreement. Nothing
in the Company Disclosure Schedule or the Buyer Disclosure Schedule is
intended to broaden the scope of any representation or warranty contained in
this Agreement or create any covenant or other agreement. Matters reflected in
the Company Disclosure Schedule and the Buyer Disclosure Schedule are not
necessarily limited to matters required by the Agreement to be reflected in
the Company Disclosure Schedule and the Buyer Disclosure Schedule,
respectively. Such additional matters are set forth for informational purposes
and do not necessarily include other matters of a similar nature.

 



 

12.11 _Jurisdiction; Court Proceedings; Waiver of Jury Trial_.

 



 

(a) Any Proceeding against any party to this Agreement arising out of or in
any way relating to this Agreement or the Contemplated Transactions shall be
brought exclusively in the Delaware Court of Chancery (or, only if the
Delaware Court of Chancery declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular
matter, any state or federal court within the State of Delaware) and each of
the parties hereby submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts

 



      
 

 



 

for the purpose of any such Proceeding; provided, that a final judgment in any
such Proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions
by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law. Each party
irrevocably and unconditionally agrees not to assert (a) any objection which
it may ever have to the laying of venue of any such Proceeding in any such
courts, (b) any claim that any such Proceeding brought in any such court has
been brought in an inconvenient forum and (c) any claim that such court does
not have personal jurisdiction with respect to such Proceeding. To the extent
that service of process by mail is permitted by applicable Law, each party
irrevocably consents to the service of process in any such Proceeding in such
courts by the mailing of such process by registered or certified mail, postage
prepaid, at its address for notices provided for herein. Each party
irrevocably and unconditionally waives any right to a trial by jury and agrees
that any of them may file a copy of this paragraph with any court as written
evidence of the knowing, voluntary and bargained-for agreement among the
parties irrevocably to waive its right to trial by jury in any such
Proceeding.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, each
of the parties hereto: (i) agrees that it will not bring or support any Person
in any Proceeding of any kind or description, whether in law or in equity,
whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against any of the Financing
Parties in any way relating to this Agreement or any of the Contemplated
Transactions, including, but not limited to, the Debt Financing, in any forum
other than the United States District Court for the Southern District of New
York (and the appellate courts thereof), or, if jurisdiction is not available
in the federal courts, the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of
New York, Borough of Manhattan, (ii) agrees that all claims or causes of
action (whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) against
any of the Financing Parties in any way relating to this Agreement, the Debt
Financing or the performance hereof or thereof or the financings contemplated
thereby, shall be exclusively governed by, and construed in accordance with,
the laws of the State of New York, and (iii) hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally waives any right such party may have to a trial by jury in
respect of any litigation (whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or
in tort or otherwise) against the Financing Parties directly or indirectly
arising out of or relating in any way to this Agreement, the Debt Financing or
the performance hereof or thereof or the financings contemplated thereby.

 



 

12.12 _No Other Duties_.

 



 

The only duties and obligations of the parties under this Agreement are as
specifically set forth in this Agreement, and no other duties or obligations
shall be implied in fact, Law or equity, or under any principle of fiduciary
obligation.

 



 

12.13 _Reliance on Counsel and Other Advisors_.

 



 

Each party has consulted such legal, financial, technical or other expert as
it deems necessary or desirable before entering into this Agreement. Each
party represents and warrants that it has read, knows, understands and agrees
with the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

12.14 _Remedies_.

 



 

(a) Subject to _Section 11.3_ and except in the case of Fraud, all remedies,
either under this Agreement or by Law or otherwise afforded to the parties
hereunder, shall be cumulative and not alternative, and any Person having any
rights under any provision of this Agreement will be entitled to enforce such
rights specifically to recover damages by reason of any breach of this
Agreement and to exercise all other rights granted by Law, equity or
otherwise. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY SET FORTH IN THIS
AGREEMENT, THE PARTIES AGREE AND ACKNOWLEDGE THAT AS AMONG THE SELLER, THE
COMPANY AND THE BUYER THEY WILL NOT HAVE ANY LIABILITY OR RESPONSIBILITY TO
THE OTHER PARTY OR ANY OTHER PERSON FOR ANY EXEMPLARY OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES WITH
RESPECT TO ANY CLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, EVEN IF
ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF THOSE DAMAGES, AND WHETHER THE CLAIM ARISES OUT
OF BREACH OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE (EXCEPT IN ANY CASE TO THE EXTENT
AWARDED TO A THIRD PARTY).

 



 

(b) None of the Seller, the Company, or any of their respective Affiliates,
nor any of their respective former, current or future directors, officers,
employees, agents, general or limited partners, managers, members,
stockholders, Affiliates or assignees or any former, current or future
director, officer, employee, agent, general or limited partner, manager,
member, stockholder, Affiliate or assignee of any of the foregoing
(collectively, the " _Seller Related Parties_ ") shall have any rights or
claims against any of the Financing Parties, solely in their respective
capacities as lenders or arrangers in connection with this Agreement or the
Debt Financing, and, subject to the rights of the Financing Sources to provide
the Debt Financing under the terms thereof, the Financing Parties, solely in
their respective capacities as lenders or arrangers, shall not have any rights
or claims against any Seller Related Parties, in connection with this
Agreement, in each case, whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort or
otherwise.

 



 

12.15 _Specific Performance_.

 



 

(a) The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that
any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or were otherwise breached. Accordingly, subject to
_Section 11.3_ and _Section 12.15(b)_, the parties agree that, in addition
to any other remedies, each party shall be entitled to enforce the terms of
this Agreement by a decree of specific performance without the necessity of
proving the inadequacy of money damages as a remedy. Each party hereby waives
any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with
such remedy. Each party further agrees that the only permitted objection that
it may raise in response to any action for equitable relief is that it
contests the existence of a breach or threatened breach of this Agreement.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, but
subject to _Section 11.3_, it is explicitly agreed that Seller (and only
Seller) shall be entitled to specific performance of Buyers, Holdings and
Newcos obligation to effect the Closing if, and only if:

 



      
 

 



 

(i) all conditions set forth in _Section 7.1_ and _Section 7.3_ (other than
those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied by actions taken at
the Closing) were satisfied at the time when the Closing was required to occur
pursuant to _Section 2.3_;

 



 

(ii) Buyer, Holdings and Newco are required and have failed to complete the
Closing pursuant to _Section 2.3_;

 



 

(iii) the conditions to the Debt Financing set forth in the definitive
agreements regarding the Debt Financing have been satisfied; and

 



 

(iv) Seller has irrevocably confirmed in writing to Holdings that if specific
performance under this _Section 12.15_ is granted and the Debt Financing is
funded, then the Seller will take all actions within its control to cause the
Closing to occur.

 



 

12.16 _Counterparts_.

 



 

This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts with the same
effect as if all signatory parties had signed the same document. All
counterparts shall be construed together and shall constitute one and the same
instrument. This Agreement and any signed agreement or instrument entered into
in connection with this Agreement, and any amendments or waivers hereto or
thereto, to the extent signed and delivered by means of a facsimile machine or
by e-mail delivery of a ".pdf" format data file, shall be treated in all
manner and respects as an original agreement or instrument and shall be
considered to have the same binding legal effect as if it were the original
signed version thereof delivered in person. No party hereto or to any such
agreement or instrument shall raise the use of a facsimile machine or e-mail
delivery of a ".pdf" format data file to deliver a signature to this Agreement
or any amendment hereto or the fact that any signature or agreement or
instrument was transmitted or communicated through the use of a facsimile
machine or e-mail delivery of a ".pdf" format data file as a defense to the
formation of a contract and each party hereto forever waives any such defense.

 



 

12.17 _Further Assurance_.

 



 

If at any time after the Closing any further action is necessary or desirable
to fully effect the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, each of the
parties shall take (or shall cause its Affiliate to take) such further action
(including the execution and delivery of such further instruments and
documents) as any other party reasonably may request.

 



 

12.18 _Legal Representation_.

 



 

Each of the parties to this Agreement acknowledges that Jones Day currently
serves as counsel to both (a) the Company and its Subsidiaries and (b) Seller
in connection with the negotiation, preparation, execution and delivery of
this Agreement and the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions (the "
_Representation_ "). There may come a time, including after consummation of
the Contemplated Transactions, when the interests of Seller and the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries may no longer be aligned or when, for any reason,
Seller, Jones Day or the Company or any of its Subsidiaries believes that
Jones Day can or should no longer represent both Seller and the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries. The parties understand and specifically

 



      
 

 



 

agree that Jones Day may withdraw from representing the Company and its
Subsidiaries and continue to represent Seller, even if the interests of Seller
and the interests of the Company or its Subsidiaries are or may be adverse,
including in connection with any dispute arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or the Contemplated Transactions, and even though Jones Day may have
represented the Company and its Subsidiaries in a matter substantially related
to such dispute or may be handling ongoing matters for the Company or any of
its Affiliates, and Holdings and the Company hereby consent thereto and waive
any conflict of interest arising therefrom. Each of the parties further agrees
that, as to all communications with respect to the Representation among Jones
Day, the Company, any of its Subsidiaries and Seller, the attorney-client
privilege, the expectation of client confidence and all other rights to any
evidentiary privilege belong to Seller and shall not pass to or be claimed by
the Company or any of its Affiliates. In addition, if the Contemplated
Transactions are consummated, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall have no
right of access to or control over any of Jones Days records related to the
Representation, which shall become the property of (and be controlled by)
Seller. Furthermore, in the event of a dispute between Seller and the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries arising out of or relating to the Representation,
none of the attorney-client privilege, the expectation of client confidence or
any other rights to any evidentiary privilege will protect from disclosure to
Seller any information or documents developed or shared during the course of
the Representation.

 



 

12.19 _Releases_.

 



 

(a) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, effective as of the
Closing, Seller, on behalf of itself and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates, and
on behalf of all of their respective directors, officers, employees, agents,
successors and assigns (collectively, the " _Seller Releasors_ "), hereby
irrevocably release and forever discharges Holdings, Newco, Buyer and their
respective Affiliates and Subsidiaries, the Company and its Subsidiaries, and
each of the Companys and its Subsidiaries respective directors (in such
directors capacity as directors, officers, employees, or agents of, or any
other positions held or services rendered on behalf of, the Company or its
Subsidiaries) (collectively, " _Company Releasees_ ") from any and all claims,
actions, causes of actions, liens, counterclaims, liabilities, suits, debts,
offsets, setoffs, losses, demands, rights, obligations, damages, costs,
attorneys fees, interest, expenses and compensation, including claims of
negligence, conversion, malfeasance, breach of contract, breach of fiduciary
duty and claims for equitable relief but excluding claims to the extent
related to the Fraud of willful misconduct of the applicable party
(collectively, " _Claims_ "), whether known or unknown, that Seller Releasors
have had in the past, or have now or may have in the future against the
Company Releases arising from the ownership of the Company Common Stock prior
to the Closing, or, with respect to directors of the Company or its
Subsidiaries, their respective service to the Company or its Subsidiaries as
directors, officers, employees, or agents of, or any other positions held or
services rendered on behalf of, the Company or its Subsidiaries.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, this release shall not be construed to release
any claims against any Company Releasee, if any, based on this Agreement, the
Amended and Restated Newco Operating Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreement
or in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

(b) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, effective as of the
Closing, the Company, Buyer, Holdings and Newco, each on behalf of itself and
its Subsidiaries

 



      
 

 



 

and Affiliates, and on behalf of all of their respective directors, officers,
employees, agents, successors and assigns (collectively, the " _Company
Releasors_ "), hereby irrevocably release and forever discharges Seller and
its Affiliates and Subsidiaries, including the Company and its Subsidiaries,
and each of their respective directors (in such directors capacity as
directors, officers, employees, or agents of, or any other positions held or
services rendered on behalf of, the Seller or its Affiliates or Subsidiaries,
including the Company and its Subsidiaries) (collectively, " _Seller
Releasees_ ") from any and all Claims, whether known or unknown, that Company
Releasors have had in the past, or have now or may have in the future against
the Seller Releasees arising from Sellers ownership of the Company Common
Stock prior to the Closing, or, with respect to directors of Seller or its
Affiliates or Subsidiaries, including the Company and its Subsidiaries, their
respective service to the Seller or its Affiliates or Subsidiaries prior to
the Closing, including the Company or its Subsidiaries, as directors,
officers, employees, or agents of, or any other positions held or services
rendered on behalf of, Seller or its Affiliates or Subsidiaries, including the
Company or its Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this release shall
not be construed to release any claims against Seller Releasee, if any, based
on (i) this Agreement, the Amended and Restated Newco Operating Agreement, the
Confidentiality Agreement or in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby or (ii) commercial dealings between any Seller Releasee and any Company
Releasor unrelated to the Contemplated Transactions.
