validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the State of Delaware

delay or materially affect the ability of the Buyer Parties to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each Buyer Party has full power
and authority to carry on the business in which it is engaged, and to own and

 



11  use the properties owned and used by it except where the failure to have the
power and authority to carry on such business and to own and use the

delay or adversely affect the ability of the Buyer Parties to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. There is no proposed, pending or,
to the Buyers Knowledge, threatened action relating to the dissolution,
liquidation, insolvency or rehabilitation of any of the Buyer Parties.

(b) _Authorization of Transaction_. Each Buyer Party has full power and
authority (including full entity power and authority) to execute and deliver
each Transaction Agreement to which such Buyer Party is a party and to perform
its obligations thereunder. The execution and delivery of each of the

authorized by all required entity action on the part of such Buyer
Party. This Agreement has been, and each of the other Transaction Agreements
to which any Buyer Party is a party will be at or prior to the Closing, duly
and validly executed and delivered by such Buyer Party, and each Transaction
Agreement to which any Buyer Party is a party constitutes the valid and
legally binding obligation of such Buyer Party, enforceable against such Buyer
Party in accordance with its terms and conditions, subject, however, to the
effects of bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar Laws
affecting creditors rights generally, and to general principles of equity
(regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in
equity or at law). Except as set forth on  _Schedule 3(b)_, no Buyer Party
needs to give any notice to, make any filing with or obtain any authorization,
consent or approval of any Governmental Authority or any other Person to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any other
Transaction Agreement to which such Buyer Party is a party.

(c) _Noncontravention_. Except as set forth on _Schedule 3(c)_, neither the
execution and delivery of any Transaction Agreement to which any Buyer Party
is a party, nor the consummation of any of the transactions contemplated
thereby, will (A) violate any Law to which any Buyer Party is subject, (B)
conflict with, result in a breach of, constitute a default under, result in
the acceleration of, create in any Person the right to accelerate, terminate,
modify or cancel or require any notice, payment or lien under any agreement,
contract, lease, license, instrument or other arrangement to which any Buyer
Party is a party or by which any Buyer Party is bound or to which any Buyer
Partys assets are subject or (C) violate any order of any
Governmental Authority, except where the violation, conflict, breach,
default, acceleration, termination, modification, cancellation, failure to
give notice, right to payment or other compensation or Encumbrance would not,
individually or in the aggregate, materially affect such Buyer Partys
ability to consummate the transactions contemplated by such Transaction
Agreement.

pay any fees or commissions to any broker, finder or similar agent with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

forth in this Agreement, the Buyer makes no representations or warranties
whatsoever to the Seller and hereby disclaims all liability and responsibility
for any representation, warranty, statement, or information made,
communicated, or furnished (orally or in writing) to the Seller or its
representatives (including any opinion, information, projection, or advice
that may have been or may be provided to the Seller by any director, officer,
employee, agent, consultant, or representative of the Buyer or any Affiliate
thereof).

(h) _No Reliance_. Each Buyer Party has reviewed and had access to all
documents, records, and information which it has desired to review in
connection with its decision to enter into this Agreement, and to purchase the
Assigned Equity Interest and to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby. In deciding to enter into this Agreement, and to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby, each Buyer Party has relied solely upon its
own knowledge, independent investigation, review and analysis (and that of its
representatives) and not on any disclosure or representation made by, or any
duty to disclose on the part of, the Seller, its Affiliates, or any of their
representatives, other than the representations and warranties of the Seller
expressly set forth herein and the other Transaction Agreements.

Equity Interest, when acquired by a Buyer Party at the Closing, will be

purposes, and such Buyer Party is not acquiring the Assigned Equity Interest
from the Seller with a view to, or to make offers of sales for the Seller in
connection with, any distribution thereof, or to participate or have a direct
or indirect participation in any such undertaking, or to participate or have a
participation in the direct or indirect underwriting of any such undertaking,
in each case within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended
(the " _Securities Act_ "), or applicable state securities Laws. Each Buyer
Party understands that: (i) the Assigned Equity Interest has not been
registered under the Securities Act by reason of its issuance in a
transaction exempt from the registration and prospectus delivery requirements
of the Securities Act and has not been qualified under any state securities
Laws on the grounds that the offering and sale of securities contemplated by
this Agreement are exempt from registration thereunder; and (ii) the Sellers
reliance on such exemptions is predicated on the Buyers representations set
forth herein. Each Buyer Party understands that the resale of the Assigned
Equity Interest may be restricted indefinitely, unless a subsequent
disposition thereof is registered under the Securities Act and registered
under any state securities Law or is exempt from such registration. Each
Buyer Party is an "accredited investor" as that term is defined in Rule 501 of
Regulation D promulgated by the SEC under the Securities Act. Each Buyer Party
is able to bear the economic risk of the acquisition of the Assigned Equity
Interest pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, including a complete loss of
such Buyer Partys investment in the Assigned Equity Interest, for an
indefinite period of time and has such knowledge and experience in financial
or business matters that it is capable of evaluating the merits and risks of
its acquisition of the Assigned Equity Interest. For purposes of state "blue
sky" Laws, the Buyer represents and warrants that the principal executive
offices of the Buyer Parties are located in the State of Texas and that the
decision by the Buyer Parties to acquire the Assigned Equity Interest shall be
deemed to occur solely in the State of Texas.

standing, failures to have such power and authority and failures to be so
enforceable as would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Company
Material Adverse Effect; and

any order of any Governmental Authority, except where the violation,

or Encumbrance affecting the Seller would not, individually or in the
aggregate, materially affect the ability of the Seller to consummate the

claim for indemnification against the Seller pursuant to _Section 11(g)_
within the applicable survival period pursuant to _Section 8(a)_, then from
and after Closing, the Seller agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Buyer
Indemnitees from and against any Adverse Consequences suffered by the Buyer
Indemnitees to the extent arising from such inaccuracy, violation or breach;
provided that the Seller shall not have any obligation to indemnify the Buyer
Indemnitees from any such individual inaccuracy, violation or breach until the
Buyer Indemnitees have suffered Adverse Consequences in excess of $200,000
(the " _Claim Threshold_ "), at which time the Buyer Indemnitees shall be
entitled to receive the entire amount of such Adverse Consequences in respect
of such indemnification claim (including the portion not in excess of the
Claim Threshold) (such indemnification claim, a " _Qualifying Buyer Indemnity
Claim_ "), subject to the remaining provisions of this _Article 8_;
_provided, further_ , that the Seller shall not have any obligation to
indemnify the Buyer Indemnitees from any Qualifying Buyer Indemnity Claim
until the Buyer Indemnitees, in the aggregate, have suffered Adverse
Consequences by reason of the sum of all such Qualifying Buyer Indemnity
Claims in excess of an aggregate deductible amount equal to $6.0 million (the
" _Deductible_ "), at which point the Seller shall be obligated to indemnify
the Buyer Indemnitees from and against all Adverse Consequences in respect of
all Qualifying Buyer Indemnity Claims exceeding the Deductible, subject to
the other provisions of this _Article 8_.

(ii) In the event of: (x) any breach of the Sellers covenants in this
Agreement, and (y) the Buyer Indemnitees make a written claim for
indemnification against the Seller pursuant to  _Section 11(g)_ within the
applicable survival period pursuant to _Section 8(a)_, then from and after
the Closing, the Seller agrees to indemnify the Buyer Indemnitees from and
against any Adverse Consequences suffered by the Buyer Indemnitees to the
extent relating to or arising from such inaccuracy, violation or breach,
subject to the other provisions of this _Article 8_.

(iii) In determining the scope of the Sellers indemnification obligations
under this _Section 8(b)_, any qualification as to Company Material Adverse
Effect shall be disregarded and the entire amount of the Adverse Consequences
suffered by the applicable Buyer Indemnitees shall be included in the
calculation of the amount of Adverse Consequences to which such Buyer
Indemnitees shall be entitled to indemnification; _provided, however_ , that
such qualifications as to Company Material Adverse Effect shall apply for
purposes of determining whether there has been a breach in the first place.

 

(iv) To the extent any Buyer Indemnitee becomes liable to, and is ordered to
and does pay to any third party that is not a Buyer Indemnitee, punitive,
exemplary, treble, special or consequential damages caused by any matter for
which such Buyer Indemnitee is entitled to be indemnified under this _Section
8(b)_, then such punitive, exemplary, treble, special, indirect, incidental
or consequential damages shall be deemed actual damages to such Buyer
Indemnitee and included within the definition of Adverse Consequences for
purposes of this _Article 8_. Except to the extent specified in
the immediately preceding sentence with respect to Third Party Claims, the
Seller shall not be liable to any Buyer Indemnitee for any punitive,
exemplary, treble, special, indirect, incidental or consequential damages
(including any loss of earnings or profits).

 



28 (v) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in no
event shall the Seller ever be required to indemnify the Buyer Indemnitees
for Adverse Consequences under: (i) _Section 8(b)(i)_ in an amount
exceeding, in the aggregate, $25.0 million; or (ii) any and all provisions of
this Agreement in an amount exceeding, in the aggregate, the Purchase Price.

(vi) No claim for indemnification may be asserted or commenced against the
Seller pursuant to this _Section 8(b)_ unless written notice of such claim is
received by the Seller describing in reasonable detail the facts and
circumstances with respect to the subject matter of such claim on or prior to
the date on which the representation, warranty or covenant on which such claim
is based ceases to survive as set forth in _Section 8(a)_.

 

(vii) No claim for a breach of representation or warranty under _Section
8(b)(i) _may be asserted or commenced by any Buyer Indemnitee against the
Seller to the extent arising out of, resulting from or relating to any breach
of any representation or warranty of which the Buyer had Knowledge on or prior
to the Closing Date unless the Buyer was otherwise obligated to Close
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.

(c) _Indemnification Provisions for the Benefit of the Seller_.

(i) In the event of: (x) any inaccuracy, violation or breach in any
representation or warranty contained in _Article 3_ and referred to in
Section 8(a)(ii) or (iii); and (y) the Seller Indemnitees make a written claim
for indemnification against the Buyer pursuant to _Section 11(g)_ within the
applicable survival period pursuant to _Section 8(a)_, then from and after
the Closing the Buyer agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Seller
Indemnitees from and against any Adverse Consequences suffered by the Seller
Indemnitees to the extent arising from such inaccuracy, violation or breach;
that the Buyer shall not have any obligation to indemnify the Seller
Indemnitees from any such individual inaccuracy, violation or breach until the
Seller Indemnitees have suffered Adverse Consequences in excess of the Claim
Threshold, at which time the Buyer Indemnitees shall be entitled to receive
the entire amount of such Adverse Consequences in respect of such
indemnification claim (including the portion not in excess of the
Claim Threshold) (such indemnification claim, a " _Qualifying Seller
Indemnity Claim_ "), subject to the remaining provisions of this _Article 8_;
_provided, further_ , that the Buyer shall not have any obligation
to indemnify the Seller Indemnitees from any such Qualifying Seller Indemnity
Claim until the Seller Indemnitees, in the aggregate, have suffered Adverse
Consequences by reason of the sum of all such Qualifying Seller Indemnity
Claims in excess of the Deductible, at which point the Buyer shall be
obligated to indemnify the Seller Indemnitees from and against all Adverse
Consequences in respect of all Qualifying Seller Indemnity Claims exceeding
the Deductible, subject to the other provisions of this _Article 8_.

 



29 (ii) In the event of: (x) any breach of the Buyers covenants in this
Agreement, and (y) the Seller Indemnitees make a written claim for
indemnification against the Buyer pursuant to _Section 11(g)_ within the
applicable survival period pursuant to _Section 8(a)_, then from and after
the Closing, the Buyer agrees to indemnify the Seller Indemnitees from and
against any Adverse Consequences suffered by the Seller Indemnitees to the
extent relating to or arising from such inaccuracy, violation or breach,
subject to the other provisions of this _Article 8_.

(iii) To the extent any Seller Indemnitee becomes liable to, and is ordered
to and does pay to any third party that is not a Seller Indemnitee, punitive,
exemplary, treble, special or consequential damages caused by any matter for
which such Seller Indemnitee is entitled to be indemnified under this 
_Section 8(c)_, then such punitive, exemplary, treble, special, indirect,
incidental or consequential damages shall be deemed actual damages to such
Seller Indemnitee and included within the definition of Adverse Consequences
for purposes of this _Article 8_. Except to the extent specified in the
immediately preceding sentence with respect to Third Party Claims, the Buyer
shall not be liable to any Seller Indemnitee for any punitive, exemplary,
treble, special, indirect, incidental or consequential damages (including any
loss of earnings or profits).

(iv) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in no event
shall the Buyer ever be required to indemnify the Seller Indemnitees for
Adverse Consequences under (i) _Section 8(c)(i)_ in an amount exceeding, in
the aggregate, $25 million; or (ii) obligations pursuant to _Article 5_ in an
amount exceeding, in the aggregate, the Purchase Price.

 

(v) No claim for indemnification may be asserted or commenced against the
Buyer pursuant to this _Section 8(c)_ unless written notice of such claim is
received by the Buyer describing in reasonable detail the facts and
circumstances with respect to the subject matter of such claim on or prior to
the date on which the representation, warranty or covenant on which such
claim is based ceases to survive as set forth in _Section 8(a)_.

(vi) No claim for a breach of representation or warranty under _Section
8(c)(i) _may be asserted or commenced by any Seller Indemnitee against the
Buyer to the extent arising out of, resulting from or relating to any breach
of any representation or warranty of which the Seller had Knowledge on or
prior to the Closing Date unless the Seller was otherwise obligated to Close
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.

(d) _Matters Involving Third Parties_.

(i) If any third party shall notify any Seller Indemnitee or Buyer
Indemnitee, as the case may be (for purposes of this _Section 8(d)_, the "
_Indemnified Party_ "), with respect to any matter (a " _Third Party Claim_
") that may give rise to a claim for indemnification against the indemnifying
party under _Section 8(b)_ or _Section 8(c)_, as applicable (for purposes of
this _Section 8(d)_, the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") under this Article 8,
then the Indemnified Party shall promptly (and in any event within five (5)
business days after receiving notice of the Third Party Claim) notify the
Indemnifying Party thereof in a written notice stating the amount of the
Adverse Consequences, if known, and method of

 



30  computation thereof, and containing a reference to the provisions of this
Agreement in respect of which such right of indemnification is claimed or
arises. Failure to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the
Indemnifying Party of any liability that it may have to the Indemnified Party,
except to the extent the defense of such claim is prejudiced by the
Indemnified Partys failure to give such notice.

 

(ii) The Indemnifying Party shall have the right to assume and thereafter
conduct the defense of the Third Party Claim with counsel of its choice
reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party
shall have full control of such defense and proceedings, including any
compromise or settlement thereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the Indemnifying Party shall not consent to the entry of any judgment or
enter into any settlement with respect to the Third Party Claim which provides
for or results in any payment by or Obligation of the Indemnified Party of or
for any damages or other amount, any Encumbrance on any property of the
Indemnified Party, any finding of responsibility or liability on the part of
the Indemnified Party or any sanction or injunction of, restriction upon the
conduct of any business by, or other equitable relief upon the Indemnified
Party, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (not to be
withheld unreasonably).

(iii) Unless and until the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of the Third
Party Claim as provided in _Section 8(d)(i)_, the Indemnified Party may
defend against the Third Party Claim in any manner it reasonably may deem
appropriate; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the Indemnified
Party consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with
respect to any such Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of
the Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not be withheld unreasonably.

(e) _Indemnification if Negligence of Indemnitee_. THE INDEMNIFICATION
PROVIDED IN THIS _ARTICLE 8_ WILL BE APPLICABLE WHETHER OR NOT THE SOLE,
JOINT OR CONTRIBUTORY NEGLIGENCE (OTHER THAN GROSS NEGLIGENCE) OF THE
INDEMNIFIED PARTY IS ALLEGED OR PROVEN. THE PARTIES AGREE THE IMMEDIATELY
PRECEDING SENTENCE IS COMMERCIALLY CONSPICUOUS.

(f) _No Waiver of Rights or Remedies_. Subject to the foregoing provisions of
this _Article 8_, each Indemnified Partys rights and remedies set forth in
this Agreement will survive the Closing and will not be deemed waived by such
Indemnified Partys consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and will be effective regardless of any inspection or investigation
conducted by or on behalf of such Indemnified Party or by its directors,
officers, employees, or representatives or at any time (regardless of whether
notice of such knowledge has been given to Indemnifying Party), whether before
or after the date of this Agreement or the Closing Date with respect to any
circumstances constituting a condition under this Agreement, unless
any waiver specifically so states.

(g) _Determination of Amount of Adverse Consequences_. The Adverse
Consequences giving rise to any indemnification obligation hereunder shall be
limited to the actual loss suffered by the Indemnified Party (reduced by any
insurance proceeds or other third-party payments received, realized or
retained by the Indemnified Party as a result of the events giving rise to
the claim for indemnification net of any expenses related to the receipt of
such proceeds as well as any Tax Benefit recognized by the

 



31  Indemnified Party (or the affiliated group of which it is a member)
occasioned by such loss or damage). Any Indemnified Party seeking indemnity
hereunder shall use commercially reasonable efforts to seek coverage
(including both costs of defense and indemnity) under applicable insurance
policies with respect to any such Adverse Consequences. In the event that a
Buyer Indemnitee receives a payment under any insurance policy or other
proceeds from a third party that would have reduced, pursuant to this
_Section 8(g)_, an indemnification payment made by a Party hereunder if such
payment under such insurance policy or other third-party source had been
received prior to such indemnification payment, such Indemnified Party shall
refund to the applicable Party an aggregate amount that equals the net amount
(taking into account any costs or expenses, including reasonable attorneys
fees, associated with submitting or otherwise making a claim for, or
collecting, such payment) of the reduction that would have so resulted from
its earlier receipt of such payment under such insurance policy or from such
third party. The amount of the loss and the amount of the indemnity payment
shall be computed by taking into account the timing of the loss or payment, as
applicable, using a Prime Rate plus 2% interest or discount rate, as
appropriate. Upon the request of the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified
Party shall provide the Indemnifying Party with information sufficient to
allow the Indemnifying Party to calculate the amount of the indemnity payment
in accordance with this _Section 8(g)_. An Indemnified Party shall take all
reasonable steps to mitigate damages in respect of any claim for which it is
seeking indemnification and shall use reasonable efforts to avoid any costs or
expenses associated with such claim and, if such costs and expenses cannot be
avoided, to minimize the amount thereof.

(h) _Tax Treatment of Indemnity Payments_. The Parties hereto agree that all
indemnification payments made under this Agreement, including any payment
made under _Article 9_, shall be treated as purchase price adjustments for
Tax purposes.

(i) _Exclusive Post-Closing Remedy_. After the Closing, the rights and
remedies set forth in this _Article 8_ and _Article 9_ shall constitute the
sole and exclusive rights and remedies of the Parties under or with respect
to the subject matter of this Agreement except for any non-monetary, equitable
relief to which any Party may be entitled, and any remedies for actual fraud.

 

(j) _Additional Remedy Matters_. To the extent any claim may be recoverable
pursuant to more than one Section of this  _Article 8_, the Indemnified
Party may make such claim under any such Section in the alternative.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in the event any Party (or
any other indemnitee) is entitled to a payment or other benefit under more
than one provision of this Agreement arising out of or resulting from the same
set of facts or circumstances and such Person has already been made whole by
payment or another benefit under one of those provisions, in no event shall
such Person be entitled to receive a subsequent payment or benefit under any
other provision of this Agreement ( _i.e._ , such Person shall not receive
more than its damages). In furtherance of the foregoing, any liability for
indemnification hereunder shall be without duplication ( _i.e._ , without
allowing the claiming Party (or other indemnitee) to receive more than its
damages) by reason of the state of facts giving rise to such liability
constituting a breach of more than one representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement.

9\. T _ax Matters_.

 

(a) _Allocations_. With respect to the taxable year that includes the Closing
Date, the Seller shall be allocated, in accordance with the Organizational
Documents of the Company in effect as of the Closing Date, all items of
income, loss, deduction, and credit of the Company for the period prior to

 



32  and including the Closing Date and the Buyer shall be allocated all
remaining items of income, loss, deduction, and credit of the Company. More
precisely, with respect to the sale of a portion of the Equity Interest in
the Company pursuant to this Agreement, the Buyer and the Seller agree to
cause the Company (to the extent they have the Legal Right) to elect "the
closing of the books" method pursuant to the Regulations of Section 706 of
the Code.

(b) _Cooperation on Tax Matters_.

 

(i) The Buyer and the Seller shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent
reasonably requested by the other Party, in connection with the preparation
and filing of Tax Returns pursuant to this _Section 9(b)_ and any audit,
litigation or other proceeding and making employees available on a mutually
convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any
material provided hereunder. The Buyer and the Seller shall retain all books
and records in their possession with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the
Company relating to any whole or partial taxable period beginning before
the Closing Date until the expiration of the statute of limitations (and, to
the extent notified by the Buyer or the Seller, any extensions thereof) of the
respective taxable periods (the " _Records_ "), and to abide by all
record retention agreements entered into with any taxing authority. Following
the Closing Date, each Party shall afford the other Party and its accountants,
and counsel, during normal business hours, upon reasonable request, full
access to the Records and to such Partys employees to the extent that such
access may be requested for purposes of preparing or filing any Tax Return,
claiming any refund with respect to Taxes or defending any audit or other
proceeding with respect to Taxes at no cost to the Party accessing the
Records (other than for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses); provided that such
access shall not be construed to require the disclosure of Records that would
cause the waiver of any attorney-client, work product, or like privilege or
cause the breach of any confidentiality agreement; _provided, further_ , that
in the event of any litigation nothing herein shall limit either Partys
rights of discovery under applicable Law.

 

(ii) The Buyer and the Seller further agree, upon request, to use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain any certificate or other document from any
Governmental Authority or any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate,
reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed (including with respect to
the transactions contemplated hereby).

 

(iii) The Buyer and the Seller agree, upon request, to provide the other
Parties with all information that such other Parties may be required to
report pursuant to Sections 751 and 6050K of the Code and all Treasury
Department Regulations promulgated thereunder.

(c) _Transfer Taxes_. The Seller shall file all necessary Tax Returns and
other documentation with respect to all transfer, documentary, sales, use,
stamp, registration and other similar Taxes and fees resulting from the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, if any, and, if required by
applicable Law, the Buyer shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, join in
the execution of any such Tax Returns and other documentation. Buyer shall be
responsible for and will indemnify Seller from and against any such Taxes and
fees. The Parties shall reasonably cooperate in good faith to minimize, to the
extent permissible under applicable Law, the amount of any such Taxes and
fees. 

 



33 (d) _Confidentiality_. Any information shared in connection with Taxes shall
be kept confidential, except as may otherwise be necessary in connection with
the filing of Tax Returns or reports, refund claims, Tax audits, Tax claims
and Tax litigation, or as required by Law.

 

(e) _Audits_. The Seller or the Buyer, as applicable, shall provide prompt
written notice to the other Parties of any pending or threatened Tax audit,
assessment or proceeding that it becomes aware of related to the Company or
the Company Assets for whole or partial periods for which it is indemnified by
the other Party hereunder. Such notice shall contain factual information (to
the extent known) describing the asserted Tax liability in reasonable detail
and shall be accompanied by copies of any notice or other document received
from or with any Tax authority in respect of any such matters. If an
Indemnified Party has knowledge of an asserted Tax liability with respect to
a matter for which it is to be indemnified hereunder and such Party fails to
give the Indemnifying Party prompt notice of such asserted Tax liability, then
(i) if the Indemnifying Party is precluded by the failure to give prompt
notice from contesting the asserted tax liability in any forum, the
Indemnifying Party shall have no obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party
for any Taxes arising out of such asserted Tax liability, and (ii) if the
Indemnifying Party is not so precluded from contesting, but such failure to
give prompt notice results in a detriment to the Indemnifying Party, then any
amount which the Indemnifying Party is otherwise required to pay
the Indemnified Party pursuant to this _Section 9(e)_ shall be reduced by
the amount of such detriment, provided, the Indemnified Party shall
nevertheless be entitled to full indemnification hereunder to the extent, and
only to the extent, that such Party can establish that the Indemnifying Party
was not prejudiced by such failure. This _Section 9(e)_ shall control the
procedure for Tax indemnification matters to the extent it is inconsistent
with any other provision of this Agreement.

(f) _Control of Proceedings_. The Party responsible for the Tax under this
Agreement shall control audits and disputes related to such Taxes (including
action taken to pay, compromise or settle such Taxes). Reasonable out-of-
pocket expenses with respect to such contests shall be borne by the Seller and
the Buyer in proportion to their responsibility for such Taxes as set forth
in this Agreement. Except as otherwise provided by this Agreement, the
noncontrolling party shall be afforded a reasonable opportunity to participate
in such proceedings at its own expense.

 

(g) _Powers of Attorney_. To the extent the Buyer has the Legal Right, the
Buyer shall, and shall cause the Company and its Affiliates to, provide the
Seller and its Affiliates with such powers of attorney or other authorizing
documentation as are reasonably necessary to empower them to execute and file
returns they are responsible for hereunder, file refund and equivalent claims
for Taxes they are responsible for, and contest, settle, and resolve any
audits and disputes that they have control over under _Section 9(e)
_(including any refund claims which turn into audits or disputes).

 

(h) _Tax Refunds_. If the Buyer or any Affiliate of the Buyer receives a
refund of any Taxes that the Seller is responsible for hereunder, or if the
Seller or any Affiliate of the Seller receives a refund of any Taxes that the
Buyer is responsible for hereunder, the Party receiving such refund shall,
within thirty (30) days after receipt of such refund, remit it to the Party
who has responsibility for such Taxes hereunder. For the purpose of this
_Section 9(h)_, the term "refund" shall include a reduction in Tax and the
use of an overpayment as a credit or other Tax offset, and receipt of
a refund shall occur upon the filing of a Tax Return or an adjustment thereto
using such reduction, overpayment or offset or upon the receipt of cash. Each
Party shall promptly notify the other of any right to claim a refund with
respect to Taxes for which the other Party is liable pursuant to this
Agreement and shall reasonably cooperate (at the expense of the Party entitled
to the refund hereunder) in the claim of such refund or other process required
to obtain such refund.

 



34 (i) _Closing Tax Certificate_. At the Closing, the Seller shall deliver to the
Buyer a certificate, in the form of _Exhibit E_.

(j) _Section 754 Election_. The Seller shall take or cause to be taken such
actions as are requested by the Buyer in order to cause the Company to make a
timely election under Section 754 of the Code with respect to the Sellers
sale of the Assigned Equity Interest to the Buyer hereunder.

 

(k) _Conflict_. In the event of a conflict between the provisions of this
_Article 9_ and any other provision of this Agreement, including _Article 8_
, this _Article 9_ shall control.

10\. _Termination_.

 

(a) _Termination of Agreement_. The Parties may terminate this Agreement, as
provided below:

 

(i) the Buyer and the Seller may terminate this Agreement by mutual written
consent at any time before the Closing; 

(ii) the Buyer may terminate this Agreement, if the Buyer is not in default or
breach of any representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained
in this Agreement, by giving written notice to the Seller at any time before
Closing: (A) in the event of any inaccuracy, violation or breach of any
representation, warranty or covenant of the Seller contained in this
Agreement if (w) the Adverse Consequences thereof (with respect to the
representations and warranties, without giving effect to any qualification as
to materiality or Company Material Adverse Effect) would, individually or in
the aggregate, constitute or result in a Company Material Adverse Effect or
materially affect the Sellers ability to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (x) the Buyer has notified the Seller of the
breach in the manner provided for in _Section 11(g)_, (y) the breach has
continued without cure for a period of ten (10) business days after receipt of
the notice of breach and (z) such breach would result in a failure to satisfy
a condition to the Buyers obligation to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby; (B) in the event that the Closing shall not have occurred
on or before December 31, 2011 (unless such failure results from the Buyer
breaching any representation, warranty or covenant contained in this
Agreement); or (C) in the event any of the conditions set forth in _Section
7(a)_ or _Section 7(b)_ shall have become incapable of fulfillment on or
prior to December 31, 2011;

(iii) the Seller may terminate this Agreement, if the Seller is not in default
or breach of any representations, warranties, covenants and agreements
contained in this Agreement, by giving written notice to the Buyer at any time
before Closing (A) in the event of any inaccuracy, violation or breach of any
representation, warranty or covenant of the Buyer contained in this Agreement
if (w) the Adverse Consequences thereof (with respect to the representations
and warranties, without giving effect to any qualification as to materiality)
or materially affect the Buyers ability to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (x) the Seller has notified the Buyer of the
breach in the

 



35  manner provided for in _Section 11(g)_, (y) the breach has continued
without cure for a period of ten (10) business days after receipt of the

condition to the Sellers obligation to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby; (B) in the event that the Closing shall not have occurred
on or before December 31, 2011 (unless such failure results primarily from
the Seller breaching any representation, warranty or covenant contained in
this Agreement); or (C) in the event any of the conditions set forth in
_Section 7(a)_ or  _Section 7(c)_ shall have become incapable of
fulfillment on or prior to December 31, 2011;

 

(iv) either Party may terminate this Agreement if one or both of the other
owners (other than Seller) of a portion of the Equity Interest in the Company
shall have exercised the right pursuant to the Poseidon ROFR Provisions to
acquire any portion of the Sellers Equity Interest in the Company; and

 

(v) either Party may terminate this Agreement if any court of competent
jurisdiction or any governmental, administrative or regulatory authority,
agency or body shall have issued an order, decree or ruling or shall have
taken any other action permanently enjoining, restraining or otherwise
prohibiting the transactions contemplated hereby and such order, decree,
ruling or other action shall have become final and nonappealable.

(b) _Effect of Termination_. Except for the provisions of this  _Article 10_
and _Article 11_ , if any Party terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section
10(a)_, all rights and Obligations of the Parties hereunder shall terminate
without any liability of any Party to the other Party and except that
termination of this Agreement will not affect any liability of either Party
for any breach of this Agreement prior to termination (but, to the extent
provided in Section 5(b)(i), giving effect to any New Seller Information or
any New Buyer Information, as applicable, for purposes of any breach of any
representation and warranty in this Agreement), or any breach at any time of
the provisions hereof surviving termination.

 

11\. _Miscellaneous_.

(a) _Expenses_. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, the
Seller, on the one hand, and the Buyer, on the other hand, will each bear its
own costs and expenses (including those of Affiliates) incurred in connection
with the preparation, execution and performance of this Agreement and the

Agreements, including all fees and expenses of its agents, representatives,
financial advisors, legal counsel and accountants.

(c) _Succession_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the
benefit of the Parties named herein and their respective successors and
permitted assigns. Neither Party may assign this Agreement or any of its
rights or Obligations hereunder (except by operation of Law) without the prior
written consent of the other Party (which consent may not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned); _provided_ , _however_ , that without the
prior approval of the Seller, the Buyer and its permitted successors and
assigns may (i) transfer any or all of its rights or interests under
this Agreement to a

 



36  wholly owned direct or indirect Subsidiary of the Buyer for so long as such
Person remains a wholly owned Subsidiary of the Buyer, including designating
one or more such Persons to be the assignee of some or any portion of the
Assigned Equity Interest; (ii) assign any or all of its rights or interests
under this Agreement to another Person in connection with any sale or transfer
of all or substantially all of its assets; (iii) make a collateral assignment
of its rights hereunder in connection with a bona fide financing transaction;
or (iv) transfer any or all of its rights or interests under this Agreement
pursuant to any foreclosure or settlement of any such collateral assignment;
_provided, further_ , that no transfer or assignment under any of the
foregoing clauses (i) through (iv) shall result in the release of the Buyer
from any of its obligations under this Agreement, and the Buyer shall remain
a primary obligor (as opposed to a surety) thereof.

(d) _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in multiple identical
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original but all of which
together shall constitute one and the same instrument.

(e) _Incorporation of Exhibits and Schedules_. The Exhibits and Schedules to
this Agreement are incorporated herein by reference and made a part hereof. If
there is any conflict or other inconsistency between this Agreement and the

Any Party may send any notice, request, demand, claim or other communication
hereunder to the intended recipient at the addresses set forth above using
any other means (including personal delivery, expedited courier, messenger
service, facsimile, ordinary mail or electronic mail), but no such notice,
request, demand, claim or other communication shall be deemed to have been
duly given unless and until it actually is received by the intended recipient.
Any Party may change the address to which notices, requests, demands, claims
and other communications hereunder are to be delivered by giving the other
Party notice in the manner herein set forth.

(h) _Governing Law; Venue_. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED
IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF TEXAS WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO
ANY CHOICE OR CONFLICT OF LAWS PROVISION OR RULE (WHETHER OF THE STATE OF
TEXAS OR ANY OTHER JURISDICTION) THAT WOULD CAUSE THE APPLICATION OF THE LAWS
OF ANY JURISDICTION OTHER THAN THE STATE OF TEXAS. EACH PARTY HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY CONSENTS TO SUBMIT TO THE JURISDICTION OF THE
COMPETENT COURTS OF THE STATE OF TEXAS AND OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, IN
EACH CASE LOCATED IN HOUSTON, TEXAS (THE "COURTS") FOR ANY LITIGATION ARISING
OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY
(AND AGREES NOT TO COMMENCE ANY LITIGATION RELATING THERETO EXCEPT IN THE
COURTS), WAIVES ANY OBJECTION TO THE LAYING OF VENUE OF ANY SUCH LITIGATION
IN THE COURTS AND AGREES NOT TO PLEAD OR CLAIM IN ANY COURT THAT SUCH
LITIGATION BROUGHT THEREIN HAS BEEN BROUGHT IN AN INCONVENIENT FORUM.

(i) _Amendments and Waivers_. No amendment of any provision of this Agreement
shall be valid unless the same shall be in writing and signed by both of the
Parties. No waiver by any Party of any default, misrepresentation or breach
of warranty or covenant hereunder, whether intentional or not, shall be deemed
to extend to any prior or subsequent default, misrepresentation, or breach of
warranty or covenant hereunder or affect in any way any rights arising by
virtue of any prior or subsequent such occurrence.

 



38 (j) _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid
or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect the
validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions hereof or the
validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in any other
situation or in any other jurisdiction.

(k) _Construction_. The Parties have participated jointly in the negotiation
and drafting of this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or question of
intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if
drafted jointly by the Parties and no presumption or burden of proof shall
arise favoring or disfavoring any Party by virtue of the authorship of any of
the provisions of this Agreement. Any reference to any federal, state, local,
or foreign statute or Law shall be deemed also to refer to all rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder, unless the context requires otherwise.
The word "including" shall mean including without limitation, unless the
context otherwise requires. All personal pronouns used in this Agreement,
whether used in the masculine, feminine or neuter gender, shall include all
other genders; the singular shall include the plural, and vice versa. All
references herein to Exhibits, Schedules, Articles, Sections or subdivisions
thereof shall refer to the corresponding Exhibits, Schedules, Article, Section
or subdivision thereof of this Agreement unless specific reference is made to
such exhibits, articles, sections or subdivisions of another document or
instrument. The terms "herein," "hereby," "hereunder,"
"hereof," "hereinafter," and other equivalent words refer to this Agreement
in its entirety and not solely to the particular portion of the Agreement in
which such word is used. The words "shall" and "will" are
used interchangeably throughout this Agreement and shall accordingly be given
the same meaning, regardless of which word is used. The word "or" will have
the inclusive meaning represented by the phrase "and/or" unless the
context requires otherwise. Any reference to a "business day" shall mean any
day other than a Saturday or Sunday or any other day on which commercial banks
are authorized or required by Law to be closed in Houston, Texas. Except to
the extent expressly provided to the contrary, references to a Party include
its successors and permitted assigns. Except as otherwise expressly provided
herein, all terms of an accounting or financial nature shall be construed in
accordance with GAAP, as in effect from time to time.

(l) _Entire Agreement_. THIS AGREEMENT (INCLUDING THE DOCUMENTS REFERRED TO
HEREIN) CONSTITUTES THE ENTIRE AGREEMENT AMONG THE PARTIES AND SUPERSEDES ANY
PRIOR UNDERSTANDINGS, AGREEMENTS, OR REPRESENTATIONS BY OR AMONG THE PARTIES
(OTHER THAN THOSE CONTAINED IN THE CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENTS), WRITTEN OR
ORAL, TO THE EXTENT IT HAS RELATED IN ANY WAY TO THE SUBJECT MATTER HEREOF.
FOR THE AVOIDANCE OF DOUBT, THIS AGREEMENT SUPERSEDES THE LETTER OF INTENT
DATED AS OF AUGUST 12, 2011 BETWEEN THE PARTIES, WHICH SHALL HAVE NO FURTHER
FORCE OR EFFECT. UPON CLOSING, THE BUYER SHALL BE RELEASED FROM ALL OF ITS
OBLIGATIONS UNDER EACH CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT.

(m) _Disclosure Schedules_. The Schedules to this Agreement have been
arranged in sections corresponding to the numbered Sections contained in this
Agreement. Any disclosure of an item in any Schedule shall be deemed to have
been disclosed in any other Schedules to which such disclosure is
clearly relevant from the text of such disclosure. The listing (or inclusion
of a copy) of a document or other item in the Schedules shall be adequate to
disclose an exception to a representation or warranty made herein if the
nature and relevance of such exception is reasonably apparent from the
listing (or inclusion of a copy) of such document.

 



39 (n) _No Recourse Against Non-Parties_. All claims or causes of action that may
be based upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement, or the negotiation,
execution or performance of this Agreement, may be made only against the
entities that are expressly identified as Parties hereto. No Person who is not
a named party to this Agreement, including, without limitation, any director,
officer, employee, member, partner, stockholder, Affiliate, agent, attorney or
representative of any named party to this Agreement (" _Non-Party Affiliates_
"), shall have any liability (whether in contract or in tort, in law or in
equity, or based upon any theory that seeks to impose liability of an entity
party against its owners or affiliates) for any Obligations or liabilities
arising under, in connection with or related to this Agreement or for any
claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of this Agreement or its
negotiation or execution; and each Party hereto waives and releases all such
liabilities, claims and Obligations against any such Non-Party Affiliates.
Non-Party Affiliates are expressly intended as third-party beneficiaries of
this provision of this Agreement.
