By virtue of the First Merger and without any action on the part of any holder
of the capital stock of SRA or Merger Sub Inc.:

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

each share of SRA Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the First
Merger Effective Time (other than any such shares to be cancelled in
accordance with Section 3.6(d)) shall be automatically converted into at the
First Merger Effective Time: 

| 
---|--- 

(i)

|

the right to receive an aggregate number of duly authorized, validly issued,
fully paid and non-assessable shares of Computer Sciences GS Common Stock
equal to (A) the Stock Consideration, divided by (B) the aggregate number of
shares of SRA Common Stock issued and outstanding on a fully diluted basis as
of immediately prior to the First Merger Effective Time, minus the number of
Dissenting Shares, multiplied by (C) the applicable Share Exchange Multiple
for the SRA Stockholder holding such share of SRA Common Stock (the "Per Share
Stock Consideration"); and 

| 
---|--- 

(ii)

|

the right to receive a cash payment (without interest) equal to (A) the Cash
Consideration, divided by (B) the aggregate number of shares of SRA Common
Stock issued and outstanding on a fully diluted basis as of immediately prior
to the First Merger Effective Time, minus the number of Dissenting Shares,
multiplied by (C) the applicable Cash Payment Multiple for the SRA Stockholder
holding such share of SRA Common Stock (the "Per Share Cash Consideration"); 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

SRA Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
canceled and cease to exist, and each certificate previously evidencing any
such shares of SRA Common Stock (a 

"SRA Certificate") shall thereafter cease to have any rights with respect

|

each share of Merger Sub Inc. Common Stock that is issued and outstanding
immediately prior to and at the First Merger Effective Time shall
automatically be converted into one share of First Merger Surviving
Corporation common stock; 

| 
---|--- 

(d)

|

all shares of SRA Common Stock held in SRA's treasury or owned by any CSC

shall be cancelled and cease to exist, and no Per Share Merger Consideration
shall be delivered in exchange therefor; and 

| 
---|--- 

(e)

|

SRA shall use reasonable best efforts to procure, prior to the Closing Date, a
policy of insurance (the "Tax Policy") providing for at least $74,800,000 of
coverage (subject to any applicable retention) for taxes, interest, penalties
and defense costs (the "Coverage Amount") attributable to the approximately
$130.3 million worthless stock loss claimed by SRA under Section 165(g)(3) of
the Code with respect to shares of ERA Systems Corporation (the "Worthless
Stock Loss Issue"). If SRA has not procured the Tax Policy prior to the
Closing Date with Acceptable Terms, then notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, the Merger Consideration payable
hereunder to each holder of equity interests in SRA (including as provided in
Section 3.7, unless otherwise determined by SRA in its sole discretion) shall
be reduced by an amount equal to such holder's pro rata share (based on
ownership of equity interests in SRA) of the Coverage Amount, and a portion of
the Cash Consideration equal to the Coverage Amount shall be placed into an
escrow account (the "Escrow Account"). The Escrow Account shall be
administered by an escrow agent selected by Computer Sciences GS and
reasonably acceptable to SRA, pursuant to such escrow agent's standard form of
escrow agreement, with such modifications as may be reasonably agreed upon by
each of Computer Sciences GS and SRA, and which shall provide for release of
the escrowed property from the Escrow Account only upon joint written
instructions of Providence and Computer Sciences GS or a final, non-appealable
court order. If a portion of the Cash Consideration equal to the Coverage
Amount is placed in the Escrow Account as contemplated by the foregoing
sentence, Computer Sciences GS and SRA shall negotiate in good faith the terms
of an indemnification agreement, which shall have substantially the following
terms: 

 

 
--- 
| 

Cap

|

The amount in the Escrow Account 

Final Release from Escrow

|

Upon the earlier of the final resolution with the IRS or the Department of
Justice, as applicable, of the Worthless Stock Loss Issue and the expiration
of applicable statute of limitations (taking into account valid extensions and
waivers). 

Defense

|

Worthless Stock Loss Issue defended by a SRA stockholder representative using
counsel/advisers of its choice. The SRA stockholder representative shall have
the right to settle the Worthless Stock Loss Issue so long as such settlement
does not: (i) require SRA or its Subsidiaries or Affiliates to pay taxes,
interest, penalties and defense costs in excess of the amount available in the
Escrow Account at the time of such settlement; or (ii) require SRA or its
Subsidiaries or Affiliates to make and admission of wrongdoing or to agree to
any injunctive, non-monetary or other relief that will have an ongoing adverse
effect on SRA or its Subsidiaries or Affiliates. 

Defense Costs

|

Incentive Plan that is unvested and outstanding immediately prior to the First
Merger Effective Time shall be cancelled, and payment shall be made in respect
thereof in an amount equal to the Per Share Merger Consideration to which such
SRA Performance-Based Option would be entitled if such SRA 

Performance-Based Option were a SRA Vested Time-Based Option and were
cancelled and converted as provided in Section 3.7(c), except that the
applicable Share Exchange Multiple shall be as set forth on Schedule 2. Such
payment shall be deposited (without reduction for withholding Taxes) into the
Management Equity Escrow Account. In no event shall any SRA Performance-Based
Option remain outstanding at the First Merger Effective Time or be assumed by
Computer Sciences GS, Merger Sub Inc. or Merger Sub LLC or rolled over into
any CSC Plan, and in no event will the individuals who held the SRA
Performance-Based Options be deemed to have become vested in any portion of

Time-Based Options less the related exercise price and withholding Taxes, and
the holder thereof shall be entitled, for each such share, to receive the Per
Share Merger Consideration in the First Merger as provided in Section 3.6. In
no event shall any SRA Vested Time-Based Option remain outstanding at the
First Merger Effective Time or be assumed by Computer Sciences GS, Merger Sub
Inc. or Merger Sub LLC or rolled over into any CSC Plan.

(d)

|

SRA Unvested Time-Based Options 

At the First Merger Effective Time, each outstanding unvested time-based
option to purchase SRA Common Stock (each, a "SRA Unvested Time-Based Option")
issued under a SRA Incentive Plan shall be converted into an option ("Rollover
Options") to acquire the number of shares of Computer Sciences GS Common Stock
equal to the product (rounded down to the nearest whole number) of (a) the
number of shares of SRA Common Stock subject to such SRA Unvested Time-Based
Option immediately prior to the First Merger Effective Time, multiplied by (b)
the Award Conversion Ratio, at an exercise price per share (rounded up to the
nearest whole cent) equal to the quotient of (i) the exercise price per share
of such SRA Unvested Time-Based Option immediately prior to the First Merger
Effective Time, divided by (ii) the Award Conversion Ratio; provided that the
exercise price and the number of shares of Computer Sciences GS Common Stock
purchasable or with respect to which the amount payable is measured pursuant
to the Rollover Options shall be determined in a manner intended to be
consistent to the extent reasonably practicable with the requirements of
Section 409A of the Code. Except as specifically provided above, following the
First Merger Effective Time, each Rollover Option shall be subject to the same
vesting terms and conditions as applied thereto immediately prior to the First
Merger Effective Time (except that the occurrence of a "change of control"
event will be determined in respect of Computer Sciences GS) and shall be
otherwise governed by the same terms and conditions as are generally
applicable under the comparable CSC Plan immediately prior to the First Merger
Effective Time. Prior to the date on which the Rollover Options become vested,
Computer Sciences GS shall file an effective registration statement on 

Form S-8 in respect of the Computer Sciences GS Common Stock subject to such
Rollover Options and shall maintain the effectiveness thereof during the
period that the Rollover Options are outstanding.

Management Equity Escrow Account of the full amount of such payment.

| 
---|---

and held by a SRA Stockholder who is entitled to demand and has properly
demanded appraisal for such shares of SRA Common Stock in accordance with, and
who complies in all respects with, Section 262 of the DGCL (such Shares, the
"Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into the right to receive the Per
Share Merger Consideration, and shall instead represent the right to receive
payment of the fair value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with and to
the extent provided by Section 262 of the DGCL. If any such SRA Stockholder
fails to perfect or otherwise waives, withdraws or loses his right to
appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL or other applicable Law, then the

severance pay upon any termination of employment after the date of this
Agreement; (ii) accelerate the time of payment or vesting or result in any
payment or funding (through a grantor trust or otherwise) of compensation or

7.11

|

Employee Benefits 

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

As soon as practicable following the date hereof, the SRA Board of Directors
(or, if appropriate, any committee administering the SRA Plans) shall adopt
such resolutions or take such other actions as may be required to effect the
conversion of SRA Performance-Based Options, SRA Restricted Stock, SRA Vested
Time-Based Options and SRA Unvested Time-Based Options on the terms set forth
in Section 3.7. 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

Computer Sciences GS will cause any employee benefit plans of Computer
Sciences GS and its Subsidiaries in which an individual who is a current
employee of SRA or one of its Subsidiaries 

(including any current employee who is not actively at work on account of
illness, disability or leave of absence but who has a right to return to
employment) on the Closing Date (the "Affected Employees") is entitled to
participate after the Closing Date to take into account for purposes of
eligibility, vesting and, under any plan providing severance benefits or paid
time off, level of benefits, service by such employees credited by SRA and its
Subsidiaries prior to the First Merger Effective Time as if such service were
with CSC or its Subsidiaries (except to the extent it would result in a
duplication of benefits).

| 
---|--- 

(c)

|

CSC and SRA intend that, over the twelve-month period following the First
Merger Effective Time, the compensation and generally applicable employee
benefits of the Affected Employees shall be substantially the same in the
aggregate (or shall have substantially the same value to the Affected
Employees in the aggregate) as the compensation and generally applicable
employee benefits of similarly situated current employees of the Computer
Sciences GS Business (in each case other than those employees whose terms of
employment are subject to a collective bargaining agreement). 

| 
---|--- 

(d)

|

With respect to any employee benefit plans maintained by Computer Sciences GS
and its Subsidiaries for the benefit of the Affected Employees following the
Closing Date ("New Plans"), Computer Sciences GS will take reasonable steps to
cause the Second Merger Surviving LLC and its Subsidiaries to: (i) cause there
to be waived any eligibility requirements or pre-existing condition
limitations or waiting period requirements to the same extent waived under
comparable CSC Plans prior to the time coverage under the New Plans commences;
and (ii) give effect, in determining any deductible, co-insurance and maximum
out-of-pocket limitations, amounts paid by such employees during the year in
which coverage under the New Plans commences under comparable SRA Plans. 

| 
---|--- 

(e)

|

Prior to the Closing Date, SRA shall submit to the SRA Stockholders a vote on
the right of any "disqualified individual" (as defined in Section 280G(c) of
the Code) to receive any and all payments (or other benefits) contingent on
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (within
the meaning of Section 280G(b)(2)(A)(i) of the Code) to the extent necessary
so that no payment received by such "disqualified individual" would be a
"parachute payment" under Section 280G(b) of the Code (determined without
regard to Section 280G(b)(4) of the Code), in a manner that satisfies the
stockholder approval requirements under Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and
regulations promulgated thereunder. Prior to the Closing Date, SRA shall have
delivered to CSC and Computer Sciences GS evidence reasonably satisfactory to
CSC and Computer Sciences GS that SRA Stockholder approval was solicited in
conformance with Section 280G and the regulations promulgated thereunder. Such
vote shall establish the "disqualified individual's" right to the payment or
other compensation. In addition, before the vote is submitted to the SRA
Stockholders, SRA shall provide adequate disclosure to the SRA Stockholders of
all material facts concerning all payments that, but for such vote, could be
deemed "parachute payments" to a "disqualified individual" under Section 280G
of the Code in a manner that satisfies Section 280G(b)(5)(B)(ii) of the Code
and regulations promulgated thereunder. CSC/Computer Sciences GS and its legal
counsel shall be provided with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment
on all documents to be delivered to the SRA Stockholders in connection with
such vote.

---|--- 

(f)

|

Nothing contained in this Section 7.11, whether express or implied: (i) shall
be construed to establish, amend or modify any benefit plan, program,
agreement or arrangement; (ii) is intended to confer upon any Person
(including any current or former employee, director or consultant of Computer
Sciences GS or any of its Subsidiaries) any rights as a third-party
beneficiary of this Agreement; or (iii) shall create a right to continued
employment as a result hereof.

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

the occurrence, or nonoccurrence, of any event the occurrence or nonoccurrence
of which could reasonably be expected to cause any representation or warranty

(a)

|

The Parties acknowledge that in connection with the Transactions, the Parties
have disclosed and will continue to disclose to each other Information,
including Confidential Information. 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

The Parties shall hold, and shall cause each of their respective Affiliates
that receive Confidential Information or are controlled by the applicable
Party to hold, and each of the foregoing shall cause their respective
Representatives to hold, in strict confidence, and not to disclose to any
other Person (including without limitation by issuing a press release or
otherwise making any public statement), use, for any purpose other than as
expressly permitted pursuant to this Agreement, the Distribution Agreement or
the other Transaction Agreements, without the prior written consent of the
other Party, any and all Confidential Information concerning the other Party
or such Party\'s Subsidiaries; provided that the Parties may disclose, or may
permit disclosure of, Confidential Information: (i) to their respective
Representatives who have a need to know such information for auditing and
other non-commercial purposes and are informed of their obligation to hold
such information confidential to the same extent as is applicable to the
Parties and in respect of whose failure to comply with such obligations, the
applicable Party will be responsible; (ii) if the Parties or any of their
respective Affiliates that receive Confidential Information or are controlled
by the applicable Party are requested or required to disclose any such
Confidential Information by oral questions, interrogatories, requests for
information or other 

documents in legal proceedings, subpoena, civil investigative demand or any
other similar process, or by other requirements of Law or stock exchange rule;
(iii) as required in connection with any legal or other proceeding by one
Party against any other Party; or (iv) as necessary in order to permit a Party

further agrees to take all commercially reasonable efforts (and to cause each
of its Affiliates that receive Confidential Information or are controlled by
the applicable Party to take all commercially reasonable efforts) to safeguard
such Confidential Information and to protect it against disclosure, misuse,
espionage, loss and theft. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that
any demand or request for disclosure of Confidential Information is made
pursuant to clause (ii) above, each Party, as applicable, shall provide the
other with prompt written notice of any such request or requirement so that
the other Party has an opportunity to seek a protective order or other
appropriate remedy, which such Parties will cooperate in obtaining. In the
event that such appropriate protective order or other remedy is not obtained,
the Party whose Confidential Information is required to be disclosed shall or
shall cause the other applicable Party or Parties to furnish, or cause to be
furnished, only that portion of the Confidential Information that is in the
opinion of outside counsel necessary to be disclosed and shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to ensure confidential treatment is accorded
to such disclosed information.

| 
---|--- 

(c)

|

Each Party acknowledges that it and its Affiliates may have in their
possession confidential or proprietary information of third parties that was
received under confidentiality or non-disclosure agreements or agreements
containing confidentiality or non-disclosure provisions that the other Party
or its Affiliates entered into with a third party prior to the Second Merger
Effective Time. Such Party will hold, and will cause its Affiliates and their
respective Representatives to hold, in strict confidence the confidential and
proprietary information of third parties to which they or any of its
respective Affiliates has had access, in accordance with the terms of such
agreements entered into prior to the Second Merger Effective Time or, if more
restrictive, the terms set forth herein. 

|

(d)

|

If the Mergers are not consummated, the other Party shall promptly: (i)
deliver or cause to be delivered to such requesting Party (and if in
electronic format, delete or destroy or cause to be deleted or destroyed) all
Confidential Information furnished to it or to any of its Affiliates; and (ii)
if specifically requested by such requesting Party, destroy any copies of such
Confidential Information (including any extracts therefrom), unless such
delivery or destruction would violate any Law. Upon the written request of
such requesting Party, the other Party shall cause one of its duly authorized
officers to certify promptly in writing to such requesting Party that all
Confidential Information has been returned, destroyed or deleted as required
by the preceding sentence. 

| 
---|--- 

(e)

|

CSC and SRA acknowledge that they have previously executed the Confidentiality
Agreement, which shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with
its terms and that the provisions of this Section 7.13 are in furtherance of,
and do not limit the obligations of, CSC and SRA under the Confidentiality
Agreement. If the Closing occurs, this Section 7.13 shall terminate on the

|

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Computer Sciences GS
shall not permit any amendment or modification to be made to, or any waiver of
any provision or remedy under, the Commitment Letter, if such amendment,
modification or waiver would, or would reasonably be expected to, (i) reduce
the aggregate amount of the Financing or (ii) impose new or additional
conditions or otherwise expand, amend or modify any of the conditions to the
receipt of the Financing or other terms in a manner that would reasonably be
expected to (x) materially delay or prevent the Closing or (y) make the timely
funding of the Financing or satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the
Financing materially less likely to occur. Any reference in this Agreement to
(i) "Financing" shall include the financing contemplated by the Commitment
Letter, as amended or modified in compliance with this Section 7.15(a), and

and in an amount at least equal to the Financing or such unavailable portion
thereof, as the case may be (the "Alternate Financing"), and to obtain a new
financing commitment letter with respect to such Alternate Financing (the "New
Commitment Letters"), which shall replace the existing Commitment Letter in
whole or in part, a copy of which shall be promptly provided to SRA. In the
event any New Commitment Letters are obtained, (i) any reference in this
Agreement to the "Financing" shall mean the debt financing contemplated by the
Commitment Letter as modified pursuant to clause (ii) below and (ii) any
reference in this Agreement to the "Commitment Letter" shall be deemed to
include the Commitment Letter to the extent not superseded by a New Commitment
Letter at the time in question and any New Commitment Letters to the extent

will update any such Required Information in order to ensure that such
Required Information does not contain any untrue statement of material fact or
omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements
contained therein not materially misleading. SRA hereby consents to the use of
its and its Subsidiaries' logos in connection with the Computer Sciences GS
Financing, provided that such logos are used solely in a manner that is not
intended to or reasonably likely to harm or disparage it or its reputation or
goodwill or any of its intellectual property rights.

7.18

|

Separation 

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, but
subject to Article 2 and Section 7.18(b), from and after November 27, 2015,
nothing in this Agreement shall prevent CSC or Computer Sciences GS from
proceeding with the Separation, Distribution, the Computer Sciences GS
Financing or the Special Dividend in accordance with the Separation Agreements
as well as either or them or their respective Subsidiaries taking any and all
steps necessary or advisable in furtherance of the foregoing including
effecting the Distribution and paying the Special Dividend regardless of
whether the conditions to this Agreement have been satisfied. 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

The Parties acknowledge that certain exhibits and schedules to the Separation
Agreements do not exist as of the date of this Agreement. CSC and Computer
Sciences GS shall use commercially reasonable efforts to complete such
exhibits and schedules as soon as reasonably practicable following the date
hereof. In preparing such exhibits and schedules to be attached the Separation
Agreements prior to the Distribution, CSC and Computer Sciences GS agree that
they shall not include any item, term or provision in any such exhibit or
schedule if the inclusion of such item, term or provision would result in (i)
the Existing Form 10 containing an untrue statement of a material fact or
omitting to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading, or (ii)
the assets, liabilities, financial condition or results of operation of the
Computer Sciences GS Business deviating in a material respect from the
financial presentation of the Computer Sciences GS Business set forth in the
Existing Form 10 (other than as and to the extent necessary to reflect the
normal quarterly financial reporting of the Computer Sciences GS Business on a
consistent basis with the financial presentation in the Existing Form 10 and
without any change in the principles of allocation of assets and liabilities
between CSC and Computer Sciences GS in connection with the Separation).
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, unless
this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 9.1, CSC and Computer
Sciences GS agree that (A) they shall not amend or modify, or agree to amend
or modify, any of the Separation Agreements to include any item, term or
provision that would result in such Separation Agreement not being
substantially in the form attached hereto as of the First Merger Effective
Time, (B) Computer Sciences GS shall not grant or agree to any consent,
agreement or waiver pursuant to the terms of such Separation Agreement that
would result in such Separation Agreement not being performed substantially on
the terms and conditions set forth in the form attached hereto as of the First
Merger Effective 

Time, and (C) CSC shall not waive any condition to the Separation set forth in
the Distribution Agreement, in each case, without the prior written consent of
SRA (not to be unreasonably withheld).

7.19

|

Stockholder Written Consents 

Promptly following the execution and delivery of this Agreement, SRA shall
take use reasonable best efforts to cause each SRA Stockholder (other than the
Enumerated SRA Stockholders) to execute and deliver to SRA: (a) a written
consent adopting this Agreement in accordance with applicable Law; and (b) a
stockholder support agreement in connection with this Agreement and the
Transactions, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to SRA and CSC,
pursuant to which such holder of SRA Common Stock will make representations
and warranties substantially similar to those set forth in Article 6 and waive
any appraisal or similar rights in connection with the Mergers. Upon execution
and delivery of each such written consent and stockholder support agreement by
any SRA Stockholder, SRA shall promptly deliver such written consent and
stockholder support agreement to CSC and Computer Sciences GS. Providence
shall, if necessary, exercise the drag-along rights that Providence has under
the Stockholders Agreements, as applicable, to cause each SRA Stockholder
party thereto to execute and deliver the written consents and stockholder
support agreements described in the foregoing sentence.

Tax Matters 

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

If there is a determination within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code
that the First Merger, taken together with the Second Merger, does not qualify
as a reorganization described in Section 368(a) of the Code, Computer Sciences
GS shall take the position for federal income tax purposes that the First
Merger was a qualified stock purchase within the meaning of Section 338 of the
Code and the Second Merger qualified as a liquidation described in Section 332
of the Code. 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

Computer Sciences GS shall ensure that the continuity of business enterprise
requirement of Treasury Regulations Section 1.368-1(d) is satisfied in
connection with the transactions provided for herein. 

| 
---|--- 

(c)

|

Computer Sciences GS covenants that neither Computer Sciences GS, nor a
"related person" (as defined for purposes of Treasury Regulations Section
1.368-1(e)(4)) with respect to Computer Sciences GS (a "Related Person"), nor
any entity or arrangement that is treated as a partnership for federal income
tax purposes and in which Computer Sciences GS or a Related Person is treated
for federal income tax purposes as owning a direct or indirect interest, will,
in connection with the Mergers (as determined for purposes of Treasury
Regulations Section 1.368-1(e)), redeem or otherwise acquire any of the shares
of Computer Sciences GS Common Stock transferred in connection with the
Mergers. 

| 
---|--- 

(d)

|

Computer Sciences GS covenants that neither Computer Sciences GS, nor any of
its Affiliates, nor a Related Person, nor any entity or arrangement that is
treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes and in which Computer
Sciences GS or a Related Person is treated for federal income tax purposes as
owning a direct or indirect interest, will take any action that would cause
the First Merger, taken together with the Second Merger, to fail to qualify as
a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. 
| 
---|--- 

(e)

|

CSC and Computer Sciences GS shall use their commercially reasonable efforts
to seek, as promptly as practicable, an opinion from Allen and Overy LLP to the
effect that the Separation should qualify as a tax-free spin-off resulting in
non-recognition under Sections 355, 361 and 368(a) of the Code (the "Spin-off
Tax Opinion"). 

| 
---|--- 

(f)

|

SRA shall, prior to the Closing, furnish to Computer Sciences GS a certificate
meeting the requirements of Treasury Regulations Section 1.1445-2(c)(3) to the
effect that shares of SRA Common Stock are not a "U.S. real property interest"
within the meaning of Section 897 of the Code. 

| 
---|--- 

(g)

|

Computer Sciences GS shall not undertake any transaction in connection with or
otherwise as part of a plan including the Mergers, after the Second Merger
Effective Time, that would cause it directly to own less than 100% of the
interests in Merger Sub LLC. 

| 
---|---

---|--- 

(a)

|

by the mutual written consent of CSC and SRA;

by either SRA or CSC or, after the Distribution, Computer Sciences GS, if the
First Merger Effective Time shall not have occurred on or before April 1, 2016
(the "Termination Date"), unless the failure of the First Merger Effective
Time to have occurred by the Termination Date shall be due to the failure of
the Party seeking to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 9.1(b)
to perform or otherwise comply with in all material respects the covenants and
agreements of such party set forth herein; 
| 
---|--- 

(c)

|

by SRA (so long as SRA is not then in material breach of any covenant,
representation or warranty or other agreement contained herein which breach
would cause the Closing conditions of CSC or Computer Sciences GS not to be
satisfied if the Closing were to occur at the time of termination), if (i)
there has been a material breach by CSC or Computer Sciences GS of any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement, or any such representation and warranty shall have become untrue in
any material respect, in either case such that Section 8.3(a) would be
incapable of being satisfied, or (ii) there has been a material breach by CSC
or Computer Sciences GS of their obligations under Article 2 or Section

Stockholders not to be satisfied if the Closing were to occur at the time of
termination), if there has been a material breach by SRA of any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement, or any such representation and warranty shall have become untrue in
any material respect, in either case such that Section 8.2(a) would be
incapable of being satisfied, and such breach or condition has not been cured
within 30 Business Days following receipt by SRA of notice of such breach;

will give written notice of such termination to the other Party, specifying
the provision pursuant to which such termination is effected.

In the event this Agreement is terminated (i) by SRA pursuant to Section
9.1(c)(ii) or (ii) by CSC pursuant to Section 9.1(b) or Section 9.1(f), in

survive the Second Merger Effective Time.

Specific Performance 

In the event of any actual or threatened default in, or breach of, any of the
terms, conditions and provisions of this Agreement or any Transaction
Agreement, the Party who is, or is to be, thereby aggrieved will have the
right to seek specific performance and injunctive or other equitable relief in
respect of its rights under this Agreement or such Transaction Agreement, in
addition to any and all other rights and remedies at law or in equity. The
Parties agree that the remedies at law for any breach or threatened breach,
including monetary damages, may be inadequate compensation for any loss and
that any defense in any action for specific performance that a remedy at law
would be adequate is waived. Any requirements for the securing or posting of
any bond with such remedy are waived by each of the Parties.

No Third-Party Beneficiaries 

Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer
upon any Person (other than CSC, Computer Sciences GS, Merger Sub LLC, Merger
Sub Inc., SRA, SRA Operating Sub, the SRA Stockholders and their respective
successors and permitted assigns) any legal or equitable right, benefit or
remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement and no
Person (other than those listed in the preceding parenthetical) shall be
deemed a third-party beneficiary under or by reason of this Agreement, except
that the Financing Sources shall be express third party beneficiaries of
Sections 11.6, 11.7, 11.10 and 11.14 hereof, each of such Sections shall
expressly inure to the benefit of the Financing Sources and the Financing
Sources shall be entitled to rely on and enforce the provisions of such
Sections. In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
nothing contained in any provision of this Agreement: (a) shall be construed
to establish, amend or modify any benefit or compensation plan, program,
agreement or arrangement; or (b) create any third-party beneficiary rights or
obligations in any Computer Sciences GS Group Employee, SRA Employee or former
employee of the Computer Sciences GS Group or SRA, including with respect to:
(i) any right to employment or continued employment or to a particular term or
condition of employment; or (ii) the ability of CSC, Computer Sciences GS, SRA
or any of their respective Affiliates to amend, modify or terminate any
benefit or compensation plan, program, agreement or arrangement at any time

11.4

|

Entire Agreement 

This Agreement, the Exhibits, the CSC/Computer Sciences GS Disclosure Schedule
and the SRA Disclosure Schedule hereto, the Confidentiality Agreement, the
other Transaction Agreements and other documents referred to herein and
therein shall constitute the entire agreement between the Parties with respect
to the subject matter hereof and shall supersede all previous negotiations,
commitments and writings with respect to such subject matter.

| 
---|--- 

11.5

|

Assignment 

Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, benefits or obligations
hereunder may be assigned by any of the Parties (whether by operation of law
or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other Parties, and any
purported assignment without such consent shall be null and void, except that
CSC and Computer Sciences GS may assign any or all of its rights, interests
under this Agreement without the consent of the other Parties hereto: (a) to
any Person providing the Computer Sciences GS Financing pursuant to the terms
thereof for purposes of creating a security interest herein or otherwise
assign as collateral in respect of such Computer Sciences GS Financing; or (b)
to any other wholly owned Subsidiary of CSC; provided, however, that, in each
case, no such assignment shall release such Party from any liability or
obligation under this Agreement and no such assignment shall be undertaken if
such assignment would reasonably be expected to cause the First Merger, taken
together with the Second Merger, to fail to qualify as a "reorganization"
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. Subject to the preceding
sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be
enforceable by the Parties and their respective successors and permitted
assigns.

11.6

|

Governing Law; Waiver of Jury Trial 
| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

(i) This Agreement and any claims or disputes arising out of or related hereto
or the transactions contemplated hereby or to the inducement of any Party to
enter herein or therein, whether for breach of contract, tortious conduct, or
otherwise and whether predicated on common law, statute or otherwise, shall be
governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of
Delaware, including all matters of construction, validity and performance, in
each case without reference to any conflict of law rules that might lead to
the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction. 

| 
---|--- 

(ii)

|

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the parties hereto and the
SRA Related Parties agree that any claim, controversy or dispute any kind or
nature (whether based upon contract, tort or otherwise) involving a Financing
Source that is in any way related to this Agreement, the Mergers or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including, but not limited to,
any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the Financing, shall be
governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New
York without regard to conflict of law principles (other than sections 5‑1401
and 5-1402 of the New York General Obligations Law). 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

As a specifically bargained inducement for each of the Parties to enter into
this Agreement (with each party having had opportunity to consult counsel),
each of the parties (including the SRA Related Parties) expressly and
irrevocably waives the right to a trial by jury in any action or proceeding
under this agreement or any action or proceeding arising out of the
transactions contemplated hereby or any other Transaction Agreement or the
Computer Sciences GS Financing or arising out of or relating to the Financing
or any of the transactions contemplated thereby, including in any action,
proceeding or counterclaim against any Financing Source, regardless of which
Party initiates such action or proceeding, and any action or proceeding under
this Agreement or any action or proceeding arising out of the transactions
contemplated hereby or any other Transaction Agreement or the Computer
Sciences GS Financing shall be tried in a court of competent jurisdiction by a
judge sitting without a jury. 

| 
---|--- 

11.7

|

Jurisdiction; Service of Process 

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

Any action with respect to this Agreement and the rights and obligations
arising hereunder, or for recognition and enforcement of any judgment in
respect of this Agreement and the rights and obligations arising hereunder
brought by the other Party or Parties or their successors or assigns, in each
case, shall be brought and determined exclusively in the Delaware Court of
Chancery and any state appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware
(or, if the Delaware Court of Chancery declines to accept jurisdiction over a
particular matter, any state or federal court within the State of Delaware).
Each of the Parties hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert, by
way of motion, as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any action with
respect to this agreement (a) any claim that is not personally subject to the
jurisdiction of the above named courts for any reason other than the failure
to serve in accordance with this Section 11.7, (b) any claim that it or its
property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any such court or from any
legal process commenced in such courts (whether through service of notice,
attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment,
execution of judgment or otherwise) and (c) to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law, any claim that (i) the action in such court is brought in an
inconvenient forum, (ii) the venue of such action is improper or (iii) this
agreement, or the subject matter hereof, may not be enforced in or by such
courts. Each of the Parties further 

agrees that no party to this agreement shall be required to obtain, furnish or
post any bond or similar instrument in connection with or as a condition to
obtaining any remedy referred to in this Section 11.7 and each Party waives
any objection to the imposition of such relief or any right it may have to
require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or similar
instrument. The Parties hereby agree that mailing of process or other papers
in connection with any such action or proceeding in the manner provided in
Section 11.1, or in such other manner as may be permitted by law, shall be
valid and sufficient service thereof and hereby waive any objections to
service accomplished in the manner herein provided.

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, each SRA Related Party and
each of the other parties hereto (i) agrees that it will not bring or support
any action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim of any
kind or description, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in
tort or otherwise, against the Financing Sources in any way relating to this
Agreement, the Mergers or any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including but not limited to any dispute arising out of or relating
in any way to the Financing or the performance thereof or the transactions
contemplated thereby, in any forum other than exclusively in the Supreme Court
of the State of New York, County of New York, or, if under applicable law
exclusive jurisdiction is vested in the federal courts, the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York (and appellate courts
thereof), (ii) submits for itself and its property with respect to any such
action to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts, (iii) agrees that service
of process, summons, notice or document by registered mail addressed to it at
its address provided in Section 11.1 hereof shall be effective service of
process against it for any such action brought in any such court, (iv) waives
and hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any
objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of, and
the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of, any such action in
any such court and (v) agrees that a final judgment in any such action shall
be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the
judgment or in any other manner provided by law. 

| 
---|--- 

11.8

|

Severability 

If any provision of this Agreement or the application of any such provision to
any Person or circumstance shall be declared judicially to be invalid,
unenforceable or void, such decision shall not have the effect of invalidating
or voiding the remainder of this Agreement, it being the intent and agreement
of the Parties that this Agreement shall be deemed amended by modifying such
provision to the extent necessary to render it valid, legal and enforceable to
the maximum extent permitted while preserving its intent or, if such
modification is not possible, by substituting therefor another provision that
is valid, legal and enforceable and that achieves the original intent of the
Parties.

| 
---|--- 

11.9

|

Headings 

The headings and captions of the Articles and Sections used in this Agreement
and the table of contents to this Agreement are for reference and convenience
purposes of the Parties only, and will be given no substantive or interpretive
effect whatsoever.

| 
---|--- 

11.10

|

Amendment 

This Agreement may be amended by the Parties at any time before or after
approval hereof by CSC, Computer Sciences GS, the Enumerated SRA Stockholders
and SRA; provided, however, that after such 

approvals there shall not be made any amendment that by Law requires further
approval by the CSC, Computer Sciences GS, the SRA Stockholders and SRA
without the further approval of such Parties. This Agreement may not be
amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the
Parties. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Sections
11.3, 11.6, 11.7 and 11.14 hereof (and any other provision of this Agreement
to the extent an amendment, supplement, waiver or other modification of such
provision would modify the substance of such Sections) and the definition of
"SRA Material Adverse Effect" may not be amended, supplemented, waived or
otherwise modified without the prior written consent of the Financing Sources.

| 
---|--- 

11.11

|

Extension; Waiver 

At any time prior to the Second Merger Effective Time, the Parties may, but
shall not be obligated to: (a) extend the time for the performance of any of
the obligations or other acts of the other Parties; (b) waive any inaccuracies
in the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement or in any
document delivered pursuant to this Agreement; or (c) waive compliance with
any of the agreements or conditions contained in this Agreement. Any agreement
on the part of a Party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if
set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such Party.

11.12

|

Interpretation 

When a reference is made in this Agreement to an Article, Section, Exhibit or
Schedule, such reference shall be to an Article, Section, Exhibit or Schedule
of this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents to this
Agreement, and the Article and Section headings contained in this Agreement,
are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or
"including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by
the words "without limitation." The words "hereof," "herein" and "hereunder"
and words of similar import when used in this Agreement shall refer to this
Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement.
The definitions contained in this Agreement are applicable to the singular as
well as the plural forms of such terms and to the masculine as well as to the
feminine and neuter genders of such terms and any reference to the masculine,
feminine or neuter gender shall be deemed to include any gender or all three
as appropriate. Unless otherwise specified, any agreement, instrument or
statute defined or referred to herein or in any agreement or instrument that
is referred to herein means such agreement, instrument or statute as from time
to time amended, modified or supplemented, including (in the case of
agreements or instruments) by waiver or consent (but only to the extent such
waiver or consent is not adverse to any member of the Computer Sciences GS
Entities) and (in the case of statutes) by succession of comparable successor
statutes, and including all attachments thereto and instruments incorporated
therein. References to a person are also to its permitted successors and
assigns. Unless expressly stated to the contrary in this Agreement or in any
other Transaction Agreement, all references to "the date hereof," "the date of
this Agreement," "hereby" and "hereupon" and words of similar import shall all
be references to August 31, 2015 (or the date of which the relevant
Transaction Agreement is first entered into, as the case may be) regardless of
any amendment or restatement hereof (or thereof). The use of the phrase
"ordinary course of business" or other derivations thereof shall mean
"ordinary course of business consistent with past practice." Unless the
context otherwise requires, "or," "neither," "nor," "any," "either," and "or"
shall not be exclusive. Wherever and whenever in this Agreement there is a
consent right of a Party or a reference to the "satisfaction" or "sole
discretion" of a Party, such Party shall be entitled to consider solely its
own interests (and not the interests of any other Person) or, at its sole
election, any such other interests and factors as such Party desires. The 

Parties have participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this
Agreement, and in the event an ambiguity or question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly
by the Parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or
disfavoring any Party by virtue of the authorship of any provisions of this
Agreement.

| 
---|--- 

11.13

|

Damages Waiver 

No Party shall be liable to another Party or any of its Affiliates (or any of
their respective present, former and future Representatives and each of their
respective heirs, executors, successors and assigns) for any exemplary damages
or punitive damages, or any other damages to the extent not reasonably
foreseeable, arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or any
Transaction Agreement (in each case, unless any such damages are payable to a
third party pursuant to a Third-Party Claim (as such term is defined in the
Distribution Agreement)).

| 
---|--- 

11.14

|

Exculpation of Financing Sources 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no SRA Related
Party (other than CSC and Computer Sciences GS) shall have any rights or
claims against any Financing Source in connection with this Agreement, the
Mergers, the Financing or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, and
no Financing Source shall have any rights or claims against any SRA Related
Party (other than CSC and Computer Sciences GS) in connection with this
Agreement, the Mergers, the Financing or the transactions contemplated hereby
or thereby, whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise;
provided that, following consummation of the Mergers, the foregoing will not
limit the rights of the parties to the Financing under any commitment letter
related thereto. In addition, in no event will any Financing Source be liable
for consequential, special, exemplary, punitive or indirect damages (including
any loss of profits, business or anticipated savings) or damages of a tortuous
nature.

| 
---|--- 

11.15

|

Reference to Time 

All references in this Agreement to times of the day shall be to New York City
time.

|

11.16

|

Non-Recourse; No Representations or Warranties 

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

This Agreement may only be enforced by or against, and any claims or causes of
action that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement, or
the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement may only be made
by or against the entities that are expressly identified as parties hereto and
no former, current or future equity holders, controlling persons, directors,
officers, employees, agents or Affiliates of any party hereto or any former,
current or future stockholder, controlling person, director, officer,
employee, general or limited partner, member, manager, agent or Affiliate of
any of the foregoing (each, a "Non-Recourse Party") shall have any liability
for any obligations or liabilities of the parties to this Agreement or for any
claim (whether in tort, contract or otherwise) based on, in respect of, or by
reason of, the transactions contemplated hereby or in respect of any
representations made or alleged to be made in connection herewith. Without
limiting the rights of any party against the other parties hereto, in no event
shall any party or any of its Affiliates seek to enforce this Agreement
against, make any claims for breach of this Agreement against, or seek to
recover monetary damages from, any Non-Recourse Party and in no event shall
any Non-Recourse Party seek to or be entitled to enforce this Agreement
against, make any claims 

for breach of this Agreement against, or seek to recover monetary damages
from, any entity that is identified as a party hereto.

Section 11.18 

 

This MASTER SEPARATION AND DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENT (this "Agreement") is dated
as of , 2015 by and between Computer Sciences Corporation, a Nevada
corporation ("CSC"), and Computer Sciences Government Services Inc., a Nevada
corporation ("Computer Sciences GS"). Each of CSC and Computer Sciences GS is
sometimes referred to herein as a "Party" and, collectively, as the "Parties".

WHEREAS:

| 
---|--- 

(A)

|

CSC, acting through its direct and indirect Subsidiaries, currently conducts
the CSC Business and the Computer Sciences GS Business; 

| 
---|--- 

(B)

|

the Board of Directors of CSC (the "Board") has determined that it is
appropriate, desirable and in the best interests of CSC and its stockholders
to separate CSC into two separate, publicly traded companies, one for each of
(i) the CSC Business, which shall be owned and conducted, directly or
indirectly, by CSC and (ii) the Computer Sciences GS Business, which shall be
owned and conducted, directly or indirectly, by Computer Sciences GS; 

| 
---|--- 

(C)

|

in order to effect such separation, the Board has determined that it is
appropriate, desirable and in the best interests of CSC and its stockholders
to undertake the Internal Reorganization and, following the completion of the
Internal Reorganization, for CSC to distribute pro rata to the Record Holders,
all of the issued and outstanding shares of Computer Sciences GS Common Stock
(the "Distribution"); 

| 
---|--- 

(D)

|

it is the intention of the Parties that the Distribution qualify as a tax-free
distribution (except to the extent of cash received in lieu of fractional
shares) under Section 355 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(the "Code"); 

| 
---|--- 

(E)

|

it is the intention of the Parties that the contributions of Computer Sciences
GS Assets to, and the assumptions of Computer Sciences GS Liabilities by,
Computer Sciences GS prior to the Distribution, together with the
Distribution, qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section
368(a)(1)(D) of the Code. 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of and subject to the premises and the mutual
agreements, terms and conditions herein contained, the benefits to be derived
therefrom and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and the

THE SEPARATION 

| 
---|--- 

2.1

|

General 

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Parties shall use,
and shall cause their respective Affiliates to use, their respective
commercially reasonable efforts to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby, including the Internal Reorganization.

| 
---|--- 

2.2

|

Restructuring; Transfer of Assets; Assumption of Liabilities 
| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

Internal Reorganization. Prior to the Effective Time, the Internal
Reorganization shall be completed. 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

Transfer of Assets and Assumption of Liabilities. Pursuant to the Transfer
Instruments (except as otherwise specifically set forth in any Ancillary
Agreement), CSC shall, or shall cause the applicable members of the CSC Group
to, Transfer to the applicable members of the Computer Sciences GS Group all
of their right, title and interest in and to the Computer Sciences GS Assets,
and Computer Sciences GS shall, or shall cause the applicable members of the
Computer Sciences GS Group to, assume all the Computer Sciences GS Liabilities
prior to the Effective Time. For the avoidance of doubt, Computer Sciences GS
and the Computer Sciences GS Group shall not assume, and following the
Effective Time CSC and the CSC Group shall be solely responsible for and shall
retain, any CSC Liabilities. 

| 
---|--- 

(c)

|

Transfers and Assumptions Occurring After the Effective Time. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, the Parties acknowledge that certain
Transfers of Assets or assumption of Liabilities (as may be provided herein or
under the Ancillary Agreements) shall occur after the Effective Time. 

| 
---|--- 

(d)

|

Consents. The Parties shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain from any Governmental Entity or other third party any Governmental
Approvals or Consents required to Transfer any of the Computer Sciences GS

| 
---|--- 

(e)

|

Costs and Expenses. Any costs and expenses incurred after the Effective Time
and on or prior to the first anniversary of the Distribution Date to effect
any Transfer of Assets or Assumption of Liabilities contemplated by this
Agreement (including any out-of-pocket costs and expenses to obtain any
required Consents) shall be borne by the Party on whose behalf the Transfer or
Assumption is made, with any such costs and expenses incurred following such
first anniversary to be the exclusive responsibility of the Party incurring
such costs. Other than costs and expenses incurred and reimbursed in
accordance with the foregoing, nothing in this Section 2.2 shall require any
member of either Group to incur any material obligation or grant any material
concession for the benefit of any member of the other Group in order to effect
any such Transfer contemplated by this Section 2.2. 

| 
---|--- 

(f)

|

No Transfers in Violation of Law or Breach of Contract. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, no Contract or other Asset shall be
transferred if it would violate applicable Law or, in the case of any
Contract, the rights of any third party to such Contract or the terms of such
Contract. 

| 
---|--- 

2.3

|

Treatment of Shared Contracts 

Without limiting the generality of the obligations set forth in Section 2.2:

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

Unless the Parties otherwise agree or the benefits of any Contract described
in this Section are expressly conveyed to the applicable Party pursuant to an
Ancillary Agreement, any Contract that is (1) a CSC Asset but inures in part
to the benefit or burden of any member of the Computer Sciences GS Group, or
(2) a Computer Sciences GS Asset but inures in part to the benefit or burden
of any member of the CSC Group (each, a "Shared Contract"), shall be assigned
in part to the applicable member(s) of the applicable Group, if so assignable,
or appropriately amended prior to, on or after the Effective Time, so that
each member of the Computer Sciences GS Group or the CSC Group, as the case
may be, shall be entitled to the rights and benefits, and shall assume the
related portion of any Liabilities, inuring to the Computer Sciences GS
Business or the CSC Business, respectively; provided, however, that (x) in no
event shall any member of any Group be required to assign (or amend) any
Shared Contract in its entirety or to assign a portion 

of any Shared Contract which is not assignable (or cannot be amended) by its
terms (including any terms imposing consents or conditions on an assignment
where such consents or conditions have not been obtained or fulfilled) and (y)
if any Shared Contract cannot be so partially assigned by its terms or
otherwise, cannot be amended or has not for any other reason been assigned or
amended, or if such assignment or amendment would impair the benefit the
parties thereto derive from such Shared Contract, (A) at the reasonable
request of the Party (or the member of such Party's Group) to which the
benefit of such Shared Contract inures in part, the Party for which such
Shared Contract is, as applicable, a CSC Asset or Computer Sciences GS Asset
shall, and shall cause each of its respective Subsidiaries to, for a period
ending on the earlier of twelve (12) months after the Distribution Date and
the end of the term of such Shared Contract (without any extensions or
renewals), take such other reasonable and permissible actions to cause such
member of the Computer Sciences GS Group or the CSC Group, as the case may be,
to receive the benefit of that portion of each Shared Contract that relates to
the Computer Sciences GS Business or the CSC Business, as the case may be (in
each case, to the extent so related) as if such Shared Contract had been
assigned to (or amended to allow) a member of the applicable Group pursuant to
this Section 2.3 and to bear the burden of the corresponding Liabilities
(including any Liabilities that may arise by reason of such arrangement) as if
such Liabilities had been assumed by a member of the applicable Group pursuant
to this Section 2.3 and (B) the Party to which the benefit of such Shared
Contract inures in part shall use commercially reasonable efforts to enter
into a separate contract pursuant to which it procures such rights and
obligations as are necessary such that it no longer needs to avail itself of
the arrangements provided pursuant to this Section 2.3(a); provided that,
other than in the event of willful breach or misconduct, knowing violation of
Law, fraud, willful misrepresentation, or gross negligence of the Party for
which such Shared Contract is, as applicable, a CSC Asset or Computer Sciences
GS Asset, such Party, and such Party's applicable Subsidiaries shall not be
liable for any actions or omissions taken in accordance with clause (y) of
this Section 2.3(a).

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

Each of CSC and Computer Sciences GS shall, and shall cause the members of its
Group to, (i) treat for all Income Tax purposes the portion of each Shared
Contract inuring to the CSC Business or Computer Sciences GS Business, as the
case may be, as Assets owned by, and/or Liabilities of, as applicable, such
Party as of the Effective Time and (ii) neither report nor take any Income Tax
position (on a Tax Return or otherwise) inconsistent with such treatment
(unless required by a change in applicable Tax Law or good faith resolution of
a Tax Contest relating to Income Taxes). 

| 
---|--- 

2.4

|

Intercompany Accounts; Cash Management 

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

Except as set forth in Section 7.1(b), all (i) intercompany receivables,
payables and loans (other than receivables, payables and loans otherwise
specifically provided for under this Agreement, under any Ancillary Agreement,
and other than payables created or required hereby or by any Ancillary
Agreement), if any, and (ii) intercompany balances, including in respect of
any cash balances, any cash balances representing deposited checks or drafts
or any cash held in any centralized cash management system between any member
of the CSC Group, on the one hand, and any member of the Computer Sciences GS
Group, on the other hand, which exist and are reflected in the accounting
records of the relevant Parties immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall
be settled prior to the Distribution, provided that any such intercompany
balances that represent ordinary course trade payables on arm's length terms
shall be converted into an ordinary trade payable (which shall survive the
Effective Time, notwithstanding 

anything herein (including Section 7.1) to the contrary) as of the Effective
Time. Each of the Parties shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries
to, take all actions and do all things reasonably necessary on its part, or
such Subsidiaries' part, under applicable Law or contractual obligations to
consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by such agreement
or agreements in respect of such settlements or capitalizations.

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

As between the Parties (and the members of their respective Group) all
payments and reimbursements received after the Effective Time by one Party (or
member of its Group) to the extent allocated to the other Party (or any member
of its Group) pursuant hereto, shall be held by such Party in trust for the
use and benefit of the Party entitled thereto (at the expense of the Party
entitled thereto) and, promptly upon receipt by such Party of any such payment
or reimbursement, such Party shall pay or shall cause the applicable member of
its Group to pay over to the Party entitled thereto the amount of such payment
or reimbursement without right of set-off. 

| 
---|--- 

(c)

|

The Parties agree to use commercially reasonable efforts to implement and
follow the cash management procedures set forth on Schedule 2.4(c) for the
time periods set forth therein. 

| 
---|--- 

2.5

|

Transfers Not Effected at or Prior to the Effective Time; Transfers Deemed
Effective as of the Effective Time 

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

To the extent that any Transfers contemplated by this Section 2 shall not have
been consummated at or prior to the Effective Time, the Parties shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to effect such Transfers as promptly following
the Effective Time as shall be practicable. Nothing herein shall be deemed to
require the Transfer of any Assets or the Assumption of any Liabilities which
by their terms or operation of Law cannot be Transferred; provided, however,
that the Parties and their respective Subsidiaries shall cooperate and use
commercially reasonable efforts to seek to obtain, in accordance with
applicable Law, any necessary Consents or Governmental Approvals for the
Transfer of all Assets and Assumption of all Liabilities to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law contemplated to be Transferred and assumed
pursuant to this Section 2. In the event that any such Transfer of Assets or
Assumption of Liabilities has not been consummated, from and after the
Effective Time (i) the Party retaining such Asset shall thereafter hold such
Asset in trust for the use and benefit of the Party entitled thereto (at the
expense of the Party entitled thereto) and (ii) the Party intended to assume
such Liability shall, or shall cause the applicable member of its Group to,
pay or reimburse the Party retaining such Liability for all amounts paid or
incurred in connection with the retention of such Liability. In addition, the
Party retaining such Asset or Liability shall, insofar as reasonably possible
and to the extent permitted by applicable Law, treat such Asset or Liability
in the ordinary course of business in accordance with past practice and take
such other actions as may be reasonably requested by the Party to which such
Asset is to be Transferred or by the Party Assuming such Liability in order to
place such Party, including but not limited to entering subcontracts for the
performance of Contracts that have not transferred, insofar as reasonably
possible, in the same position as if such Asset or Liability had been
Transferred or assumed as contemplated hereby and so that all the benefits and
burdens relating to such Asset or Liability, including possession, use, risk
of loss, potential for gain, and dominion, control and command over such Asset
or Liability, are to inure from and after the Effective Time to the member or
members of the CSC Group or the Computer Sciences GS Group entitled to the
receipt of such Asset or required to assume such Liability. In furtherance of
the foregoing, the Parties agree that, as of the Effective Time, subject to
Section 2.2(f), each Party shall be deemed to have acquired complete and sole
beneficial ownership over all of the Assets, together with all rights, powers
and privileges incident thereto, and shall be deemed to have assumed in
accordance with 

the terms of this Agreement all of the Liabilities, and all duties,
obligations and responsibilities incident thereto, which such Party is
entitled to acquire or required to assume pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement.

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

If and when the Consents, Governmental Approvals and/or conditions, the
absence or non-satisfaction of which caused the deferral of Transfer of any
Asset or deferral of the Assumption of any Liability, are obtained or
satisfied, the Transfer, assignment, Assumption or novation of the applicable
Asset or Liability shall be effected in accordance with and subject to the
terms of this Agreement and/or the applicable Ancillary Agreement, and shall,
to the extent possible without the imposition of any undue cost on any Party,
be deemed to be effective as of the Effective Time. 

| 
---|--- 

(c)

|

Following the second anniversary of the Distribution Date, the Party retaining
any Asset or Liability due to the deferral of the Transfer of such Asset or
the deferral of the Assumption of such Liability shall not be obligated, in
connection with the foregoing, to expend any money unless the necessary funds
are advanced, assumed, or agreed in advance to be reimbursed by the Party
entitled to such Asset or the Person intended to be subject to such Liability,
other than reasonable attorneys' fees and recording or similar or other
incidental fees, all of which shall be promptly reimbursed by the Party
entitled to such Asset or the Person intended to be subject to such Liability. 

| 
---|--- 

(d)

|

After the Effective Time, each Party (or any member of its Group) may receive
mail, packages and other communications properly belonging to another Party
(or any member of its Group). Accordingly, at all times after the Effective
Time, each Party is hereby authorized to receive and open all mail, packages
and other communications received by such Party that belongs to such other
Party, and to the extent that they do not relate to the business of the
receiving Party, the receiving Party shall promptly deliver such mail,
packages or other communications (or, in case the same also relates to the
business of the receiving Party or another Party, copies thereof) to such
other Party as provided for in Section 11.6. The provisions of this Section
2.5(d) are not intended to, and shall not, be deemed to constitute an
authorization by any Party to permit the other to accept service of process on
its behalf and no Party is or shall be deemed to be the agent of any other
Party for service of process purposes. 

| 
---|--- 

(e)

|

With respect to any Assets that have not been Transferred or Liabilities that
have not been assumed at or prior to the Effective Time, each of CSC and
Computer Sciences GS shall, and shall cause the members of its respective
Group to, (i) treat for all Income Tax purposes (A) the deferred Assets as
assets having been Transferred to and owned by the Party entitled to such
Assets at the Effective Time and (B) the deferred Liabilities as liabilities
having been assumed and owned by the Person intended to be subject to such
Liabilities at the Effective Time and (ii) neither report nor take any Income
Tax position (on a Tax Return or otherwise) inconsistent with such treatment
(unless required by a change in applicable Tax Law or good faith resolution of
a Tax Contest relating to Income Taxes). 

| 
---|--- 

2.6

|

Transfer Instruments 

In connection with, and in furtherance of, the Transfers of Assets and the
Assumptions of Liabilities contemplated by this Agreement, the Parties shall
execute or cause to be executed, on or after the date hereof by the
appropriate entities to the extent not executed prior to the date hereof, any
Transfer Instruments necessary to evidence the valid Transfer to the
applicable Party or member of such Party's Group of all right, title and
interest in and to its Assets and the valid and effective Assumption by the
applicable Party of its assumed Liabilities for Transfers and Assumptions to
be effected pursuant to New York Law or the Laws of one of the other states of
the United States or the United States or, if not 

appropriate for a given Transfer or Assumption, and for Transfers or
Assumptions to be effected pursuant to non-U.S. Laws, in such form as the
Parties shall reasonably agree, including the Transfer of real property by
mutually acceptable conveyance deeds as may be appropriate and in form and
substance as may be required by the jurisdiction in which the real property is
located. The Transfer of capital stock shall be effected by means of executed
stock powers and notation on the stock record books of the corporation or
other legal entities involved, or by such other means as may be required in
any non-U.S. jurisdiction to Transfer title to stock and, only to the extent
required by applicable Law, by notation on public registries.

2.7

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

In addition to and without limiting the actions specifically provided for
elsewhere in this Agreement, each of the Parties shall cooperate with each
other and use (and shall cause its respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates to
use) commercially reasonable efforts prior to, at and after the Effective
Time, to take, or to cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or to cause to
be done, all things reasonably necessary on its part under applicable Law or
contractual obligations to cause the conditions set forth in Section 4.4
(other than Sections 4.4(a) and (h)) to be satisfied and to consummate and
make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements. 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

Without limiting the foregoing, at and after the Effective Time, each Party
shall cooperate with the other Party, and without any further consideration,
at the cost and expense of the Party on whose behalf the request is made for
the twelve (12) month period following the Distribution Date and thereafter at
the cost and expense of the requesting Party, from and after the Effective
Time, to execute and deliver, or use commercially reasonable efforts to cause
to be executed and delivered, all instruments, including instruments of
Transfer or title, and to make all filings with, and to obtain all Consents
and/or Governmental Approvals, any permit, license, Contract, indenture or
other instrument (including any Consents or Governmental Approvals), and to
take all such other actions as such Party may reasonably be requested to take
by any other Party from time to time, consistent with the terms of this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, in order to effectuate the provisions
and purposes of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and the Transfers
of the applicable Assets and the assignment and Assumption of the applicable
Liabilities and the other transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. 

| 
---|--- 

(c)

|

Without limiting the foregoing, in the event that any Party (or member of such
Party's Group) is delivered or receives any Assets to be transferred to the
other Party pursuant to this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements, such Party
agrees to promptly return or cause the return of such Assets to the other
Party (or member of such other Party's Group as designated by such other
Party) at such other Party's expense. 

| 
---|---

other authorized representatives of any such Governmental Entity (each, a
"Audit Agency"). Subject to the provisions in subsection (c) of this Section
2.10, CSC shall be the party of record in settlement discussions with the
applicable Audit Agency of Indirect Rates for Open Years; provided, however,
that CSC will (i) not propose, agree or consent to, without Computer Sciences
GS's prior written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned), any determination, settlement or offer regarding such Indirect
Rates; and (ii) promptly inform Computer Sciences GS of the acceptance by the
applicable Audit Agency of a final determination or settlement of Indirect
Rates for Open Years previously agreed or consented to by Computer Sciences
GS. In connection with the settlement of Indirect Rates, each Party shall make
available to the other Party all personnel and pertinent Information in such
Party's possession or under such Party's control relating thereto as are
reasonably required by the other Party.

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

If either Party becomes aware of a material development that would affect
Indirect Rates, such Party shall, as soon as reasonably practicable
thereafter, inform the other Party of the status of and developments relating
to such matter. CSC shall be responsible for scheduling meetings with the
applicable Audit Agency that concern Indirect Rates relating to CSC Contracts.
Computer Sciences GS shall be responsible for scheduling meetings with the
applicable Audit Agency that concern Indirect Rates relating to Computer
Sciences GS Contracts. The Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to jointly determine the appropriate party that shall be responsible for
scheduling meetings with the applicable Audit Agency that involve Indirect
Rate issues applicable to both Parties, including company-wide fringe pools
and corporate home office allocations. If the parties are unable to jointly
determine which Party shall be responsible for scheduling meetings involving
Indirect Rate issues applicable to both Parties, CSC shall be responsible for
scheduling such meetings. Prior to a Party scheduling any meeting with an
Audit Agency regarding Indirect Rates for Open Years, each Party shall cause
appropriate personnel from such Party to discuss the timing and agenda for
such meeting, and each Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
include personnel from the other Party; provided, however, that if the
applicable Audit Agency objects to having the other Party present with respect
to Indirect Rate issues that concern only the requesting Party's contracts,
the requesting Party shall not be obligated to include personnel of the other
Party but the requesting Party shall inform the other excluded Party of the
discussions that occurred promptly following any such meeting. Each Party
shall bear its own internal costs and expenses in connection with any matters
involving Indirect Rates (including, for the avoidance of doubt, of the costs
of salaries and benefits of its personnel engaged with respect to such
matters). Costs and expenses of external legal counsel and other third-party
advisors engaged by CSC in connection with the settlement of Indirect Rates
shall be borne by the Parties in accordance with their respective Sharing
Percentages. 

| 
---|--- 

(c)

|

Upon settlement of Indirect Rates for Open Years, responsibility for the costs
of any resulting credit or payment due to customers shall be borne by Computer
Sciences GS. If CSC makes any credit or payment to a customer that includes
amounts payable by Computer Sciences GS pursuant to this paragraph, CSC shall
be entitled to reimbursement by Computer Sciences GS promptly upon delivery to
Computer Sciences GS of evidence of such credit or payment. 

| 
---|--- 

(d)

|

If, after the Effective Date, DCAA, DCMA, or another U.S. Government audit
agency, such as an agency Inspector General, initiates an audit of a
Transferred Contract and the issue of the audit relates to work performed by
the other Party prior to the Effective Date, the parties agree to cooperate,
to the extent required, in responding to such audit, including using
reasonable commercial efforts to make documents and employees available for
preparation of the audit response. Each Party shall bear its own internal
costs and expenses in connection with preparation of the audit response.

(a)

|

Except as otherwise specified in any Ancillary Agreement, at or prior to the
Effective Time or as soon as practicable thereafter, each Party shall (with
the reasonable cooperation of the applicable member of the other Party's
Group) use commercially reasonable efforts to have the applicable members of
the other Party's Group removed as guarantor of or obligor for any CSC or
Computer Sciences GS Liability (as applicable), including in respect of those
guarantees set forth on Schedule 2.11(a)(ii), to the extent that they relate
to CSC Liabilities or Computer Sciences GS Liabilities (as applicable). 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

At or prior to the Effective Time, to the extent required to obtain a release
from a guaranty (a "Guaranty Release") of any member of the other Party's
Group, each Party shall, as applicable, execute a guaranty agreement
substantially in the form of the existing guaranty or such other form as is
agreed to by the relevant parties to such guaranty agreement, except to the
extent that such existing guaranty contains representations, covenants or
other terms or provisions either (A) with which such Party would be reasonably
unable to comply or (B) which would be reasonably expected to be breached. 

| 
---|--- 

(c)

|

If either Party is unable to obtain, or to cause to be obtained, any such
required removal as set forth in clauses (a) and (b) of this Section 2.11, (i)
such Party shall indemnify and hold harmless the member of the other Party's
Group that is guarantor or obligor thereunder for any Loss arising from or
relating thereto (in accordance with the provisions of Section 7) and shall or
shall cause another member of the its Group, as agent or subcontractor for
such guarantor or obligor, to pay, perform and discharge fully all the
obligations or other Liabilities of such member of the other Party's Group;
and (ii) such Party agrees not to renew or extend the term of, increase its
obligations under, or Transfer to a third party, any loan, guarantee, lease,
contract or other obligation for which any member of the other Party's Group
is or may be liable without the prior written consent of the other Party or
such member of the other Party's Group, unless all obligations of such member
of the other Party's Group with respect thereto are thereupon terminated by
documentation reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to the other Party
or such member of the other Party's Group; provided, however, with respect to
any Computer Sciences GS Lease, in the event a Guaranty Release is not
obtained and Computer Sciences GS wishes to extend the term of such guaranteed
lease, then Computer Sciences GS shall have the option of extending the term
if it provides such security to CSC as is reasonably satisfactory to the
member of the CSC Group that is guarantor under such guaranteed lease.

|

SHARED CONTINGENT LIABILITIES 

| 
---|--- 

6.1

|

Shared Contingent Liabilities 

From and after the Effective Time, except as otherwise expressly set forth in
this Section 6 or the Tax Matters Agreement (with respect to Taxes) and
without limiting the indemnification provisions of Section 7, CSC and Computer
Sciences GS shall each be responsible for (i) its Sharing Percentage of any
Shared Contingent Liabilities pursuant to and in accordance with the relevant
provisions of Section 7 and, without duplication, (ii) its Sharing Percentage
of any Specified Shared Expenses related to or arising out of any Shared
Contingent Liability. Any amounts owed in respect of any Shared Contingent
Liabilities other than Specified Shared Expenses (which are addressed pursuant
to Section 5.2) shall be remitted promptly after the Party entitled to such
amount provides an invoice (including reasonable supporting Information with
respect thereto and a calculation of the amounts owed by each Party based on
such Party's Sharing Percentage) to the Party owing such amount and such costs
and expenses shall be included in the calculation of the amount of the
applicable Shared Contingent Liability in determining the reimbursement
obligations of the other Party with respect thereto; provided, however, that
if so directed by the Party providing the invoice, in lieu of remitting
amounts directly to the Party providing the invoice, the owing Party shall
remit the owed amount directly to the appropriate third party or parties or to
an account established by the invoicing Party for the benefit of the Parties,
in which case each Party shall contribute its Sharing Percentage of such
amount to such account for the benefit of the Parties. It shall not 

be a defense to any obligation by any Party to pay any amounts, whether
pursuant to this Section 6 or in respect of Losses pursuant to Section 7, in
respect of any Shared Contingent Liability that (A) such Party was not
consulted in the defense or management thereof, (B) that such Party's views or
opinions as to the conduct of such defense were not accepted or adopted, (C)
that such Party does not approve of the quality or manner of the defense
thereof or (D) that such Shared Contingent Liability was incurred by reason of
a settlement rather than by a judgment or other determination of Liability
(even if, subject in each case to Section 6.2(g), such settlement was effected
without the consent or over the objection of such Party); provided that the
foregoing is not meant to not limit the Managing Party's obligation to keep
the other Party informed pursuant to Section 6.2(c). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, no Party shall be required to pay its share of any final settlement
in connection with any Shared Contingent Liability unless the final settlement
agreement in connection therewith shall provide for a full and unconditional
release of such Party.

6.2

|

Management of Shared Contingent Liabilities 

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

"Managing Party" with respect to the Shared Contingent Liabilities shall mean
CSC; provided, however, that Computer Sciences GS may become the Managing
Party with respect to any Shared Contingent Liability upon the prior written
agreement of the Parties. 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

Except as provided in the Tax Matters Agreement (with respect to management of
Tax Contests), the Managing Party shall, on behalf of itself and the other
Party, have sole and exclusive authority to, and shall actively and
diligently, commence, prosecute, manage, control, conduct or defend (or assume
or conduct the defense of) or otherwise determine all matters whatsoever
(including, as applicable, litigation strategy and choice of legal counsel or
other professionals) with respect to any Shared Contingent Liability. The
Managing Party shall promptly notify the other Party in the event that it
receives notice of any Shared Contingent Liability including any claim or
demand relating thereto; provided that the failure to provide such notice
shall not give rise to any rights on the part of the other Party against the
Managing Party or affect any other provision of this Section 6.2, except to
the extent the other Party is actually and materially prejudiced thereby. No
Party other than the Managing Party shall consent to the entry of any judgment
or enter into any settlement with respect to any Shared Contingent Liability
without the prior written consent of the Managing Party. For the avoidance of
doubt, any settlement by the Managing Party shall be subject to Section
6.2(g). 

| 
---|--- 

(c)

|

The Managing Party shall on a quarterly basis, or if a material development
occurs as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter, inform the other Party of
the status of and developments relating to any matter involving a Shared
Contingent Liability and provide copies of any material document, notices or
other materials related to such matters; provided that the failure to provide
any such information shall not be a basis for liability of the Managing Party
except and solely to the extent the receiving Party shall have been actually
prejudiced thereby. Each Party shall cooperate fully with the Managing Party
in its management of any of such Shared Contingent Liability and shall take
such actions in connection therewith that the Managing Party reasonably
requests (including providing access to such Party's Records and other
Information and employees as set forth in Section 6.3). 

| 
---|--- 

(d)

|

In the event of any dispute as to whether any Liability is a Shared Contingent
Liability, the Managing Party may, but shall not be obligated to, commence
prosecution, other assertion or defense of such claim or right pending
resolution of such dispute. In the event that the Managing Party commences any
such prosecution, assertion or defense and, upon resolution of the dispute
(pursuant to Section 9 or otherwise), it is determined that such Liability is
not a Shared Contingent Liability, as the case may be, and that such 

Asset or Liability belongs to the other Party, pursuant to the provisions of
this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement, the Managing Party shall cease the
prosecution, assertion or defense of such right or claim and the control
thereof shall be transferred to the other Party. In such event, the other
Party shall promptly reimburse the Managing Party for all out-of pocket costs
and expenses incurred to such date in connection with the prosecution,
assertion or defense of such claim or right (which shall not include the costs
of salaries and benefits of employees of the Managing Party or any pro rata
portion of overhead or other costs of employing such employees which would
have been incurred by such employees' employer regardless of the employees'
service with respect to the foregoing).

| 
---|--- 

(e)

|

Until and unless the Managing Party assumes responsibility for defending a
Shared Contingent Liability, such other Party against which a Third Party
Claim may be brought may defend such Third Party Claim, with its costs and
expenses to be borne by the Parties in accordance with their Sharing
Percentages. If the other Party is conducting the defense of any such Shared
Contingent Liability, the Managing Party shall cooperate with such other Party
in such defense and make available to such other Party all witnesses,
pertinent Information, and material in the Managing Party's possession or
under such Managing Party's control relating thereto as are reasonably
required by such other Party (with the costs of the foregoing to be borne by
the Parties in accordance with their Sharing Percentages). 

| 
---|--- 

(f)

|

Unless the Managing Party has failed to assume the defense of a Shared
Contingent Liability in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the other
Party may not settle or compromise any Shared Contingent Liability without the
prior written consent of the Managing Party, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed. 

| 
---|--- 

(g)

|

In the case of any Shared Contingent Liability, the Managing Party shall not
consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement of the Shared
Contingent Liability without the prior written consent of the other Party (not
to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) if the effect thereof is to permit any
injunction, declaratory judgment or other nonmonetary relief, to be entered,
directly or indirectly, against the other Party. 

| 
---|--- 

6.3

|

Access to Information and Employees by the Managing Party 

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

Unless otherwise prohibited by Law, in connection with the management and
disposition of any Shared Contingent Liability, the other Party shall make
readily available to and afford to the Managing Party and its authorized
accountants, counsel and other designated representatives reasonable access,
subject to appropriate restrictions for classified Information, Confidential
Information or Privileged Information, to the employees, properties, Records
and other Information of such Party and the members of such Party's Group
insofar as such access relates to the relevant Shared Contingent Liability; it
being understood by the Parties that such access as well as any services
provided pursuant to Section 6.3(b) may require a significant time commitment
on the part of such Party's employees and that any such commitment shall not
otherwise limit any of the rights or obligations set forth in this Section 6;
it also being understood that such access and such services provided shall not
unreasonably interfere with any of such Party's employees' normal functions.
Nothing in this Section 6.2(a) shall require any Party to violate any
agreement with any third party regarding the confidentiality of confidential
and proprietary information relating to that third party or its business;
provided, however, that in the event that a Party is required to disclose any
such Information, such Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to seek
to obtain such third party's written consent to the disclosure of such
Information. 
| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

Certain Services. Each of CSC and Computer Sciences GS shall make available to
the other, upon reasonable written request, its and its Subsidiaries'
officers, directors, employees, counsel and agents to assist in the management
(including, if applicable, as witnesses in any Action) of any Shared
Contingent Liability to the extent that such Persons may reasonably be
required in connection with the prosecution, defense or day-to-day management
of any Shared Contingent Liability. 

| 
---|--- 

(c)

|

Costs and Expenses Relating to Access by the Managing Party. Except as
otherwise provided in any Ancillary Agreement, the provision of access and
other services pursuant to this Section 6.2 (including by the Managing Party)
shall be borne by the Party providing such access and services (other than for
actual out-of-pocket costs and expenses, which shall constitute Specified
Shared Expenses) and shall be shared by the Parties accordingly. 

| 
---|--- 

(d)

|

Other Specified Shared Expenses. Each Party shall be entitled, upon
presentation of reasonable supporting documentation thereof, to reimbursement
by the other Party of any out-of-pocket costs and expenses in excess of such
first Party's Sharing Percentage of the aggregate combined out-of-pocket costs
and expense of both Parties related to or arising out of defending, managing
or providing assistance in managing any such Shared Contingent Liability on a
quarterly basis, in advance of a final determination or resolution of any
Action related to a Shared Contingent Liability. Specified Shared Expenses in
respect of Shared Contingent Liabilities shall also include any amounts with
respect to a bond, prepayment or similar security or obligation required (or
determined to be advisable by the Managing Party) to be posted by the Managing
Party in respect of any claim. In order to determine if a Party is owed any
reimbursement pursuant to the foregoing, each Party shall provide the other
Party on a quarterly basis its total out-of-pocket costs and expenses related
to or arising out of defending, managing or providing assistance in managing
any such Shared Contingent Liability. In addition, each Party shall, in
connection with each invoice, provide a quarterly estimated budget (for
informational and planning purposes only) to the other Party of Specified
Shared Expenses for the following quarter. 

| 
---|--- 

6.4

|

Notice Relating to Shared Contingent Liabilities; Disputes 

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

In the event that any Party or any member of such Party's Group or any of
their respective Affiliates, becomes aware of (i) any Liability that may be
Shared Contingent Liability, (ii) any matter or occurrence that has given or
could give rise to a Shared Contingent Liability or (iii) any matter that is
material and is reasonably relevant to the Managing Party's ongoing or future
management, prosecution, defense and/or administration of any Shared
Contingent Liability, such Party shall promptly (but in any event within
thirty (30) days of becoming aware, unless, by its nature the subject matter
of such notice would require earlier notice) notify the other Party of any
such matter (setting forth in reasonable detail the subject matter thereof);
provided, however, that no Party shall be liable for the failure to provide
such notice except and solely to the extent the other Party shall have been
actually and materially prejudiced as a result of such failure. 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

In the event that any Party disagrees whether a claim, obligation or Liability
is a Shared Contingent Liability or whether such claim, obligation or
Liability is a Liability allocated to one of the Parties pursuant to this
Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement, then such matter shall be resolved
pursuant to and in accordance with the dispute resolution provisions set forth
in Section 9. 

| 
---|--- 

6.5

|

Cooperation with Governmental Entity 

If, in connection with any Shared Contingent Liability, a Party is required by
Law to respond to and/or cooperate with a Governmental Entity, such Party
shall be entitled to cooperate and respond to such Governmental Entity after,
to the extent practicable under the specific circumstances, consultation with
the Managing Party with respect to such Shared Contingent Liability; provided
that to the extent such consultation was not practicable such Party shall
promptly inform the Managing Party of such cooperation and/or response to the
Governmental Entity and the subject matter thereof. In the event that any
Party is requested or required by any Governmental Entity in connection with
any Shared Contingent Liability pursuant to written or oral question or
request for Information or documents in any legal or administrative
proceeding, review, interrogatory, subpoena, investigation, demand, or similar
process, such Party shall notify the Managing Party promptly of the request or
requirement and such Party's response thereto, and shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to consult with the Managing Party with respect to the
nature of such Party's response to the extent practicable and not in violation
of any attorney-client Privilege or legal process.

| 
---|--- 

6.6

|

Default 

In the event that a Party defaults in any full or partial payment in respect
of any Shared Contingent Liability (as provided in this Section 6 and in
Section 7), including the payment of the costs and expenses of the Managing
Party, then the non-defaulting Party shall be required to pay the amount in
default; provided, however, that any such payment by a non-defaulting Party
shall in no way release the defaulting Party from its obligations to pay its
obligations in respect of such Shared Contingent Liability (both for past and
future obligations) and the non-defaulting Party may exercise any available
legal remedies available against such defaulting Party.

| 
---|--- 

6.7

|

Change of Control 

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in the event that there is a
public announcement of a Change of Control of Computer Sciences GS, the
obligation of CSC to pay the CSC Sharing Percentage of any Shared Contingent
Liability shall terminate and be of no further force and effect, with Computer
Sciences GS to be fully responsible for any Shared Contingent Liability,
unless such announced transaction is terminated, in which case such obligation
shall be fully reinstated. 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in the event that Computer
Sciences GS sells, transfers or assigns (or announces the sale, transfer or
assignment of) any business, division or other asset out of which a Shared
Contingent Liability arose, the obligation of CSC to pay the CSC Sharing
Percentage of such Shared Contingent Liability shall terminate and be of no
further force and effect, with Computer Sciences GS (and/or the acquirer of
such business, division or asset) to be fully responsible for such Shared
Contingent Liability (unless, if announced, such transaction is terminated, in
which case such obligation shall be fully reinstated). 

| 
---|--- 

(c)

|

For purposes of this Agreement a "Change of Control" shall mean, with respect
to Computer Sciences GS, the occurrence of any one of the following after the
Effective Time: 

| 
---|--- 

(i)

|

the direct or indirect Transfer, in one or a series of related transactions,
of all or substantially all of the properties or assets of Computer Science
GS, and the other members of Computer Sciences GS's Group, taken as a whole,
to one or more Persons, other than to Computer Sciences GS or one of Computer
Sciences GS Group's Subsidiaries; 
| 
---|--- 

(ii)

|

the first day on which the board of directors of Computer Sciences GS is not
composed of a majority of directors who (1) were a member of Computer Sciences
GS's board of directors immediately following the Effective Time; or (2) were
nominated for election, elected or appointed to Computer Sciences GS's board
of directors with the approval of a majority of directors described in clause
(1) or this clause (2) who were members of Computer Sciences GS's board of
directors at the time of such nomination, election or appointment (either by a
specific vote or by approval by such directors of the proxy statement of
Computer Sciences GS in which such member was named as a nominee for election
as a director); 

| 
---|--- 

(iii)

|

the consummation of any transaction, including any merger, amalgamation,
arrangement or consolidation, the result of which is that any Person becomes
the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of more than fifty (50%) of the
voting interests of Computer Sciences GS; provided that a transaction
described in this clause (iii) shall not be deemed to involve a Change of
Control if (a) Computer Sciences GS becomes a direct or indirect wholly-owned
subsidiary of a holding company (which shall include a parent company) and (b)
the direct or indirect holders of the voting interests of such holding company
immediately following that transaction are substantially the same as, and hold
in substantially the same proportions as, the holders of Computer Sciences
GS's voting interests immediately prior to that transaction. Following any
such transaction, references in this definition to CSC or Computer Sciences
GS, as applicable, shall be deemed to refer to such holding company; 

| 
---|--- 

(iv)

|

Computer Sciences GS consolidates with, or merges with or into, any Person, or
any Person consolidates with, or merges with or into, Computer Sciences GS, in
any such event pursuant to a transaction in which any of the outstanding
voting interests of Computer Sciences GS, or of such other Person is converted
into or exchanged for cash, securities or other property, other than any such
transaction where the shares of Computer Sciences GS's voting interests
outstanding immediately prior to such transaction constitute, or are converted
into or exchanged for, a majority of the voting interest of the surviving
Person immediately after giving effect to such transaction; or 

| 
---|--- 

(v)

|

the adoption of a plan relating to the liquidation or dissolution (other than

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

Nothing contained in this Agreement shall impair or otherwise affect any right

(c)

|

Each Party shall not, and shall not permit any member of its Group to, make

| 
---|--- 

7.4

|

Procedures for Indemnification 

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

Other than with respect to Third Party Claims, which shall be governed by
Section 7.4(b), and Shared Contingent Liabilities, which shall be governed by
Section 6.3, each CSC Indemnitee and Computer Sciences GS Indemnitee (each, an
"Indemnitee") shall notify in writing, with respect to any matter that such
Indemnitee has determined has given or could give rise to a right of
indemnification under this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement, the Party
which is or may be required pursuant to this Section 7 or pursuant to any
Ancillary Agreement to make such indemnification (the "Indemnifying Party"),
within thirty (30) days of such determination, stating the amount of the Loss
claimed, if known, and method of computation thereof, and referring to the
provisions of this Agreement in respect of which such right of indemnification
is claimed by such Indemnitee or arises; provided, however, that the failure
to provide such written notice shall not release the Indemnifying Party from
any of its obligations except and solely to the extent the Indemnifying Party
shall have been actually prejudiced as a result of such failure. Each such
Indemnitee shall provide the applicable Indemnifying Party with reasonable
access, upon reasonable prior written notice and during normal business hours,
in a manner so as not to unreasonably 

interfere in any material respect with the normal business operations of such
Indemnitee, to its books and records, properties and personnel relating to the
claim the Indemnitee has determined has given or could give rise to a right of
indemnification under this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement.

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

Third Party Claims. If a claim or demand is made by any Person who is not a
party to this Agreement (a "Third Party Claim") against an Indemnitee as to
which such Indemnitee is or may be entitled to indemnification pursuant to
this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement, such Indemnitee shall notify the
Indemnifying Party in writing, and in reasonable detail, of the Third Party
Claim promptly (and in any event within thirty (30) days) after receipt by
such Indemnitee of written notice of the Third Party Claim; provided, however,
that the failure to provide notice of any such Third Party Claim pursuant to
this or the preceding sentence shall not release the Indemnifying Party from
any of its obligations except and solely to the extent the Indemnifying Party
shall have been actually and materially prejudiced as a result of such
failure. If any Party shall receive notice or otherwise learn of the assertion
of a Third Party Claim which may reasonably be determined to be a Shared
Contingent Liability, such Party, as appropriate, shall give the Managing
Party written notice thereof within thirty (30) days after such Person becomes
aware of such Third Party Claim subject to and in compliance with Section 6.3.
Thereafter, the Indemnitee shall deliver to the Indemnifying Party (and, if
applicable, to the Managing Party), promptly (and in any event within five (5)
Business Days) after the Indemnitee's receipt thereof, copies of all notices
and documents (including court papers) received by the Indemnitee relating to
the Third Party Claim. 

| 
---|--- 

(c)

|

Other than in the case of (i) a Shared Contingent Liability (the defense of
which shall be assumed and controlled by the Managing Party) or (ii) Taxes
addressed in the Tax Matters Agreement, the Indemnifying Party shall be
entitled to participate in the defense of any Third Party Claim and, if it so
chooses, to assume the defense thereof, at such Indemnifying Party's own cost
and expense and by such Indemnifying Party's own counsel, that is reasonably
acceptable to the Indemnitee, within thirty (30) days of the receipt of such
notice from such Indemnitee; provided, however, that the Indemnifying Party
shall not be entitled to assume the defense of any Third Party Claim to the
extent such Third Party Claim (x) is an allegation of a criminal violation or
(y) seeks injunctive relief against the Indemnitee. In connection with the
Indemnifying Party's defense of a Third Party Claim, such Indemnitee shall
have the right to employ separate counsel and to participate in (but not
control) the defense, compromise, or settlement thereof, at its own expense
and, in any event, shall cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in such defense
and make available to the Indemnifying Party, at the Indemnifying Party's
expense, all witnesses, pertinent Information, materials and information in
such Indemnitee's possession or under such Indemnitee's control relating
thereto as are reasonably required by the Indemnifying Party; provided,
however, that in the event of that any of the Indemnities reasonably believes
there is a conflict of interest between the Indemnifying Party and the
applicable Indemnitee, such Indemnitee shall be entitled to retain, at the
Indemnifying Party's expense, separate counsel as required by the applicable
rules of professional conduct with respect to such matter; provided, further,
that if (i) the Third Party Claim is not a Shared Contingent Liability and
(ii) the Indemnifying Party has assumed the defense of the Third Party Claim
but has specified, and continues to assert, any reservations or exceptions to
such defense or to its liability therefor, then, in any such case, the
reasonable fees and expenses of one separate counsel for all Indemnitees shall
be borne by the Indemnifying Party. 

| 
---|--- 

(d)

|

Notwithstanding any assumption of defense of a Third Party Claim by an
Indemnifying Party in accordance with Section 7.4(c), in the event that in the
course of defending such Third Party Claim the Indemnifying Party or the other
Party becomes aware that the subject matter of such Third Party Claim relates
to a Liability of the other Party and not to a Liability of such Indemnifying
Party, then the 

Indemnifying Party shall, subject to the prior written consent of the other
Party to which such Liability belongs (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed), use commercially reasonable efforts to transfer the
defense of such claim to such other Party, and shall thereafter cooperate
fully with such other Party in such defense and make available to such other
Party, at such Party's expense, all witnesses, pertinent Information,
materials and information in such Indemnifying Party's possession or under
such Indemnifying Party's control relating to such Third Party Claim as are
reasonably required by such other Party.

| 
---|--- 

(e)

|

Until and unless the Indemnifying Party assumes responsibility for defending a
Third Party Claim, such Indemnitee may defend such Third Party Claim at the
cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnitee is conducting
the defense against any such Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall
cooperate with the Indemnitee in such defense and make available to the
Indemnitee, at the Indemnitee's expense, all witnesses, pertinent Information,
and material in such Indemnifying Party's possession or under such
Indemnifying Party's control relating thereto as are reasonably required by
the Indemnitee. 

| 
---|--- 

(f)

|

Unless the Indemnifying Party has failed to assume the defense of the Third
Party Claim in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, no Indemnitee may
settle or compromise any Third Party Claim without the prior written consent
of the Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed. 

| 
---|--- 

(g)

|

In the case of a Third Party Claim, no Indemnifying Party shall consent to
entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement of the Third Party Claim
without the prior written consent of the Indemnitee (not to be unreasonably
withheld or delayed) if the effect thereof is to permit any injunction,
declaratory judgment or other non-monetary relief to be entered, directly or
indirectly, against any Indemnitee. For the avoidance of doubt, no such
consent shall be required to the extent such judgment or settlement is for
monetary damages. 

| 
---|--- 

(h)

|

Except as otherwise set forth in Section 6 and Section 8.6, or as set forth in
any Ancillary Agreement, absent fraud or willful misconduct by an Indemnifying
Party, the indemnification provisions of this Section 7 shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy of an Indemnitee for any monetary or compensatory damages or
losses resulting from any breach of this Agreement and each Indemnitee
expressly waives and relinquishes any and all rights, claims or remedies such
Person may have with respect to the foregoing other than under this Section 7
against any Indemnifying Party. For the avoidance of doubt, all disputes in
respect of this Section 7 shall be resolved in accordance with Section 9.

Cooperation in Defense and Settlement 

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

With respect to any Third Party Claim that is not a Shared Contingent
Liability and that implicates both Parties in any material respect due to the
allocation of Liabilities, responsibilities for management of defense and
related indemnities pursuant to this Agreement or any of the Ancillary
Agreements, the Parties agree to use commercially reasonable efforts to
cooperate fully and maintain a joint defense (in a manner that will preserve
for all Parties any Privilege with respect thereto). The Party that is not
responsible for managing the defense of any such Third Party Claim shall, upon
reasonable request, be consulted with respect to significant matters relating
thereto and may, if necessary or helpful, retain counsel to assist in the
defense of such claims. 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

CSC and Computer Sciences GS each agree that at all times from and after the
Effective Time, if an Action is commenced by a third party naming both Parties
(or any member of such Parties' respective 

Groups) as defendants and with respect to which a named Party (or any member
of such Party's respective Group) is a nominal defendant and/or such Action is
otherwise not a Liability allocated to such named Party under this Agreement
or any Ancillary Agreement, then the other Party shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause such nominal defendant to be removed from such
Action, as soon as reasonably practicable.

| 
---|--- 

7.6

|

Indemnification Payments 

Indemnification required by this Section 7 shall be made by periodic payments
of the amount of Losses in a timely fashion during the course of the
investigation or defense, as and when bills are received or a Loss incurred.

| 
---|--- 

7.7

|

Indemnification Obligations Net of Insurance Proceeds and Other Amounts 

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

Any Loss subject to indemnification pursuant to this Section 7 including, for
the avoidance of doubt, in respect of any Shared Contingent Liability, shall
be calculated (i) net of insurance proceeds that actually reduce the amount of
the Loss, (ii) net of any proceeds received by the Indemnitee from any third
party for indemnification for such Liability that actually reduce the amount
of the Loss ("Third Party Proceeds") and (iii) net of any Tax benefits
actually realized in accordance with, and subject to, the principles set forth
or referred to in Section 2.4 of the Tax Matters Agreement. Accordingly, the
amount which any Indemnifying Party is required to pay pursuant to this
Section 7 to any Indemnitee pursuant to this Section 7 shall be reduced by any
Insurance Proceeds or Third Party Proceeds theretofore actually recovered by
or on behalf of the Indemnitee in respect of the related Loss. If an
Indemnitee receives a payment required by this Agreement from an Indemnifying
Party in respect of any Loss (an "Indemnity Payment") and subsequently
receives Insurance Proceeds or Third Party Proceeds, then the Indemnitee shall
pay to the Indemnifying Party an amount equal to the excess of the Indemnity
Payment received over the amount of the Indemnity Payment that would have been
due if the Insurance Proceeds or Third Party Proceeds had been received,
realized or recovered before the Indemnity Payment was made. 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

The Parties acknowledge that the indemnification provisions hereof do not
relieve any insurer who would otherwise be obligated to pay any claim to pay
such claim. In furtherance of the foregoing, the Indemnitee shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to seek to collect or recover any Insurance
Proceeds and any Third Party Proceeds (other than Insurance Proceeds under an
arrangement where future premiums are adjusted to reflect prior claims in
excess of prior premiums) to which the Indemnitee is entitled in connection
with any Loss for which the Indemnitee seeks indemnification pursuant to this
Section 7; provided that the Indemnitee's inability to collect or recover any
such Insurance Proceeds or Third Party Proceeds (despite having used
commercially reasonable efforts) shall not limit the Indemnifying Party's
obligations hereunder. 

| 
---|--- 

7.8

|

Additional Matters; Survival of Indemnities 

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

The indemnity agreements contained in this Section 7 shall remain operative
and in full force and effect, regardless of (i) any investigation made by or
on behalf of any Indemnitee; (ii) the knowledge by the Indemnitee of Losses
for which it might be entitled to indemnification hereunder; and (iii) any
termination of this Agreement following the Effective Time. 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

The rights and obligations of each Party and their respective Indemnitees
under this Section 7 shall survive the sale or other Transfer by any Party or
its respective Subsidiaries of any Assets or businesses or 

the assignment by it of any Liabilities, with respect to any Loss of any
Indemnitee related to such Assets, businesses or Liabilities.

Preservation of Corporate Records 

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

Except to the extent otherwise provided herein or in any Ancillary Agreement,
a Party maintaining or providing Records or access to Information to the other
Party under this Agreement shall be entitled to receive from such other Party,
upon the presentation of invoices therefor, payments for such amounts,
relating to supplies, disbursements and other out-of-pocket expenses (which
shall not include the costs of salaries and benefits of employees of such
Party or any pro rata portion of overhead or other costs of employing such
employees which would have been incurred by such employees' employer
regardless of the employees' service with respect to the foregoing), as may be
reasonably incurred in providing such Records or access to Information. 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

The Parties shall comply with those document retention policies as shall be
set forth on Schedule 8.1(b) hereto or otherwise established and agreed to in
writing by their respective authorized officers at or prior to the Effective
Time in respect of Records and related matters. For the avoidance of doubt,
each Party shall comply with the records retention requirements applicable to
their respective contract with a Government Customer. 

| 
---|--- 

8.2

|

Financial Statements and Accounting; Government Audits 

Each Party agrees to provide assistance and reasonable access to its
properties, Records, other Information and personnel set forth in this Section
8.2 at the request of the other Party: (i) at any time, with the consent of
the other Party (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) for reasonable
business purposes relating to financial reporting and other regulatory
obligations (including disclosure obligations) or other obligations to
Government Entities; (ii) from the Effective Time until the completion of each
Party's audit for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2017 (or thereabout), in
connection with the preparation and audit of each Party's financial statements
for the fiscal years ending March 31, 2016 (or thereabout) and March 31, 2017
(or thereabout) (including financial statements for any interim periods), the
printing, filing and public dissemination of such financial statements and the
audit of each Party's internal controls over financial reporting and
management's assessment thereof and management's assessment of each Party's
disclosure controls and procedures, if required; (iii) in the event that
either Party changes its independent auditors within two (2) years following
the Distribution Date, reasonable access on the terms set forth in this
Section 8.2 for a period of up to one hundred and eighty (180) days from such
change; and (iv) to the extent reasonably necessary to respond to any written
request or official comment from a Governmental Entity, such as in connection
with responding to a comment letter from the Commission or an audit request
from the Defense Contract Audit Agency or the Defense Contract Management
Agency. Without limiting the foregoing, each Party agrees as follows:

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

Financial Statements. Each Party shall provide reasonable access to the other
Party on a timely basis to all Information reasonably required to meet its
schedule for the preparation, printing, filing, and public dissemination of
its quarterly and annual financial statements and for management's assessment
of the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures and its
internal controls over financial reporting in accordance with Items 307 and
308, respectively, of Regulation S-K and, to the extent applicable to such 

Party, its auditor's audit of its internal controls over financial reporting
and management's assessment thereof in accordance with Section 404 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the Commission's and the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board's rules and auditing standards thereunder, if
required (such assessments and audit being referred to as the "Internal
Control Audit and Management Assessments"). Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, each Party shall provide all required financial and other
Information with respect to itself and its Subsidiaries to its auditors in a
sufficient and reasonable time and in sufficient detail to permit its auditors
to take all steps and perform all reviews necessary to provide sufficient
assistance, if requested, to each other Party's auditors with respect to
Information to be included or contained in such other Party's annual financial
statements and to permit such other Party's auditors and management to
complete the Internal Control Audit and Management Assessments, for all
required periods in the fiscal years ending March 31, 2016 (or thereabout) and
March 31, 2017 (or thereabout).

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

Access to Audit Personnel and Records. Except to the extent otherwise
contemplated by the Ancillary Agreements, each Party shall authorize its
respective auditors to make reasonably available to the other Party's auditors
(the "Other Party's Auditors") both the personnel who performed or are
performing the annual audits of such audited Party (each Party with respect to
its own audit, the "Audited Party") and work papers related to the annual
audits of such Audited Party (subject to the execution of any reasonable and
customary access letters that such Audited Party's auditors may require in
connection with the review of such work papers by such Other Party's
Auditors), in all cases within a reasonable time prior to such Audited Party's
auditors' opinion date, so that the Other Party's Auditors are able to perform
the procedures they reasonably consider necessary to take responsibility for
the work of the Audited Party's auditors as it relates to their auditors'
report on such other Party's financial statements, all within sufficient time
to enable such other Party to meet its timetable for the printing, filing and
public dissemination of its annual financial statements. 

| 
---|--- 

(c)

|

Annual Reports. Each Party shall deliver to the other Party a reasonably
complete draft of the portions of the annual report (and financial statements
required to be filed therewith) for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2016 (or
thereabout) (the "Annual Report") that relate to or directly discuss the
Distribution and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, no
later than two weeks prior to the date such Annual Report is expected to be
filed; provided, however, that for the avoidance of doubt, each Party may
continue to revise its respective Annual Report prior to the filing thereof,
with material changes to the portions of the Annual Report and accompanying
financial statements that are required to be shared hereunder to be delivered
to the other Party as soon as reasonably available. Each Party shall notify
the other Party, as soon as reasonably practicable after becoming aware
thereof, of any material accounting differences relating to the Distribution
and other transactions contemplated by this Agreement between the financial
statements to be included in such Party's Annual Report and the pro forma
financial statements included, as applicable, in the Form 10 or the Form 8-K
to be filed by CSC with the Commission on or about the time of the
Distribution. If any such differences are notified by any Party, the Parties
shall confer and/or meet as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter, and in
any event prior to the filing of any Annual Report, to consult with each other
in respect of such differences and the effects thereof on the Parties' Annual
Reports. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, neither Party shall
be required to disclose to the other Party events or occurrences that such
Party determines in good faith to be significant or material to such Party and
that are not appropriate for disclosure. 

| 
---|--- 

(d)

|

Nothing in this Section 8 shall require any Party to violate any agreement
with any third party regarding the confidentiality of confidential and
proprietary Information relating to that third party or its business; 

provided, however, that in the event that a Party is required under this
Section 8.2 to disclose any such Information, such Party shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to seek to obtain such third party's written
consent to the disclosure of such Information.

| 
---|--- 

8.3

|

Provision of Information 

Other than in circumstances in which indemnification is sought pursuant to
Section 7 (in which event the provisions of such Section shall govern) or for
matters related to provision of Tax Records (in which event the provisions of
the Tax Matters Agreement shall govern) and without limiting the applicable
provisions of Section 6, and subject to appropriate restrictions for
classified Information, Privileged Information or Confidential Information:

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

If Information that is retained by CSC (pursuant to the proviso in Section
1.1(14)(xii)) is (i) CSC Information but used in or related to the Computer
Sciences GS Business, Computer Sciences GS shall have the right to access and
use such Information and make reasonable copies thereof but solely for its
internal purposes consistent with past practice, subject to applicable
security restrictions and confidentiality obligations as set forth in Section
8.5 (Confidentiality) and (ii) Computer Sciences GS Information, Computer
Sciences GS shall have the right to access and use such Information and make
reasonable copies thereof, which copies shall be included in the Computer
Sciences GS Assets; 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

If Information that is retained by Computer Sciences GS (pursuant to the
proviso in Section 1.1(19)(xii)) is (i) Computer Sciences GS Information but
used in or related to the CSC Business, CSC shall have the right to access and
use such Information and make reasonable copies thereof but solely for its
internal purposes consistent with past practice, subject to applicable
security restrictions and confidentiality obligations as set forth in Section
8.5 and (ii) is CSC Information, CSC shall have the right to access and use
such Information and make reasonable copies thereof, which copies shall be
included in the CSC Assets.

8.4

|

Witness Services 

Except in the event the Parties are opposing one another in an Action, in
which case normal discovery rules shall apply, at all times from and after the
Effective Time, CSC and Computer Sciences GS shall each use its commercially
reasonable efforts to make available to the other Party, upon reasonable
written request, its and its Subsidiaries' former (to the extent practicable)
and then-current directors, officers, employees, other personnel and agents of
such Party as witnesses and any Records or other Information within its
control or which it otherwise has the ability to make available (other than
materials covered by any Privilege) to the extent that such Persons (giving
consideration to business demands of such directors, officers, employees,
other personnel and agents) or Records or other Information may reasonably be
required to testify, in the case of Persons, or be provided, in the case of
Records or Information, in connection with the prosecution or defense of any
Action in which the requesting Party may from time to time be involved (except
for claims, demands or Actions between members of each Group). A Party
providing a witness to the other Party under this Section shall be entitled to
receive from the recipient of such witness services, upon the presentation of
invoices therefor, payments for such amounts, relating to supplies,
disbursements and other out-of-pocket expenses (which shall not include the
costs of salaries and benefits of employees who are witnesses or any pro rata
portion of overhead or other costs of employing such employees which would
have been incurred by such employees' employer regardless of the employees'
service as witnesses; provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing, the Party
providing a witness (including in connection with any Shared Contingent
Liability) shall be entitled to receive the pro 

rata portion of the costs of salaries and benefits of such employees with
respect to whom at least thirty percent (30%) of their professional time over
period of one-month or greater is dedicated to such witness services), as may
be reasonably incurred and properly paid under applicable Law.

| 
---|--- 

8.5

|

Confidentiality 

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

Notwithstanding any termination of this Agreement, each Party shall hold, and
shall cause each of its respective Subsidiaries to hold, and shall cause its
and their respective officers, employees, agents, consultants and advisors to
hold, in strict confidence, and not to disclose or release or, except as
otherwise permitted by this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement, use, without
the prior written consent of the Party to whom the Confidential Information
relates (which may be withheld in such Party's sole and absolute discretion,
except where disclosure is required by applicable Law), any and all
Confidential Information (as defined herein) concerning or belonging to the
other Party; provided that each Party may disclose, or may permit disclosure
of, Confidential Information (i) to its respective auditors, attorneys,
financial advisors, bankers and other appropriate consultants and advisors who
have a need to know such Information and are informed of the obligation to
hold such Information confidential and in respect of whose failure to comply
with such obligations, the applicable Party will be responsible, (ii) if any
Party or any of its respective Subsidiaries is required or compelled to
disclose any such Confidential Information by judicial or administrative
process or by other requirements of Law or stock exchange rule or is advised
by outside counsel in connection with a governmental proceeding that it is
advisable to do so, (iii) as required in connection with any legal or other
proceeding by one Party against any other Party, (iv) as necessary in order to
permit a Party to prepare and disclose its financial statements, Tax Returns
or other required disclosures, (v) as necessary for a Party to enforce its
rights or perform its obligations under this Agreement (including pursuant to
Section 2.3) or an Ancillary Agreement or (vi) to Governmental Entities in
accordance with applicable procurement regulations and contract requirements.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that any demand or request for
disclosure of Confidential Information is made pursuant to clause (ii), (iii),
(iv), (v) or (vi) above, each Party, as applicable, shall promptly notify (to
the extent permissible by Law) the Party to whom the Confidential Information
relates of the existence of such request, demand or disclosure requirement and
shall provide such affected Party a reasonable opportunity to seek an
appropriate protective order or other remedy, which such Party will cooperate
in obtaining to the extent reasonably practicable. In the event that such
appropriate protective order or other remedy is not obtained, the Party which
faces the disclosure requirement shall furnish only that portion of the
Confidential Information that is required to be disclosed and shall take
commercially reasonable steps to ensure that confidential treatment is
accorded such Confidential Information. 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

Each Party acknowledges that it and the other members of its Group may have in
its or their possession confidential or proprietary Information of third
parties that was received under confidentiality or non-disclosure agreements
with such third party while such Party and/or members of its Group were part
of the CSC Group. Each Party shall comply, and shall cause the other members
of its Group to comply, and shall cause its and their respective officers,
employees, agents, consultants and advisors (or potential buyers) to comply,
with all terms and conditions of any such third-party agreements entered into
prior to the Effective Time, with respect to any confidential and proprietary
Information of third parties to which it or any other member of its Group has
had access. 

| 
---|--- 

(c)

|

The Parties agree that Confidential Information that is subject to privacy
laws, rules, regulations and contractual requirements ("Protected
Information") will be subject to the additional terms and conditions set forth
in Schedule 8.5(c). 
| 
---|--- 

(d)

|

The Parties agree that irreparable damage may occur in the event that the
provisions of this Section 8.5 were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms. Accordingly, it is hereby agreed that the Parties shall be
entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions to enforce specifically the
terms and provisions hereof in any court of the United States or any state
having jurisdiction, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they
are entitled at law or in equity. 

| 
---|--- 

(e)

|

For the avoidance of doubt, the disclosure and sharing of Privileged
Information shall be governed by Section 8.6 and not by this Section 8.5. 

| 
---|--- 

8.6

|

Privilege Matters 

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

Pre-Separation Services. The Parties recognize that legal and other
professional services that have been and will be provided prior to the
Effective Time have been and will be rendered for the collective benefit of
each of the members of the CSC Group and the Computer Sciences GS Group, and
that each of the members of the CSC Group and the Computer Sciences GS Group
should be deemed to be the client with respect to such pre-separation services
for the purposes of asserting all privileges, immunities, or other protections
from disclosure which may be asserted under applicable Law, including
attorney-client privilege, business strategy privilege, joint defense
privilege, common interest privilege, and protection under the work-product
doctrine ("Privilege"). The Parties shall have a shared Privilege with respect
to all Information subject to Privilege ("Privileged Information") which
relates to such pre-separation services. For the avoidance of doubt,
Privileged Information within the scope of this Section 8.6 includes, but is
not limited to, services rendered by legal counsel retained or employed by any
Party (or any member of such Party's respective Group), including outside
counsel and in-house counsel. 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

Post-Separation Services. The Parties recognize that legal and other
professional services will be provided following the Effective Time to each of
CSC and Computer Sciences GS. The Parties further recognize that certain of
such post-separation services will be rendered solely for the benefit of CSC
or Computer Sciences GS, as the case may be, while other such post-separation
services may be rendered with respect to claims, proceedings, litigation,
disputes, or other matters which involve CSC and Computer Sciences GS. With
respect to such post-separation services and related Privileged Information,
the Parties agree as follows: 

| 
---|--- 

(i)

|

All Privileged Information relating to any claims, proceedings, litigation,
disputes, or other matters which involve CSC and Computer Sciences GS shall be
subject to a shared Privilege between the Parties involved in the claims,
proceedings, litigation, disputes, or other matters at issue; and 

| 
---|--- 

(ii)

|

Except as otherwise provided in Section 8.6(b)(i), Privileged Information
relating to post-separation services provided solely to one of CSC or Computer
Sciences GS shall not be deemed shared between the Parties, provided that the
foregoing shall not be construed or interpreted to restrict the right or
authority of the Parties (x) to enter into any further agreement, not
otherwise inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement, concerning the
sharing of Privileged Information or (y) otherwise to share Privileged
Information without waiving any Privilege which could be asserted under
applicable Law. 

| 
---|--- 

(c)

|

The Parties agree as follows regarding all Privileged Information with respect
to which the Parties shall have a shared Privilege under Section 8.6(a) or
(b): 
| 
---|--- 

(i)

|

Subject to Section 8.6(c)(iii) and (iv), no Party may waive any Privilege
which could be asserted under any applicable Law, and in which the other Party
has a shared Privilege, without the consent of the other Party, which shall
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Consent shall be in writing, or shall
be deemed to be granted unless written objection is made within ten (10) days
after written notice by the requesting Party to the Party whose consent is
sought; 

| 
---|--- 

(ii)

|

If a dispute arises between or among the Parties or their respective
Subsidiaries regarding whether a Privilege should be waived to protect or
advance the interest of any Party, each Party agrees that it shall negotiate
in good faith, shall endeavor to minimize any prejudice to the rights of the
other Party, and shall not unreasonably withhold consent to any request for
waiver by the other Party. Each Party specifically agrees that it shall not
withhold consent to waive for any purpose except to protect its own legitimate
interests; 

| 
---|--- 

(iii)

|

If, within ten (10) days of receipt by the requesting Party of written
objection, the Parties have not succeeded in negotiating a resolution to any
dispute regarding whether a Privilege should be waived, and the requesting
Party determines that a Privilege should nonetheless be waived to protect or
advance its interest, the requesting Party shall provide the objecting Party
ten (10) days written notice prior to effecting such waiver. Each Party
specifically agrees that failure within ten (10) days of receipt of such
notice to commence proceedings in a court of competent jurisdiction to enjoin
such disclosure under applicable Law shall be deemed full and effective
consent to such disclosure; and 

| 
---|--- 

(iv)

|

In the event of any litigation or dispute between the Parties, or any members
of their respective Groups, either such Party may waive a Privilege in which
the other Party or member of such Group has a shared Privilege, without
obtaining the consent of the other Party; provided that such waiver of a
shared Privilege shall be effective only as to the use of Privileged
Information with respect to the litigation or dispute between the Parties
and/or the applicable members of their respective Groups, and shall not
operate as a waiver of the shared Privilege with respect to third parties. 

| 
---|--- 

(d)

|

The transfer of all Information pursuant to this Agreement is made in reliance
on the agreement of CSC or Computer Sciences GS as set forth in Section 8.5
and this Section 8.6, to maintain the confidentiality of Privileged
Information and to assert and maintain any applicable Privilege. The access to
Information being granted hereunder, the agreement to provide witnesses and
individuals hereunder, the furnishing of notices and documents and other
cooperative efforts contemplated hereunder, and the transfer of Privileged
Information between the Parties and their respective Subsidiaries pursuant to
this Agreement, in each case shall not be deemed a waiver of any Privilege
that has been or may be asserted under this Agreement or otherwise. 

| 
---|--- 

(e)

|

Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in this Section 8.6, the Audit
Management Party (as defined in the Tax Matters Agreement) shall have the
authority to disclose or not disclose, in its sole discretion, any and all
Privileged Information to (i) any Taxing Authority (as defined in the Tax
Matters Agreement) conducting a Tax Contest or (ii) to third parties in
connection with the defense of a Tax Contest, including expert witnesses,
accountants and other advisors, potential witnesses and other parties whose
assistance is deemed, in the sole discretion of the Audit Management Party, to
be necessary or beneficial to representing the interests of the Parties
hereunder. 

| 
---|--- 

8.7

|

Ownership of Information 

Any Information owned by one Party or any of its Subsidiaries that is provided
to a requesting Party pursuant to this Section 8 shall be deemed to remain the
property of the providing Party. Unless specifically set forth herein or in an
Ancillary Agreement, nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed as
granting or conferring rights of license or otherwise in any such Information.
CSC shall, as soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, provide
Computer Sciences GS with access to and/or copies of such Information
consisting of spreadsheet tools and templates used for human resources
purposes (the "HR Tools"). To the extent any such HR Tools contain personally
identifiable information, CSC will use commercially reasonable efforts to
remove any such personally identifiable information from the HR Tools prior to
delivering the HR Tools to Computer Sciences GS.

| 
---|--- 

8.8

|

Other Agreements 

The rights and obligations granted under this Section 8 are subject to any
specific rights, obligations, limitations, qualifications or additional
provisions on the sharing, exchange or confidential treatment of Information
set forth in any Ancillary Agreement.

|

DISPUTE RESOLUTION 

| 
---|--- 

9.1

|

Negotiation 

In the event of a controversy, dispute or claim arising out of, in connection
with, or in relation to the interpretation, performance, nonperformance,
validity or breach of this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements or otherwise
arising out of, or in any way related to, this Agreement or the Ancillary
Agreements or the transactions contemplated hereby, including any claim based
on contract, tort, statute or constitution (collectively, "Disputes"), the
general counsels of the Parties (or such other individuals designated by the
respective general counsels) and/or the executive officers designated by the
Parties, shall negotiate for a reasonable period of time to settle such
Dispute; provided that such reasonable period shall not, unless otherwise
agreed by the Parties in writing, exceed forty-five (45) days from the time of
receipt by a Party of written notice of such Agreement Dispute ("Dispute
Notice"); provided, further, that in the event of any arbitration in
accordance with Section 9.3 hereof, the Parties shall not assert the defenses
of statute of limitations and laches arising during the period beginning after
the date of receipt of the Dispute Notice, and any contractual time period or
deadline under this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement to which such Dispute
relates occurring after the Dispute Notice is received shall not be deemed to
have passed until such Dispute has been resolved.

| 
---|--- 

9.2

|

Mediation 

If, within forty-five (45) days after receipt by a Party of a Dispute Notice,
the Parties have not succeeded in negotiating a resolution of the Dispute, the
Parties may mutually agree to submit the Dispute at the earliest possible date
to mediation conducted in accordance with the Mediation Procedure of the
International Institute for Conflict Prevention and Resolution ("CPR"), with
each Party to bear equally the costs of the mediation; provided, however, that
each Party shall bear its own attorneys' fees and expenses and other costs in
connection with such mediation. If mediation has been so agreed, the parties
agree to participate in good faith in the mediation and negotiations related
thereto for a period of thirty (30) days or such longer period as they may
mutually agree following the initial mediation session (the "Mediation
Period").

| 
---|--- 

9.3

|

Arbitration 

If the Parties do not elect to submit the Dispute to mediation in accordance
with Section 9.2 or the Dispute has not been resolved for any reason after the
Mediation Period, such Dispute shall be determined, at the request of any
relevant Party, by arbitration conducted in Virginia, before and in accordance
with the then-existing Rules for Non-Administered Arbitration of the CPR,
except as modified herein (the "Rules"). There shall be three arbitrators, one
of which shall be designated by each Party and the third of which shall be
selected by the two so designated, which two shall be appointed by the Parties
within twenty (20) days of receipt by respondent of a copy of the demand for
arbitration and which third arbitrator shall be selected within fifteen (15)
days thereafter. If the arbitrators are not timely appointed by the Parties
(or by the selected arbitrators) under this Section 9.3, he or she shall be
appointed by the CPR in accordance with the Rules, and in any such procedure,
each Party shall be given two strikes, excluding strikes for cause. Any
controversy concerning whether an Dispute is an arbitrable Dispute, whether
arbitration has been waived, whether an assignee of this Agreement is bound to
arbitrate, or as to the interpretation, validity or enforceability of this
Section 9 shall be determined by the arbitrator. In resolving any Dispute, the
Parties intend that the arbitrator shall apply the substantive Laws of the
State of New York, without regard to any choice of law principles thereof that
would mandate the application of the laws of another jurisdiction. The Parties
intend that the provisions to arbitrate set forth herein be valid, enforceable
and irrevocable, and any award rendered by the arbitrator shall be final and
binding on the Parties. The Parties agree to comply and cause the members of
their applicable Group to comply with any award made in any such arbitration
proceedings and agree to enforcement of or entry of judgment upon such award,
in any court of competent jurisdiction, including the Virginia Courts (as
defined in Section 11.18). The arbitrator shall be entitled, if appropriate,
to award any remedy in such proceedings, including monetary damages, specific
performance and all other forms of legal and equitable relief; provided,
however, the arbitrator shall not be entitled to award special, consequential,
reputational, indirect or punitive damages unless in connection with
indemnification for a Third Party Claim (and in such a case, only to the
extent awarded in such Third Party Claim).

9.4

|

Arbitration Period 

Any arbitration proceeding shall be concluded in a maximum of six (6) months
from the commencement of the arbitration or such other period as the
arbitrator together with the Parties involved in such proceeding shall deem
reasonable.

9.5

Treatment of Negotiations, Mediation and Arbitration 

Without limiting the provisions of the Rules, unless otherwise agreed in
writing by the Parties or permitted by this Agreement, the Parties shall keep,
and shall cause the members of their applicable Group to keep, confidential
all matters relating to and any negotiation, mediation, conference or
discussion or otherwise pursuant to this Section 9, all of which shall be
treated as compromise and settlement negotiations for purposes of Rule 408 of
the Federal Rules of Evidence and comparable state rules; provided that such
matters may be disclosed (i) to the extent reasonably necessary in any
proceeding ancillary to an arbitration hereunder, including to enforce the
award or for entry of a judgment upon the award and (ii) to the extent
otherwise required by Law or the rules of any stock exchange on which a
Party's securities may be listed. Nothing said or disclosed, nor any document
produced, in the course of any negotiations, conferences and discussions that
is not otherwise independently discoverable shall be offered or received as
evidence or used for impeachment or for any other purpose in any current or
future arbitration. Nothing contained herein is intended to or shall be
construed to prevent a Party from applying to any court of competent
jurisdiction for interim measures or other provisional relief in 

connection with the subject matter of any Disputes. Without prejudice to such
provisional remedies as may be available under the jurisdiction of a court,
the arbitral tribunal shall have full authority to grant provisional remedies
and to direct the parties to request that any court modify or vacate any
temporary or preliminary relief issued by such court, and to award damages for
the failure of a Party to respect the arbitral tribunal's orders to that
effect.

| 
---|--- 

9.6

|

Continuity of Service and Performance 

Unless otherwise agreed in writing, the Parties shall continue to provide
service and honor all other commitments under this Agreement and each
Ancillary Agreement during the course of dispute resolution pursuant to the
provisions of this Section 9 with respect to all matters not subject to such
dispute resolution.

| 
---|--- 

9.7

|

Consolidation 

The arbitrator may consolidate an arbitration under this Agreement with any
arbitration arising under or relating to the Ancillary Agreements or any other
agreement between the parties entered into pursuant hereto, as the case may
be, if the subject of the Disputes thereunder arises out of or relates
essentially to the same set of facts or transactions. Such consolidated
arbitration shall be determined by the arbitrator appointed for the
arbitration proceeding that was commenced first in time.

|

Subject to Section 10.2, the Computer Sciences GS Assets shall include any and

asserted claim, specifically including rights of indemnity and the right to be
defended by or at the expense of the insurer and the right to any applicable

available to such Party. 
| 
---|--- 

10.4

Severability 

In the event any one or more of the provisions contained in this Agreement
should be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, the validity,
legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions contained herein and
therein shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby. The Parties
shall endeavor in good-faith negotiations to replace the invalid, illegal or
unenforceable provisions with valid provisions, the economic effect of which
comes as close as possible to that of the invalid, illegal or unenforceable
provisions.

| 
---|--- 

11.21

|

Force Majeure 

No Party (or any Person acting on its behalf) shall have any liability or
responsibility for failure to fulfill any obligation (other than a payment
obligation) under this Agreement or, unless otherwise expressly provided
therein, any Ancillary Agreement, so long as and to the extent to which the
fulfillment of such obligation is prevented, frustrated, hindered or delayed
as a consequence of circumstances of Force Majeure. A Party claiming the
benefit of this provision shall, as soon as reasonably practicable after the 

occurrence of any such event: (a) notify the other applicable Parties of the
nature and extent of any such Force Majeure condition and (b) use due

Nothing in this Agreement is intended to confer to or impose upon any Party a
duplicative right, entitlement, obligation or recovery with respect to any
matter arising out of the same facts and circumstances.

| 
---|--- 

11.24

|

Tax Treatment of Payments 

Unless otherwise required by a Final Determination, this Agreement or the Tax
Matters Agreement or otherwise agreed to between the Parties, for U.S. federal
Tax purposes, any payment made pursuant to this Agreement (other than any
payment of interest pursuant to Section 11.11) by: (a) Computer Sciences GS to
CSC shall be treated for all Tax purposes as a distribution by Computer
Sciences GS to CSC with respect to stock of Computer Sciences GS occurring
after Computer Sciences GS is directly owned by CSC and immediately before the
applicable Distribution; or (b) CSC to Computer Sciences GS shall be treated
for all Tax purposes as a tax-free contribution by CSC to Computer Sciences GS
with respect to its stock occurring after Computer Sciences GS is directly
owned by CSC and immediately before the Distribution; and in each case, no
Party shall take any position inconsistent with such treatment. In the event
that a Taxing Authority (as defined in the Tax Matters Agreement) asserts that
a Party's treatment of a payment pursuant to this Agreement should be other
than as required pursuant to this Agreement (ignoring any potential
inconsistent or adverse Final Determination), such Party shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to contest such challenge.

| 
---|--- 

11.25

|

No Waiver 

No failure to exercise and no delay in exercising, on the part of any Party,
any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder or under the other Ancillary
Agreements shall operate as a waiver hereof or thereof; nor shall any single
or partial exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder or
thereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of
any other right, remedy, power or privilege.

---|--- 

11.26

|

No Admission of Liability 

The allocation of Assets and Liabilities herein (including on the Schedules
hereto) is solely for the purpose of allocating such Assets and Liabilities
between CSC and Computer Sciences GS and is not intended as an admission of
liability or responsibility for any alleged Liabilities vis-a-vis any third
party, including with respect to the Liabilities of any non-wholly owned
subsidiary of CSC or Computer Sciences GS.

until in the judgment of the administrator of the applicable plan or program
such action is consistent with all applicable Laws, including federal
securities Laws. Any period of exercisability will not be extended on account
of a period during which such an award is not exercisable pursuant to the
preceding sentence.

Transitional Matters Under Computer Sciences GS Welfare Plans 

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

Treatment of Claims Incurred 

| 
---|--- 

(i)

|

Liability for Claims. With respect to unpaid covered claims incurred on or
prior to the Effective Time by any Computer Sciences GS Welfare Plan
Participant under any CSC Welfare Plans, including claims that are self-
insured and claims that are fully insured through third-party insurance, CSC
shall retain and be responsible for the payment for such claims or shall cause
such CSC Welfare Plans to fully perform, pay and discharge all such claims, as
the case may be. No Computer Sciences GS Entity shall be responsible for any
Liability with respect to any such claims. 
| 
---|--- 

(ii)

|

Claims Incurred. For purposes of this Section 7.2(a), a claim or expense is
deemed to be incurred (A) with respect to medical (including continuous
hospitalization), dental, vision and/or prescription drug benefits, upon the
rendering of health services giving rise to such claim or expense; (B) with
respect to life insurance, accidental death and dismemberment and business
travel accident insurance, upon the occurrence of the event giving rise to
such claim or expense; and (C) with respect to short-term and long-term
disability benefits, upon the date of an individual's disability, as
determined by the disability benefit insurance carrier or claim administrator,
giving rise to such claim or expense. 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

Credit for Deductibles and Other Limits. With respect to each Computer
Sciences GS Welfare Plan Participant, the Computer Sciences GS Welfare Plans
will give credit for the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs for any
amount paid, number of services obtained or provider visits by such Computer
Sciences GS Welfare Plan Participant toward deductibles, out- of-pocket
maximums, limits on number of services or visits, or other similar limitations
to the extent such amounts are taken into account under the comparable CSC
Welfare Plan. 

| 
---|--- 

(c)

|

COBRA. CSC and its Subsidiaries will be liable for all requirements under
COBRA with respect to all Computer Sciences GS Group Employees (and their
qualifying beneficiaries) who, as of the day prior to the Effective Time, were
covered under a CSC Benefit Plan pursuant to COBRA or who have a COBRA
qualifying event (as defined in Section 4980B of the Code) that had occurred
prior to and including the Effective Time. Computer Sciences GS shall be
liable for all requirements under COBRA with respect to any COBRA qualifying
event occurring after the Effective Time with respect to Computer Sciences GS
Employees (and their qualifying beneficiaries). 

| 
---|--- 

7.3

|

Continuity of Benefits 

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

Additional Details Regarding Flexible Spending Accounts. To the extent any
Computer Sciences GS Welfare Plan provides or constitutes a health care
flexible spending account or dependent care flexible spending account (each a
"Computer Sciences GS FSA"), such Computer Sciences GS Welfare Plan shall be
effective as of the Effective Time. 

| 
---|--- 

(i)

|

It is the intention of the Parties that all activity under a Computer Sciences
GS Welfare Plan Participant's flexible spending account with CSC for the plan
year in which the Effective Time occurs be treated instead as activity under
the corresponding Computer Sciences GS FSA. Accordingly, (i) any period of
participation by a Computer Sciences GS Welfare Plan Participant in a CSC
flexible spending account during the plan year in which the Effective Time
occurs (the "FSA Participation Period") will be deemed a period when the
Computer Sciences GS Welfare Plan Participant participated in the
corresponding Computer Sciences GS FSA; (ii) all expenses incurred during the
FSA Participation Period will be deemed incurred while the Computer Sciences
GS Welfare Plan Participant's coverage was in effect under the corresponding
Computer Sciences GS FSA; and (iii) all elections and reimbursements made with
respect to an FSA Participation Period under a CSC flexible spending account
will be deemed to have been made with respect to the corresponding Computer
Sciences GS FSA. 

| 
---|--- 

(ii)

|

If the aggregate reimbursement payouts made to Computer Sciences GS Welfare
Plan Participants prior to the Effective Time from the applicable CSC Welfare
Plan flexible spending accounts during the plan year in which the Effective
Time occurs are less than the aggregate accumulated contributions to such
accounts made by such Computer Sciences GS Welfare Plan Participants 

prior to the Effective Time for such plan year, CSC shall cause an amount
equal to the amount by which such contributions are in excess of such
reimbursement payouts to be transferred to Computer Sciences GS (or a Computer
Sciences GS Entity designated by Computer Sciences GS) by wire transfer of
immediately available funds as soon as practicable, but in no event later than
45 days, following the Effective Time.

| 
---|--- 

(iii)

|

If the aggregate reimbursement payouts made to Computer Sciences GS Welfare
Plan Participants prior to the Effective Time from the applicable CSC Welfare
Plan flexible spending accounts during the plan year in which the Effective
Time occurs exceed the aggregate accumulated contributions to such accounts
made by the Computer Sciences GS Welfare Plan Participants prior to the
Effective Time for such plan year, Computer Sciences GS shall cause an amount
equal to the amount by which such reimbursement payouts are in excess of such
contributions to be transferred to CSC (or a CSC Group Entity designated by
CSC) by wire transfer of immediately available funds as soon as practicable,
but in no event later than 45 days, following the Effective Time. 

| 
---|--- 

(iv)

|

Notwithstanding anything in this Section 7.3(a), at and after the Effective
Time, the Computer Sciences GS Group shall assume, and cause the Computer
Sciences GS Welfare Plans to be solely responsible for, all claims by Computer
Sciences GS Welfare Plan Participants under the applicable CSC Welfare Plan
flexible spending accounts that were incurred in the plan year in which the
Distribution occurs, whether incurred prior to, on, or after the Effective
Time, that have not been paid in full as of the Effective Time. 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

Additional Details Regarding Health Savings Accounts. To the extent that any
Computer Sciences GS Welfare Plan provides or constitutes a health savings
account (each a "Computer Sciences GS HSA"), such Computer Sciences GS Welfare
Plan shall be effective as of the Effective Time. It is the intention of the
Parties that all activity under a Computer Sciences GS Welfare Plan
Participant's health savings account with CSC for the year in which the
Distribution occurs be treated instead as activity under the corresponding
Computer Sciences GS HSA. Accordingly, (i) any period of participation by a
Computer Sciences GS Welfare Plan Participant in a CSC health savings account
during the year in which the Effective Time occurs (the "HSA Participation
Period") will be deemed a period when the Computer Sciences GS Welfare Plan
Participant participated in the corresponding Computer Sciences GS HSA; (ii)
all expenses incurred during the HSA Participation Period will be deemed
incurred while the Computer Sciences GS Welfare Plan Participant's coverage
was in effect under the corresponding Computer Sciences GS HSA; and (iii) all
elections and reimbursements made with respect to an HSA Participation Period
under a CSC health savings account will be deemed to have been made with
respect to the corresponding Computer Sciences GS HSA. 

| 
---|--- 

(c)

|

Waiver of Conditions or Restrictions. Unless prohibited by applicable Law, the
Computer Sciences GS Welfare Plans will waive all limitations as to
preexisting conditions, exclusions, service conditions, waiting period
limitations or evidence of insurability requirements that would otherwise be
applicable to the Computer Sciences GS Welfare Plan Participant following the
Effective Time to the extent that such Employee had previously satisfied such
limitation under the corresponding CSC Welfare Plan. 

| 
---|--- 

7.4

|

Insurance Contracts 

To the extent any CSC Welfare Plan is funded through the purchase of an
insurance contract or is subject to any stop loss contract, CSC and Computer
Sciences GS will cooperate and use their commercially 

reasonable efforts to replicate such insurance contracts for Computer Sciences
GS (except to the extent changes are required under applicable state insurance
Laws or filings by the respective insurers) and to maintain any pricing
discounts or other preferential terms for both CSC and Computer Sciences GS
for a reasonable term. Neither Party shall be liable for failure to obtain
such insurance contracts, pricing discounts, or other preferential terms for
the other Party. Each Party shall be responsible for any additional premiums,
charges, or administrative fees that such Party may incur pursuant to this
Section 7.4.

| 
---|--- 

7.5

|

Third-Party Vendors 

Except as provided below, to the extent any CSC Welfare Plan is administered
by a third-party vendor, CSC and Computer Sciences GS will cooperate and use
their commercially reasonable efforts to replicate any contract with such
third-party vendor for Computer Sciences GS and to maintain any pricing
discounts or other preferential terms for both CSC and Computer Sciences GS
for a reasonable term. Neither Party shall be liable for failure to obtain
such pricing discounts or other preferential terms for the other Party. Each
Party shall be responsible for any additional premiums, charges, or
administrative fees that such Party may incur pursuant to this Section 7.5.

so broad as is enforceable.

the Master Separation and Distribution Agreement.

| 
---|--- 

11.16

|

(b)

|

The Trademarks License to use the specific marks: (i) COMPUTER SCIENCES
GOVERNMENT SERVICES and (ii) COMPUTER SCIENCES GS includes the right to use
such marks as and as part of a corporate or entity name, or trade name;
provided that such corporate or entity name, or trade name, consists of the
exact phrase "COMPUTER SCIENCES GOVERNMENT SERVICES", or "COMPUTER SCIENCES

(d)

|

Computer Sciences GS may develop logos or stylized "CSGOV" marks, however,
before any public use of any such CSGOV logos commence, Computer Sciences GS
must first submit proposed drawings of such marks to CSC for CSC's written
approval. After having obtained written approval from CSC, such CSGOV logos
will become Licensed Marks under this Agreement, and as long as such CSGOV
logos are not materially altered, Computer Sciences GS may use such CSGOV
logos as long as such use otherwise complies with the terms of this Agreement.
Computer Sciences GS further agrees that CSC will own all trademark,
copyright, and other rights in such CSGOV logos, and Computer Sciences GS
hereby assigns, grants and delivers (and agrees further to assign, grant and
deliver) exclusively to CSC, all right, title and interest of every kind and
nature whatsoever in and to any such CSGOV logos, including all copyrights and
all renewals of copyrights. Computer Sciences GS further agrees, at CSC's sole
cost and expense, to execute and deliver to CSC such other and further
instruments and documents that CSC may reasonably request for the purpose of
establishing, evidencing, enforcing or defending CSC\'s right, title and
interest of every kind and nature whatsoever, including all copyrights, in and
to such CSGOV logos. 
| 
---|--- 

(e)

|

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Computer Sciences GS shall be permitted to use
any stationary, marketing and promotional material and any other materials

| 
---|--- 

(f)

|

Computer Sciences GS and Computer Sciences GS Subsidiaries may sublicense the
Licensed Marks solely in accordance with the Trademarks License to
advertisers, distributors, vendors, dealers, suppliers and other Persons,
solely for use in connection with the operation of the Computer Sciences GS
Business in a manner consistent with past practice. Computer Sciences GS shall
be responsible for any act or omission by a sublicensee or by any Computer
Sciences GS Subsidiaries that would constitute a breach of the Trademarks
License or other terms hereof, as if committed by Computer Sciences GS. 

| 
---|--- 

(g)

|

Computer Sciences GS's, Computer Sciences GS Subsidiaries' and any permitted
sublicensees' use of the Licensed Marks shall comply with relevant elements of
CSC's trademark guidelines and applicable Laws. CSC further reserves the right
to approve the quality and propriety of any goods or services using the
Licensed Marks, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed. It is the purpose of this provision to prevent uses of the
Licensed Marks in a manner that are inconsistent with CSC's high quality of
goods and services or in a manner that might be offensive to ordinary and
customary standards of exceptional service as determined by CSC, in its sole
discretion, or that could undermine or damage the reputation of CSC. Computer
Sciences GS further agrees to furnish CSC, upon request, with sample specimens
of each item bearing the Licensed Marks or pre-printed promotional literature,
video, media production, web pages, or other marketing aids which Computer
Sciences GS, Computer Sciences GS Subsidiaries, or any permitted sublicensee
proposes to use with and which incorporate the Licensed Marks. Computer
Sciences GS agrees that all advertising and promotional materials in which it
and Computer Sciences GS Subsidiaries and permitted sublicensees use the
Licensed Marks shall be truthful in all respects. CSC shall have the right to
require Computer Sciences GS, Computer Sciences GS Subsidiaries and any
permitted sublicensee to make reasonable changes to such literature or
marketing aids for the purpose of eliminating inaccuracies, to ensure
compliance with the requirements of this section or otherwise to protect the
Licensed Marks. If no objection is made by CSC within ten (10) Business Days
after its receipt of such material, CSC shall be deemed not to object to its
use or distribution. CSC shall not be deemed to endorse the accuracy of, or
assume any legal responsibility for the contents of such promotional material
or media presentations. Computer Sciences GS and Computer Sciences GS
Subsidiaries may not modify, change or alter any Licensed Mark without the
prior written consent of CSC, not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed. Computer Sciences GS agrees that it shall not, directly or
indirectly, do, omit to do, or permit to be done, any act that will or may
dilute the goodwill associated with the Licensed Marks or tarnish or bring
into disrepute the reputation of or goodwill associated with the Licensed
Marks or CSC or that will or may invalidate or jeopardize any registration of
the Licensed Marks. Computer Sciences GS and Computer Sciences GS Subsidiaries
shall not purchase Internet keywords or domain names containing the Licensed
Marks.

(h)

|

Computer Sciences GS recognizes the ownership of, and great value of the
goodwill associated with, the Licensed Marks as well as the marks COMPUTER
SCIENCES and COMPUTER SCIENCES CORPORATION. Computer Sciences GS acknowledges
that such goodwill belongs to CSC and that such Licensed Marks, as well as the
marks COMPUTER SCIENCES and COMPUTER SCIENCES CORPORATION, have inherent
and/or acquired distinctiveness and are famous marks. Nothing in this
Agreement gives Computer Sciences GS, Computer Sciences GS Subsidiaries, or
any sublicensees any right, title, or interest in the Licensed Marks, or the
mark/designation COMPUTER SCIENCES, except 

the right to use the Licensed Marks in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement. Computer Sciences GS's, Computer Sciences GS Subsidiaries', and any
sublicensees' use of the Licensed Marks shall inure to the benefit of CSC.
Computer Sciences GS, Computer Sciences GS Subsidiaries, and sublicensees,
will not, and will not cause any other Person to, seek to register any marks
for, containing, or confusingly similar to, the Licensed Marks or the mark
COMPUTER SCIENCES. Computer Sciences GS, Computer Sciences GS Subsidiaries,
and sublicensees shall not, and shall not cause any other Person to, oppose or
seek to cancel or challenge, in any forum anywhere in the world, including,
but not limited to, the United States Patent and Trademark Office, any
application or registration by CSC for the Licensed Marks, or a mark
consisting of or containing "COMPUTER SCIENCES", or any composite mark
containing a Licensed Mark as an element of such composite mark. Further,
Computer Sciences GS, Computer Sciences GS Subsidiaries, and sublicensees,
shall not, and shall not cause any other Person to, object to, or file any
action or lawsuit because of, any use by CSC of: (i) the Licensed Marks, (ii)
any composite mark containing a Licensed Mark, (iii) the mark COMPUTER
SCIENCES or any composite mark containing "COMPUTER SCIENCES", or (iv) any
company name, corporate name, trade name, keyword, or domain name consisting
of or containing any of the Licensed Marks or "COMPUTER SCIENCES", for or in
connection with any goods or services, whether such use is by CSC directly or
through CSC's licensees, CSC Subsidiaries, or CSC's authorized users; and
Computer Sciences GS, Computer Sciences GS Subsidiaries, and sublicensees will
not, and will not cause any other Person to, take any other action which may
adversely affect or contest CSC's ownership of or right to use the Licensed
Marks, any composite mark containing a Licensed Mark, or the goodwill
associated with the Licensed Marks. Other than as permitted in this Agreement,
Computer Sciences GS, Computer Sciences GS Subsidiaries, and sublicensees will
not, and will not cause any other Person to, use "COMPUTER SCIENCES" as, or as

keyword, or domain name.

| 
---|--- 

(i)

|

Computer Sciences GS, Computer Sciences GS Subsidiaries, and any sublicensees
as permitted under this Agreement, will display on materials utilizing or
displaying the Licensed Marks any notice, marking, or indicia of ownership
required by this Agreement or otherwise by CSC from time to time. Computer
Sciences GS, Computer Sciences GS Subsidiaries, and any sublicensees as
permitted under this Agreement will, in all material respects, use the
Licensed Marks in a manner reasonably calculated to prevent the Licensed Marks
from becoming generic or otherwise invalid. 

| 
---|--- 

(j)

|

Computer Sciences GS agrees to notify CSC in writing, as promptly as
reasonably practicable, of any of the following which comes to the attention
of Computer Sciences GS: (i) any adoption, use, or registration of any mark,
trade name, trading style or corporate name, domain name, or designation which
would infringe, impair or dilute, or tend to infringe, impair or dilute, the
Licensed Marks or the mark COMPUTER SCIENCES; (ii) any challenge to CSC's use,
Computer Sciences GS's use, Computer Sciences GS Subsidiaries' use, or any
sublicensees' use of any Licensed Mark; or (iii) any claim made by any Person
of any rights in any Licensed Mark or the mark COMPUTER SCIENCES. 

| 
---|--- 

(k)

|

Except as provided herein, CSC shall be responsible, at its sole discretion,
for renewing and maintaining at CSC's expense all trademark applications and
registrations for the Licensed Marks. CSC may elect, for any reason, not to
renew any applications and registrations for the Licensed Marks. In the event
CSC determines during the Initial Term that it intends to allow an application
or registration for a Licensed Mark to lapse, be cancelled or be abandoned, it
will notify Computer Sciences GS as promptly as reasonably practicable and
Computer Sciences GS shall be entitled to pursue or maintain such application
or registration in CSC's name, but at Computer Sciences GS's sole cost and
expense. Each Party agrees to 

cooperate and provide promptly, upon any request by the other Party,
appropriate samples and specimens of CSC's, Computer Sciences GS's, and
Computer Sciences GS Subsidiaries', and any authorized sublicensees' use of

using such Licensed Mark and (ii) the manner in which such Licensed Mark is
being used in such jurisdiction. 

| 
---|--- 

(m)

|

CSC may elect at any time, at its sole discretion and for any reason, to
change, alter, or replace the trademarks and service marks that CSC directs to
be used as the names of its Licensed Products or Licensed Methodologies. The
changed/altered/replaced trademarks and service marks (the "New Marks")
directed by CSC to be used as the new names of the Licensed Products or
Licensed Methodologies will become Licensed Marks under this Agreement,
immediately upon receipt by Computer Sciences GS of written notification by
CSC of any New Marks. Upon receipt by Computer Sciences GS of written notice
of any New Marks, Computer Sciences GS agrees to, and agrees to cause all
Computer Sciences GS Subsidiaries and sublicensees to, change over within
ninety (90) days on all web pages, marketing materials, promotional items,
advertising, documents, files, and other materials to the use of the New Marks
instead of the former Licensed Marks being used for such Licensed Products or
Licensed Methodologies. 

| 
---|--- 

(n)

|

Nothing in this Agreement shall constitute any representation or warranty by
CSC that any Licensed Mark is valid or that the exercise by Computer Sciences
GS, any Computer Sciences GS Subsidiary, or any permitted sublicensee of any
rights granted under this Agreement with respect to any Licensed Mark will not
infringe the Intellectual Property Rights of any Person.

---|--- 

2.6

|

Preservation of Ownership of Proprietary Rights 

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

All rights not specifically granted to Computer Sciences GS herein are hereby
retained by CSC. There are no implied licenses to any of the CSC Proprietary
Items (or to any right, title or interest therein or part, portion or aspect
thereof). Computer Sciences GS covenants to take no action or commit any
omission that would reasonably be expected to be adverse to CSC's sole and
exclusive ownership of all right, title and interest in and to the CSC
Proprietary Items and shall not (i) apply to register or cooperate in any
effort by any Third Party to register any right, title or interest in or to
any CSC Proprietary Items anywhere in the world in connection with any
products or services; (ii) challenge or participate in any challenge of CSC's
rights in the CSC Proprietary Items; or (iii) do anything else inconsistent
with CSC's rights in the CSC Proprietary Items. If, contrary to the intent of
the Parties, it should occur that Computer 

Sciences GS has any rights of ownership in the CSC Proprietary Items, Computer
Sciences GS hereby agrees, at any time upon the written request of CSC, to
assign and to sell for ten dollars (US$10.00) to CSC any and all such rights
of ownership as well as the entire right, title and interest to any such right
(including any attendant goodwill). Computer Sciences GS shall promptly upon
request by CSC execute, without additional consideration, any assignment or
other document that may be reasonably necessary or appropriate for CSC to
purchase, take assignment or perfect its ownership interest or to memorialize,

and interest in and to any CSC Proprietary Items.

| 
---|--- 

2.7

|

Enforcement Actions 

Computer Sciences GS agrees to notify CSC in writing, as promptly as
reasonably practicable, of any actual or alleged infringement, challenge,
misappropriation, claim, impairment or violation of any Intellectual Property
Rights relating to the Licensed Products, Licensed Methodologies, Licensed
Know-How or Licensed Marks that comes to the attention of Computer Sciences
GS. CSC shall have sole and exclusive authority and discretion to take such
action as it deems appropriate and control any dispute, claim, litigation,
United States Patent and Trademark Office or other U.S. or foreign
governmental or administrative proceeding, or other action arising out of any
actual or alleged infringement, challenge, misappropriation, claim, impairment
or violation of any Intellectual Property Rights relating to the CSC
Proprietary Items and including any brought by a Third Party (an "Enforcement
Action"). Unless the Parties otherwise agree, all costs and expenses related
to an Enforcement Action shall be borne by CSC, and CSC shall be entitled to
all monetary damages, fines, settlement payments, costs, attorneys' fees, and
other amounts ("Recoveries") awarded to CSC as a direct result of an
Enforcement Action. Computer Sciences GS shall, and if requested by CSC cause
Computer Sciences GS Subsidiaries and any sublicensees to, at CSC's expense,
cooperate fully and promptly with CSC with respect to such Enforcement Action,
in such manner and to such extent as CSC may reasonably request, including
joining such Enforcement Action as a party. Nothing herein shall be construed
as requiring CSC to take any action to bring or defend any Enforcement Action
or to indemnify or hold harmless Computer Sciences GS, Computer Sciences GS
Subsidiaries, or any sublicensees in connection therewith. During the Initial
Term, in the event CSC provides written notice or confirmation to Computer
Sciences GS that it determines not to bring an Enforcement Action, Computer
Sciences GS may, with the prior written consent of CSC (which consent may be
withheld by CSC for any reason in its sole discretion), bring an Enforcement
Action with respect to any violation of the Licensed Products, Licensed
Methodologies, Licensed Know-How or Licensed Marks that Computer Sciences GS
reasonably believes would have a material and adverse effect on its business;
provided, however, that Computer Sciences GS shall not compromise or settle
any Enforcement Action without the prior written consent of CSC; provided,
further that Computer Sciences GS shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless
(at Computer Sciences GS's sole cost and expense) CSC for any losses of CSC
arising from or relating to such Enforcement Action brought by Computer
Sciences GS without CSC's prior written consent, including, for the avoidance
of doubt, any losses arising from any counterclaim to such Enforcement Action.
Unless the Parties otherwise agree, all costs and expenses related to an
Enforcement Action brought by Computer Sciences GS shall be borne by Computer
Sciences GS and any Recoveries awarded to Computer Sciences GS as a direct
result of an Enforcement Action brought by Computer Sciences GS shall belong
to Computer Sciences GS. CSC shall, if reasonably requested by Computer
Sciences GS and at Computer Sciences GS' expense, provide and cause its
Affiliates to provide reasonable cooperation with respect to any such
Enforcement Action. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing herein shall be
construed as requiring CSC to join as a party any Enforcement Action brought
by Computer Sciences GS.

|

Sole Remedy; Indemnification Procedures 

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

If any Improvement for which CSC has an indemnification obligation under
Section 8.1 becomes, or in CSC's reasonable opinion is likely to become, the
subject of any U.S. copyright, trademark or trade secret infringement or
misappropriation claim or proceeding, CSC will, in addition to indemnifying
Computer Sciences GS as provided in Section 8.1, promptly take the following
actions, at no additional charge to Computer Sciences GS, in the listed order
of priority: (i) secure the right to continue using the item or (ii) replace
or modify the item to make it non-infringing. If neither of such actions can
be accomplished by CSC using commercially reasonable efforts, and only in such
event, CSC will remove the applicable Improvements and, in full satisfaction
of CSC's obligations with respect to this Section 8.3(a), the applicable Fees
will be equitably adjusted to reflect such removal. THIS SECTION 8.3 AND
SECTION 8.1 STATE THE ENTIRE LIABILITY AND OBLIGATIONS OF CSC AND THE
EXCLUSIVE REMEDY OF COMPUTER SCIENCES GS, ITS AFFILIATES, SUCCESSORS AND
ASSIGNS WITH RESPECT TO ANY VIOLATION OR INFRINGEMENT OF ANY INTELLECTUAL
PROPERTY RIGHTS BY THE LICENSED PRODUCTS AND THE SUPPORT SERVICES OR ANY PART
THEREOF.

All indemnification procedures shall be governed by Section 7.4 of the Master
Separation and Distribution Agreement. 

|

any of its Subsidiaries and that the other Party shall, in addition to any
other rights it may have at Law or in equity, be entitled to equitable relief,
including injunction and specific performance, as a remedy for any breach (and

otherwise and whether predicated on common Law, statute or otherwise) shall in
all respects be governed by and construed in accordance with the Laws of the

injunctive or other equitable relief of its rights under this Agreement, in
addition to any and all other rights and remedies at Law or in equity, and all
such rights and remedies shall be cumulative. The Parties agree that, from and
after the Effective Date, the remedies at Law for any breach or threatened
breach of this Agreement, including monetary damages, are inadequate

ASSIGNMENT; SUCCESORS AND ASIGNS 

This Agreement shall not be assignable, in whole or in part, directly or

not in any way be affected or impaired thereby. The Parties shall endeavor in
good-faith negotiations to replace the invalid, illegal or unenforceable
provisions with valid provisions, the economic effect of which comes as close
as possible to that of the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provisions.

| 
---|--- 

13.

|

GOVERNING LAW; JURISDICTION 

This Agreement (and any claims or disputes arising out of or related thereto
or to the transactions contemplated thereby or to the inducement of any Party

and Distribution Agreement, each of the Parties irrevocably submits to the
exclusive jurisdiction of (a) the Fairfax County Circuit Court and any appeals
courts thereof or (b) the United States District Court for the Eastern

exclusive jurisdiction of the Virginia Courts for the enforcement of any award
issued thereunder. Each of the Parties further agrees that service of any
process, summons, notice or document by U.S. registered mail to such Party's
respective address set forth in Section 11.6 of the Master Separation and
Distribution Agreement shall be effective service of process for any action,
suit or proceeding in the Virginia Courts with respect to any matters to which
it has submitted to jurisdiction in this Section 6.6. Each of the Parties
irrevocably and unconditionally waives any objection to the laying of venue of
any action, suit or proceeding arising out of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby in the Virginia Courts, and hereby further
irrevocably and unconditionally waives and agrees not to plead or claim in any
such court that any such action, suit or proceeding brought in any such court
has been brought in an inconvenient forum.

| 
---|--- 

14.

|

WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL 

EACH OF THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVES TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY WITH RESPECT TO ANY
LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH
THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT. EACH OF THE
PARTIES HEREBY (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY
OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY
WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER
AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT AND
THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT, 

AS APPLICABLE, BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS
IN THIS SECTION 14.

FORCE MAJEURE

responsibility for failure to fulfill any obligation (other than a payment
obligation) under this Agreement, so long as and to the extent to which the

a consequence of circumstances of Force Majeure. A Party claiming the benefit
of this provision shall, as soon as reasonably practicable after the
occurrence of any such event: (a) notify the other applicable Parties of the
nature and extent of any such Force Majeure condition and (b) use due
diligence to remove any such causes and resume performance under this
Agreement as soon as feasible.

accept, all of CSC's or its Subsidiary's rights, title and interests in and to
the Owned Real Properties, subject to the other provisions of this Agreement
and (to the extent not inconsistent with the provisions of this Agreement) the
terms of the Master Separation and Distribution Agreement and the other
Ancillary Agreements. The Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
effect such conveyance or Transfer prior to the Distribution Date or as soon
as practicable thereafter.

| 
---|---

provisions of this Agreement and (to the extent not inconsistent with the
provisions of this Agreement) the terms of the Master Separation and
Distribution Agreement and the other Ancillary Agreements. The Parties shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to effect such Transfer prior to the
Distribution Date or as soon as practicable thereafter.

| 
---|--- 

2.3

|

Lease Consents 

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

CSC has provided or plans to provide prior to the Distribution Date any notice
required to be delivered under each Lease Requiring Notice substantially in
the form of Exhibit 2 attached hereto and has requested the Lease Consents by
written notice substantially in the form of Exhibit 3 attached hereto to the
Landlord with respect to each Lease Requiring Consent. Each such written
notice for Lease Consents requests consent with respect to: (i) the assignment
of the Lease by CSC or its applicable Subsidiary to Computer Sciences GS or
its designated Subsidiary and (ii) to the extent required under the Lease, the
change of affiliation and/or control of Computer Sciences GS that may occur in

commercially reasonable efforts to obtain such Lease Consents. 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

Computer Sciences GS shall cooperate as reasonably requested by CSC to obtain
the Lease Consents. Neither CSC nor any of its Subsidiaries shall have any
liability to Computer Sciences GS or any of its Subsidiaries arising out of,
or relating to, the failure to obtain any Lease Consents or any default, loss
of any rights or acceleration of any obligations under, or any termination of,
any Lease Requiring Consent as a result of any failure to obtain any Lease
Consents. If and to the extent that a Lease Requiring Consent 

provides the applicable Landlord the opportunity to recapture all or a portion
of a leased premises due to a request for a Lease Consent and such Lease
Requiring Consent permits a request to be withdrawn (or words of similar
import) upon such Landlord's election so to recapture, then, if Computer
Sciences GS so requests in writing, CSC shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to exercise such right to withdraw a request for Lease Consent.

| 
---|--- 

(c)

|

Computer Sciences GS shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to satisfy
promptly, or cause its applicable Subsidiaries to use their commercially
reasonable efforts to satisfy promptly, all of the requirements set forth in
each Lease Requiring Consent and any other lawful and reasonable requirements
of the Landlord in obtaining the Lease Consents, including, without
limitation: 

| 
---|--- 

(i)

|

if required by any Landlord with respect to any Lease Requiring Consent,
entering into an agreement with such Landlord to assume, observe and perform
the tenant's obligations under such Lease Requiring Consent during the
remainder of the term of such Lease Requiring Consent; and 

| 
---|--- 

(ii)

|

if required by any Landlord with respect to any Lease Requiring Consent,
providing, or causing another Person (other than CSC or any other member of
the CSC Group) to provide, a guarantee, surety, letter of credit, security
deposit or other security in reasonable form and amount to meet the reasonable
requirements of the Landlord with respect to the creditworthiness of Computer
Sciences GS or its designated Subsidiary. 

| 
---|--- 

2.4

|

Releases 

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

CSC and Computer Sciences GS shall use their respective commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain a Release from each Landlord with respect to each
Lease and to satisfy promptly, or cause its designated Subsidiaries to use
their commercially reasonable efforts to satisfy promptly, all of the lawful
and reasonable requirements of each Landlord in obtaining each Release;
provided, however, that neither CSC nor Computer Sciences GS shall be required
to commence or pursue any Action, nor shall CSC be required to pay any
consideration or incur any cost or otherwise offer or grant any accommodation
(financial or otherwise), to obtain any Release. 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

Without limiting the foregoing, Computer Sciences GS shall, or shall cause its
designated Subsidiaries to, use commercially reasonable efforts to satisfy
promptly, all of the lawful and reasonable requirements of each Landlord in
obtaining each Release, including, without limitation: 

| 
---|--- 

(i)

|

if required by the Landlord with respect to any Lease, entering into an
agreement with such Landlord to assume, observe and perform the tenant's
obligations under such Lease during the remainder of the term of such Lease;
and 

| 
---|--- 

(ii)

|

if required by the Landlord with respect to any Lease, providing, or causing
another Person (other than CSC or any other member of the CSC Group) to
provide, a guarantee, surety, letter of credit, security deposit or other
security in reasonable form and amount to meet the reasonable requirements of
the Landlord with respect to the creditworthiness of Computer Sciences GS or
its designated Subsidiary. 

| 
---|--- 

(c)

|

To the extent that CSC or Computer Sciences GS does not obtain a Release from
each Landlord with respect to any Lease, Computer Sciences GS shall indemnify,
defend, protect and hold harmless the CSC 

Indemnitees from and against, and shall reimburse each CSC Indemnitee for, all
Losses incurred by any CSC Indemnitee following the Distribution Date as a
result of (i) all Obligations or the failure by Computer Sciences GS or any of
its Subsidiaries to pay, perform, observe and discharge all Obligations or
(ii) Computer Sciences GS's or its applicable Subsidiary's use or occupancy of
the respective Leased Real Properties under each such Lease, including without
limitation Computer Sciences GS's or such Subsidiary's use or occupancy of any
Leased Real Property under Section 2.5 of this Agreement.

| 
---|--- 

(d)

|

Without limiting the foregoing, to the extent that Computer Sciences GS does
not obtain a Release within ninety (90) days after the Distribution Date with
respect to any Guaranteed Lease with a remaining term of more than eighteen
(18) months, CSC may require Computer Sciences GS or its applicable Subsidiary
to offer to pay to the Landlord under each such Guaranteed Lease a cash
deposit (to be refunded to Computer Sciences GS at the expiration of the
remaining term of such Guaranteed Lease) of not less than three (3) months'
rent as an inducement for such Landlord to provide a Release. 

| 
---|--- 

2.5

|

Temporary Occupancy 

In the event that the Actual Closing for any Leased Real Property does not
occur on or before the Distribution Date, CSC and Computer Sciences GS shall
use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to allow Computer
Sciences GS to occupy such Leased Real Property upon the terms and conditions
contained in the relevant Lease and until the Actual Closing for such Leased
Real Property; provided, however, that if an enforcement action or forfeiture
by the relevant Landlord due to Computer Sciences GS's or its applicable
Subsidiary's occupation of such Leased Real Property constituting a breach of
a Relevant Lease cannot, in the reasonable opinion of CSC, be avoided other
than by requiring Computer Sciences GS or its applicable Subsidiary to
promptly vacate the relevant Leased Real Property, CSC may, by notice to
Computer Sciences GS, promptly require Computer Sciences GS or its applicable
Subsidiary to vacate the relevant Leased Real Property on not less than ten
(10) days prior written notice. Computer Sciences GS will be responsible for
all Losses incurred by CSC or any of its Subsidiaries as a consequence of such
occupation. Neither Computer Sciences GS nor its applicable Subsidiary shall
be entitled to make any claim or demand against, or obtain reimbursement from,
CSC or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to any Losses incurred by Computer
Sciences GS or its applicable Subsidiary as a consequence of being obliged to
vacate the Leased Real Property or in obtaining alternative premises,
including, without limitation, any Action or forfeiture which a Landlord may
take against Computer Sciences GS or its applicable Subsidiary.

| 
---|--- 

2.6

|

Performance of Leases 

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

Following the Distribution Date, whether or not (i) the Actual Closing with
respect to any Leased Real Property has occurred, (ii) Computer Sciences GS or
its applicable Subsidiary occupies such Leased Real Property under Section 2.5
of this Agreement or subleases such Leased Real Property under Section 2.7 of
this Agreement or (iii) Computer Sciences GS or its applicable Subsidiary is
required to vacate such Leased Real Property under Section 2.5 of this
Agreement, Computer Sciences GS shall pay, perform, observe and discharge
promptly when due, or cause its applicable Subsidiary to pay, perform, observe
and discharge promptly when due, all Obligations under the Lease of such
Leased Real Property; provided, however, that if, prior to an Actual Closing,
a Landlord refuses to accept direct payment, performance, observation or other
discharge of Obligations by Computer Sciences GS or its applicable Subsidiary,
then CSC, at Computer Sciences GS's or its applicable Subsidiary's request,
shall make such payment, performance, observation or otherwise discharge such
Obligations until such Actual Closing, subject to CSC's receipt of payment
from Computer Sciences GS or its applicable Subsidiary of all rent and other 

amounts payable under the applicable Lease prior to payment by CSC to the
Landlord; and provided, further, that if Computer Sciences GS or its
applicable Subsidiary is required to vacate such Leased Real Property under
Section 2.5 of this Agreement, Computer Sciences GS or its applicable
Subsidiary shall pay to (if a Landlord refuses to accept direct payment,
performance, observation or other discharge of Obligations by Computer
Sciences GS or its applicable Subsidiary), or be entitled to be reimbursed by
(if a Landlord otherwise accepts direct payment, performance, observation or
other discharge of Obligations by Computer Sciences GS or its applicable
Subsidiary), CSC or its designated Subsidiary monthly in advance fifty percent
(50%) of the rent and other amounts payable under the applicable Lease for the
remainder of the term of such Lease.

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

Upon (i) the Actual Closing with respect to any Guaranteed Property or (ii)
the commencement of Computer Sciences GS's or its applicable Subsidiary's
occupancy of any Leased Real Property under Section 2.5 of this Agreement or
sublease of any Leased Real Property under Section 2.7 of this Agreement,
Computer Sciences GS and each of its applicable Subsidiaries shall obtain and
maintain all insurance, in such amounts and with such coverage, terms and
conditions, as the tenant is required to maintain under each such Lease;
provided, however, if, prior to an Actual Closing, a Landlord refuses to
accept Computer Sciences GS's performance of the insurance requirements of any
Lease or Computer Sciences GS's insurer does not recognize an insurable
interest on behalf of Computer Sciences GS, then CSC at Computer Sciences GS's
request shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and maintain
insurance policies until such Actual Closing, in such amounts and with such
coverage, terms and conditions, as the tenant is required to maintain under
such Lease, subject to (i) CSC's receipt of payment from Computer Sciences GS
of all premiums and other amounts owing with respect to such policies prior to
payment by CSC to the carriers and (ii) indemnification from Computer Sciences
GS against any Losses which any CSC Indemnitee may suffer under or in
connection with such arrangements. Computer Sciences GS and each of its
applicable Subsidiaries shall maintain such insurance for so long as CSC
retains any Obligations with regard to the Properties or Leases subject to
such insurance. Each of CSC and Computer Sciences GS (each, an "Obtaining
Party") shall, when obtaining insurance pursuant to this Agreement, use
commercially reasonable efforts to provide that coverage under such insurance
shall not expire or be terminated or materially modified without such insurer
endeavoring to provide written notice to the other Party at least thirty (30)
days in advance of such expiration, termination or modification. All policies
of commercial general liability insurance obtained by an Obtaining Party (or
any Subsidiary of such Obtaining Party) shall designate the other Party and,
as applicable, the other members of the CSC Group or the appropriate
Subsidiary of Computer Sciences GS, as additional insureds. On or before each
such Actual Closing or the commencement of any such occupancy or sublease, and
thereafter at least thirty (30) days before the expiration of any such
insurance or within ten (10) days after receiving a written request from the
other Party, the Obtaining Party shall deliver certificates from the issuers
of all such insurance evidencing full compliance with this Section 2.6(b),
together with evidence of the payment of any premiums due on account of such
insurance. 

| 
---|--- 

(c)

|

CSC shall use commercially reasonable efforts to promptly deliver to Computer
Sciences GS or its applicable Subsidiary copies of all invoices, demands,
notices and other communications received by CSC or its applicable Subsidiary
or agents in connection with any of the Leased Real Properties or the Leases
and shall, at Computer Sciences GS's cost and upon Computer Sciences GS's
reasonable request, use commercially reasonable efforts to give notices and
otherwise communicate on behalf of Computer Sciences GS or its applicable
Subsidiary with respect to matters relating to any Lease or Leased Real
Property. Computer Sciences GS shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
promptly deliver to CSC copies of all demands, notices and other
communications received by Computer Sciences GS or its 

applicable Subsidiary or agents that allege any breach or default of any
Lease, which breach or default could reasonably be expected to result in CSC
or any of its Subsidiaries incurring any Liabilities under such Lease or
relating to the applicable Leased Real Property.

| 
---|--- 

2.7

|

Alternative Sublease 

If, at any time, the relevant Lease Consent is expressly refused or if CSC
does not reasonably expect to obtain such Lease Consent, CSC shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to sublease (using an instrument substantially
in the form of Exhibit 4 attached to this Agreement) all of the relevant
Leased Real Property utilized by Computer Sciences GS or its applicable
Subsidiary to Computer Sciences GS or such Subsidiary for the remainder of the
term of the Lease (or, if required by Landlord, for a period equal to
substantially all of the remainder of the term of such Lease). CSC shall apply
to the relevant Landlord for the Lease Consent with respect to such sublease,
and, on the grant of such Lease Consent, CSC shall sublease or cause its
applicable Subsidiary to sublease to Computer Sciences GS or its applicable
Subsidiary the relevant Leased Real Property for the remainder of the term of
the Lease Requiring Consent, at a rent equal to the rent from time to time
under the Lease Requiring Consent, but otherwise on substantially the same
terms and conditions as the Lease Requiring Consent, except to the extent
inconsistent with this Agreement and except that CSC shall have no obligation
to perform any obligations of such Landlord under such Lease. The sublease
shall provide that (i) CSC shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
enforce such Lease for the benefit of Computer Sciences GS or its applicable
Subsidiary, at Computer Sciences GS's or its applicable Subsidiary's sole cost
and expense, (ii) CSC shall not terminate or otherwise amend such Lease so as
to materially adversely affect such subleased premises or Computer Sciences
GS's or its applicable Subsidiary's rights thereunder; and (iii) subject to
Section 2.13 of this Agreement, CSC shall exercise such Lease rights as may be
reasonably requested by Computer Sciences GS or its applicable Subsidiary from
time to time, at Computer Sciences GS's or its applicable Subsidiary's sole
cost and expense and subject to indemnification from Computer Sciences GS
against any Losses any CSC Indemnitee may suffer in connection therewith.

| 
---|--- 

2.8

|

Form of Transfer 

CSC or its applicable Subsidiary shall make the conveyance or transfer of the
Owned Real Properties in accordance with Section 2.1 of this Agreement using
one or more instruments substantially in the form of Exhibit 1 attached to
this Agreement and shall make the assignment, sublease or transfer of the
Leased Real Property in accordance with Sections 2.2 and 2.7 of this Agreement
using one or more instruments substantially in the form of Exhibits 2, 3 or 4
(as applicable) attached to this Agreement (or, if any Landlord so requires,
in the form of assignment reasonably proposed by the relevant Landlord), in
each case with such modifications as are necessary to conform to local
requirements, customs and practices to the extent necessary to render such
form effective and, if requested by Computer Sciences GS, recordable.

| 
---|--- 

2.9

|

Title to the Properties 

CSC makes no representations or warranties, express or implied, with respect
to the quality or condition of, or any encumbrances on, the title to the
Properties, and Computer Sciences GS or its applicable Subsidiary shall accept
the rights, title and interests of CSC or its applicable Subsidiary in and to
each Owned Real Property and each Lease, subject to any defects in the quality
or condition of such title and any easements, covenants, conditions,
restrictions, reservations and other matters affecting, encumbering or
relating to each Property. 
| 
---|--- 

2.10

|

Condition of Properties 

CSC makes no representations or warranties, express or implied, with respect
to the condition of the Properties, and Computer Sciences GS or its applicable
Subsidiary shall accept each Property in such condition and state of repair as
exists on the Distribution Date, with respect to the Owned Real Properties,
and on the Actual Closing Date, with respect to the Leased Real Properties,
with all faults, limitations and defects (latent and apparent), without any
representations or warranties, express or implied, as to its quality,
merchantability or its fitness for any intended use or particular purpose.
Computer Sciences GS, for itself and on behalf of its Subsidiaries,
acknowledges that it has had the opportunity to inspect the Properties to its
full satisfaction and is familiar with the Properties. The Parties obligations
under this Agreement are not conditioned upon the Properties being in any
particular condition, and, any damage from condemnation or any fire or other
casualty or any other change in the condition of any Property notwithstanding,
CSC shall make, or cause its applicable Subsidiary to make, the conveyances,
assignments and transfers under Section 2.1 and 2.2 of this Agreement, and
Computer Sciences GS shall accept, or cause its applicable Subsidiary to
accept, all such conveyances, assignments and transfers; provided, however, in
the event of any such damage from condemnation or fire or other casualty
before the Distribution Date, with respect to the Owned Real Properties, or
the Actual Closing, with respect to the Leased Real Properties, CSC or its
applicable Subsidiary shall confer with Computer Sciences GS regarding, and
use commercially reasonable efforts to pursue and assign to Computer Sciences
GS or its applicable Subsidiary, all rights and interests of CSC or its
applicable Subsidiary in and to any proceeds of insurance arising from such
fire or casualty or proceeds arising from any condemnation proceeding at the
time of the conveyance, assignment or transfer for the relevant Property. To
the extent that there is any damage from condemnation or any fire or other
casualty to any Leased Real Property prior to the Actual Closing, CSC shall
consult with Computer Sciences GS prior to the exercise of any right set forth
in the respective Lease with respect to such an event.

| 
---|--- 

2.11

If any Lease expires or is terminated prior to the Distribution Date, (i) CSC
or its applicable Subsidiary shall not be required to assign or transfer such
Lease, (ii) Computer Sciences GS or its applicable Subsidiary shall not be
required to accept an assignment or transfer of such Lease or a sublease of

Lease Extensions 

Computer Sciences GS shall not enter into, and shall not permit its applicable
Subsidiaries to enter into, any agreement renewing any Guaranteed Lease or
extending the term of any Guaranteed Lease unless CSC is released from all
Obligations, including any guaranty, surety and other security relating to
such Guaranteed Lease. If Computer Sciences GS or its Subsidiary wishes to
remain in any Guaranteed Property after the expiration of the current term of
any Guaranteed Lease, Computer Sciences GS shall enter into, or cause its
applicable Subsidiary to enter into, a new lease of such Guaranteed Property
under 

which neither CSC nor any of its Subsidiaries shall have any Liabilities. If
any Guaranteed Lease provides (a) a right or option to renew such Guaranteed
Lease or extend the term of such Guaranteed Lease that the tenant under such
Guaranteed Lease may exercise with respect to such Guaranteed Lease or (b)
that such Guaranteed Lease shall renew or the term of such Guaranteed Lease
shall be extended automatically if the tenant under such Guaranteed Lease
fails to take an action to prevent such automatic renewal or extension, then,
Computer Sciences GS shall not exercise, and shall not permit its applicable
Subsidiary to exercise, such right or option to renew such Guaranteed Lease or
extend the term of such Guaranteed Lease, and Computer Sciences GS shall take
such action, or shall cause its applicable Subsidiary to take such action, as
is necessary to prevent the automatic renewal of such Guaranteed Lease or the
automatic extension of the term of such Guaranteed Lease. Neither CSC nor any
of its Subsidiaries shall have any Liabilities under (i) any Lease that
expires or is subject to renewal on or after the Distribution Date, or (ii)
any new lease executed by Computer Sciences GS or its Subsidiaries in
connection with the Computer Sciences GS Business on or after the Distribution
Date.

|

Landlord Estoppel Certificates 

If requested to do so by Computer Sciences GS, CSC will use its commercially
reasonable efforts to provide estoppel certificates to landlords under the
Guaranteed Leases, subject to the receipt of factual representations from
Computer Sciences GS in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to CSC (and
subject to receipt of an acknowledgement from Computer Sciences GS that it
will be solely responsible for, and will hold CSC harmless against, any

INDEMNIFICATION 

| 
---|--- 

4.1

|

Notice of Default Under the Guaranteed Leases; Indemnification and
Reimbursement 

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

Computer Sciences GS shall provide CSC with a copy of any written notice of
default, notice of alleged default or other notice that Computer Sciences GS
or any of its Subsidiaries receives from a Landlord or a lender with respect
to any Guaranteed Lease that may result in an event of default, which copy
shall be given to CSC as soon as practicable and in any event no later than
fifteen (15) Business Days after Computer Sciences GS's or any of its
Subsidiaries' receipt of any such notice. CSC shall provide Computer Sciences
GS with a copy of any written notice of default, notice of alleged default or
other notice that CSC or any member of the CSC Group receives from a Landlord
with respect to any Guaranteed Lease, which copy shall be given to Computer
Sciences GS as soon as practicable and in any event no later than five (5)
Business Days after CSC's or any of the CSC Group members' receipt of any such
notice. 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

Computer Sciences GS shall deliver to CSC, as soon as practicable and in any
event no later than fifteen (15) Business Days after Computer Sciences GS's or
any of its Subsidiaries' receipt of any notice described in Section 4.1(a)
hereof, a statement from Computer Sciences GS concerning Computer Sciences
GS's intentions with respect to said default or alleged default. CSC shall
reasonably cooperate with any attempt by Computer Sciences GS pursuant to this
Section 4.1(b) to cure or contest a default or alleged default. 

| 
---|--- 

(i)

|

If Computer Sciences GS indicates an intent to contest said default or alleged
default, then Computer Sciences GS shall engage legal counsel reasonably
acceptable to CSC and shall diligently pursue such contest; provided, however,
if CSC reasonably believes that Computer Sciences GS is not likely to prevail
in such contest and CSC reasonably believes that CSC or any member of the CSC
Group will suffer adverse consequences as a result of such default or alleged
default if it is not cured promptly, then, in any such event, CSC may (in its
sole and absolute discretion and without any obligation to do so) give
Computer Sciences GS written notice of CSC's intention to cure the default or
alleged default under such Guaranteed Lease, and the Parties shall be
thereafter be governed by Section 4.1(b)(iii). 
| 
---|--- 

(ii)

|

If Computer Sciences GS indicates its intent to cure such default or alleged
default, Computer Sciences GS shall cure said default or alleged default
within the time period set forth in the applicable Guaranteed Lease, or if
said default or alleged default is of a character which does not permit the
curing of said default or alleged default within the time period set forth in
the applicable Guaranteed Lease, Computer Sciences GS shall eliminate, cure,
obtain a waiver or otherwise constructively address such default or alleged
default and proceed diligently with respect to said default or alleged default
until cured, waived or eliminated, but, in any event, in the manner required
under the terms and conditions of the applicable Guaranteed Lease. So long as
Computer Sciences GS is working diligently to cure such default or alleged
default in accordance with the foregoing, CSC shall refrain from taking
actions to cure such default or alleged default and shall cooperate as
reasonably requested by Computer Sciences GS with respect to curing such
default or alleged default or settling such dispute with the applicable
Landlord; provided, however, if Computer Sciences GS (1) provides written
notice to CSC of its intention not to cure said default or alleged default,
(2) fails to send any notice of its intentions, or (3) fails to cure a default
or alleged default in accordance with its previous notice to CSC, or if CSC
reasonably believes that CSC or any member of the CSC Group will suffer
adverse consequences as a result of such default or alleged default if it is
not cured promptly, then, in any such event, CSC may (in its sole and absolute
discretion and without any obligation to do so) give Computer Sciences GS
written notice of CSC's intention to cure the default or alleged default under
such Guaranteed Lease and the parties shall be thereafter be governed by
Section 4.1(b)(iii). 

| 
---|--- 

(iii)

|

If Computer Sciences GS has not cured such default or alleged default within
five (5) days after Computer Sciences GS's receipt of CSC's written notice to
Computer Sciences GS pursuant to the final sentences of Sections 4.1(b)(i) or
4.1(b)(ii) (or, if such default or alleged default cannot be cured within such
five (5) day period, Computer Sciences GS has not commenced to cure and
continued to diligently pursue such cure to completion within the grace or
cure periods provided under, and otherwise in accordance with the terms of the
applicable Guaranteed Lease), then, regardless of any stated intention of
Computer Sciences GS, CSC may (in its sole and absolute discretion and without
any obligation to do so) cure such default or alleged default on behalf of
Computer Sciences GS at Computer Sciences GS's sole cost and expense, and
Computer Sciences GS, for itself and on behalf of each of its Subsidiaries,
hereby grants to CSC a license to enter upon any Leased Real Property for the
purpose of effecting such cure, subject to the provisions of such Guaranteed
Lease. 

| 
---|--- 

(iv)

|

If CSC or any member of the CSC Group incurs any Losses as a result of a
default or alleged default under any Guaranteed Lease by Computer Sciences GS
or any of its Subsidiaries, and if Computer Sciences GS does not pay to CSC
the full amount of such Losses promptly after receipt of notice of such Losses
from CSC, CSC shall be entitled to exercise any and all remedies available to
it under this Agreement or under any other agreement between the parties, at
law or in equity. 

| 
---|--- 

(c)

|

Computer Sciences GS, for itself and as agent for each of its Subsidiaries,
hereby agrees to indemnify, defend (or, where applicable, pay the costs of
defense for) and hold harmless the CSC Indemnitees from and against, and shall
reimburse such CSC Indemnitees for, all Losses incurred by the CSC Indemnitees
by reason of (i) the incurrence by any CSC Indemnitees of reasonable out-of-
pocket costs of enforcement (excluding any internal administrative costs of
such CSC Indemnitees) of any terms, covenants or 

agreements contained in this Agreement, (ii) any and all payments or
performance required of any of the CSC Indemnitees with respect to any
Obligation, and (iii) any breach or default by Computer Sciences GS or any of
its Subsidiaries under any Guaranteed Lease. If any CSC Indemnitee incurs any
such Losses, Computer Sciences GS shall reimburse CSC for the full amount
thereof, within ten (10) days after receiving a written demand for such Losses
from CSC. In the event that, with the consent of CSC, Computer Sciences GS
assumes the defense of any CSC Indemnitee with respect to any Action arising
out of any matter from and against which Computer Sciences GS is obligated to
indemnify, defend and hold harmless such CSC Indemnitee under this Section
4.1(c), such defense shall include the employment of counsel reasonably
satisfactory to Computer Sciences GS and CSC and the payment by Computer
Sciences GS of all of such counsel's fees and expenses. CSC shall not be
liable for the payment of any settlement of any such Action effected by
Computer Sciences GS without the written consent of CSC. Computer Sciences GS
shall not, without the prior written consent of CSC (not to be unreasonably
withheld or delayed), effect any settlement of any Action in respect of which
any CSC Indemnitee is a party and from and against which Computer Sciences GS
is obligated to indemnify, defend and hold harmless such CSC Indemnitee under
this Section 4.1(c), unless such settlement is paid, in the first instance, by
Computer Sciences GS, contains no admission of wrongdoing on the part of any
CSC Indemnitee and includes an unconditional release of all CSC Indemnitees
from all liability on all claims that are the subject matter of such Action.
CSC agrees to cooperate reasonably with Computer Sciences GS's defense of any
such Action, as reasonably requested by Computer Sciences GS and at Computer
Sciences GS's sole cost and expense.

4.2

|

Termination of Assignment Upon Breach or Event of Default 

If a breach or default occurs under any of the Guaranteed Leases and such
breach or default remains uncured after any applicable notice and cure period,
then CSC, at its election, shall have the following non-exclusive remedies:

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

CSC shall be entitled to all of the rights and remedies which CSC may have
under this Agreement or any other Contract or at law or in equity; 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

CSC shall have the right to terminate the assignment to Computer Sciences GS
or its applicable Subsidiary of CSC's or its applicable Subsidiary's right,
title and interest in and to the Guaranteed Lease with respect to which there
exists a default following any notice and cure period provided for in such
Guaranteed Lease, which right CSC shall exercise by written notice to Computer
Sciences GS. Provided that such Guaranteed Lease is not a Lease Requiring
Consent, upon receiving such notice from CSC, such assignment shall be of no
further force and effect; and Computer Sciences GS shall assign or otherwise
transfer, or cause its applicable Subsidiary to assign or otherwise transfer,
to CSC all of Computer Sciences GS or such Subsidiary's right, title and
interest in and to such Guaranteed Lease and any related improvements and
fixtures (but excluding any furnishings, trade fixtures and business
equipment) used in connection with the Leased Real Property demised under such
Guaranteed Lease (collectively, the "Related Property"). If such Guaranteed
Lease is a Lease Requiring Consent, then CSC may seek Landlord's consent to
re-assignment of the Lease to CSC at Computer Sciences GS's sole cost and
expense, and, upon the receipt of such consent, Computer Sciences GS (or its
Subsidiary) shall perform such assignment and transfer called for in the
preceding sentence. 

| 
---|--- 

(c)

|

If CSC exercises its right to terminate the assignment to Computer Sciences GS
of any Guaranteed Lease, CSC shall have the immediate right to possession and
use of the Leased Real 

Property with respect to which such breach or event of default exists and any
Related Property associated with such Leased Real Property, and, upon
receiving the notice of termination of such Guaranteed Lease from CSC,
Computer Sciences GS shall quit and vacate, or shall cause its applicable
Subsidiary and all other tenants and occupants of such Leased Real Property,
to quit and vacate such Leased Real Property in accordance with the
requirements of such Guaranteed Lease and broom clean, with all rubbish,
debris and personal property belonging to Computer Sciences GS or such
Subsidiary, tenant or occupant (other than the Related Property) having been
removed. If Computer Sciences GS or any such Subsidiary, tenant or occupant
shall fail to quit and vacate such Leased Real Property after receipt of such
notice of termination in accordance with the requirements of the Guaranteed
Lease, CSC shall have all rights and remedies available at law and in equity
to evict Computer Sciences GS, or such Subsidiary, tenant or occupant from
such Leased Premises.

| 
---|--- 

(d)

|

Computer Sciences GS, for itself and as agent for each of its Subsidiaries,
hereby irrevocably constitutes and appoints CSC its true and lawful attorney-
in-fact for the purpose of carrying out the terms and provisions of this
Section 4.2 after a breach or default under this Agreement or under any
Guaranteed Lease (which continues after the giving of any notice and the
expiration of any cure period provided under such Guaranteed Lease), in
Computer Sciences GS's or such Subsidiary's name and stead, (i) to secure and
maintain the use and possession of any Leased Real Properties with respect to
which any breach or event of default exists under any Guaranteed Lease and any
Related Property; (ii) to take any and all actions which CSC reasonably deems
necessary to protect, maintain and secure its interest in any such Leased Real
Property and Related Property; and (iii) to put and substitute one or more
agents, attorney or attorneys-in-fact for Computer Sciences GS or any such
Subsidiary to do, execute, perform and finish for Computer Sciences GS or such
Subsidiary those matters which shall be reasonably necessary or advisable, or
which Computer Sciences GS's agent, attorney-in-fact or its substitute shall
deem reasonably necessary or advisable, with respect to such Leased Real
Property or Related Property, including, without limitation, executing on
behalf of Computer Sciences GS any instrument deemed necessary or advisable by
CSC to evidence the termination of the previous assignment, and the assignment
of Computer Sciences GS's or its Subsidiary's rights, title and interests in
and to such Guaranteed Lease under this Section 4.2, as thoroughly, amply and
fully as Computer Sciences GS could do personally. All such powers of attorney
shall be deemed coupled with an interest and shall be irrevocable. 

| 
---|--- 

4.3

|

No Obligation to Pay Rent 

Nothing in this Agreement or the instruments assigning the Guaranteed Leases
to Computer Sciences GS or its applicable Subsidiary creates any obligation on
the part of CSC to pay any amounts due or owing under any of the Guaranteed

|

COVENANTS 

| 
---|--- 

5.1

|

Merger 

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

As long as the Guaranteed Rent in the aggregate through the remaining life of
the Guaranteed Leases exceeds $[l], prior to the completion by Computer
Sciences GS of any consolidation with or merger into any Person (or of any
transaction involving or related to an acquisition of a controlling interest
in Computer Sciences GS or a sale of all or substantially all of Computer
Sciences GS's assets on a 

consolidated basis) (in each case, a "Transaction"), the surviving Person of
such Transaction (the "Surviving Person") shall deliver to CSC a Letter of
Credit in the Required Amount to support the Surviving Person's obligations
under this Agreement (on such terms and conditions as are reasonably
acceptable to CSC); provided that no such Letter of Credit shall be required
if the Surviving Person of such Transaction is rated as investment grade by
Standard and Poor's or Moody's Investor Services following the completion of the
Transaction

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

If the Surviving Person provides the Letter of Credit under Section 5.1(a),
the Surviving Person shall be obligated to maintain the Letter of Credit in
the Required Amount during the term commencing on the Distribution Date and
terminating on the earlier of (i) the unconditional release, expiration or
termination of all of CSC's Obligations with respect to all Guaranteed Leases
or (ii) the date on which the Guaranteed Rent falls below $[l] (such term, the
"Letter of Credit Term"). 

| 
---|--- 

5.2

|

Security Interests 

As long as CSC's duties under any Obligation remain outstanding with regards
to any Leased Real Properties or Leases, Computer Sciences GS shall not
pledge, hypothecate, collaterally assign, mortgage or otherwise encumber, or
permit any lien or encumbrance upon, or grant any security interest in, any of
Computer Sciences GS's rights, title or interests, as lessee or assignee, in
or to any of such Leased Real Properties or Leases, except to the extent any
such lien, encumbrance or security interest is subordinate to, and would not
otherwise interfere with, the interests, rights or remedies of CSC with
respect to such Leased Real Property or Lease under the terms of this
Agreement; provided, however, that this Section 5.2 shall not apply to (a) any
lien or encumbrance on any Landlord's interest in any Leased Real Property
existing as of the Distribution Date or expressly permitted under a Lease; (b)
any liens against the Properties for real estate taxes or mechanics',
materialmens' or other liens based upon claims for work, labor or materials
relating to any Property, if (i) such taxes or claims are not due and payable
or are being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and (ii)
Computer Sciences GS maintains adequate reserves for payment of such taxes or
claims in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles; and (c)
any mortgage, deed of trust or security interest on any Property or Lease in
favor of the provider or providers of any senior working capital facility
and/or any senior term loan facility. It shall not be considered a default of
this Agreement if, within ten (10) Business Days after Computer Sciences GS
receives notice of a lien against a Property, Computer Sciences GS causes such
lien to be released of record or provides CSC with insurance against the same
issued by a major title insurance company or such other protection against the
same as CSC shall accept in its sole and absolute discretion.

| 
---|--- 

5.3

|

Sciences GS or its applicable Subsidiary and the date of any contractual
escalation in the monthly rental payment under each Guaranteed Lease, and (b)
certifies that Computer Sciences GS is not in breach or default under any of
the Guaranteed Leases and that no event exists which, with the passage of
time, would become an event of breach or default (or, if applicable,
identifies any exceptions). 
| 
---|--- 

5.4

|

Limitation on Assignment 

As long as any Obligations remain outstanding with regards to a Guaranteed
Lease, Computer Sciences GS or its applicable Subsidiary may assign or
otherwise transfer its rights, title and interests in and to under any such
Guaranteed Lease, or sublease all or substantially all of any the Guaranteed
Property, to a third party (any such proposed assignee, sublessee or
transferee being a "Proposed Transferee," and any such proposed assignment,
sublease or transfer being a "Proposed Transfer"); provided, however, that (a)
CSC consents to such Proposed Transfer, which consent CSC may grant or
withhold in its reasonable discretion, (b) effective upon or before such
Proposed Transfer, a Release of all CSC Indemnitees is obtained under such
Guaranteed Lease, or (c) the Proposed Transferee is a direct or indirect
wholly-owned Subsidiary of Computer Sciences GS, under common control with
Computer Sciences GS, or in control of Computer Sciences GS at all times and
Computer Sciences GS remains primarily liable for the Obligations as if
Computer Sciences GS were still the tenant or assignee under the applicable
Guaranteed Lease or Guaranteed Leases. Any transfer in violation of this
Section 5.4 is void.

Further Assurances 

At any time and from time to time, upon the request of the other Party,
Computer Sciences GS and CSC shall each execute and deliver to the other Party
such further instruments and documents, and do such further acts and things,
as such other Party may reasonably request in order to effectuate fully the
purposes of this Agreement. To the extent it is possible without causing a
default under any Lease, CSC shall take such other actions as may be
reasonably requested by Computer Sciences GS in order to place Computer
Sciences GS, insofar as reasonably possible, in the same position as if the
Leases for any Leased Real Property for which the Actual Closing did not occur
on or before the Distribution Date had been transferred as contemplated
hereby.

REGISTRATIONS 

| 
---|--- 

2.1

|

Shelf Registration Statement 

As soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing Date and in any event not
later than seven (7) Business Days of the Closing Date, Computer Sciences GS
shall file a Registration Statement for a Shelf Registration on Form S-1
covering the resale of all Stockholder Registrable Securities on a delayed or

calendar months following the Closing Date, Computer Sciences GS shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to convert the Form S-1 Shelf to a Shelf
Registration on Form S-3 (a "Form S-3 Shelf" and together with the Form S-1
Shelf, the "Shelf Registration Statement"). Subject to the terms of this
Agreement, including any applicable Blackout 

Period, Computer Sciences GS shall respond to any comments from the SEC as
promptly as practicable and use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause
the Shelf Registration Statement to be declared effective under the Securities
Act as promptly as reasonably practicable after the filing thereof and shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts to keep such Shelf Registration
Statement continuously effective under the Securities Act until the date that
all Stockholder Registrable Securities covered by such Registration Statement
are no longer Stockholder Registrable Securities (the period during which
Computer Sciences GS shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to keep the
Shelf Registration Statement continuously effective under the Securities Act
in accordance with this Section 2.1 the "Shelf Period"). Computer Sciences GS
shall notify the holders of Stockholder Registrable Securities named in the
Shelf Registration Statement via facsimile or by email of the effectiveness of
a Form S-1 Shelf promptly once Computer Sciences GS telephonically confirms
effectiveness with the SEC. Computer Sciences GS shall file a final Prospectus
with the SEC to the extent required by Rule 424. The "Plan of Distribution"
section of such Shelf Registration Statement shall provide for all permitted
means of disposition of Stockholder Registrable Securities requested in
writing to be included therein by Providence including, if so requested in
writing by Providence, firm commitment underwritten public offerings, agented
transactions, sales directly into the market, purchases or sales by brokers
and sales not involving a public offering.

| 
---|--- 

2.2

|

Requests for Registration 

Subject to Article 3 and the other terms and conditions of this Agreement, at
any time during the Shelf Period Providence on behalf of the holders of
Providence Registrable Securities may request to sell all or any portion of
their Providence Registrable Securities in an offering that is registered
pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement (each, a "Shelf Takedown").
Providence may request Computer Sciences GS to initiate up to five
underwritten Shelf Takedowns. For the avoidance of doubt, there shall be no
limit on resales by Providence pursuant to any Shelf Registration Statement
that are not underwritten Shelf Takedowns. An offering using any such
registration statement may be an Underwritten Offering if requested by
Providence.

| 
---|--- 

2.3

|

Shelf Takedown Notice 

All requests for Shelf Takedowns shall be made only by Providence giving
written notice to Computer Sciences GS (a "Shelf Takedown Notice"). Each Shelf
Takedown Notice shall specify the number of Providence Registrable Securities
to be sold and the intended methods of disposition. Within one (1) Business
Days after receipt of any Shelf Takedown Notice, Computer Sciences GS shall
give written notice of such requested Shelf Takedown (which notice shall state
the material terms of such proposed Shelf Takedown, to the extent known) to
all other holders of Stockholder Registrable Securities and, subject to the
provisions of Section 2.4, shall include in such Shelf Takedown all
Stockholder Registrable Securities with respect to which Computer Sciences GS
has received written requests for inclusion therein within two (2) Business
Days after giving such notice; provided, that any such Stockholder Registrable
Securities shall be sold subject to the same terms as are applicable to the
Providence Registrable Securities. For the avoidance of doubt, a Shelf
Takedown Notice may be given by Providence during a Blackout Period with such
Shelf Takedown to occur immediately following the later of the expiration of
the notice periods described in the preceding sentence or the next succeeding
Business Day following expiration of the Blackout Period.

| 
---|--- 

2.4

|

Priority on Shelf Registrations 

Computer Sciences GS shall not include in any Shelf Takedown any securities
that are not Stockholder Registrable Securities without the prior written
consent of Providence; which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. In any Underwritten Offering, if the managing
underwriter(s) advises Computer Sciences GS in writing that in its opinion the
number of Stockholder Registrable Securities and, if permitted hereunder,
other securities requested to be included in such Underwritten Offering
exceeds the number of Stockholder Registrable Securities and other securities,
if any, that can be sold therein in an orderly manner at a price that is
acceptable to Providence, then Computer Sciences GS shall include in such
registration only such number of shares of Computer Sciences GS Common Stock
that in the opinion of the managing underwriter(s) can be sold in an orderly
manner at a price that is acceptable to Providence, which shares shall be
included in the following order of priority:

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

first, Providence Registrable Securities for which registration was requested,
pro rata among holders of such Providence Registrable Securities on the basis
of the number of Providence Registrable Securities owned by each such holder; 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

second, Volgenau Registrable Securities for which registration is requested,
pro rata among the holders of Volgenau Registrable Securities on the basis of
the number of Volgenau Registrable Securities owned by each such holder; 

| 
---|--- 

(c)

|

third, Management Registrable Securities for which registration is requested,
pro rata among the holders of Management Registrable Securities on the basis
of the number of Management Registrable Securities owned by each such holder; 

| 
---|--- 

(d)

|

fourth, any securities proposed to be registered by Computer Sciences GS; and 

| 
---|--- 

(e)

|

fifth, any other securities proposed to be included in such registration
which, in the opinion of the underwriters, can be sold without any such
adverse effect. 

| 
---|--- 

2.5

|

Selection of Underwriters 

Providence shall have the right to select the underwriter or underwriters to
administer any underwritten offering in connection with a sale of Stockholder
Registrable Securities pursuant to a Shelf Takedown from a list to be supplied
by Computer Sciences GS, which list shall include at least 5 nationally
recognized investment banking firms. If Providence wishes to select a lead
underwriter that is not on the list provided by Computer Sciences GS,
Providence may propose an alternative lead underwriter; provided however that
if Computer Sciences GS objects in good faith to such alternative lead
underwriter, Computer Sciences GS may require Providence to select a different
alternative lead underwriter after good faith consultation with Computer
Sciences GS, and, for the avoidance of doubt, Computer Sciences GS may not
object to such different alternative lead underwriter.

| 
---|--- 

2.6

|

Other Registration Rights 

Computer Sciences GS represents and warrants that it is not a party to, or
otherwise subject to, any other agreement granting registration rights to any
Person with respect to any securities of Computer Sciences GS other than this

not be obligated to effect any underwritten Shelf Takedown unless the
reasonably anticipated gross proceeds from the sale of Providence Registrable
Securities in such underwritten Shelf Takedown are $100 million.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no Stockholder
Registrable Securities may be registered, offered, sold or otherwise
transferred under, and Computer Sciences GS shall not be required to maintain
the effectiveness of, more than one registration statement with respect to

Blackout Period. After the expiration of any Blackout Period and without any
further request from Providence, Computer Sciences GS to the extent necessary
shall as promptly as reasonably practicable and, if Providence has delivered a
Shelf Takedown Notice during any Blackout Period, the next succeeding Business
Day following such expiration, prepare and file a post-effective amendment or
supplement to the Shelf Registration Statement or the Prospectus, or any
document incorporated therein by reference, or file any other required
document so that, as thereafter delivered to purchasers of the Stockholder
Registrable Securities included therein, the Prospectus will not include an
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading.

| 
---|--- 

4.

|

PIGGYBACK REGISTRATIONS 

| 
---|--- 

4.1

|

Right to Piggyback 

If Computer Sciences GS proposes to register any of its Computer Sciences GS
Common Stock (whether or not in combination with any other equity or debt
security or otherwise and whether or not in connection with a Shelf
Registration) under the Securities Act (other than in connection with
registration on Form S-4 or Form S-8 or any successor or similar forms, or
relating solely to the sale of debt or convertible debt instruments) and the
registration form to be used may be used for the registration of Stockholder
Registrable Securities (a "Piggyback Registration"), Computer Sciences GS
shall give prompt written notice to the Stockholders of its intention to
effect such a registration. Each such notice shall specify the approximate
number of shares of Computer Sciences GS Common Stock to be registered.
Subject to Sections 4.2 and 4.3, if Stockholder Registrable Securities in the
aggregate equal 2% or more of the outstanding shares of Computer Sciences GS
Common Stock, Computer Sciences GS will include in such registration (and in
all related registrations or qualifications under blue sky laws and in any
related underwriting) all Stockholder Registrable Securities with respect to
which Computer Sciences GS has received a written request from any Stockholder
for inclusion therein within 10 days after the delivery of such notice;
provided that (i) each seller must sell its Stockholder Registrable Securities
to the underwriter or underwriters selected by Computer Sciences GS in
connection with such offering on the same terms and conditions as apply to
Computer Sciences GS and (ii) if, at any time after giving notice to 

the relevant Stockholder of its intention to effect such registration,
Computer Sciences GS shall determine for any reason not to register any of its
Computer Sciences GS Common Stock under the Securities Act, Computer Sciences
GS shall give notice to the relevant Stockholder and thereupon shall be
relieved of its obligation to register any Stockholder Registrable Securities
in connection with such registration and, except for the obligation to pay
Registration Expenses pursuant to Section 5.2 Computer Sciences GS shall have
no liability to the holders of Stockholder Registrable Securities in
connection with such termination or withdrawal. Computer Sciences GS shall
have the right to select the underwriter or underwriters to administer any
underwritten offering in connection with such registration and related
offering.

| 
---|--- 

4.2

|

Priority on Primary Registrations 

If a Piggyback Registration is an underwritten primary registration on behalf
of Computer Sciences GS, and the managing underwriter(s) advises Computer
Sciences GS that in its opinion the number of securities requested to be
included in such registration exceeds the number which can be sold in such
offering in an orderly manner at a price that is acceptable to Computer
Sciences GS, Computer Sciences GS will include in such registration only such
number of shares of Computer Sciences GS Common Stock that in the opinion of
the managing underwriter(s) can be sold in an orderly manner at a price that
is acceptable to Computer Sciences GS, which shares shall be included in the
following order of priority:

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

first, the shares of Computer Sciences GS Common Stock Computer Sciences GS
proposes to sell, 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

third, any other shares of Computer Sciences GS Common Stock requested to be
included in such registration. 

| 
---|---

Priority on Secondary Registrations 

If a Piggyback Registration is an underwritten secondary registration on
behalf of holders of Computer Sciences GS Common Stock (other than the holders
of Stockholder Registrable Securities), and the managing underwriter(s)
advises Computer Sciences GS in writing that in its opinion the number of
securities requested to be included in such registration exceeds the number
which can be sold in such offering in an orderly manner at a price that is
acceptable to Computer Sciences GS, Computer Sciences GS will include in such
registration only such number of shares of Computer Sciences GS Common Stock
that in the opinion of the managing underwriter(s) can be sold in an orderly
manner at a price that is acceptable to Computer Sciences GS, which shares
shall be included in the following order of priority:

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

first, the shares of Computer Sciences GS Common Stock requested to be
included therein by the applicable holders requesting registration, and

Computer Sciences GS such information relating to the sellers of Stockholder
Registrable Securities and the sale or registration of Stockholder Registrable
Securities by the Stockholders and the distribution thereof as Computer
Sciences GS may from time to time reasonably request in writing. In the event
of a Piggyback Registration, if within 10 days of the receipt of a written
request from Computer Sciences GS, the Stockholders fail to provide to
Computer Sciences GS any information relating to the Stockholders that is
required by applicable law to be disclosed in any registration statement,
Computer Sciences GS may exclude the Stockholders\' Stockholder Registrable
Securities from such registration statement.

If any registration or comparable statement refers to any holder by name or
otherwise as the holder of any securities of Computer Sciences GS and if in
such holder\'s sole and exclusive judgment, such holder is or might be deemed
to be an underwriter or a controlling person of Computer Sciences GS, such
holder shall have the right to require the insertion therein of language, in
form and substance satisfactory to such holder and presented to Computer
Sciences GS in writing, to the effect that the holding by such holder of such
securities is not to be construed as a recommendation by such holder of the
investment quality of Computer Sciences GS\'s securities covered thereby and
that such holding does not imply that such holder will assist in meeting any
future financial requirements of Computer Sciences GS.

reports, it will, upon the request of Providence, make publicly available such

pursuant to Rule 144), all to the extent required to enable the Stockholders

INDEMNIFICATION 

| 
---|--- 

6.1

|

Indemnification by Computer Sciences GS 

Computer Sciences GS agrees to: (a) indemnify and hold harmless, to the
fullest extent permitted by law, the Stockholders and, as applicable, their
respective officers, directors, trustees, employees, unitholders, holders of
beneficial interests, members, general and limited partners, agents and
representatives and each Person who controls the Stockholders or such holder
(within the meaning of the Securities Act) (collectively, "Stockholder
Indemnitees") against any and all losses, claims, actions, damages,
liabilities and expenses (including reasonable attorney\'s fees and expenses),
to which the Stockholders or any such holder or Stockholder Indemnitee may
become subject under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses,
claims, actions, damages, liabilities or expenses (or actions or proceedings,
whether commenced or threatened, in respect thereof) arise out of, result from
or are based upon (i) any untrue or alleged untrue statement of material fact
contained in any registration statement of Computer Sciences GS under the
Securities Act that covers any Stockholder Registrable Securities pursuant to
this Agreement, or prospectus or preliminary prospectus or any amendment
thereof or supplement thereto relating to Stockholder Registrable Securities,
together with any documents incorporated therein by reference, or (ii) any
omission or alleged omission of a material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements therein (in the case of a prospectus or
preliminary prospectus, in the light of the circumstances under which they
were made) not misleading; and (b) reimburse the Stockholders and each such
holder and Stockholder Indemnitee for any legal or any other expenses as
incurred, including any amounts paid in any settlement effected with the
consent of Computer Sciences GS, which consent will not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed, reasonably incurred by them in connection with
investigating or defending any such loss, claim, liability, action or
proceeding; provided, however, that Computer Sciences GS shall not be liable
in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, action, damage,
liability or expense (or action or proceeding in respect thereof) arises out
of, results from or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue
statement, or omission or alleged omission, made in such registration
statement, any such prospectus or preliminary prospectus or any amendment or
supplement thereto, in reliance upon, and in conformity with, written
information prepared and furnished to Computer Sciences GS by or on behalf of
such holder with respect to such holder expressly for use therein.

| 
---|--- 

6.2

|

Indemnification by Holders of Stockholder Registrable Securities 

In connection with any registration statement in which a holder of Stockholder
Registrable Securities is participating, each such holder will furnish to
Computer Sciences GS in writing such information as Computer Sciences GS
reasonably requests for use in connection with any such registration
statement, prospectus, preliminary or prospectus and, to the extent permitted
by law, will indemnify and hold harmless, severally and not jointly, Computer
Sciences GS and its officers, directors, employees, agents, representatives,
trustees and each Person who controls Computer Sciences GS (within the meaning
of the Securities Act) (collectively, the "Computer Sciences GS Indemnitees")
against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses (including
reasonable attorney\'s fees and expenses) to which Computer Sciences GS or any
such Computer Sciences GS Indemnitee may become subject under the Securities
Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages, liabilities and
expenses (or actions or proceedings, whether commenced or threatened, in
respect thereof) arise out of, result from or are based upon (a) any untrue or
alleged untrue statement of material fact contained in any registration
statement of Computer 

Sciences GS under the Securities Act that covers any Stockholder Registrable
Securities pursuant to this Agreement, or prospectus, preliminary prospectus
or Free Writing Prospectus or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto
relating to Stockholder Registrable Securities, together with any documents
incorporated therein by reference, or (b) any omission or alleged omission of
a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein (in the case of a prospectus, preliminary prospectus or
Free Writing Prospectus, in the light of the circumstances under which they
were made) not misleading, but, in the case of each of (a) and (b), only to
the extent that such untrue statement (or alleged untrue statement) or
omission (or alleged omission) is made in such registration statement, any
such prospectus, preliminary prospectus or Free Writing Prospectus or any
amendment thereof or supplement thereto, together with any documents
incorporated therein by reference, in reliance upon and in conformity with
written information prepared and furnished to Computer Sciences GS by or on
behalf of such holder with respect to such holder expressly for use therein.
In addition, such holder will reimburse Computer Sciences GS and each such
Computer Sciences GS Indemnitee for any legal or any other expenses as
incurred including any amounts paid in any settlement effected with the
consent of such holder, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed, incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any
such loss, claim, liability, action or proceeding. The liability of any holder
of Stockholder Registrable Securities shall be several and not joint and shall
be limited to the net proceeds after underwriting commissions and discounts
(but before any taxes and expenses which may be payable by such holder)
received by such holder from the sale of Stockholder Registrable Securities
covered by such registration statement, less any other amounts paid by such
holder to Computer Sciences GS and each such Computer Sciences GS Indemnitee
in respect of such untrue statement, alleged untrue statement, omission or
alleged omission.

| 
---|--- 

6.3

|

Procedure 

Any Person entitled to indemnification hereunder will (a) give prompt written
notice to the indemnifying party of any claim with respect to which it seeks
indemnification (provided, that the failure of any indemnified party to give
such notice shall not relieve the indemnifying party of its obligations
hereunder, except to the extent that the indemnifying party is actually
prejudiced by such failure to give such notice), and (b) unless in such
indemnified party\'s reasonable judgment a conflict of interest between such
indemnified and indemnifying parties may exist with respect to such claim,
permit such indemnifying party to assume the defense of such claim with
counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party. If such defense is
assumed, the indemnifying party will not be subject to any liability for any
settlement made by the indemnified party without its consent (but such consent
will not be unreasonably withheld). An indemnifying party who is not entitled
to, or elects not to, assume the defense of a claim will not be obligated to
pay the fees and expenses of more than one counsel for all parties indemnified
by such indemnifying party with respect to such claim, unless in the
reasonable judgment of any indemnified party a conflict of interest may exist
between such indemnified party and any other of such indemnified parties with
respect to such claim.

| 
---|--- 

6.4

|

Entry of Judgment; Settlement 

The indemnifying party shall not, except with the approval of each indemnified
party, consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement which
does not include as an unconditional term thereof, the giving by the claimant
or plaintiff to each indemnified party of a release from all liability in
respect to such claim or litigation without any payment or consideration
provided by such indemnified party. 
| 
---|--- 

6.5

|

Contribution 

If the indemnification provided for in this Article 6 is, other than expressly
pursuant to its terms, unavailable to or is insufficient to hold harmless an
indemnified party under the provisions above in respect of any losses, claims,
damages, liabilities or expenses referred to therein, then each indemnifying
party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party
as a result of such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses in such
proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of Computer
Sciences GS on the one hand and of the sellers of Stockholder Registrable
Securities and any other sellers participating in the registration statement
on the other hand in connection with the statement or omissions which resulted
in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant
equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the sellers of
Stockholder Registrable Securities and any other sellers participating in the
registration statement shall be deemed to be the total net proceeds from the
offering (before deducting expenses) to the sellers of Stockholder Registrable
Securities and any other sellers participating in the registration statement.
The relative fault of Computer Sciences GS on the one hand, and of the sellers
of Stockholder Registrable Securities and any other sellers participating in
the registration statement on the other hand, shall be determined by reference
to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged statement or omission to
state a material fact relates to information supplied by Computer Sciences GS
or by the sellers of Stockholder Registrable Securities or other sellers
participating in the registration statement and the parties\' relative intent,
knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such
statement or omission.

Computer Sciences GS and the sellers of Stockholder Registrable Securities
agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this
Article 6 were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of
allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations
referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph. The amount paid or payable
by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages,
liabilities and expenses referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph
shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any
legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in
connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim.
Notwithstanding the provisions of this Article 6, no seller of Stockholder
Registrable Securities shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of
the net proceeds received by the Stockholders from the sale of Stockholder
Registrable Securities covered by the registration statement filed pursuant
hereto, less any other amounts paid by the Stockholders in respect of such
untrue statement, alleged untrue statement, omission or alleged omission. No
Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section
11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any Person
who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.

| 
---|--- 

6.6

|

Other Rights 

The indemnification and contribution by any such party provided for under this
Agreement shall be in addition to any other rights to indemnification or
contribution which any indemnified party may have pursuant to law or contract
and will remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made
or omitted by or on behalf of the indemnified party or any officer, director
or controlling Person of such indemnified party and will survive the transfer
of Stockholder Registrable Securities and the termination or expiration of
this Agreement.

| 
---|--- 

6.7

|

Survival 

The indemnification provided for under this Agreement will remain in full
force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the
indemnified party or any officer, agent or employee and each other Person who
participates as an underwriter in the offering or sale of such securities and
each other Person, if any, who controls (within the meaning of the Securities
Act) such indemnified party, and will survive the transfer of securities.

Agreement shall in no way be construed as a waiver of such provisions and
shall not affect the right of such party thereafter to enforce each and every
provision of this Agreement in accordance with its terms. To the extent the
Amendment of any Section of this Agreement would require a specific consent
pursuant to this Section 7.5, any Amendment to the definitions used in such
Section as applied to such Section shall also require the same specified

any choice of law or conflict of law rules or provisions (whether of the State
of New York or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the
laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of New York. In furtherance of
the foregoing, the internal law of the State of New York shall control the
interpretation and construction of this Agreement, even though under that
jurisdiction\'s choice of law or conflict of law analysis, the substantive law
of some other jurisdiction would ordinarily apply.

The Parties agree that jurisdiction and venue in any action brought by any
Party pursuant to this Agreement shall properly lie exclusively in the United
States District Court for the Southern District of New York or any court of
the State of New York and any federal or state court located 

in the State of New York from which appeal therefrom validly lies. By
execution and delivery of this Agreement, each Party irrevocably submits to
the jurisdiction of such courts for itself and in respect of its property with
respect to such action. The Parties irrevocably agree that venue would be
proper in such court, and hereby waive any objection that such court is an
improper or inconvenient forum for the resolution of such action. The Parties
further agree that the mailing by certified or registered mail, return receipt
requested, of any process required by any such court shall constitute valid
and lawful service of process against them, without necessity for service by
any other means provided by statute or rule of court.

|

Exercise of Rights and Remedies 

No delay of or omission in the exercise of any right, power or remedy accruing
to any party as a result of any breach or default by any other party under
this Agreement shall impair any such right, power or remedy, nor shall it be
construed as a waiver of or acquiescence in any such breach or default, or of
any similar breach or default occurring later; nor shall any such delay,

This TAX MATTERS AGREEMENT (this "Agreement") is dated as of , 2015, by and
between Computer Sciences Corporation, a Nevada corporation ("CSC"), and
Computer Sciences Government Services Inc., a Nevada corporation ("Computer
Sciences GS" and, together with CSC, the "Parties", and each individually, a
"Party").

WHEREAS:

| 
---|--- 

(A)

|

As of the date hereof, CSC is the common parent of an affiliated group of
domestic corporations within the meaning of Section 1504(a) of the Code (the
"Affiliated Group"), and the members of the Affiliated Group have heretofore
joined in filing consolidated federal Income Tax Returns; 

| 
---|--- 

(B)

|

CSC, acting through its direct and indirect Subsidiaries, currently conducts
the CSC Business and the Computer Sciences GS Business; 

| 
---|--- 

(C)

|

The Board of Directors of CSC (the "Board") has determined that it is
appropriate, desirable and in the best interests of CSC and its stockholders
to separate CSC into two separate, publicly traded companies, one for each of
(i) the CSC Business, which shall be owned and conducted, directly or
indirectly, by CSC and (ii) the Computer Sciences GS Business, which shall be
owned and conducted, directly or indirectly, by Computer Sciences GS; 

| 
---|--- 

(D)

|

In order to effect such separation, the Board has determined that it is
appropriate, desirable and in the best interests of CSC and its stockholders
to undertake the Internal Reorganization and, following the completion of the
Internal Reorganization, for CSC to distribute pro rata to the Record Holders
in accordance with the Distribution Ratio, all of the issued and outstanding
shares of Computer Sciences GS Common Stock (the "Distribution"); 

| 
---|--- 

(E)

|

It is the intention of the Parties that the Distribution qualify as a tax-free
distribution under Section 355 of the Code; 

| 
---|--- 

(F)

|

It is the intention that the contributions of Computer Sciences GS Assets to,
and the assumption of Computer Sciences GS Liabilities by, Computer Sciences
GS prior to the Distribution, together with the Distribution (collectively,
the "Separation"), qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Sections
368(a)(1)(D) and 355 of the Code; and 

| 
---|--- 

(G)

|

As a result of the Distribution, the Parties desire to enter into this
Agreement to provide for certain Tax matters, including the assignment of
responsibility for the preparation and filing of Tax Returns, the payment of
and indemnification for Taxes (including Taxes with respect to the
Distribution and related transactions as contemplated in the Master Separation
and Distribution Agreement and the other Ancillary Agreements), entitlement to
refunds of Taxes, and the prosecution and defense of any Tax controversies.

ALLOCATION OF TAX LIABILITIES 

| 
---|--- 

2.1

|

Payment of Taxes 

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

Taxes Upon Filing and Adjusted Income Taxes. The Party responsible for the
filing of a Tax Return pursuant to Sections 3.1 and 3.2 shall pay to the
relevant Taxing Authority all Taxes due or payable in connection with such Tax
Return (including any amounts relating to adjustments to such Tax Return) and
shall be entitled to any refunds (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any
similar credit or offset against Taxes) in connection therewith.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any Tax Return (other than a
Consolidated Return) of Computer Sciences GS or any Computer Sciences GS
Subsidiary for any taxable period (whether ending on, before or after the
Distribution Date), Computer Sciences GS shall be liable for, and shall be
entitled to any refunds of, Taxes (including any amounts relating to
adjustments to such Tax Return) relating to such taxable period. 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

Separation Taxes. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 2.1 to the
contrary, and except as provided in Section 4, CSC shall be liable for, and
shall be entitled to any refunds of, any Taxes for a taxable period that
begins on or before the Distribution Date imposed or incurred in connection
with the Separation, including (i) Taxes imposed as a result of the Separation
failing to qualify under Section 355 and/or Section 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code,
(ii) Taxes imposed as a result of the stock of Computer Sciences GS
distributed in the Distribution failing to be treated as qualified property
pursuant to Section 355(d) or 355 

(e) of the Code, (iii) Taxes imposed as a result of CSC otherwise recognizing
any gain in connection with the Distribution (including, for the avoidance of
doubt, the related internal transactions), (iv) Taxes imposed as a result of
the recapture of any previously claimed Tax items in connection with the
Distribution, (v) Taxes imposed as a result of any deferred intercompany item
or excess loss account (or any similar item under state, local or foreign Tax
law) being taken into account in connection with the Distribution pursuant to
Section 1502 of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder (or any
similar provision of state, local or foreign Tax law) and (vi) any stamp,
duty, transfer, sales and use or similar Taxes incurred in connection with the
Separation.

| 
---|--- 

(c)

|

Other Taxes. At the conclusion of any Proceeding relating to Other Taxes, CSC
and Computer Sciences GS shall reasonably cooperate with one another in a
timely manner to determine the amount of any Other Taxes payable by CSC that
are attributable to the Computer Sciences GS Business (and vice-versa) and
Computer Sciences GS or CSC, as the case may be, shall pay such amount of
Other Taxes to CSC or Computer Sciences GS, as the case may be. 

| 
---|--- 

2.2

|

Indemnity 

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

Subject to Section 4, CSC shall indemnify Computer Sciences GS and its
Affiliates from all liability for Taxes for which CSC is responsible pursuant
to Section 2.1 and any related Losses. 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

Subject to Section 4, Computer Sciences GS shall indemnify CSC and its
Affiliates from all liability for Taxes for which Computer Sciences GS is
responsible pursuant to Section 2.1 and any related Losses. 

| 
---|--- 

(c)

|

Unless otherwise agreed in writing, the indemnifying Party shall pay to the
indemnified Party the amount required to be paid pursuant to Section 2.2(a) or
(b) above within thirty (30) days of being notified of the amount due by the
indemnified Party. The notice by the indemnified Party requesting such payment
shall be accompanied by the calculations and other information used to
determine the indemnifying Party's obligations hereunder. Such payment shall
be paid by the indemnifying Party to the indemnified Party by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated by the indemnified Party
by written notice to the indemnifying Party prior to the due date of such
payment. In the event of a disagreement as to the amount required to be paid
pursuant to Section 2.2(a) or (b) above, the indemnifying party and the
indemnified party shall cooperate with one another in good faith to resolve
any such disagreement. 

| 
---|--- 

2.3

|

Contests 

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

Subject to Section 4, the right to control the conduct of any Proceeding shall
belong to the Party responsible, pursuant to Sections 3.1 and 3.2, for the
filing of the Tax Return to which such Proceeding relates. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, CSC shall have the right to control the conduct of any Proceeding
if CSC reasonably determines that it could have an indemnification obligation
for an adjustment to Tax pursuant to such Proceeding. If the Party not
controlling a Proceeding could have an indemnification obligation for an
adjustment to Tax pursuant to such Proceeding, such Party shall be entitled to
participate in (but not control) such Proceeding at its own cost and expense. 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

The Party controlling a Proceeding shall not settle such Proceeding in a
manner that would result in an indemnity payment from the other Party under
this Agreement or otherwise cause a material adverse tax consequence to the
other Party without the consent of the other Party (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); provided that the Party
controlling such Proceeding may settle such Proceeding without the consent of
the other Party so long as such Party waives its indemnification rights
hereunder in respect of such Proceeding and agrees to indemnify the other
Party against any material adverse tax consequence arising from such
settlement. 
| 
---|--- 

(c)

|

To the extent relevant, the Parties will use commercially reasonable efforts
to work with Taxing Authorities to cause any Proceedings to be bifurcated into
pre-Distribution Date and post-Distribution Date periods. 

| 
---|--- 

(d)

|

At CSC's request, Computer Sciences GS will pay its share of Taxes as needed
to file a protest or otherwise respond to a Proceeding. 

| 
---|--- 

(e)

|

CSC and Computer Sciences GS shall negotiate in good faith concerning the
waiver of any law firm and advisor conflicts with respect to any law firms or
advisors that were retained by CSC at any time prior to the Effective Time. 

| 
---|--- 

(f)

|

After the Distribution Date, each Party shall promptly notify the other Party
in writing upon receipt of written notice of the commencement of any
Proceeding or of any demand or claim upon it, which, if determined adversely,
would be grounds for indemnification from such other Party pursuant to Section
2.2; provided that failure to provide notice pursuant to this sentence shall
not relieve any Party of its obligations pursuant to this Agreement except to
the extent such Party is actually prejudiced as a result thereof. Each Party
shall, on a timely basis, keep the other Party informed of all developments in
the Proceeding and provide such other Party with copies of all pleadings,
briefs, orders, and other correspondence pertaining thereto. 

| 
---|--- 

2.4

|

Treatment of Payments; After Tax Basis 

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

Unless otherwise required by a Final Determination, this Agreement or
otherwise agreed to between the Parties, any payment made pursuant to this
Agreement (other than any payment of interest pursuant to Section 2.4(d)) by:
(i) Computer Sciences GS to CSC shall be treated for all Tax purposes as a
distribution by Computer Sciences GS to CSC with respect to the stock of
Computer Sciences GS occurring after Computer Sciences GS is directly owned by
CSC and immediately before the Distribution; or (ii) CSC to Computer Sciences
GS shall be treated for all Tax purposes as a tax-free contribution by CSC to
Computer Sciences GS with respect to its stock occurring after Computer
Sciences GS is directly owned by CSC and immediately before the Distribution;
and in each case, no Party shall take any position inconsistent with such
treatment. In the event that a Taxing Authority asserts that a Party's
treatment of a payment pursuant to this Agreement should be other than as
required pursuant to this Agreement (ignoring any potential inconsistent or
adverse Final Determination), such Party shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to contest such challenge. 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

If the receipt or accrual of any payment pursuant to this Agreement (other
than payments of interest pursuant to Section 2.4(d)) results in taxable
income to the indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates, such payment shall
be increased so that, after the payment of any Taxes with respect to the
payment, the indemnified Party and its Affiliates shall have realized the same
net amount they would have realized had the payment not resulted in taxable
income. 

| 
---|--- 

(c)

|

To the extent that any liability for Taxes or Losses that is subject to
indemnification under this Agreement gives rise to a deduction, credit or
other Tax benefit to the indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates, the
amount of any payment made under this Agreement shall be decreased by taking
into account any actual reduction in Taxes (determined on a with and without
basis) of the indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates resulting from such
Tax benefit. To the extent that the Party responsible for the payment of Taxes
pursuant to Section 2.1 incurs a liability for Taxes or a Loss or an
adjustment that is not subject to indemnification under this Agreement and the
other Party or any of its Affiliates receives a deduction, credit or other Tax
benefit as a result, the Party receiving such Tax benefit shall pay to the
other Party the Tax benefit (determined on a with and without basis) in
accordance with this Section 2.4. If (i) such actual 

reduction in Taxes of the indemnified Party or its Affiliate occurs in a
taxable period following the period in which the indemnification payment is
made or (ii) any adjustment to the liability for Taxes for which one Party or
any Affiliates is responsible hereunder gives rise to a deduction, credit or
other Tax benefit to the other Party or any of its Affiliates, the indemnified
Party (or, in the case of (ii), the other Party) shall on an annual basis pay
the indemnifying Party (or, in the case of (ii), the responsible Party) the
amount of the actual reduction in Taxes (determined on a with and without
basis); provided, however, that no such payment shall be required if the
actual reduction in Taxes for the relevant year and any unpaid reduction in
Taxes for all prior years is less than $50,000.

| 
---|--- 

(d)

|

Payments made pursuant to this Agreement that are not made within the period
prescribed in this Agreement or, if no period is prescribed, within thirty
(30) days after demand for payment is made (the "Payment Period") shall bear
interest for the period from and including the date immediately following the
last date of the Payment Period through and including the date of payment at a
rate of simple interest per annum equal to LIBOR. Such interest will be
payable at the same time as the payment to which it relates and shall be
calculated on the basis of a year of 365 days and the actual number of days
for which due.

4.1

|

Opinion Requirement for Major Transactions Undertaken by Computer Sciences GS
During the Restricted Period 

Other than pursuant to the transactions contemplated by the Master Separation
and Distribution Agreement or the Merger Agreement or issuances satisfying the
requirements of Safe Harbors VIII or IX of Treas. Regs. Section 1.355-7(d),
Computer Sciences GS agrees that during the Restricted Period it shall not (i)
merge or consolidate with or into any other entity, (ii) liquidate or
dissolve, (iii) sell or transfer any portion 

of its assets that would violate the "continuity of business enterprise"
requirement of Treas. Regs. Section 1.368-1(d) or 1.355-3, (iv) redeem or
otherwise repurchase any of its capital stock other than pursuant to open
market stock repurchase programs meeting the requirements of section
4.05(1)(b) of Rev. Proc. 96-30, 1996-1 C.B. 696 (prior to modification), (v)
cease the active conduct of its Active Business, (vi) enter into any
negotiations, agreements or arrangements with respect to transactions or
events (including any transactions described in Sections 4.1(i)-(iv), stock
issuances (pursuant to the exercise of options or otherwise), option grants or
acquisitions, or a series of such transactions or events, but excluding the
Distribution and the Mergers) that may cause the Distribution to be treated as
part of a plan pursuant to which one or more persons acquire directly or
indirectly stock of Computer Sciences GS representing a "30-percent or greater
interest" (i.e., stock possessing at least thirty percent (30%) of the total
combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote or at least
thirty percent (30%) of the total value of shares of all classes of stock, as
such terms are used in Section 355(d)(4) of the Code), or (vii) take any other
action (or series of actions), or permit any Subsidiary to take any such
action (or series of actions), where the taking of such action (or series of
actions) described in this Section 4.1 could reasonably be expected to (A)
cause the Distribution to fail to qualify as a tax-free distribution to CSC's
stockholders under Section 355(a) of the Code, (B) cause the Internal
Reorganization, taken together with the Distribution, to fail to qualify as a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a)(1)(D) and 355 of the Code
or (C) cause the stock of Computer Sciences GS distributed in the Distribution
to fail to be treated as qualified property pursuant to Section 355(e) of the
Code (the acts listed in (i)-(vii) collectively, the "Prohibited Acts").
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Computer Sciences GS may take any of the
Prohibited Acts, subject to Section 4.2, if (x) Computer Sciences GS first
obtains (at its expense) an opinion in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to CSC of a nationally recognized law firm or a "big four"
accounting firm reasonably acceptable to CSC, which opinion may be based on
factual representations (reasonably acceptable to CSC) or (y) Computer
Sciences GS obtains a ruling from the IRS, that such Prohibited Act or
Prohibited Acts, and any transaction related thereto, should not cause (i) the
Distribution to fail to qualify as a tax-free distribution to CSC's
stockholders under Section 355(a) of the Code, (ii) the Internal
Reorganization, taken together with the Distribution, to fail to qualify as a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a)(1)(D) and 355 of the Code
or (iii) the stock of Computer Sciences GS distributed in the Distribution to
fail to be treated as qualified property pursuant to Section 355(e) of the
Code. Computer Sciences GS may also take any of the Prohibited Acts, subject
to Section 4.2, with the consent of CSC in its sole and absolute discretion.
During the Restricted Period, CSC shall provide all information and written
representations reasonably requested by Computer Sciences GS that CSC is
reasonably able to provide relating to any transaction involving an
acquisition (directly or indirectly) of the stock of Computer Sciences GS
within the meaning of Section 355(e) of the Code or any other matter
reasonably necessary to enable Computer Sciences GS to obtain the opinion or
ruling described in clauses (x) and (y) hereof.

4.2

|

Indemnification for Distribution Taxes 

If, after the Distribution, a Party or any of its Affiliates takes any action
or enters into any agreement to take any action, including any of the
Prohibited Acts as defined in Section 4.1 of this Agreement (other than any
such action contemplated in the Master Separation and Distribution Agreement
or related documents), or if there is any direct or indirect acquisition of a
Party's stock, and as a result (i) the Distribution shall fail to qualify as a
tax-free distribution to CSC's stockholders under Section 355(a) of the Code,
(ii) the Internal Reorganization, taken together with the Distribution, shall
fail to qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Sections
368(a)(1)(D) and 355 of the Code or (iii) the stock of Computer Sciences GS
distributed in the Distribution shall fail to be treated as qualified property
pursuant to Section 355(e) of the Code, then such Party (the "Breaching
Party") shall indemnify and hold harmless the other Party (the "Non-Breaching
Party") and any of its Affiliates against any and all Taxes (and any related
Losses) imposed upon or incurred by the Non-Breaching Party or any of its
Affiliates (and any 

Taxes of CSC stockholders to the extent the Non-Breaching Party or any of its
Affiliates is liable with respect to such Taxes, whether to a Taxing
Authority, to a stockholder or to any other person) as a result, unless such
Taxes would, in any event, have been imposed upon or incurred by the Non-
Breaching Party or any or its Affiliates without regard to such actions,
breaches or events, as determined at such time; provided, however, that
Computer Sciences GS shall not be obligated to indemnify CSC under this
Section 4.2 to the extent that (i) Computer Sciences GS took such action or
entered into such agreement in reliance upon any representation, warranty or
covenant made by CSC in the representation letter CSC furnished to Allen and
Overy LLP in connection with the Opinion and CSC breached such representation,
warranty or covenant or (ii) the indemnification claim arises from any
breached representation, warranty or covenant made by Computer Sciences GS in
its representation letter provided in connection with the Opinion to the
extent such representation, warranty or covenant creates a restriction more
onerous than the restrictions described in Section 4.1. Subject to the
foregoing proviso, the Non-Breaching Party and any of its Affiliates shall be
indemnified and held harmless under this Section 4.2 without regard to whether
an opinion or ruling pertaining to the action pursuant to Section 4.1 was
obtained, and without regard to whether the Non-Breaching Party gave its
consent to such action pursuant to Section 4.1 or otherwise.

Taxing Authority) at least two (2) Business Days prior to the date payment of
the Indemnified Liability is required to be made to the Taxing Authority. Such
payment shall be paid by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account designated by the indemnified Party by written notice to the
indemnifying Party prior to the due date of such payment. 

| 
---|--- 

(e)

|

Refund of Amounts. Should a Party or any of its Affiliates receive a refund in
respect of an Indemnified Liability or other Taxes for which the other Party
was responsible under this Agreement, or should any such amounts that would
otherwise be refundable to such Party or any of its Affiliates be applied or
credited by the Taxing Authority to obligations of such Party or any of its
Affiliates unrelated to an Indemnified Liability, then such Party shall,
promptly following receipt (or notification of credit), remit such refund or
an amount equal to such credit (including any statutory interest that is

This TRANSITION SERVICES AGREEMENT (this "Agreement") is dated as of , 2015
by and between Computer Sciences Corporation, a Nevada corporation ("CSC"),
and Computer Sciences Government Services Inc., a Nevada corporation
("Computer Sciences GS"). Each of CSC and Computer Sciences GS is sometimes
referred to herein as a "Party" and collectively as the "Parties". Capitalized
terms used herein and not otherwise defined herein have the meanings given to
such terms in the Master Separation and Distribution Agreement dated as of the
date hereof, by and between CSC and Computer Sciences GS (as such may be
amended from time to time, the "Master Separation and Distribution
Agreement").

WHEREAS:

| 
---|--- 

(A)

|

CSC, acting directly and through its direct and indirect Subsidiaries,
currently conducts the CSC Business and the Computer Sciences GS Business; 

| 
---|--- 

(B)

|

CSC and Computer Sciences GS have entered into the Master Separation and
Distribution Agreement in connection with the separation of the Computer
Sciences GS Business from CSC and the Distribution of Computer Sciences GS
Common Stock to stockholders of CSC; and 

| 
---|--- 

(C)

|

in connection therewith, the Parties desire to enter into this Agreement. 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of and subject to the premises and the mutual
agreements, terms and conditions herein contained, the benefits to be derived
therefrom and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and the
sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereby agree as
follows:

| 
---|--- 

1.

|

SERVICES PROVIDED 

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

During the period commencing on the Distribution Date and ending on the
applicable Termination Date (as defined in Section 11), Service Provider shall
provide, or shall cause one or more of its Affiliates or a contractor,
subcontractor, vendor or other third-party service provider (each, a "Third
Party Provider") to provide, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth herein, the services (the "Services") described on Schedule A (Services
provided by CSC to Computer Sciences GS) or Schedule B (Services provided by
Computer Sciences GS to CSC) (collectively, the "Services Schedules"). 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

With respect to each Service, the Party required to provide such Service is
the "Service Provider" and the other Party is the "Service Recipient". In
performing the Services, Service Provider and each of its Affiliates shall
provide, or ensure that any Third Party Provider shall provide, the Services
consistent with the "Performance Standards", which shall mean in all material
respects (i) in substantially the same manner and at the same level of service
(including, as applicable, with respect to type, frequency, quality, quantity,
priority and timeliness) as compared with the six-month period prior to the
Distribution Date, except as may be set forth in individual Service Schedules,
(ii) with substantially the same degree of skill and care and (iii) with
substantially the same level of security (or any increased level of security
reasonably required as a result of CSC and Computer Sciences GS not being
affiliates of each other following the Distribution) as provided and used by
the Service Provider during the six-month period prior to the Distribution
Date, which Services shall be free of material error. The Performance
Standards shall in any event be standards that are commercially reasonable. 

| 
---|--- 

(i)

|

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if circumstances dictate that there must be an
increase in the complexity of a Service (whether as a result of increased
quantity or quality, changing frequency or regulatory requirements or
otherwise), Service Recipient acknowledges and agrees that such Service may
not be provided within the same amount of time as it had previously taken
during 

such period, and, in such a case, Service Provider and each of its Affiliates
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide, or to ensure that any
Third Party Provider shall provide, such Service in a timely manner.

| 
---|--- 

(ii)

|

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Services are to be
provided in a manner that treats Service Recipient (or its Subsidiaries or its
or their personnel or business) substantially as favorably as Service Provider
treats itself (or its Affiliates or its or their personnel or business) in
connection with the provision of a Self-Service (as defined in Section 2(d)). 

| 
---|--- 

(c)

|

If Service Provider wishes to provide a Service by using a Third Party
Provider and if such Services were not provided by such Third Party Provider
to Service Recipient during the six-month period prior to the Distribution
Date, Service Provider shall obtain the consent of Service Recipient (such
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) prior to
such Third Party Provider so providing such Service; provided further, that in
any case, Service Provider shall remain responsible for the performance by any
Third Party Provider of its obligations hereunder. 

| 
---|--- 

(d)

|

Increased Services. 

| 
---|--- 

(i)

|

Service Recipient may request additional quantities of Services beyond the
quantities specified in the applicable Services Schedule ("Increased
Services") from Service Provider by providing written notice. Service Provider
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to accommodate such request; it
being understood, however, that Service Provider shall not be required to
provide Increased Services if the Parties are unable to reach agreement on the
terms thereof. Upon the mutual written agreement as to the nature, cost
(including cost of additional equipment as stated in (ii) below), duration and
scope of such Increased Services, the Parties shall supplement in writing the
Services Schedules hereto to include such Increased Services. Service
Provider's obligations with respect to providing any such Increased Services
shall become effective only upon a new Services Schedule or an amendment to an
existing Services Schedule being duly executed by the Parties. 

| 
---|--- 

(ii)

|

Unless otherwise agreed by the Parties, if an Increased Service requires
Service Provider to purchase any machinery, equipment, apparatuses, computer
hardware and other electronic data processing and communications equipment,
tools, instruments, furniture, office equipment, automobiles, trucks, and
other transportation equipment, special and general tools, test devices,
molds, tooling, dies, prototypes and models and other tangible personal
property (collectively, "Equipment"), Service Recipient shall bear the costs
of such Equipment, which Service Provider will provide at cost. Upon the
termination of the applicable Service, such Equipment shall be assigned and
transferred to Service Recipient. 

| 
---|--- 

2.

|

PAYMENT 

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

Except as otherwise provided on the applicable Services Schedule, for each
Service, Service Recipient shall pay Service Provider an amount equal to the
Service Costs (as defined below) for all Services being provided to Service
Recipient. 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

Except as otherwise provided on the applicable Services Schedule, the "Service
Costs" for each Service shall be the cost set forth on the applicable Services
Schedule, which are intended to reflect the Historic Cost Allocation. The
Service Costs for any Service for which an agreed cost is not specified on the 

applicable Services Schedule shall be the Historic Cost Allocation for
providing such Service. "Historic Cost Allocation" shall mean the allocation
of costs associated with such Service reflected in the financial presentation
of the Computer Sciences GS Business set forth in the Form 10, as amended
through August 17, 2015, plus (to the extent not included in such allocated
costs) the following (but only to the extent allocable to the provision of the
Services):

| 
---|--- 

(i)

|

any reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Service Provider with Third
Party Providers in connection with the provision of Services, without markup
or fee, including to the extent applicable to the Services, one-time set-up
costs, license fees, costs to enter into third party agreements, costs to exit
third party agreements, termination fees, and other costs incurred in
connection with Third Party Providers providing Services in compliance with
this Agreement, and including pursuing any warranty or indemnity against a
Third Party Provider in accordance with Section 3(e); 

| 
---|--- 

(ii)

|

the cost of licenses for software or other intellectual property (or other
cost associated with obtaining rights to use software or intellectual
property) (a "Third Party License"), without markup or fee, including any
termination, transfer, sublicensing, access, upgrade or conversion fees; 

| 
---|--- 

(iii)

|

any sales, transfer, goods, services, value added, gross receipts or similar
taxes, fees, charges or assessments (including any such taxes that are
required to be withheld) arising out of such Service and incurred by Service
Provider; provided that the Parties agree to use commercially reasonable
efforts to minimize any such taxes, fees or assessments and Service Recipient
shall not be obligated to pay any income or franchise taxes imposed on the
Service Provider; and 

| 
---|--- 

(iv)

|

the cost of travel expenses that are reasonable and incurred in accordance
with Service Provider's normal travel policy and other reasonable
miscellaneous out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by Service Provider. 

| 
---|--- 

(c)

|

Except as otherwise provided on the applicable Services Schedule or required
by applicable Law, all amounts shall be invoiced and paid in U.S. Dollars. To
the extent necessary, local currency conversion on any such invoice shall be
based on Service Provider's internal exchange rate for the then-current month,
based upon the average for such month, as calculated consistently with how
such local currency conversion was calculated in the twelve-month period prior
to the Distribution Date. 

| 
---|--- 

(d)

|

With respect to any service that a Service Provider provides or causes an
Affiliate to provide to itself or its Affiliates that is the same or
substantially similar to a Service provided to Service Recipient or its
Subsidiaries hereunder (such service, a "Self-Service"), Service Provider may
stop providing such Self-Service to itself or its Affiliates as long as (i)
such termination does not adversely affect the ability of Service Provider to
deliver the Service to Service Recipient in accordance with the Performance
Standards and (ii) Service Provider notifies Service Recipient of such
termination as promptly as practicable and no later than ninety (90) days
prior to the date it intends to stop providing the Self-Service. Further, if
Service Provider terminates a Self-Service prior to the Termination Date
applicable for the corresponding Service, the Service Costs of such Service
following any such termination shall be calculated as if Service Provider had
not terminated such Self-Service. 
| 
---|--- 

(e)

|

Invoices and Payment. 

| 
---|--- 

(i)

|

Except as provided on the applicable Services Schedule, Service Provider shall
invoice Service Recipient for the Service Costs owed hereunder on a monthly
basis, with Service Costs for all Services provided by Service Provider, its
Affiliates or its Third Party Providers to Service Recipient in the last
fiscal period included on a combined single invoice, and shall provide
reasonable documentation supporting such Service Costs. Service Recipient
shall pay the amount of such invoice by electronic transfer of immediately
available funds not later than forty-five (45) days after the date of such
invoice. 

| 
---|--- 

(ii)

|

Neither Party nor any of its respective Affiliates shall have a right of set-
off against the other Party or its Subsidiaries, except in connection with any
amounts billed hereunder. 

| 
---|--- 

(iii)

|

In the event Service Recipient does not pay Service Provider in accordance
with the terms hereof (a) all amounts so payable and past due shall accrue
interest from the 31st day after the date of the invoice to the receipt of
payment at a rate per annum equal to the six (6)-month LIBOR rate (as shown on
the Reuters Screen LIBOR 01 Page (or on any successor or substitute of such
page) at approximately 11:00 a.m. on the 31st day after the date of the
invoice, or the next Business Day, if such day is not a Business Day) plus 3%
(the "Interest Rate", with the applicable rate to be recalculated every six
months), until such amounts, together with all accrued and unpaid interest
thereon, are paid in full, and (b) Service Recipient shall pay, as additional
fees, all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by Service
Provider in attempting to collect and collecting amounts so due, including all
reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. 

| 
---|--- 

(iv)

|

In the event that Service Recipient in good faith disputes an invoice
submitted by Service Provider, Service Recipient may withhold payment of any
amount subject to the dispute; provided that (a) Service Recipient shall
continue to pay all undisputed amounts in accordance with the terms hereof,
(b) Service Recipient shall notify Service Provider, in writing, of any
disputed amounts and the reason for any dispute by the due date for payment of
the invoice containing any disputed charges and (c) in the event any dispute
is resolved in Service Provider's favor, any amount that Service Recipient
should have paid shall be deemed to have accrued interest at the Interest Rate
from the date such payment should have been made. 

| 
---|--- 

(v)

|

In the event of a dispute regarding the amount of any invoice, the Parties
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to resolve such dispute within
forty-five (45) days after Service Recipient provides written notification of
such dispute to Service Provider. Each Party shall provide full supporting
documentation concerning any disputed amount or invoice within thirty (30)
days after written notification of the dispute. Unpaid fees that are under
good faith dispute shall not be considered a basis for default hereunder. To
the extent that a dispute regarding the amount of any invoice cannot be
resolved pursuant to this Section 2(e)(v), the dispute resolution procedures
set forth in Section 9 herein shall apply. 

| 
---|--- 

3.

|

COOPERATION 

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

Service Recipient and Service Provider shall cooperate and work together in
good faith to develop a global transition plan in order to facilitate a smooth
and orderly termination of a Service by its applicable Termination Date or at
such earlier time as Service Recipient terminates Service Provider's
performance of the Services in accordance with Section 11. 
| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

In furtherance of the foregoing, Service Provider, if requested and at Service
Recipient's expense, will provide Service Recipient with reasonable support
necessary to transition or migrate the services to Service Recipient or any
third party or parties chosen by Service Recipient, which may include, but not
be limited to, consulting and training and providing reasonable access to data
and other information and to Service Provider's and its Affiliates' employees;
provided that such activities shall not unduly burden or interfere with
Service Provider's business and operations. 

| 
---|--- 

(c)

|

It is understood that it will require significant efforts by the Parties to
implement this Agreement and ensure performance hereunder. Service Recipient
shall (i) cooperate with and provide Service Provider with such information
and documentation as is reasonably necessary for Service Provider to perform
the Services; and (ii) perform such other duties and tasks as may be
reasonably required to permit Service Provider to perform the Services,
including (x) cooperating in obtaining any consents or approvals from third
parties necessary to facilitate Service Provider's ability to provide the
Services and (y) conducting such testing as may be reasonably required by
Service Provider in connection with any updates or changes to the applicable
systems or processes involved in providing a Service; provided that Service
Provider has given Service Recipient such prior written notice as set forth in
the applicable Services Schedules or, if not contemplated therein, a
reasonable time before conducting such testing, taking into account the type
and scope of such testing. A Service Provider shall not be deemed to be in
breach of its obligations to provide or make available any Service to the
extent that Service Recipient has not provided information and access to
appropriate personnel that is reasonably necessary for the performance of such
Service. 

| 
---|--- 

(d)

|

Service Provider shall use commercially reasonable efforts to make or obtain
any approvals, permits and licenses and implement any systems as may be
necessary for it to perform the Services independently as soon as practicable
following the Distribution Date. 

| 
---|--- 

(e)

|

Upon Service Recipient's written request and without prejudice to any direct
rights Service Recipient may have against a Third Party Provider or Service
Provider, Service Provider shall use commercially reasonable efforts to pursue
any warranty or indemnity under any contract Service Provider or its
Affiliates may have with a Third Party Provider with respect to any Service
provided to Service Recipient by such Third Party Service Provider. 

| 
---|--- 

(f)

|

Service Provider shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, if
required, any Third Party License or consent required by any Third Party
Provider to provide the applicable Service to Service Recipient, and Service
Recipient shall, as necessary, cooperate with Service Provider in obtaining
any such Third Party License or consent. If such Third Party License or
consent cannot be obtained on commercially reasonable terms, the Parties will
use commercially reasonable efforts to arrange for an alternative method of
obtaining any such Service on Service Recipient's behalf ("Alternative
Method"), which may include Service Provider providing such Service itself. If
there is any Third Party License or consent which was not required as of the
date hereof but will subsequently be required before the Termination Date for
a particular Service, Service Provider shall identify in writing to Service
Recipient such Third Party License or consent within sixty (60) days of the
date hereof and in any event no later than thirty (30) days prior to the date
such Third Party License or consent is required. 

| 
---|--- 

(g)

|

The Parties shall use the fiscal quarter and year ends as set forth in
Schedule C in connection with the provision and receipt of applicable Services
hereunder, for so long as such Services are being provided. 

| 
---|--- 

4.

|

PERFORMANCE STANDARDS; REPORTS; PERSONNEL 
| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

Services shall be provided in accordance with the Performance Standards and
applicable Law. 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

It will not be deemed to be a breach of this Agreement if Service Provider
fails to meet the Performance Standards because of (i) the failure of Service
Recipient to reasonably cooperate with or provide information, facilities,
equipment, hardware or software, services or decisions to Service Provider as
required hereunder, (ii) changes reasonably deemed to be required by changes
in Law, technology or the availability of reasonably commercially available
products and services, (iii) changes otherwise permitted hereunder, (iv)
changes to the relevant systems, processes or personnel of Service Recipient,
to the extent Service Provider's failure to meet the Performance Standards is
the direct result of such changes, or (v) Force Majeure as further provided in
Section 8. 

| 
---|--- 

(c)

|

Service Provider shall not make changes in the manner of providing a Service
unless (i) Service Provider is making similar changes in a Self-Service being
performed for itself or its Subsidiaries or such changes are de minimis, in
each case so long as such changes do not prevent Service Provider from meeting
the Performance Standards, (ii) such changes are required by Service Provider
or Service Recipient pursuant to applicable Law, or (iii) Service Recipient
provides its prior written consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed) to such changes (in each case, for the avoidance of
doubt, with the costs of any such change to be included in the calculation of
Service Costs). 

| 
---|--- 

(d)

|

Service Provider shall not be required to provide any Service that would be
constitute a breach of applicable Law, including any applicable U.S. and
non-U.S. Laws and regulations relating to the protection of classified and
critical unclassified information, export controls, sanctions, and imports,
including those regulations maintained by the U.S. Department of the
Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control, the Export Administration
Regulations maintained by the U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry
and Security, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the International Traffic
in Arms Regulations maintained by the U.S. Department of State, Directorate of
Defense Trade Controls. 

| 
---|--- 

(e)

|

Except as provided in the applicable Services Schedule for a Service, in
providing, or causing to be provided, the Services, Service Provider shall
only provide employees or agents of Service Recipient with access to systems
or software to the extent that such employees or agents of Service Recipient
or its Subsidiaries had authorized access immediately prior to the
Distribution Date, or are replacement employees or agents of Service Recipient
or its Subsidiaries. 

| 
---|--- 

(f)

|

Unless otherwise set forth in the applicable Services Schedule and except as
may be otherwise required (or prohibited) by applicable Law, in performing the
Services, Service Provider shall, if requested to do so in writing by Service
Recipient, prepare and furnish to Service Recipient reports concerning the
Services, which reports shall contain substantially the same data, in
substantially the same format, and prepared and delivered on substantially the
same timetable, as reports prepared by Service Provider with respect to such
Services during the six month period prior to the Distribution Date (excluding
any reports solely prepared in contemplation of the Distribution). Upon
Service Recipient's written request for modifications to the reporting and
data transfer practices reasonably required to assist Service Recipient in
transitioning off the Service, Service Provider shall cooperate and consult in
good faith with Service Recipient to make such modifications; provided that if
Service Provider reasonably determines in its sole discretion that any such
modification may cause Service Provider to be in breach of its other
obligations to Service Recipient, then Service Provider shall not be under any
obligation to make such modifications. 

| 
---|--- 

(g)

|

Service Provider shall make available such personnel as may be required to
provide the Services, including any specific personnel designated on the
applicable Services Schedule. Except as otherwise 

provided in the applicable Services Schedule, Service Provider shall have the
right to designate which personnel it will assign to perform the Services.
Service Provider also shall have the right to remove and replace any such
personnel at any time or designate any of its Affiliates or a Third Party
Provider (subject to Section 1(c) herein) at any time to perform the
Transition Services; provided that Service Provider shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts consistent with past practice to limit the disruption to
Service Recipient in the transition of the Services to different personnel;
provided further that if a Services Schedule designates a certain person as a
"key personnel", if such person is no longer in the employ of the Service
Provider or its Affiliates or is otherwise not available to perform the
Services, then the portion of such Service performed by such person may be
terminated by Service Recipient upon fifteen (15) days prior written notice to
Service Provider, even if prior to the end of the Minimum Service Period.
Except as set forth in the Services Schedules, Service Provider shall have no
obligation to retain any individual employee for the sole purpose of providing
a particular Service. In the event Service Recipient requires that a Service
be provided or facilitated by personnel who are U.S. citizens or lawful
permanent resident aliens, Service Provider shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to accommodate the request at no additional charge.

| 
---|--- 

(h)

|

In the event Service Recipient or any of its Affiliates hires an employee of
Service Provider or its Affiliates, and such employee was material to
providing Services to Service Recipient, Service Provider shall have the
option, in its sole discretion (in addition to any other remedies available to
it under the Master Separation and Distribution Agreement or otherwise), upon
ten (10) Business Days' written notice to Service Recipient to suspend its
obligations with respect to the Services performed by the hired employee (with
a reduction in the applicable Service Costs associated with the hired
employee) effective on the date of such employee's termination of employment
with Service Provider. Any provision of Service following a reduction in
Service Provider's obligations pursuant to this Section shall be deemed to be
consistent with Service Provider's obligations under this Agreement, so long
as Service Provider satisfies the Performance Standards and the obligations
contained in this Section 4 with respect to such Service. 

| 
---|--- 

(i)

|

Each Party agrees that it shall be responsible for compliance by its personnel
(including any Third Party Provider) performing or otherwise involved with
Services with all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement. 

| 
---|--- 

(j)

|

Each Party shall notify the other Party in writing as promptly as practicable
after becoming aware of any default or breach of this Agreement committed by
either it or the other Party. Service Provider shall notify Service Recipient
of any event that may reasonably be expected to materially impact a Service
provided hereunder. 

| 
---|--- 

(k)

|

In the event Service Provider has received a written notice of default or
breach in the performance of a Service hereunder (including as a result of
material error(s) in the performance of such Service), it will use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cure such default or breach. In the event
Service Provider is unable to cure such breach or default within thirty (30)
days from receipt of notice thereof, in addition to the rights available under
Section 11, there shall be an adjustment to Service Costs to reflect the costs
to Service Recipient associated with such default, breach or error, including
any incremental reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by
Service Recipient in retaining any Third Party Provider to provide such
Service or in providing such Service itself during the minimum period required
to be provided by Service Provider. 

| 
---|--- 

5.

|

NEW SERVICES 

If, after the date hereof and on or prior to the 90th day following the
Distribution Date, the Parties mutually determine that a service required by
Service Recipient and provided by Service Provider or one of its Subsidiaries
prior to the Distribution Date was omitted from the Services Schedules,
Service Recipient may request that Service Provider perform such service ("New
Service") in addition to the Services being provided hereunder. Service
Provider shall promptly begin performing any New Service consistent with past
practice upon a timely written request from Service Recipient (which request
may be in the form of email) that includes (a) a description of the New
Service, and (b) a schedule for commencing and completing such New Service.
Thereafter, Service Provider and Service Recipient shall enter into good faith
negotiations to agree to an amendment to the Services Schedules providing for
such New Service; provided that if no agreement for an Additional Service
Schedule Amendment has been reached in writing in thirty (30) days, such New
Service shall be deemed to have a Termination Date of one year from the
Distribution Date, with Service Costs as provided for in Section 2(a),
calculated as if the amendment to the Services Schedule for such New Service
were silent regarding costs and expenses (such amendment or deemed amendment
pursuant to the foregoing proviso, an "Additional Service Schedule
Amendment"). Any New Service shall be considered a Service hereunder and the
Services Schedules shall incorporate, and be deemed to be duly amended by,
such Additional Service Schedule Amendment.

| 
---|--- 

6.

|

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY; IT SECURITY 

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

Service Recipient agrees to comply with, and to cause its Subsidiaries to
comply with, the terms of any license or other agreement of Service Provider
or any of its Affiliates relating to software that is provided to Service
Recipient and is used in connection with the provision of any Services
hereunder; provided that in the event that Service Provider enters into new
software licenses after the Distribution Date, Service Recipient shall have
the prior opportunity to review and confirm its ability to comply therewith,
which it shall do reasonably and in good faith. In the event that Service
Recipient provides written notice of its inability to comply therewith,
Service Provider may in its sole discretion suspend its provision of any
Services under such new software licenses effective after thirty (30) days'
notice of the same. While such Service is suspended, Service Provider shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to identify alternative software with
accompanying licenses acceptable to Service Recipient. Upon entering into new
software licenses acceptable to Service Recipient, Service Provider shall
resume or commence providing Service. Service Recipient shall indemnify
Service Provider for any claims by third parties arising out of or in
connection with Service Recipient's noncompliance with or violation of
software licenses relating to software that is provided to Service Recipient
and is used in connection with the provision of any Services hereunder;
provided that Service Recipient will not be obligated to indemnify Service
Provider for any software that is the subject of an above-described notice of
inability to comply with license after the date that Service Provider receives
such notice. Subject to the foregoing, the Parties shall cooperate to identify
any material licenses or consents necessary for such provision and shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to minimize the costs associated therewith. 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

If the receipt or provision of any Service hereunder requires the use by a
Party of the Intellectual Property (other than Trademarks) of the other Party,
then such Party and its Affiliates shall have the non-exclusive, royalty-free,
non-sublicensable (except as required for its and its Affiliates' receipt or
provision of Services) right and license to use such Intellectual Property for
the sole purpose of, and only to the extent necessary for, the receipt or
provision of such Services hereunder, pursuant to the terms and conditions of

responsibility for failure to fulfill any obligation (other than a payment

as a consequence of circumstances of Force Majeure. A Party claiming the
benefit of this provision shall, as soon as reasonably practicable after the
occurrence of any such event: (a) notify the other Party of the nature and
extent of any such Force Majeure condition and (b) use commercially reasonable
efforts to remove any 

such causes and resume performance under this Agreement as soon as feasible.

(or such other executive as designated by the General Counsel of such Party),
who shall attempt within a period of fifteen (15) days following the end of
such previous thirty (30) day period to conclusively resolve any such issue,
and in the event the dispute remains unresolved following such fifteen (15)
day period, the dispute may be submitted to mediation in accordance with
Section 9.2 (Mediation) of the Master Separation and Distribution Agreement,
and if any dispute remains unresolved after the Mediation Period, such dispute
shall be determined, at the request of either Party, by arbitration in
accordance with Section 9.3 (Arbitration) of the Master Separation and
Distribution Agreement and the other applicable provisions of Section 9
(Dispute Resolution) of the Master Separation and Distribution Agreement.
Nothing in this Section 9 or any provision of the Master Separation and

any court of competent jurisdiction for interim measures or other provisional
relief in connection with the subject matter of any disputes.

---|--- 

(c)

|

In the event of any dispute between the Parties regarding a Service, prior to

TERM OF AGREEMENT AND SERVICE TERMINATION DATES 

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

This Agreement (other than Sections 9, 10, 11 and 13) shall terminate upon the
last of the Termination Dates in respect of all Services to be provided
hereunder; provided that the rights of the Parties in respect of any claims
that have accrued prior to such termination shall survive such termination. 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

For each Service, the "Termination Date" shall be the date specified for a
Service on the applicable Services Schedule; provided that the Parties may
mutually agree to extend any Service for a reasonable period and such Service
may be terminated earlier as provided in this Agreement or in the applicable
Services Schedule. 

| 
---|--- 

(c)

|

For each Service, the minimum service period ("Minimum Service Period"), if
any, during which Service Recipient is obligated to receive such Service is
set forth in each Service Schedule. 

| 
---|--- 

(i)

|

Service Recipient may terminate any Service on or after its Minimum Service
Period and prior to its Termination Date by providing to Service Provider
written notice of termination, which shall be deemed irrevocable upon delivery
(a "Termination Notice"), by the date as set forth in the applicable Services
Schedule, or if no such date is specified, not less than thirty (30) days
before the date of such earlier termination or as otherwise may be mutually
agreed to by the Parties; provided that if the Services Schedule indicates
that any Service is dependent on one or more other Services, then each such
Service must be terminated together; provided further that any termination may
be on a location by location basis if so indicated on the Services Schedules.
If no Minimum Service Period is provided in a particular Services Schedule,
such Service may be terminated by Service Recipient at any time before its
Termination Date as may be mutually agreed by the Parties. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, unless the Parties otherwise agree, each
Minimum Service Period shall be sixty (60) days. 

| 
---|--- 

(ii)

|

Upon the receipt of a Termination Notice, if Service Provider is unable to
transition the applicable Service to the Service Recipient or its designee in
a commercially reasonable manner which does not unduly disrupt the Service on
the requested termination date, Service Provider shall use commercially
reasonable efforts consistent with past practice to transition such Service as
soon as possible, and any resulting third party, out-of-pocket costs to
Service Recipient shall be shared equally between Service Provider and Service
Recipient. 

| 
---|--- 

(d)

|

In the event either Party breaches or defaults in the performance of a
Service, and if such breach or default is not cured within thirty (30) days
after written notice from the other Party specifying such breach or default as
provided in Sections 4(j) and (k), then the Service Recipient may at any time
thereafter terminate, at its option, any such Service that is the subject of
such default by giving five (5) days prior written notice to Service Provider. 

|

either of them an agent or legal representative of the other for any purpose

authority to assume or create any obligation or responsibilities, express or
implied, on behalf of or in the name of any other Party, or to bind any other
Party in any manner whatsoever. The Parties expressly acknowledge (a) that
Service Provider is an independent contractor with respect to Service
Recipient in all respects, including the provision of the Services, and (b)

confidentiality obligations. In connection with any permitted disclosure of
this Agreement to any third party, each Party shall redact the portions of the
Services Schedules that are not relevant to such third party's inquiry. 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

It is further understood and agreed that money damages may not be a sufficient
remedy for any breach of this Section 13 and that each Party shall be entitled
to seek equitable relief, including injunction and specific performance, as
remedy for any such breach. Such remedies shall not be deemed to be the
exclusive remedies for a breach, but shall be in addition to all other
remedies herein described available at Law or equity.

otherwise, except that any Service Recipient Indemnitees or Service Provider
Indemnitees shall be intended third-party beneficiaries of Section 10(b). Each
Party agrees, and each Party in its capacity as a Service Recipient represents
and warrants, that the Services shall be provided solely to, and shall be used
solely by, Service Recipient and its Subsidiaries. Service Recipient shall not
resell or provide the Services to any other Person, or permit the use of the

this Agreement may be waived, if but only if such amendment or waiver is in
writing and signed, in the case of an amendment, by each of the Parties, or in
the case of a waiver, by the Party against whom the waiver is effective. No
failure or delay by either Party in exercising any right, power or privilege

time. Any other proper business may be transacted at the annual meeting.

1.2

|

Special Meetings 

Special meetings of stockholders for any purpose or purposes may be called at
any time by the Board of Directors, or by a committee of the Board of

Notice of Meetings 

Whenever stockholders are required or permitted to take any action at a
meeting, a written notice of the meeting shall be given that shall state the
place, date and hour of the meeting and, in the case of a special meeting, the

by law, the certificate of incorporation or these by-laws, the written notice
of any meeting shall be given not fewer than ten nor more than sixty days
before the date of the meeting to each stockholder entitled to vote at such
meeting. If mailed, such notice shall be deemed to be given when deposited in
the United States mail, postage prepaid, directed to the stockholder at his
address as it appears on the records of the corporation.

| 
---|--- 

1.4

|

Adjournments 

Any meeting of stockholders, annual or special, may adjourn from time to time
to reconvene at the same or some other place, and notice need not be given of
any such adjourned meeting if the time and place thereof are announced at the
meeting at which the adjournment is taken. At the adjourned meeting the
corporation may transact any business that might have been transacted at the
original meeting. If the adjournment is for more than thirty days, or if after
the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, notice
of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled
to vote at the meeting.

| 
---|--- 

1.5

|

Quorum 

Except as otherwise provided by law, the certificate of incorporation or these
by-laws, at each meeting of stockholders the presence in person or by proxy of
the holders of shares of stock having a majority of the votes that could be
cast by the holders of all outstanding shares of stock entitled to vote at the
meeting shall be necessary and sufficient to constitute a quorum. In the
absence of a quorum, the stockholders so 

present may, by majority vote, adjourn the meeting from time to time in the
manner provided in Section 1.4 of these by-laws until a quorum shall attend.
Shares of its own stock belonging to the corporation or to another
corporation, if a majority of the shares entitled to vote in the election of
directors of such other corporation is held, directly or indirectly, by the
corporation, shall neither be entitled to vote nor be counted for quorum
purposes; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not limit the right of
the corporation to vote stock, including but not limited to its own stock,
held by it in a fiduciary capacity.

| 
---|--- 

1.6

|

Organization 

Meetings of stockholders shall be presided over by the Chairman of the Board,
if any, or in his absence by the Vice Chairman of the Board, if any, or in his
absence by the President, or in his absence by a Vice President, or in the
absence of the foregoing persons by a chairman designated by the Board of
Directors, or in the absence of such designation by a chairman chosen at the
meeting. The Secretary shall act as secretary of the meeting, but in his
absence the chairman of the meeting may appoint any person to act as secretary
of the meeting. The chairman of the meeting shall announce at the meeting of
stockholders the date and time of the opening and the closing of the polls for
each matter upon which the stockholders will vote.

| 
---|--- 

1.7

|

Voting; Proxies 

Except as otherwise provided by the certificate of incorporation, each
stockholder entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders shall be entitled
to one vote for each share of stock held by him that has voting power upon the
matter in question. Each stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of
stockholders or to express consent or dissent to corporate action in writing
without a meeting may authorize another person or persons to act for him by
proxy, but no such proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three years from
its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period. A proxy shall be
irrevocable if it states that it is irrevocable and if, and only as long as,
it is coupled with an interest sufficient in law to support an irrevocable
power. A stockholder may revoke any proxy that is not irrevocable by attending
the meeting and voting in person or by filing an instrument in writing
revoking the proxy or by delivering a proxy in accordance with applicable law
bearing a later date to the Secretary of the corporation. Voting at meetings
of stockholders need not be by written ballot and, unless otherwise required
by law, need not be conducted by inspectors of election unless so determined
by the holders of shares of stock having a majority of the votes that could be
cast by the holders of all outstanding shares of stock entitled to vote
thereon that are present in person or by proxy at such meeting. At all
meetings of stockholders for the election of directors a plurality of the
votes cast shall be sufficient to elect. All other elections and questions
shall, unless otherwise provided by law, the certificate of incorporation or
these by-laws, be decided by the vote of the holders of shares of stock having
a majority of the votes that could be cast by the holders of all shares of
stock outstanding and entitled to vote thereon.

| 
---|--- 

1.8

|

Fixing Date for Determination of Stockholders of Record 

In order that the corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to
notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment
thereof, or to express consent to corporate action in writing without a
meeting, or entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution
or allotment of any rights, or entitled to exercise any rights in respect of
any change, conversion or exchange of stock or for the purpose of any other
lawful action, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date
shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is
adopted by the Board of Directors and which record date: (1) in the case of
determination of stockholders entitled to vote at any meeting of 

stockholders or adjournment thereof, shall, unless otherwise required by law,
not be more than sixty nor fewer than ten days before the date of such
meeting; (2) in the case of determination of stockholders entitled to express
consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, shall not be more
than ten days from the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date
is adopted by the Board of Directors; and (3) in the case of any other action,
shall not be more than sixty days prior to such other action. If no record
date is fixed: (1) the record date for determining stockholders entitled to
notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of
business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if
notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day
on which the meeting is held; (2) the record date for determining stockholders
entitled to express consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting
when no prior action of the Board of Directors is required by law, shall be
the first date on which a signed written consent setting forth the action
taken or proposed to be taken is delivered to the corporation in accordance
with applicable law, or, if prior action by the Board of Directors is required
by law, shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board of
Directors adopts the resolution taking such prior action; and (3) the record
date for determining stockholders for any other purpose shall be at the close
of business on the day on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution
relating thereto. A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice
of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of
the meeting; provided, however, that the Board of Directors may fix a new
record date for the adjourned meeting.

| 
---|--- 

1.9

|

List of Stockholders Entitled to Vote 

The Secretary shall prepare and make, at least ten days before every meeting
of stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at the
meeting, arranged in alphabetical order, and showing the address of each
stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of each
stockholder. Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder,
for any purpose germane to the meeting, during ordinary business hours, for a
period of at least ten days prior to the meeting, either at a place within the
city where the meeting is to be held, which place shall be specified in the
notice of the meeting, or if not so specified, at the place where the meeting
is to be held. The list shall also be produced and kept at the time and place
of the meeting during the whole time thereof and may be inspected by any
stockholder who is present. Upon the willful neglect or refusal of the
directors to produce such a list at any meeting for the election of directors,
they shall be ineligible for election to any office at such meeting. The stock
ledger shall be the only evidence as to who are the stockholders entitled to
examine the stock ledger, the list of stockholders or the books of the
corporation, or to vote in person or by proxy at any meeting of stockholders.

1.10

Action By Consent of Stockholders 

Unless otherwise restricted by the certificate of incorporation, any action
required or permitted to be taken at any annual or special meeting of the
stockholders may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice and without
a vote, if a consent or consents in writing, setting forth the action so
taken, shall be signed by the holders of outstanding stock having not less
than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take
such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were
present and voted and shall be delivered (by hand or by certified or
registered mail, return receipt requested) to the corporation by delivery to
its registered office in the State of Delaware, its principal place of
business, or an officer or agent of the corporation having custody of the book
in which proceedings of minutes of stockholders are recorded. Prompt notice of
the taking of the corporate action 

without a meeting by less than unanimous written consent shall be given to
those stockholders who have not consented in writing.

| 
---|--- 

1.11

|

Conduct of Meetings 

The Board of Directors of the corporation may adopt by resolution such rules
and regulations for the conduct of the meeting of stockholders as it shall
deem appropriate. Except to the extent inconsistent with such rules and
regulations as adopted by the Board of Directors, the chairman of any meeting
of stockholders shall have the right and authority to prescribe such rules,
regulations and procedures and to do all such acts as, in the judgment of such
chairman, are appropriate for the proper conduct of the meeting. Such rules,
regulations or procedures, whether adopted by the Board of Directors or
prescribed by the chairman of the meeting, may include, without limitation,
the following: (i) the establishment of an agenda or order of business for the
meeting; (ii) rules and procedures for maintaining order at the meeting and

otherwise.

|

Other Indemnification 

The corporation\'s obligation, if any, to indemnify any person who was or is
serving at its request as a director, officer, employee or agent of another

Waiver of Notice of Meetings of Stockholders, Directors and Committees 

Any written waiver of notice, signed by the person entitled to notice, whether
before or after the time stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent to notice.
Attendance of a person at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of
such meeting, except when the person attends a meeting for the express purpose
of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any
business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Neither the
business to be transacted at nor the purpose of any regular or special meeting
of the stockholders, directors, or members of a committee of directors need be
specified in any written waiver of notice.

| 
---|--- 

7.4

|

Interested Directors; Quorum 

No contract or transaction between the corporation and one or more of its
directors or officers, or between the corporation and any other corporation,
partnership, association, or other organization in which one or more of its
directors or officers are directors or officers, or have a financial interest,
shall be void or voidable solely for this reason, or solely because the
director or officer is present at or participates in the meeting of the Board
of Directors or committee thereof which authorizes the contract or
transaction, or solely because his or their votes are counted for such
purpose, if: (1) the material facts as to his relationship or interest and as
to the contract or transaction are disclosed or are known to the Board of
Directors or the committee, and the Board of Directors or committee in good
faith authorizes the contract or transaction by the affirmative votes of a
majority of the disinterested directors, even though the disinterested
directors be less than a quorum; or (2) the material facts as to his
relationship or interest and as to the contract or transaction are disclosed
or are known to the stockholders entitled to vote thereon, and the contract or
transaction is specifically approved in good faith by vote of the
stockholders; or (3) the contract or transaction is fair as to the corporation
as of the time it is authorized, approved or ratified, by the Board of
Directors, a committee thereof, or the stockholders. Common or interested
directors may be counted in determining the presence of a quorum at a meeting
of the Board of Directors or of a committee which authorizes the contract or
transaction.

ACTION TO BE TAKEN

| 
---|--- 

•

|

Pursuant to the merger to be effected under that certain Agreement and Plan of
Merger (the "Agreement") dated as of August [l], 2015 by and among Computer
Sciences Corporation, Computer Sciences Government Services Inc. ("Computer
Sciences GS"), Star Second Merger Sub LLC, Star First Merger Sub Inc., SRA,
SRA International, Inc. and the holders of common stock of SRA set forth on
Schedule 1 of the Agreement, all of the Shares will be cancelled. The amount
distributed by Computer Sciences Government Services Inc. at the consummation
of the Merger (the "Closing") after giving effect to the adjustments described
below shall be the "Merger Consideration." The exact amount of Merger
Consideration to be distributed per share for Shares issued and outstanding
cannot be determined at this time because such calculation will depend upon
the number of outstanding Shares at the Closing (including Shares issued in
connection with the cashless exercise of vested stock options prior to
Closing) and the amount of any valid indemnification claims deducted from any
escrow account established in connection with the Merger (the "Escrow
Account"). 

| 
---|--- 

•

|

Because a portion of the Merger Consideration paid at Closing may be held in
the Escrow Account until resolution of any matters for which indemnification
may be provided by the stockholders of SRA under the Agreement (each, an
"Indemnified Matter"), holders of the Shares may not receive the full amount
of the per share consideration shortly after the Closing. In such event and
subject to reduction for indemnification claims satisfied out of any escrowed
funds, holders of the Shares would then receive the balance of the Merger
Consideration owed to them with respect to the Escrow Account promptly after
resolution of the Indemnified Matter. 

| 
---|--- 

•

|

To receive payment for your Shares, you must complete and sign page 4 of this
Form, by following the instructions and notes for guidance set out on pages 3,
5 and 6. All Merger Consideration will be paid by either check or wire

IMPORTANT TAX INFORMATION

A stockholder that is a United States Person whose tendered Shares are
accepted for payment is required to provide Computer Sciences GS (as payer) a
properly completed IRS Form W-9 (or the Substitute Form W-9 provided herewith)
to avoid federal income tax backup withholding. If such stockholder is an
individual, such stockholder's TIN is generally his or her social security
number. If Computer Sciences GS is not provided with the correct TIN, the
stockholder may be subject to a $50 penalty imposed by the Internal Revenue
Service and payments that are made to such stockholder may be subject to
backup withholding of 28%. In addition, if a stockholder makes a false
statement that results in no imposition of backup withholding, and there was
no reasonable basis for making such statement, a $500 penalty may also be
imposed by the Internal Revenue Service.

A stockholder that is NOT a United States Person must submit a properly
completed Internal Revenue Service Form W-8, which is available from the
website of the Internal Revenue Service at http://www.irs.gov. Such
stockholder should consult his or her tax advisor with respect to submission
of the appropriate IRS Form W-8.

If backup withholding applies, Computer Sciences GS is required to withhold
28% of any payments made to the stockholder. Backup withholding is not an
additional tax. Rather, the federal income tax liability of a person subject
to backup withholding will be reduced by the amount of tax withheld. If
withholding results in an overpayment of taxes, a refund may be obtained
provided that the required information is furnished to the Internal Revenue
Service.

A stockholder is required to give Computer Sciences GS the TIN (e.g., social
security number or employer identification number) of the record holder of
Shares tendered hereby. If Shares are in more than one name or are not in the
name of the actual owner, consult the enclosed "Guidelines for Certification
of Taxpayer Identification Number on Substitute Form W-9" on pages 10-11 of
this Form for additional guidance on which number to report. If the tendering
stockholder has not been issued a TIN and has applied for a number or intends
to apply for a number in the near future, the stockholder should write
"Applied For" in the space provided for the TIN in Part I, and sign and date
the Substitute Form W-9. If "Applied For" is written in Part I, Computer
Sciences GS will withhold 28% of any payments made to the stockholder until a
TIN is provided to Computer Sciences GS and, if Computer Sciences GS is not
provided with a TIN within 60 days, such amounts will be paid over to the
Internal Revenue Service.



AN IRS FORM W-9 OR THIS SUBSTITUTE FORM W-9 BELOW MUST BE COMPLETED AND SIGNED
BY ALL UNITED STATES PERSONS (See Instruction 11). Please provide your social
security number or other taxpayer identification number ("TIN") and certify
that you are not subject to backup withholding.
