<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prospect has formed a wholly owned subsidiary, Merger Sub, solely for the purposes of the merger of Merger Sub with and into KW
pursuant to Section&nbsp;251 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>DGCL</I></B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"), in which KW will be the surviving corporation (the
"</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>Merger</I></B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>"</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>). </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
board of directors of KW has declared this Agreement advisable and fair to, and in the best interests of, KW. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Merger requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share of KW (the
"</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>KW Common Stock</I></B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>") and (ii)&nbsp;the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of common stock of Prospect, par value $0.0001 per
share (the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>Prospect Common Stock</I></B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>") sold in the Prospect Public Offering voted at the Prospect Stockholders' Meeting, </FONT> <FONT SIZE=2><I>provided</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>, that the Merger will
only proceed if holders of fewer than 30% of the shares of the Prospect Common Stock sold in the Prospect Public Offering
exercise their conversion rights. Prior to the Closing, the holders of the convertible preferred stock of KW (the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>KW Preferred Stock</I></B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>" and collectively
with the KW Common Stock, the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>KW Securities</I></B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"), will agree to amend the Certificate of Designation of the KW Preferred Stock to provide that, upon the
Closing, each share of KW Preferred Stock will be converted into the right to receive shares of Prospect Common Stock at the Preferred Stock Exchange Ratio. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concurrently
with the execution of this Agreement, Prospect, the Prospect Founders, De Guardiola Advisors,&nbsp;Inc. ("</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>DGA</I></B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"), De
Guardiola Advisors Holdings,&nbsp;Inc. ("</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>DGAH</I></B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>") and KW are entering into a letter agreement, of even date herewith (the
"</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>Forfeiture Agreement</I></B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"), in the form attached hereto as </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>Exhibit&nbsp;A</I></B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>, pursuant to which, subject to
the terms and conditions set forth therein (i)&nbsp;the Prospect Founders have agreed to the forfeiture and cancellation of 2.575&nbsp;million shares of Prospect Common Stock and
(ii)&nbsp;Prospect has agreed to issue to DGAH an aggregate of 375,000 shares of Prospect Common Stock upon the closing of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in satisfaction of an
obligation of Prospect under its engagement letter with DGA. </FONT></P>

imposed against the Indemnitee or if such settlement does not expressly and unconditionally release the Indemnitee from all liabilities and obligations with respect to such claim. If the Indemnitor
assumes such defense, the Indemnitor shall not be liable for any amount required to be paid by the Indemnitee that exceeds, where the Indemnitee has unreasonably withheld or delayed consent in
connection with the proposed compromise or settlement of a third party claim, the amount for which that third party claim could have been settled pursuant to that proposed compromise or settlement. In
all cases, the Indemnitee shall provide its reasonable cooperation with the Indemnitor in defense of claims or litigation, including by making employees, information and documentation reasonably
available. If the Indemnitor shall not assume the defense of any such action, lawsuit, proceeding, investigation or other claim, the Indemnitee may defend against such matter as it deems appropriate;

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
the Accountants determine that aggregate Payments should be reduced to the Reduced Amount, the Company shall promptly give Employee notice to that effect and a copy

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As
a result of the uncertainty in the application of Section&nbsp;4999 of the Code at the time of the initial determination by the Accountants hereunder, it is

or distributed by the Company to or for the benefit of Employee could have been so paid or distributed ("Underpayment"), in each case, consistent with the calculation of the Reduced Amount hereunder.
In the event that the Accountants, based upon the assertion of a deficiency by the Internal Revenue Service against either the Company or Employee which the Accountants believe has a high probability
of success, determine that an Overpayment has been made, Employee shall pay any such Overpayment to the Company together with interest at the applicable federal rate provided for in
Section&nbsp;7872(f)(2) of the Code; provided, however, that no amount shall be payable by Employee to the Company if and to the extent such payment would not either reduce the amount on which
Employee is subject to tax under Section&nbsp;1 and Section&nbsp;4999 of the Code or generate a refund of such taxes. In the event that the Accountants determine that an Underpayment has occurred,

Code. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;"Net
After-Tax Receipt" shall mean the present value (as determined in accordance with Sections&nbsp;280G(b)(2)(A)(ii) and 280G(d)(4) of the Code) of all
Payments net of all taxes imposed on Employee with respect thereto under the Code and under applicable state and local laws, determined by applying the highest marginal rate under Section&nbsp;1 of
the Code and under state and local laws which applied to Employee's taxable income for the immediately preceding taxable year, or such other rate(s) as Employee certifies, in Employee's sole
discretion, as likely to apply to him in the relevant tax year(s). </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subject
to the last sentence of this subsection&nbsp;(e), all determinations made by the Accountants under this Section&nbsp;15 shall be conclusive and binding upon
the Company and Employee for all purposes. All fees and expenses of the Accountants shall be borne solely by the Company. For purposes of making the calculations required by this Section&nbsp;15,
the Accountants may make reasonable assumptions and approximations concerning applicable taxes and may rely on reasonable, good faith interpretations concerning the application of Sections&nbsp;280G
and 4999 of the Code. The Company and Employee will furnish to the Accountants such information and documents as the Accountants may reasonably request in order to make determinations under this
Section&nbsp;15. In the event that Employee disagrees with the determination of the Accountants under this Section&nbsp;15, he can have such determination reviewed pursuant to the alternative
dispute resolution currently set forth in the employment agreement between the Company and Donald J. Herrema, most recently amended as
of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;, 2009. If such mechanism is used, review shall

Company will promptly advise the Employee and will reasonably and in good faith amend the terms of such arrangement such that it is exempt or complies (with the most limited possible economic effect
on the Employee and on Company) or to minimize any additional tax, interest and/or penalties that may apply under Section&nbsp;409A if exemption or compliance is not practicable. Company agrees that

Section&nbsp;409A ("Nonqualified Deferred Compensation") and (ii)&nbsp;cannot be paid or provided in a manner otherwise provided herein without subjecting the Employee to additional tax, interest

to be provided pursuant to this Employment Agreement or otherwise, and including, without limitation, the post-termination payments and benefits provided pursuant to Section&nbsp;11(c)

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
the Accountants determine that aggregate Payments should be reduced to the Reduced Amount, the Company shall promptly give Employee notice to that effect and a copy

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As
a result of the uncertainty in the application of Section&nbsp;4999 of the Code at the time of the initial determination by the Accountants hereunder, it is

or distributed by the Company to or for the benefit of Employee could have been so paid or distributed ("Underpayment"), in each case, consistent with the calculation of the Reduced Amount hereunder.
In the event that the Accountants, based upon the assertion of a deficiency by the Internal Revenue Service against either the Company or Employee which the Accountants believe has a high probability
of success, determine that an Overpayment has been made, Employee shall pay any such Overpayment to the Company together with interest at the applicable federal rate provided for in
Section&nbsp;7872(f)(2) of the Code; provided, however, that no amount shall be payable by Employee to the Company if and to the extent such payment would not either reduce the amount on which
Employee is subject to tax under Section&nbsp;1 and Section&nbsp;4999 of the Code or generate a refund of such taxes. In the event that the Accountants determine that an Underpayment has occurred,
any such Underpayment shall be promptly paid by the Company to or for the benefit of Employee together with interest at the applicable federal rate provided for in Section&nbsp;7872(f)(2) of the
Code. </FONT></P>

Code. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;"Net

Payments net of all taxes imposed on Employee with respect thereto under the Code and under applicable state and local laws, determined by applying the highest marginal rate under Section&nbsp;1 of

Employee and on Company) or to minimize any additional tax, interest and/or penalties that may apply under Section&nbsp;409A if exemption or compliance is not practicable. Company agrees that it

entire Board of Directors; provided, however, that in no event shall the number of directors be less than one nor more than twelve. The directors shall be divided into three classes, designated
Class&nbsp;I, Class&nbsp;II and Class&nbsp;III. The number of directors in each class shall be as nearly equal as possible. The directors in Class&nbsp;I shall be elected for a term expiring
at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders to be held in 2010. The directors in Class&nbsp;II shall be elected for a term expiring at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders to be held in 2011. The directors
in Class&nbsp;III shall be elected for a term expiring at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders to be held in 2012. Beginning with the 2010 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, each class of directors will
be elected for a term of office to expire at the third succeeding Annual Meeting of Stockholders after its election. Except as the DGCL may otherwise require, in the interim between annual meetings of
stockholders or special meetings of stockholders called for the election of directors and/or the removal of one or more directors and the filling of any vacancy in that connection, newly created
directorships and any vacancies in the Board, including unfilled vacancies resulting from the removal of directors for cause, may be filled by the vote of a majority of the remaining directors then in
office, although less than a quorum (as defined in the Corporation's bylaws), or by the sole remaining director. All directors shall hold office until the expiration of their respective terms of
office and until their successors shall have been elected and qualified. A director elected to fill a vacancy resulting from the death, resignation or
removal of a director shall serve for the remainder of the full term of the director whose death, resignation or removal shall have created such vacancy and until his successor shall have been elected
and qualified. </FONT></P>

Corporation which is represented in person or by proxy at such meeting and entitled to vote thereat (provided that a lawful quorum of stockholders be there represented in person or by proxy), unless a
higher vote is required by applicable law, shall be as valid and binding upon the Corporation and upon all the stockholders as though it had been approved or ratified by every stockholder of the

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOW,
THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual agreements herein set forth, the parties hereto agree as follows: </FONT></P>

written notice to the Company. If the Warrant Agent shall become incapable of acting as Warrant Agent, the Company shall appoint a successor to such Warrant Agent. If the Company shall fail to make
such appointment within a period of 30&nbsp;days after it has been notified in writing of such resignation or of such incapacity by the Warrant Agent or by the registered holder of a Warrant
Certificate, then the registered holder of any Warrant Certificate or the Warrant Agent may apply, at the expense of the Company, to any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a
successor to the Warrant Agent. Pending appointment of a successor to such Warrant Agent, either by the Company or by such a court, the duties of the Warrant Agent shall be carried out by the Company.
The holders of a majority of the unexercised Warrants shall be entitled at any time to remove the Warrant Agent and appoint a successor to such Warrant Agent. If a Successor Warrant Agent shall not
have been appointed within 30&nbsp;days of such removal, the Warrant Agent may apply, at the expense of the Company, to any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor to the
Warrant Agent. Such successor to the Warrant Agent need not be approved by the Company or the former Warrant Agent. After appointment the successor to the Warrant Agent shall be vested with the same

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Warrants evidenced by this Warrant Certificate are part of a duly authorized issue of Warrants entitling the holder on exercise to
receive shares of Common Stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of the Company (the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>Common Stock</I></B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"), and are issued or to be issued pursuant to an amended
and restated Warrant Agreement dated as of [<U>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</U>], 2009 (the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>Warrant
Agreement</I></B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"), duly
executed and delivered by the Company to Continental Stock Transfer&nbsp;&amp; Trust Company, a New York corporation, as warrant agent (the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>Warrant
Agent</I></B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"), which Warrant Agreement is hereby incorporated by reference in and made a part of this instrument and is hereby referred to for a description of the rights, limitation
of rights, obligations, duties and immunities thereunder of the Warrant Agent, the Company and the holders (the words "holders" or "holder" meaning the registered holders or registered holder) of the
Warrants. A copy of the Warrant Agreement may be obtained by the holder hereof upon written request to the Company. Defined terms used in this Warrant Certificate but not defined herein shall have the
meanings given to them in the Warrant Agreement. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Warrants
may be exercised at any time during the Warrant Exercise Period set forth in the Warrant Agreement. The holder of Warrants evidenced by this Warrant Certificate may exercise
them by surrendering this Warrant Certificate, with the form of election to purchase set forth hereon properly completed and executed, together with payment of the Exercise Price as specified in the
Warrant Agreement, at the principal corporate trust office of the Warrant Agent. In the event that upon any exercise of Warrants evidenced hereby the number of Warrants exercised shall be less than
the total number of Warrants evidenced hereby, there shall be issued to the holder hereof or his assignee a new Warrant Certificate evidencing the number of Warrants not exercised. No adjustment shall
be made for any dividends on any Common Stock issuable upon exercise of this Warrant. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding
anything else in this Warrant Certificate or the Warrant Agreement, no Warrant may be exercised unless at the time of exercise (i)&nbsp;a registration statement
covering the Warrant Shares to be issued upon exercise is effective under the Act and (ii)&nbsp;a prospectus thereunder relating to the Warrant Shares is current. In no event shall the Warrants be
settled on a net cash basis during the Warrant Exercise Period nor shall the Company be required to issue unregistered shares upon the exercise of any Warrant. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once
the Warrants become exercisable and there is an effective registration statement covering the shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Warrants available and current
throughout the 30-day redemption period defined below, the Company may redeem the outstanding Warrants (except with respect to the sponsors' Warrants held by a sponsor or its permitted
transferee) in whole and not in part at a price of $0.01 per Warrant upon a minimum of 30&nbsp;days' prior written notice of redemption (the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>30-day redemption
period</I></B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>") and if, and only if, the last sale price of the Company's Common Stock equals or exceeds $19.50 per share for any 20 trading days within a 30-trading day
period ending three business days before the notice of redemption is sent. If the Company calls the Warrants for redemption, it will have the option to require all holders that wish to exercise
Warrants to do so on a "cashless basis." In such event, each holder would pay the exercise price by surrendering the Warrants for that number of shares of Common Stock equal to the quotient obtained
by dividing (x)&nbsp;the product of the number of shares of Common Stock underlying the Warrants, multiplied by the difference between the exercise price of the Warrants and the "fair market value"
(defined below) by (y)&nbsp;the fair market value. The "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>fair market value</I></B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>" shall mean the average reported last sale price of the Common Stock for the
ten trading days ending on the third trading day prior to the date on which the notice of redemption is sent to the holders of Warrants. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Warrant Agreement provides that upon the occurrence of certain events the number of Warrant Shares set forth on the face hereof may, subject to certain conditions, be adjusted. No </FONT></P>
