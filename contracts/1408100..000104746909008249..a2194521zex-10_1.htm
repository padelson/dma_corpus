AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER 

  

 AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER dated as of September 8, 2009 (this " _Agreement_ "), by and among PROSPECT ACQUISITION CORP., a company incorporated under the laws of Delaware (" _Prospect_ "), KW MERGER SUB CORP., a company incorporated under the laws of Delaware and a wholly owned subsidiary of Prospect (" _Merger Sub_ ") and KENNEDY-WILSON, INC., a company incorporated under the laws of Delaware (" _KW_ "). Each of the Parties to this Agreement is individually referred to herein as a " _Party_ " and collectively as the " _Parties_." Capitalized terms used herein that are not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to them in Annex A hereto. 

  

    
 _BACKGROUND 
_

  

 Prospect has formed a wholly owned subsidiary, Merger Sub, solely for the purposes of the merger of Merger Sub with and into KW pursuant to Section 251 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ "), in which KW will be the surviving corporation (the " _Merger_ _"_ ). 

  

 The board of directors of KW has declared this Agreement advisable and fair to, and in the best interests of, KW. 

  

 The Merger requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share of KW (the " _KW Common Stock_ ") and (ii) the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of common stock of Prospect, par value $0.0001 per share (the " _Prospect Common Stock_ ") sold in the Prospect Public Offering voted at the Prospect Stockholders\' Meeting, _provided_ , that the Merger will only proceed if holders of fewer than 30% of the shares of the Prospect Common Stock sold in the Prospect Public Offering exercise their conversion rights. Prior to the Closing, the holders of the convertible preferred stock of KW (the " _KW Preferred Stock_ " and collectively with the KW Common Stock, the " _KW Securities_ "), will agree to amend the Certificate of Designation of the KW Preferred Stock to provide that, upon the Closing, each share of KW Preferred Stock will be converted into the right to receive shares of Prospect Common Stock at the Preferred Stock Exchange Ratio. 

  

 Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, Prospect, the Prospect Founders, De Guardiola Advisors, Inc. (" _DGA_ "), De Guardiola Advisors Holdings, Inc. (" _DGAH_ ") and KW are entering into a letter agreement, of even date herewith (the " _Forfeiture Agreement_ "), in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit A_, pursuant to which, subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein (i) the Prospect Founders have agreed to the forfeiture and cancellation of 2.575 million shares of Prospect Common Stock and (ii) Prospect has agreed to issue to DGAH an aggregate of 375,000 shares of Prospect Common Stock upon the closing of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in satisfaction of an obligation of Prospect under its engagement letter with DGA. 

  

 The parties intend that the Merger contemplated herein constitute a tax-free reorganization with the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and hereby adopt this Agreement as a plan of reorganization within the meaning of the Code. 

   

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the Parties agree as follows: 

  

    
ARTICLE I 

  

  _The Merger 
_

   

 Section 1.1 _ The Merger._ At the Merger Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.2), Merger Sub will be merged with and into KW in accordance with Section 251 of the DGCL and this Agreement, and the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub will thereupon cease. KW (sometimes hereinafter 

         

referred to as the " _Surviving Corporation_ ") will be the surviving
corporation in the Merger. The Merger will have the effects specified in the
DGCL. The name of the Surviving Corporation will be Kennedy-Wilson, Inc.

  

 Section 1.2 _ Merger Effective Time._ As soon as practicable following the satisfaction or, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, waiver of the conditions to the Closing set forth in Article VIII, if this Agreement shall not have been terminated prior thereto as provided in Article X, the parties hereto shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing a certificate of merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") meeting the requirements of Section 251 of the DGCL to be properly executed and filed in accordance with the applicable requirements of the DGCL. The Merger shall become effective at the time designated in the Certificate of Merger as the effective time of the Merger that the Parties shall have agreed upon and designated, or if no such time has been designated, on filing (the " _Merger Effective Time_ "). 

  

 Section 1.3 _ Effect of the Merger._ At the Merger Effective Time, the effect of the Merger shall be as provided in the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Merger Effective Time, except as otherwise provided herein, all the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of Merger Sub and KW shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 Section 1.4 _ Certificate of Incorporation; By-Laws._ The Certificate of Incorporation of KW in effect immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time shall be the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation, until duly amended in accordance with applicable Law. The bylaws of KW in effect immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation, until duly amended in accordance with applicable Law. 

   

 Section 1.5 _ Directors of Surviving Corporation._ Immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time, one of the directors of KW shall resign. The remaining directors of KW immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation along with one additional director to be appointed by Prospect, until the earlier of their death, resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, as the case may be. 

  

 Section 1.6 _ Officers of Surviving Corporation._ The officers of KW immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation, until the earlier of their death, resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, as the case may be. 

  

 Section 1.7 _ Conversion of Stock in the Merger._ At the Merger Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares: 

  

  

 (a) _Conversion of KW Securities_. Subject to Section 1.7(f), each share of KW Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time shall be automatically converted into the right to receive 3.8031 shares of Prospect Common Stock (" _Common Stock Exchange Ratio_ "). Each share of KW Preferred Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time shall be automatically converted into the right to receive 105.6412 shares of Prospect Common Stock (" _Preferred Stock Exchange Ratio_ ," and together with the Common Stock Exchange Ratio, the " _Exchange Ratio_ "). The total number of shares of Prospect Common Stock issued in the Merger as a result of the conversion of the KW Securities into shares of Prospect Common Stock (" _Conversion Shares_ ") shall equal 26 million shares, _minus_ any shares of Prospect Common Stock that would otherwise have been issuable to holders of Dissenting Shares had such holders not exercised Dissent Rights, _plus_ the aggregate number of additional shares paid pursuant to Section 1.7(g). 

  

      

  

 (b) _Conversion of Merger Sub Shares_. Each issued and outstanding share of the capital stock of Merger Sub shall be converted into and become one fully-paid and nonassessable common share, no par value, of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 (c) _KW Stock Rights Become Prospect Stock Rights_. All KW Stock Rights then outstanding shall remain outstanding and shall be assumed by Prospect and thereafter become Prospect Stock Rights. Each KW Stock Right by virtue of becoming a Prospect Stock Right shall be exercisable upon the same terms and conditions as in effect immediately prior to the Merger, except that upon the exercise of such Prospect Stock Rights, shares of Prospect Common Stock shall be issuable in lieu of KW Common Stock. The number of shares of Prospect Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of a Prospect Stock Right immediately after the Merger Effective Time and the exercise price of each such Prospect Stock Right shall be equal to the number of shares and price as in effect immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time multiplied by the Common Stock Exchange Ratio (in the case of the number of shares) and the inverse of the Common Stock Exchange Ratio (in the case of the exercise price). 

   

 (d) _KW Securities Become Rights for Prospect Common Stock_. From and after the Merger Effective Time, all of the certificates which immediately prior to that time represented outstanding KW Securities (the " _KW Certificates_ ") shall be deemed for all purposes to evidence ownership of, and to represent, the shares of Prospect Common Stock into which such KW Securities have been converted as herein provided. The registered owner on the books and records of the Surviving Corporation or its transfer agent of any such KW Certificate shall have and be entitled to exercise any voting and other rights with respect to and to receive any dividend and other distributions upon the shares of Prospect Common Stock evidenced by such KW Certificate as above provided. 

   

 (e) _No Transfers of Pre-Merger KW Securities_. At or after the Merger Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of KW of the KW Securities which were outstanding immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time. If, after the Merger Effective Time, KW Certificates are presented to Prospect, the Surviving Corporation or their respective transfer agent or the Exchange Agent (defined in Section 1.8), the presented KW Certificates shall be cancelled and exchanged for certificates for shares of Prospect Common Stock deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement in accordance with the procedures set forth herein. 

   

 (f) _KW Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement to the contrary, KW Securities that are outstanding immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time and that are held by stockholders who shall not have voted in favor of the Merger or consented thereto in writing and who shall have demanded properly in writing appraisal (" _Dissent Rights_ ") for such shares (collectively, the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL or, if applicable, pursuant to Chapter 13 of the California General Corporation Law (the (" _CGCL_ "), shall not be converted into or represent the right to receive shares of Prospect Common Stock. Such stockholders shall be entitled to receive payment of the appraised value of the Dissenting Shares held by them in accordance with the provisions of said Section 262 or, if applicable, said Chapter 13, except that all Dissenting Shares held by stockholders who shall have failed to perfect or who effectively shall have withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal of such Dissenting Shares under such Section 262 or, if applicable, such Chapter 13, shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted into and to have become exchangeable, as of the Merger Effective Time, for the right to receive, without any interest thereon, the shares of Prospect Common Stock in the manner provided in subparagraph (a) above. 

   

 (g) _Fractional Shares_. No certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Prospect Common Stock will be issued in the Merger, but in lieu thereof, the number of shares of Prospect Common Stock to be delivered to each holder of shares of KW Securities shall be rounded up to the nearest whole share. 

  

      

  

 (h) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any KW Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificates upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the shares of Prospect Common Stock contemplated to be paid and transferred to the holder of KW Securities represented by such KW Certificates; provided, however, that Prospect may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed certificates to deliver a bond in such sum as it may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against Prospect with respect to the certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed. 

  

 (i) _Withholding Rights_. Each of Prospect, the Surviving Corporation and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the number of shares of Prospect Common Stock otherwise deliverable under this Agreement (or any payments made in respect of any Dissenting Shares), such amounts as Prospect, the Surviving Corporation and the Exchange Agent may reasonably determine are required to be deducted and withheld with respect to such delivery and payment under the Code or any provision of state, local, provincial or foreign tax law. To the extent that any amounts are so withheld all appropriate evidence of such deduction and withholding, including any receipts or forms required in order for the Person with respect to whom such deduction and withholding occurred to establish the deduction and withholding and payment to the appropriate authority as being for its account with the appropriate authorities, shall be delivered to the Person with respect to whom such deduction and withholding has occurred, and such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes as having been delivered and paid to the Person otherwise entitled to the consideration in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Prospect or the Exchange Agent, at its option, may require any such amounts required to be deducted and withheld from any Prospect Common Stock or payments made in respect of any Dissenting Shares deliverable hereunder to be reimbursed in cash to Prospect or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be, prior to the issuance of such Prospect Common Stock hereunder. 

  

  

 Section 1.8 _ Exchange Agent._ As of the Merger Effective Time, Prospect shall enter into an agreement with the transfer agent of Prospect Common Stock (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") authorizing such Exchange Agent to act as exchange agent in connection with the Merger. The Exchange Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable instructions, deliver the Prospect Common Stock contemplated to be paid and transferred to the holders of KW Securities hereunder upon surrender of a KW Certificate. Each KW Certificate representing shares of KW Common Stock or KW Preferred Stock shall be deemed at any time after the Merger Effective Time to evidence only the right to receive upon such surrender the consideration described in Section 1.7(a). 

  

 Section 1.9 _ Closing._ The Closing (the " _Closing_ ") of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby shall take place on or prior to November 13, 2009 at the offices of Loeb and Loeb LLP in New York, New York commencing at 9:00 a.m. local time on the third business day following the satisfaction or waiver of all conditions and obligations of the Parties to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby (other than conditions and obligations with respect to the actions that the respective Parties will take at Closing) on such date and at such time as the Parties may mutually determine (the " _Closing Date_ "). 

  

 Section 1.10 _ Further Assurances._ Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at any time or from time to time after the Closing, each of the Parties shall execute and deliver such other documents and instruments, provide such materials and information and take such other actions as may be commercially reasonable, to the extent permitted by law, to fulfill its obligations under this Agreement and to effectuate and consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.

Except as disclosed in Section 2.15(j) of the KW Disclosure Schedule, neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will alone result in excess parachute payments (within the meaning of Code Section 280G).

Subsidiaries will not be able to renew their existing insurance coverage as

insurers as may be necessary to continue their business on terms consistent
with market for KW\'s or any of its Subsidiaries\' respective lines of

ARTICLE IX 

  

  _Indemnification 
_

   

 Section 9.1 _ Survival._ All of the representations and warranties of the Parties contained in this Agreement shall survive the Closing for a period of twelve (12) months and shall thereafter be of no further force and effect; _provided, however_ , that the representations and warranties contained in Sections 2.14, 2.24 and 2.26 and Sections 3.15 and 3.22, shall survive the Closing for a period equal to any applicable statute of limitations (including any waivers or extensions thereof). All of the covenants and obligations of the Parties contained in this Agreement shall survive the Closing unless they expire sooner in accordance with their terms. The term during which any representation, warranty, or covenant survives hereunder is referred to as the " _Survival Period_." Except as expressly provided in this paragraph, no claim for indemnification hereunder may be made after the expiration of the Survival Period. 

  

 Section 9.2 _ Indemnification by KW._ KW shall, subject to limitations set forth in this Article IX hereof, indemnify, defend and hold harmless Prospect (which term, for the purposes of this Article IX shall include any of Prospect\'s successors) and permitted assigns (the " _Prospect Indemnified Parties_ ") from and against any liabilities, loss, claims, damages, fines, penalties, expenses (including costs of investigation and defense and reasonable attorneys\' fees and court costs) (collectively, " _Damages_ ") arising from: (i) any breach of any representation or warranty made by KW in Article II hereof or in any certificate delivered by KW pursuant to this Agreement; or (ii) any breach by KW of its covenants or obligations in this Agreement to be performed or complied with by KW at or prior to the Closing. 

  

 Section 9.3 _ Indemnification by Prospect._ Prospect shall, subject to the terms hereof, indemnify, defend and hold harmless KW (which term, for the purposes of this Article IX shall include any of KW\'s successors) and permitted assigns (the " _KW Indemnified Parties_ ") from and against any Damages arising from: (i) any breach of any representation or warranty made by Prospect in Article III hereof or in any certificate delivered by Prospect pursuant to this Agreement; or (ii) any breach by Prospect of its covenants or obligations in this Agreement to be performed or complied with by Prospect at or prior to the Closing. 

        

 Section 9.4 _ Limitations on Indemnity._ Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to the contrary, the Prospect Indemnified Parties and the KW Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to indemnification pursuant to Section 9.2 or Section 9.3, unless and until the aggregate amount of Damages under Section 9.2 or Section 9.3, as applicable, collectively exceeds $1,000,000 (the " _Deductible_ "). The aggregate amount of Damages for which a Party may be liable under this Agreement shall not exceed $10,000,000 (the " _Cap_ "). 

   

 Section 9.5 _ Defense of Third Party Claims._ If any Prospect Indemnified Party or KW Indemnified Party determines to make a claim for indemnification under Section 9.2 or 9.3 (each an " _Indemnitee_ "), such Indemnitee shall notify the indemnifying party (an " _Indemnitor_ ") of the claim in writing promptly after receiving notice of any action, lawsuit, proceeding, investigation, demand or other claim against the Indemnitee (if by a third party), describing the claim, the amount thereof (if known and quantifiable) and the basis thereof in reasonable detail (such written notice, an " _Indemnification Notice_ "); provided that the failure to so notify an Indemnitor shall not relieve the Indemnitor of its obligations hereunder except to the extent that (and only to the extent that) such failure shall have caused the damages for which the Indemnitor is obligated to be greater than such damages would have been had the Indemnitee given the Indemnitor prompt notice hereunder. Any Indemnitor shall be entitled to participate in the defense of such action, lawsuit, proceeding, investigation or other claim giving rise to an Indemnitee\'s claim for indemnification at such Indemnitor\'s expense, and at its option shall be entitled to assume the defense thereof by appointing a reputable counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnitee to be the lead counsel in connection with such defense; _provided_ , that the Indemnitee shall be entitled to participate in the defense of such claim and to employ counsel of its choice for such purpose; _provided, however_ , that the fees and expenses of such separate counsel shall be borne by the Indemnitee and shall not be recoverable from such Indemnitor under this Article IX. If the Indemnitor shall control the defense of any such claim, the Indemnitor shall be entitled to settle such claims; _provided_ , that the Indemnitor shall obtain the prior written consent of the Indemnitee (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) before entering into any settlement of a claim or ceasing to defend such claim if, pursuant to or as a result of such settlement or cessation, injunctive or other equitable relief will be imposed against the Indemnitee or if such settlement does not expressly and unconditionally release the Indemnitee from all liabilities and obligations with respect to such claim. If the Indemnitor assumes such defense, the Indemnitor shall not be liable for any amount required to be paid by the Indemnitee that exceeds, where the Indemnitee has unreasonably withheld or delayed consent in connection with the proposed compromise or settlement of a third party claim, the amount for which that third party claim could have been settled pursuant to that proposed compromise or settlement. In all cases, the Indemnitee shall provide its reasonable cooperation with the Indemnitor in defense of claims or litigation, including by making employees, information and documentation reasonably available. If the Indemnitor shall not assume the defense of any such action, lawsuit, proceeding, investigation or other claim, the Indemnitee may defend against such matter as it deems appropriate; provided that the Indemnitee may not settle any such matter without the written consent of the Indemnitor (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) if the Indemnitee is seeking or will seek indemnification hereunder with respect to such matter. 

  

 Section 9.6 _ Determining Damages._ The amount of Damages subject to indemnification under Section 9.2 or 9.3 shall be calculated net of (i) any Tax Benefit inuring to the Indemnitee on account of such Damages, (ii) any reserves set forth in any of KW Financial Statements relating to such Damages and (iii) any insurance proceeds or other amounts under indemnification agreements received or receivable by the Indemnitee on account of such Damages. If the Indemnitee receives a Tax Benefit on account of such Damages after an indemnification payment is made to it, the Indemnitee shall promptly pay to the Person or Persons that made such indemnification payment the amount of such Tax Benefit at such time or times as and to the extent that such Tax Benefit is realized by the Indemnitee. For purposes hereof, " _Tax Benefit_ " shall mean any refund of Taxes to be paid or reduction 

        
  

in the amount of Taxes which otherwise would be paid by the Indemnitee, in
each case computed at the highest marginal tax rates applicable to the
recipient of such benefit. To the extent Damages are recoverable by
insurance, the Indemnitees shall take all commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain maximum recovery from such insurance. In the event that an insurance or
other recovery is made by any Indemnitee with respect to Damages for which
any such Person has been indemnified hereunder, then a refund equal to the
aggregate amount of the recovery shall be made promptly to the Person or
Persons that provided such indemnity payments to such Indemnitee. The
Indemnitors shall be subrogated to all rights of the Indemnitees in respect of
Damages indemnified by the Indemnitors. The Indemnitees shall take all
commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate all Damages upon and after
becoming aware of any event which could reasonably be expected to give rise to
Damages. For Tax purposes, the Parties agree to treat all payments made under
this Article IX as adjustments to the consideration received for KW
Securities.

   

 Section 9.7 _ Right of Setoff._ To the extent that any Party is obligated to indemnify any other Party after Closing under the provisions of this Article IX for Damages reduced to a monetary amount, such Party after Closing shall have the right to decrease any amount due and owing or to be due and owing under any agreement with the other Party, whether under this Agreement or any other agreement between such Parties on the one hand, and any of the other Party or any of their respective Affiliates, Subsidiaries or controlled persons or entities on the other. 

   

 Section 9.8 _ Limitation on Recourse; No Third Party Beneficiaries._ 

  

  

 (a) No claim shall be brought or maintained by any Party or its respective successors or permitted assigns against any officer, director, partner, member, agent, representative, Affiliate, equity holder, successor or permitted assign of any Party which is not otherwise expressly identified as a Party, and no recourse shall be brought or granted against any of them, by virtue of or based upon any alleged misrepresentation or inaccuracy in or breach of any of the representations, warranties, covenants or obligations of any Party set forth or contained in this Agreement or any exhibit or schedule hereto or any certificate delivered hereunder. 

  

 (b) The provisions of this Article IX are for the sole benefit of the Parties and nothing in this Article IX, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other Person any legal or equitable right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Article IX. 

  

  

 Section 9.9 _ Fraud._ Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the limitations and thresholds set forth in this Article IX shall not apply with respect to fraud, intentional misrepresentation or willful misconduct.

 Section 11.4 _ Severability._ If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule or Law, or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any Party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that transactions contemplated by this Agreement are fulfilled to the extent possible.

Each of the Parties hereby irrevocably submits with regard to any such action or proceeding for itself and in respect of its property, generally and unconditionally, to the personal jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts and agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any court other than the aforesaid courts. Each of the Parties hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any action or proceeding with respect to this Agreement, (i) any claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the above-named courts for any reason other than the failure to serve in accordance with this Section 11.8, (ii) any claim that it or its property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process commenced in such courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise), and (iii) to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any claim that (1) the suit, action or proceeding in such court is brought in an inconvenient forum, (2) the venue of such suit, action or proceeding is improper or (3) this Agreement, or the subject mater hereof, may not be enforced in or by such courts. 

  

 (b) EACH OF THE PARTIES IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO ANY OF THE TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS, THE TRANSACTION OR THE ACTIONS OF THE PARTIES IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE OR ENFORCEMENT THEREOF. 

  

  

 Section 11.9 _ Assignment._ Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise by any of the Parties without the prior written consent of the other Parties. Any purported assignment without such consent shall be void. Subject to the preceding sentences, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

AMENDMENT TO AGREEMENT

  

 NOW, THEREFORE, for good and valuable consideration the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereby amend the Agreement, effective as of the times set forth below. 

  

 1. Section 2 (b) is deleted immediately before the Effective Time. 

  

 2. Section 9 is deleted as of the Effective Time and a new Section 9 is substituted as of the Effective Time, to read as follows: 

  

  

 9. _Termination_. 

    

 (a) Either Company or Employee may terminate this Agreement at any time during the Term, in the event of a material breach of this Agreement by Employee or Company which is not corrected within thirty (30) days after the written notice of the breach is delivered to the other party. The written notice from Company to Employee shall include a reasonably detailed description of Employee\'s acts or omissions, which constitute cause for termination. The term "cause" shall mean: (i) the breach of any material provision of this Agreement; (ii) persistent misconduct, neglect or negligence in the performance of Employee\'s duties and obligations as set forth in this Agreement; (iii) disloyal, dishonest or illegal conduct or moral turpitude of Employee; (iv) such material carelessness or inefficiency in the performance of his` duties that Employee, in the reasonable discretion of Company, is deemed unfit to continue in the service of Company; and (v) the material and persistent failure of Employee to comply with the policies or directives of Company and/or failure to take direction from Company management. 

  

 (b) Employee\'s employment with Company shall cease upon the date of his death or physical or mental disability to the extent that Employee becomes disabled for more than sixty (60) consecutive days or ninety (90) days in the aggregate in any 12-month period and unable to perform his duties on a full-time basis. Upon termination for death or physical or mental disability, Company shall continue to pay Employee the basic salary described in Section 4 for the remainder of the Term of the Agreement on the Company\'s ordinary payroll dates     

   
  

applicable to similarly situated employees of the Company, together with such
other employee benefits (other than continued participation under the
Company\'s Section 401(k) plan) as Employee may be entitled to under the
provisions of Section 6 (or if such benefits cannot be provided pursuant to
the terms of the applicable plans, comparable benefits, provided, however,
that the provision of comparable benefits shall be made following Employee\'s
termination of employment only if and to the extent that such benefits may be
provided at no additional cost above what was previously paid by the
Company).

  

 (c) If the Employee is terminated by Company prior to the end of the Term without cause, then Company shall continue to pay Employee the basic salary described in Section 4 for the remainder of the Term of the Agreement on the Company\'s ordinary payroll dates applicable to similarly situated employees of the Company, together with such other employee benefits (other than continued participation under the Company\'s Section 401(k) plan) as Employee may be entitled to under the provisions of Section 6 (or if such benefits cannot be provided pursuant to the terms of the applicable plans, comparable benefits, provided, however, that the provision of comparable benefits shall be made following Employee\'s termination of employment only if and to the extent that such benefits may be provided at no additional cost above what was previously paid by the Company). 

  

 (d) If Company instructs Employee to work full-time or substantially full-time at any location not acceptable to Employee (other than the Company\'s main headquarters) that is more than 50 miles from Employee\'s then principal place of work and more than 50 miles from Employee\'s then principal residence, or eliminates or materially reduces his duties as CEO / Chairman , then Employee may elect to deem such action(s) a constructive termination by Company and resign his employment, provided that (i) such resignation occurs within one year of such action(s); (ii) Employee provides written notice to the Company of such action(s) within 90 days thereof; and (iii) the Company fails to cure the action(s) constituting such constructive termination within 30 days of receipt of the notice. In the event of such a resignation, Company shall continue to pay or provide Employee for the remainder of the Term the basic salary described in Section 4 of the Agreement on the Company\'s ordinary payroll dates applicable to similarly situated employees of the Company, together with such other employee benefits (other than continued participation under the Company\'s Section 401(k) plan) as Employee may be entitled to under the provisions of Section 6 (or if such benefits cannot be provided pursuant to the terms of the applicable plans, comparable benefits, provided, however, that the provision of comparable benefits shall be made following Employee\'s termination of employment only if and to the extent that such benefits may be provided at no additional cost above what was previously paid by the Company). 

  

 (e) If Employee terminates this Agreement without cause or Employee is terminated for cause, then Employee shall be entitled to receive only the compensation described in Section 4 above earned to the date of termination. Company shall not pay Employee the salary and other benefits which Employee would have been entitled to for the remainder of the term of the Agreement under Sections 4 and Section 6 above, provided that in the event Employee so resigns, Employee will receive a bonus for the year in which he resigned in the ordinary course but prorated based on the number of days Employee was employed by the Company that year (provided that, if the bonus is intended to be qualified under section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, payment of the prorated bonus shall be contingent on satisfaction of the performance target applicable to the bonus). 

   

      

   

 (f) This Agreement may be terminated by Employee at any time, provided such termination shall have the effect set forth as follows: 

    

 (i) Termination of this Agreement pursuant to this Section 9 shall not relieve Employee of his obligations to comply with Sections 7 and 8 hereof, which provisions shall survive the termination of this Agreement. If, and only if, Employee is terminated without cause or Employee resigns due to the Company\'s material breach of this Agreement which is not corrected within thirty (30) days after the Employee\'s written notice of the breach to the Company, then Employee shall be relieved of his obligations under Sections 7 and 8 hereof. 

    

  

 3. A new Section 11 is added, effective as of September 4, 2009: 

  

  

 11. _October 15, 2009 Bonus Payments._

  

  

 The Company shall pay Employee a cash bonus of $4.85 million on October 15, 2009. The bonus shall be promptly repaid if the merger of Merger Sub into Company does not occur by November 15, 2009. 

  

 4. A new Section 12 is added, effective as of the Effective Time: 

  

  

 12. _April 1, 2010 and January 1, 2011 Bonus Payments._

    

 (a) Subject to the conditions set forth in this Section 12, Company shall pay Employee a cash bonus of $2.425 million on April 1, 2010, and a cash bonus of $4.425 million on January 1, 2011. 

  

 (b) The bonus payable April 1, 2010 is conditioned on (1) approval by the PAX Compensation Committee of the issuance of the bonus as a Performance Unit Award under the Kennedy-Wilson Holdings, Inc. 2009 Equity Participation Plan (the "Plan"), (2) approval of the Plan by the shareholders of PAX (3) Employee\'s continued employment through April 1, 2010, and (4) satisfaction as of March 31, 2010 of the Performance Target, and (5) reapproval of the Performance Target by the PAX Compensation Committee subsequent to the Effective Time. The "Performance Target" is that the Company\'s assets under management be at least $3 billion. For this purpose, "assets under management" shall equal the value of assets under management by the Company, as reflected in the footnotes to the Company\'s financial statements, plus the _cost_ of properties subject to property management contracts with the Company (not taking into account any properties whose value is reflected in the footnotes). In the event that the Performance Target is not met as of March 31, 2010, the bonus otherwise due March 31, 2010 shall, nevertheless, continue to be paid if the Performance Target is satisfied as of the earlier of June 30, 2010, September 30, 2010, or December 31, 2010. 

  

 (c) The bonus payable January 1, 2011 is conditioned on (1) approval by the PAX Compensation Committee of the issuance of the bonus as a Performance Unit Award under the Plan, (2) approval of the Plan by the shareholders of PAX (3) Employee\'s continued employment through January 1, 2011, (4) satisfaction of the Performance Target as of December 31, 2010, and (5) reapproval of the Performance Target by the PAX Compensation Committee subsequent to the Effective Time. 

   

 (d) Notwithstanding the preceding subsections of this section, the bonuses described herein shall be payable even if Employee is not employed through the dates set forth above, provided that the other conditions to the payment of the bonus are met and Employee terminates employment under conditions that would entitle him under Section 9(c) or (d) to payment of his salary through the remainder of the Term. 

   

      

   

  

 5. A new Section 13 is added, effective immediately prior to the Effective Time. 

  

  

 13. _Note Forgiveness._

  

  

 Immediately prior to the Effective Time, the principal and interest shall be forgiven on the note dated April 10, 2006 from Employee to Company and the note shall be treated as paid in full. 

  

 6. A new Section 14 is added, effective as of the Effective Time: 2009: 

  

  

 14. _Restricted Shares._

    

 (a) Immediately after the Effective Time and subject to the conditions set forth herein, Employee shall be issued 900,000 restricted shares of common stock of PAX. The restricted shares are conditioned on (1) approval by the PAX Compensation Committee of the issuance and terms of the restricted shares under the Kennedy-Wilson Holdings, Inc. 2009 Equity Participation Plan (the "Plan"), subject to the conditions set forth below in (b) and (c), (2) approval of the Plan by the shareholders of PAX, (3) Employee\'s continued employment through the vesting dates set forth below in (b), (4) satisfaction of the Performance Target, and (5) reapproval of the Performance Target by the PAX Compensation Committee subsequent to the Effective Time. 

  

 (b) 300,000 restricted shares shall become vested on the first anniversary of the Effective Time, provided that the Performance Target is met as of September 30, 2010; 300,000 restricted shares shall become vested on the second anniversary of the Effective Time, provided that the Performance Target is met as of September 30, 2011; and 300,000 restricted shares shall become vested on the third anniversary of the Effective Time, provided that the Performance Target is met as of September 30, 2012. 

  

 (c) Notwithstanding subsections (a) and (b), if, prior to the Employee\'s fully satisfying the above 3-year vesting requirement, Employee\'s employment with the Company shall be terminated by the Company without cause or by the Employee for Good Reason, in any such event, the requirement of continued employment shall no longer apply, so that, assuming the Performance Target is met as of the relevant date, the restricted shares shall thereupon become fully vested, no longer subject to restrictions, and transferable. As used in this subsection, "Good Reason" shall mean the voluntary termination by Employee of his employment with the Company within six months of the Company\'s (A) instructing the Employee to work (or provide services) full-time or substantially full-time at any location not acceptable to the Employee (other than the employer\'s main headquarters) that is more than 50 miles from Employee\'s principal place of work and more than 50 miles from Employee\'s principal residence, (B) eliminating or materially reducing the Employee\'s duties for the Company, or (C) materially reducing the Employee\'s base pay (or compensation). 

   

  

 7. A new Section 15 is added, effective as of the Effective Time: 

  

  

 15. Section 280G. 

    

 (a) Notwithstanding anything in this Employment Agreement to the contrary, in the event that the Company\'s independent public accountants (the "Accountants") shall determine that receipt of all payments or benefits made or provided by the Company or its affiliated companies in the nature of compensation to or for Employee\'s benefit (each, a "Payment"), whether payable or to be provided pursuant to this Employment Agreement or otherwise, and including, without limitation, the post-termination payments and benefits provided pursuant to Section 9 and the restricted shares provided pursuant to Section 14, would subject Employee to the excise tax under Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), the Payments shall be reduced to the Reduced Amount (as defined below). 

   

      

   

 (b) If the Accountants determine that aggregate Payments should be reduced to the Reduced Amount, the Company shall promptly give Employee notice to that effect and a copy of the detailed calculation thereof. Any reduction of the Payments shall be made in such a manner as will provide Employee with the greatest Net After-Tax Receipt, as defined below. 

  

 (c) As a result of the uncertainty in the application of Section 4999 of the Code at the time of the initial determination by the Accountants hereunder, it is possible that Payments will have been made by the Company to or for the benefit of Employee which should not have been so made ("Overpayment"), or that additional amounts which will have not been paid or distributed by the Company to or for the benefit of Employee could have been so paid or distributed ("Underpayment"), in each case, consistent with the calculation of the Reduced Amount hereunder. In the event that the Accountants, based upon the assertion of a deficiency by the Internal Revenue Service against either the Company or Employee which the Accountants believe has a high probability of success, determine that an Overpayment has been made, Employee shall pay any such Overpayment to the Company together with interest at the applicable federal rate provided for in Section 7872(f)(2) of the Code; provided, however, that no amount shall be payable by Employee to the Company if and to the extent such payment would not either reduce the amount on which Employee is subject to tax under Section 1 and Section 4999 of the Code or generate a refund of such taxes. In the event that the Accountants determine that an Underpayment has occurred, any such Underpayment shall be promptly paid by the Company to or for the benefit of Employee together with interest at the applicable federal rate provided for in Section 7872(f)(2) of the Code. 

  

 (d) The following terms have the meanings set forth below: 

    

 (i) "Reduced Amount" shall mean the greatest amount of Payments that can be paid that would not result in the imposition of the excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code. 

  

 (ii) "Net After-Tax Receipt" shall mean the present value (as determined in accordance with Sections 280G(b)(2)(A)(ii) and 280G(d)(4) of the Code) of all Payments net of all taxes imposed on Employee with respect thereto under the Code and under applicable state and local laws, determined by applying the highest marginal rate under Section 1 of the Code and under state and local laws which applied to Employee\'s taxable income for the immediately preceding taxable year, or such other rate(s) as Employee certifies, in Employee\'s sole discretion, as likely to apply to him in the relevant tax year(s). 

    

 (e) Subject to the last sentence of this subsection (e), all determinations made by the Accountants under this Section 15 shall be conclusive and binding upon the Company and Employee for all purposes. All fees and expenses of the Accountants shall be borne solely by the Company. For purposes of making the calculations required by this Section 15, the Accountants may make reasonable assumptions and approximations concerning applicable taxes and may rely on reasonable, good faith interpretations concerning the application of Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code. The Company and Employee will furnish to the Accountants such information and documents as the Accountants may reasonably request in order to make determinations under this Section 15\. In the event that Employee disagrees with the determination of the Accountants under this Section 15, he can have such determination reviewed pursuant to the alternative dispute resolution currently set forth in the employment agreement between the Company and Donald J. Herrema, most recently amended as of , 2009. If such mechanism is used, review shall be de novo and no presumption of correctness shall attach to the Accountants\' determination. 

   

      

   

  

 8. A new Section 16 is added, effective as of January 1, 2009. 

  

  

 16. Section 409A. 

    

 (a) The Company intends that the reimbursements, payments and benefits to which Employee could become entitled under this Employment Agreement be exempt from or comply with Section 409A of the Code and the regulations and other guidance promulgated thereunder ("Section 4009A"). The provisions of this Section 16 shall qualify and supersede all other provisions of this Agreement as necessary to fulfill the foregoing intention. If Company believes, at any time, that any of such reimbursement, payment or benefit is not exempt or does not so comply, Company will promptly advise the Employee and will reasonably and in good faith amend the terms of such arrangement such that it is exempt or complies (with the most limited possible economic effect on the Employee and on Company) or to minimize any additional tax, interest and/or penalties that may apply under Section 409A if exemption or compliance is not practicable. Company agrees that it will not, without Employee\'s prior written consent, knowingly take any action, or knowingly refrain from taking any action, other than as required by law, that would result in the imposition of tax, interest and/or penalties upon the Employee under Section 409A, unless such action or omission is pursuant to the Employee\'s written request. 

  

 (b) To the extent applicable, each and every payment to be made pursuant to this Employment Agreement shall be treated as a separate payment and not as one of a series of payments treated as a single payment for purposes of Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-2(b)(2)(iii). 

   

 (c) If Employee is a "specified employee" (determined by Company in accordance with Section 409A and Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-3(i)(2)) as of the date that the Employee experiences a separation from service, as defined in Treasury Regulations Section 1.409A-1(h)(1), from the Company (a "Separation from Service") and if any reimbursement, payment or benefit to be paid or provided under this Employment Agreement or otherwise both (i) constitutes a "deferral of compensation" within the meaning of and subject to Section 409A ("Nonqualified Deferred Compensation") and (ii) cannot be paid or provided in a manner otherwise provided herein without subjecting the Employee to additional tax, interest and/or penalties under Section 409A, then any such reimbursement, payment or benefit that is payable during the first six months following Employee\'s date of termination shall be paid or provided to Employee in a lump sum cash payment to be made, with interest at the applicable federal rate, on the earlier of (x) Employee\'s death and (y) the first business day of the seventh (7th) month immediately following Employee\'s Separation from Service. To the extent available, all the exceptions of Treasury Regulations Section 1.409A-1(b)(9) shall apply in implementing the rules of this section. 

  

 (d) Except to the extent any reimbursement, payment or benefit to be paid or provided under this Employment Agreement does not constitute Nonqualified Deferred Compensation, (i) the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement or the provision of any in-kind benefit (as defined in Section 409A) to Employee during any calendar year will not affect the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement or provided as in-kind benefits to Employee in any other calendar year (subject to any lifetime and other annual limits provided under Company\'s health plans), (ii) the reimbursements for expenses for which Employee is entitled shall be made on or before the last day of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the applicable expense is incurred and (iii) the right to payment or reimbursement or in-kind benefits may not be liquidated or exchanged for any other benefit. 

  

 (e) Any reimbursement, payment or benefit to be paid or provided under this Employment Agreement due to a Separation from Service that is exempt from Section 409A 

   

      

   
  

pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(9)(v) will be paid or
provided to Employee only to the extent the expenses are not incurred or the
benefits are not provided beyond the last day of Employee\'s second taxable
year following Employee\'s taxable year in which the Separation from Service
occurs; provided, however, that Company shall reimburse such expenses
no later than the last day of the third taxable year following Employee\'s
taxable year in which Employee\'s Separation from Service occurs.

   

 (f) Any reimbursement, payment or benefit to be paid or provided under this Agreement that constitutes Nonqualified Deferred Compensation due upon a termination of employment shall be paid or provided to Employee only in the event of a Separation from Service. 

   

  

 Subject to the foregoing, the Employment Agreement remains in full force and effect, and Company and Employee hereby ratify and affirm the Employment Agreement in each and every respect. 

  

 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned have executed this Fifteenth Amendment on the dates written below.

 _SECOND AMENDMENT TO EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT 
_

  

 This Second Amendment to Employment Agreement (the "Second Amendment") is made and entered into by and between KENNEDY-WILSON, INC., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), and Mary L. Ricks, an individual ("Employee"). This amendment will become effective at the times set forth below, including the time at which KW Merger Sub Corp. ("Merger Sub"), a subsidiary of Prospect Acquisition Corp. ("PAX"), is merged into the Company (the "Effective Time"). 

  

    
 _RECITALS 
_

  

 WHEREAS, Company and Employee have agreed that the terms of the Employment Agreement shall be modified as set forth below and that, except as modified, the Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. 

   

 WHEREAS, Company and Employee have agreed that the modifications set forth below that are effective as of the Effective Time shall be conditioned upon the consummation of the merger of PAX into the Company. 

  

    
 _AMENDMENT TO AGREEMENT 
_

  

 NOW, THEREFORE, for good and valuable consideration the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereby amend the Agreement, as follows: 

  

 1. Section 3 (b) is deleted immediately before the Effective Time. 

  

 2. Section 11(c) is amended as of the Effective Time to read as follows: 

  

   

 (c) If the Employee is terminated by Company prior to the end of the Term without cause, then Company shall continue to pay Employee the basic salary described in Section 5(a) for the remainder of the Term of the Agreement on the Company\'s ordinary payroll dates applicable to similarly situated employees of the Company, together with such other employee benefits (other than continued participation under the Company\'s Section 401(k) plan) as Employee may be entitled to under the provisions of Section 6 (or if such benefits cannot be provided to Employee pursuant to the terms of the applicable plans, comparable benefits, provided, however, that the provision of comparable benefits shall be made following Employee\'s termination of employment only if and to the extent that such benefits may be provided at no additional cost to the Company above what was previously paid by the Company). Notwithstanding Section 2, if Company instructs Employee to work full-time or substantially full-time at any location not acceptable to Employee (other than the Company\'s main headquarters) that is more than 50 miles from Employee\'s then principal place of work and more than 50 miles from Employee\'s then principal residence, or eliminates or materially reduces her duties as a senior executive level manager and supervisor of projects, personnel and budgets, then Employee may elect to deem such action(s) a constructive termination by Company and resign her employment, provided that (i) such resignation occurs within one year of such action(s); (ii) Employee provides written notice to the Company of such action(s) within 90 days thereof; and (iii) the Company fails to cure the action(s) constituting such constructive termination within 30 days of receipt of the notice. In the event of such a resignation, Company shall continue to pay or provide the compensation and benefits described in this Section 11(c) for the remainder of the Term and Employee\'s employment shall be terminated. 

   

  

 3. The old Section 12 captioned "Miscellaneous" shall be renumbered as Section 17\. 

        

 4. A new Section 12 is added, effective as of September 4, 2009: 

  

  

 12. _ October 15, 2009 Bonus Payments._

    

 The Company shall pay Employee a cash bonus of $2 million on October 15, 2009. The bonus shall be promptly repaid if the merger of Merger Sub into Company does not occur by November 15, 2009. 

   

  

 5. A new Section 13 is added, effective as of the Effective Time: 

  

  

 13. _ April 1, 2010 and January 1, 2011 Bonus Payments._

    

 (a) Subject to the conditions set forth in this Section 13, Company shall pay Employee a cash bonus of $1 million on April 1, 2010, and a cash bonus of $1 million on January 1, 2011. 

  

 (b) The bonus payable April 1, 2010 is conditioned on (1) approval by the PAX Compensation Committee of the issuance of the bonus as a Performance Unit Award under the Kennedy-Wilson Holdings, Inc. 2009 Equity Participation Plan (the "Plan"), (2) approval of the Plan by the shareholders of PAX (3) Employee\'s continued employment through April 1, 2010, (4) satisfaction as of March 31, 2010 of the Performance Target, and (5) reapproval of the Performance Target by the PAX Compensation Committee subsequent to the Effective Time. The "Performance Target" is that the Company\'s assets under management be at least $3 billion. For this purpose, "assets under management" shall equal the value of assets under management by the Company, as reflected in the footnotes to the Company\'s financial statements, plus the cost of properties subject to property management contracts with the Company (not taking into account any properties whose value is reflected in the footnotes). In the event that the Performance Target is not met as of March 31, 2010, the bonus otherwise due March 31, 2010 shall, nevertheless, be paid if the Performance Target is satisfied as of the earlier of June 30, 2010, September 30, 2010, or December 31, 2010. 

  

 (c) The bonus payable January 1, 2011 is conditioned on (1) approval by the PAX Compensation Committee of the issuance of the bonus as a Performance Unit Award under the Plan, (2) approval of the Plan by the shareholders of PAX (3) Employee\'s continued employment through January 1, 2011, (4) satisfaction of the Performance Target as of December 31, 2010, and (5) reapproval of the Performance Target by the PAX Compensation Committee subsequent to the Effective Time. 

  

 (d) Notwithstanding the preceding subsections of this section, the bonuses described herein shall be payable even if Employee is not employed through the dates set forth above, provided that the other conditions to the payment of the bonus are met and Employee terminates employment under conditions that would entitle her under Section 11(c) to payment of her salary through the remainder of the Term. 

   

  

 6. A new Section 14 is added, effective as of the Effective Time: 

  

  

 14. _ Restricted Shares._

    

 (a) Immediately after the Effective Time and subject to the conditions set forth herein, Employee shall be issued 900,000 restricted shares of common stock of PAX. The restricted shares are conditioned on (1) approval by the PAX Compensation Committee of the issuance and terms of the restricted shares under the Kennedy-Wilson Holdings, Inc. 2009 Equity Participation Plan (the "Plan"), subject to the conditions set forth below in (b) and (c), (2) approval of the Plan by the shareholders of PAX, (3) Employee\'s continued employment through the vesting dates set forth below in (b), (4) satisfaction of the Performance Target, and (5) reapproval of the Performance Target by the PAX Compensation Committee subsequent to the Effective Time. 

   

      

   

 (b) 300,000 restricted shares shall become vested on the first anniversary of the Effective Time, provided that the Performance Target is met as of September 30, 2010; 300,000 restricted shares shall become vested on the second anniversary of the Effective Time, provided that the Performance Target is met as of September 30, 2011; and 300,000 restricted shares shall become vested on the third anniversary of the Effective Time, provided that the Performance Target is met as of September 30, 2012. 

  

 (c) Notwithstanding subsections (a) and (b), if, prior to the Employee\'s fully satisfying the above 3-year vesting requirement, Employee\'s employment with the Company shall be terminated by the Company without cause or by the Employee for Good Reason, in any such event, the requirement of continued employment shall no longer apply, so that, assuming the Performance Target is met as of the relevant date, the restricted shares shall thereupon become fully vested, no longer subject to restrictions, and transferable. As used in this subsection, "Good Reason" shall mean the voluntary termination by Employee of her employment with the Company within six months of the Company\'s (A) instructing the Employee to work (or provide services) full-time or substantially full-time at any location not acceptable to the Employee (other than the employer\'s main headquarters) that is more than 50 miles from Employee\'s principal place of work and more than 50 miles from Employee\'s principal residence, (B) eliminating or materially reducing the Employee\'s duties for the Company, or (C) materially reducing the Employee\'s base pay (or compensation). 

   

  

 7. A new section 15 is added, effective as of the Effective Time: 

  

  

 15. Section 280G. 

    

 (a) Notwithstanding anything in this Employment Agreement to the contrary, in the event that the Company\'s independent public accountants (the "Accountants") shall determine that receipt of all payments or benefits made or provided by the Company or its affiliated companies in the nature of compensation to or for Employee\'s benefit (each, a "Payment"), whether payable or to be provided pursuant to this Employment Agreement or otherwise, and including, without limitation, the post-termination payments and benefits provided pursuant to Section 11(c) and the restricted shares provided pursuant to Section 14, would subject Employee to the excise tax under Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), the Payments shall be reduced to the Reduced Amount (as defined below). 

   

 (b) If the Accountants determine that aggregate Payments should be reduced to the Reduced Amount, the Company shall promptly give Employee notice to that effect and a copy of the detailed calculation thereof. Any reduction of the Payments shall be made in such a manner as will provide Employee with the greatest Net After-Tax Receipt, as defined below. 

  

 (c) As a result of the uncertainty in the application of Section 4999 of the Code at the time of the initial determination by the Accountants hereunder, it is possible that Payments will have been made by the Company to or for the benefit of Employee which should not have been so made ("Overpayment"), or that additional amounts which will have not been paid or distributed by the Company to or for the benefit of Employee could have been so paid or distributed ("Underpayment"), in each case, consistent with the calculation of the Reduced Amount hereunder. In the event that the Accountants, based upon the assertion of a deficiency by the Internal Revenue Service against either the Company or Employee which the Accountants believe has a high probability of success, determine that an Overpayment has been made, Employee shall pay any such Overpayment to the Company together with interest at the applicable federal rate provided for in Section 7872(f)(2) of the Code; provided, however, that no amount shall be payable by Employee to the Company if and to the extent such payment would not either reduce the amount on which Employee is subject to tax under 

   

      

   
  

Section 1 and Section 4999 of the Code or generate a refund of such taxes. In
the event that the Accountants determine that an Underpayment has occurred,
any such Underpayment shall be promptly paid by the Company to or for the
benefit of Employee together with interest at the applicable federal rate
provided for in Section 7872(f)(2) of the Code.

  

 (d) The following terms have the meanings set forth below: 

    

 (i) "Reduced Amount" shall mean the greatest amount of Payments that can be paid that would not result in the imposition of the excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code. 

  

 (ii) "Net After-Tax Receipt" shall mean the present value (as determined in accordance with Sections 280G(b)(2)(A)(ii) and 280G(d)(4) of the Code) of all Payments net of all taxes imposed on Employee with respect thereto under the Code and under applicable state and local laws, determined by applying the highest marginal rate under Section 1 of the Code and under state and local laws which applied to Employee\'s taxable income for the immediately preceding taxable year, or such other rate(s) as Employee certifies, in Employee\'s sole discretion, as likely to apply to him in the relevant tax year(s). 

    

 (e) Subject to the last sentence of this subsection (e), all determinations made by the Accountants under this Section 15 shall be conclusive and binding upon the Company and Employee for all purposes. All fees and expenses of the Accountants shall be borne solely by the Company. For purposes of making the calculations required by this Section 15, the Accountants may make reasonable assumptions and approximations concerning applicable taxes and may rely on reasonable, good faith interpretations concerning the application of Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code. The Company and Employee will furnish to the Accountants such information and documents as the Accountants may reasonably request in order to make determinations under this Section 15\. In the event that Employee or Company disagrees with the determination of the Accountants under this Section 15, either can have such determination reviewed through the Alternative Dispute Resolution mechanism set forth in Section 12. If such mechanism is used, review shall be de novo and no presumption of correctness shall attach to the Accountants\' determination. 

   

  

 8. A new Section 16 is added, effective as of January 1, 2009. 

  

  

 16. Section 409A. 

    

 (a) The Company intends that the reimbursements, payments and benefits to which Employee could become entitled under this Employment Agreement be exempt from or comply with Section 409A of the Code and the regulations and other guidance promulgated thereunder ("Section 409A"). The provisions of this Section 16 shall qualify and supersede all other provisions of this Agreement as necessary to fulfill the foregoing intention. If Company believes, at any time, that any of such reimbursement, payment or benefit is not exempt or does not so comply, Company will promptly advise the Employee and will reasonably and in good faith amend the terms of such arrangement such that it is exempt or complies (with the most limited possible economic effect on the Employee and on Company) or to minimize any additional tax, interest and/or penalties that may apply under Section 409A if exemption or compliance is not practicable. Company agrees that it will not, without Employee\'s prior written consent, knowingly take any action, or knowingly refrain from taking any action, other than as required by law, that would result in the imposition of tax, interest and/or penalties upon the Employee under Section 409A, unless such action or omission is pursuant to the Employee\'s written request. 

   

      

   

 (b) To the extent applicable, each and every payment to be made pursuant to this Employment Agreement shall be treated as a separate payment and not as one of a series of payments treated as a single payment for purposes of Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-2(b)(2)(iii). 

  

 (c) If Employee is a "specified employee" (determined by Company in accordance with Section 409A and Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-3(i)(2)) as of the date that the Employee experiences a separation from service, as defined in Treasury Regulations Section 1.409A-1(h)(1), from the Company (a "Separation from Service") and if any reimbursement, payment or benefit to be paid or provided under this Employment Agreement or otherwise both (i) constitutes a "deferral of compensation" within the meaning of and subject to Section 409A ("Nonqualified Deferred Compensation") and (ii) cannot be paid or provided in a manner otherwise provided herein without subjecting the Employee to additional tax, interest and/or penalties under Section 409A, then any such reimbursement, payment or benefit that is payable during the first six months following the Employee\'s date of termination shall be paid or provided to the Employee in a lump sum cash payment to be made, with interest at the applicable federal rate, on the earlier of (x) Employee\'s death and (y) the first business day of the seventh (7th) month immediately following Employee\'s Separation from Service. To the extent available, all the exceptions of Treasury Regulations Section 1.409A-1(b)(9) shall apply in implementing the rules of this section. 

  

 (d) Except to the extent any reimbursement, payment or benefit to be paid or provided under this Employment Agreement does not constitute Nonqualified Deferred Compensation, (i) the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement or the provision of any in-kind benefit (as defined in Section 409A) to Employee during any calendar year will not affect the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement or provided as in-kind benefits to the Employee in any other calendar year (subject to any lifetime and other annual limits provided under Company\'s health plans), (ii) the reimbursements for expenses for which Employee is entitled shall be made on or before the last day of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the applicable expense is incurred and (iii) the right to payment or reimbursement or in-kind benefits may not be liquidated or exchanged for any other benefit. 

  

 (e) Any reimbursement, payment or benefit to be paid or provided under this Employment Agreement due to a Separation from Service that is exempt from Section 409A pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(9)(v) will be paid or provided to Employee only to the extent the expenses are not incurred or the benefits are not provided beyond the last day of the Employee\'s second taxable year following the Employee\'s taxable year in which the Separation from Service occurs; provided, however, that Company shall reimburse such expenses no later than the last day of the third taxable year following Employee\'s taxable year in which Employee\'s Separation from Service occurs. 

  

 (f) Any reimbursement, payment or benefit to be paid or provided under this Agreement that constitutes Nonqualified Deferred Compensation due upon a termination of employment shall be paid or provided to Employee only in the event of a Separation from Service. 

   

  

 Subject to the foregoing, the Employment Agreement remains in full force and effect, and Company and Employee hereby ratify and affirm the Employment Agreement in each and every respect. 

        

 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned have executed this Second Amendment on the dates written below.

 NOW, THEREFORE, for good and valuable consideration the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereby amend the Agreement, as follows: 

  

 1. Section 3 is amended as of the Effective Time to read as follows: 

  

   

 (a) Employee shall be employed by the Company pursuant to this Agreement for a term (the "Term") beginning on June 15, 2009, and continuing through to, and terminating at the close of business on January 31, 2014 (unless earlier terminated pursuant to Section 11). 

   

  

 2. Section 5(c) is deleted effective as of the Effective Time. 

  

 3. Section 11(a) is deleted effective as of the Effective Time by deleting the words "eighteen (18) month." 

  

 4. Section 11(c) is amended as of the Effective Time to read as follows: 

  

  

 If the Employee is terminated by Company prior to the end of the Term without cause, then Company shall continue to pay Employee the basic salary described in Section 5(a) for the remainder of the Term of the Agreement on the Company\'s ordinary payroll dates applicable to similarly situated employees of the Company, together with such other employee benefits (other than continued participation under the Company\'s Section 401(k) plan) as Employee may be entitled to under the provisions of Section 6 (or if such benefits cannot be provided to Employee pursuant to the terms of the applicable plans, comparable benefits, provided, however, that the provision of comparable benefits shall be made following Employee\'s termination of employment only if and to the extent that such benefits may be provided at no additional cost to the Company above what was previously paid by the Company). Notwithstanding Section 2, if Company instructs Employee to work full-time or substantially full-time at any location not acceptable to Employee (other than the Company\'s main headquarters) that is more than 50 miles from Employee\'s then principal place of work and more than 50 miles from Employee\'s then principal residence, or eliminates or materially reduces his duties as a senior executive level manager and supervisor of projects, personnel and budgets, then Employee may elect to deem such action(s) a constructive termination by Company and resign his employment, provided that (i) such resignation occurs within one year of such action(s); (ii) Employee provides written notice to the Company of such action(s) within 90 days thereof; and (iii) the Company fails to cure the action(s) constituting such 

  

      

  

constructive termination within 30 days of receipt of the notice. In the
event of such a resignation, Company shall continue to pay or provide the

of the Term and Employee\'s employment shall be terminated.

  

  

 5. The old Section 12 captioned "Miscellaneous" shall be renumbered as Section 15\. 

  

 6. A new Section 12 is added, effective as of the Effective Time: 

  

  

 15. _ Restricted Shares._

    

 (a) Immediately after the Effective Time and subject to the conditions set forth herein, Employee shall be issued 900,000 restricted shares of common stock of PAX. The restricted shares are conditioned on (1) approval by the PAX Compensation Committee of the issuance and terms of the restricted shares under the Kennedy-Wilson Holdings, Inc. 2009 Equity Participation Plan (the "Plan"), subject to the conditions set forth below in (b) and (c), (2) approval of the Plan by the shareholders of PAX, (3) Employee\'s continued employment through the vesting dates set forth below in (b), (4) satisfaction of the Performance Target and (5) reapproval of the Performance Target by the PAX Compensation Committee subsequent to the Effective Time. The "Performance Target" is that the Company\'s assets under management by the Company be at least $3 billion. For this purpose, "assets under management" shall equal the value of assets under management, as reflected in the footnotes to the Company\'s financial statements, plus the cost of properties subject to property management contracts with the Company (not taking into account any properties whose value is reflected in the footnotes). The restricted shares shall be subject to all terms and conditions of the Plan. 

  

 (b) 300,000 restricted shares shall become vested on the first anniversary of the Effective Time, provided that the Performance Target is met as of September 30, 2010; 300,000 restricted shares shall become vested on the second anniversary of the Effective Time, provided that the Performance Target is met as of September 30, 2011; and 300,000 restricted shares shall become vested on the third anniversary of the Effective Time, provided that the Performance Target is met as of September 30, 2012. 

  

 (c) Notwithstanding subsections (a) and (b), if, prior to the Employee\'s fully satisfying the above 3-year vesting requirement, Employee\'s employment with the Company shall be terminated by the Company without cause or by Employee for Good Reason, in any such event, the requirement of continued employment shall no longer apply, so that, assuming the Performance Target is met as of the relevant date(s), the restricted shares shall thereupon become fully vested, no longer subject to restrictions, and transferable. As used in this subsection, "Good Reason" shall mean the voluntary termination by Employee of his employment with the Company within six months of the Company\'s (A) instructing the Employee to work (or provide services) full-time or substantially full-time at any location not acceptable to the Employee (other than the employer\'s main headquarters) that is more than 50 miles from Employee\'s principal place of work and more than 50 miles from Employee\'s principal residence, (B) eliminating or materially reducing the Employee\'s duties for the Company, or (C) materially reducing the Employee\'s base pay (or compensation). 

   

  

 7. A new Section 13 is added, effective as of the Effective Time. 

  

  

 13. Section 280G. 

    

 (a) Notwithstanding anything in this Employment Agreement to the contrary, in the event that the Company\'s independent public accountants (the "Accountants") shall determine that receipt of all payments or benefits made or provided by the Company or its affiliated companies in the nature of compensation to or for Employee\'s benefit (each, a "Payment"), 

   

      

   

whether payable or to be provided pursuant to this Employment Agreement or
otherwise, and including, without limitation, the post-termination payments
and benefits provided pursuant to Section 11(c) and the restricted shares
provided pursuant to Section 12, would subject Employee to the excise tax
under Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
"Code"), the Payments shall be reduced to the Reduced Amount (as defined
below).

  

 (b) If the Accountants determine that aggregate Payments should be reduced to the Reduced Amount, the Company shall promptly give Employee notice to that effect and a copy of the detailed calculation thereof. Any reduction of the Payments shall be made in such a manner as will provide Employee with the greatest Net After-Tax Receipt, as defined below.

 8. A new Section 14 is added, effective as of January 1, 2009: 

  

  

 14. Section 409A. 

    

 (a) The Company intends that the reimbursements, payments and benefits to which Employee could become entitled under this Employment Agreement be exempt from or comply with Section 409A of the Code and the regulations and other guidance promulgated thereunder ("Section 409A").

 (c) If Employee is a "specified employee" (determined by Company in accordance with Section 409A and Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-3(i)(2)) as of the date that the Employee experiences a separation from service, as defined in Treasury Regulations Section 1.409A-1(h)(1), from the Company (a "Separation from Service") and if any reimbursement, payment or benefit to be paid or provided under this Employment Agreement or otherwise both (i) constitutes a "deferral of compensation" within the meaning of and subject to Section 409A ("Nonqualified Deferred Compensation") and (ii) cannot be paid or provided in a manner otherwise provided herein without subjecting the Employee to additional tax, interest and/or penalties under Section 409A, then any such reimbursement, payment or benefit that is payable during the first six months following the Employee\'s date of termination shall be paid or provided to the Employee in a lump sum cash payment to be made, with interest at the applicable federal rate, on the earlier of (x) the Employee\'s death and (y) the first business day of the seventh (7th) month immediately following the Employee\'s Separation from Service. To the extent available, all the exceptions of Treasury Regulations Section 1.409A-1(b)(9) shall apply in implementing the rules of this section. 

  

 (d) Except to the extent any reimbursement, payment or benefit to be paid or provided under this Employment Agreement does not constitute Nonqualified Deferred Compensation, (i) the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement or the provision of any in-kind benefit (as defined in Section 409A) to Employee during any calendar year will not affect the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement or provided as in-kind benefits to the Employee in any other calendar year (subject to any lifetime and other annual limits provided under Company\'s health plans), (ii) the reimbursements for expenses for which Employee is entitled shall be made on or before the last day of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the 

   

      

   
  

applicable expense is incurred and (iii) the right to payment or
reimbursement or in-kind benefits may not be liquidated or exchanged for any
other benefit.

  

 (e) Any reimbursement, payment or benefit to be paid or provided under this Employment Agreement due to a Separation from Service that is exempt from Section 409A pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(9)(v) will be paid or provided to Employee only to the extent the expenses are not incurred or the benefits are not provided beyond the last day of the Employee\'s second taxable year following the Employee\'s taxable year in which the Separation from Service occurs; provided, however, that Company shall reimburse such expenses no later than the last day of the third taxable year following the Employee\'s taxable year in which the Employee\'s Separation from Service occurs. 

  

 (f) Any reimbursement, payment or benefit to be paid or provided under this Agreement that constitutes Nonqualified Deferred Compensation due upon a termination of employment shall be paid or provided to Employee only in the event of a Separation from Service. 

   

  

 Subject to the foregoing, the Employment Agreement remains in full force and effect, and Company and Employee hereby ratify and affirm the Employment Agreement in each and every respect.

  LOCK-UP AGREEMENT 

  

 THIS LOCK-UP AGREEMENT (this "Lock-Up Agreement"), dated as of  _ _, 2009, by and among Prospect Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation (the "Company") and  _ _ (the "Stockholder"). 

  

 WHEREAS, the Company was organized to serve as a vehicle to effect a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or other similar business combination with one or more operating business in the financial services industry ("Business Combination"); 

  

 WHEREAS, the Company consummated an initial public offering in November 2007 ("IPO") in connection with which it raised net proceeds of approximately $247.0 million which were placed in a trust account pending the consummation of a Business Combination, or the dissolution and liquidation of the Company, in the event it is unable to consummate a Business Combination by November 14, 2009; 

   

 WHEREAS, the Company expects to consummate a Business Combination with Kennedy-Wilson, Inc. (the "Acquisition") pursuant to certain agreements. 

  

 WHEREAS, the Stockholder owns _ _ shares of the Company\'s common stock, of which the Company desires that _ _ shares(1) (the "Three Month Shares") be locked up for three months and that  _ _ shares(2) (the "One-Year Shares") be locked up for one year, and which the Stockholder has agreed that it will lock-up for such periods of time. (1) 10% of shares received as merger consideration.

 (b) For the purpose of effectuating this Lock-Up Agreement, the Stockholder hereby consents to the Company issuing a stop transfer instruction to the transfer agent in accordance with the terms of this Lock-Up Agreement. Any sale of Shares in violation of this Lock-Up Agreement by the Stockholder without the consent of the Company shall constitute a material breach of this Lock-Up Agreement. 

  

 (c) The Stockholder acknowledges that its breach or impending violation of any of the provisions of this Lock-Up Agreement may cause irreparable damage to the Company for which remedies at law would be inadequate. The Stockholder further acknowledges and agrees that the provisions set forth herein are essential terms and conditions of the Lock-Up Agreement that the Company may seek to enforce in addition to any of its rights or remedies provided under any other agreement decree or order by any court of competent jurisdiction enjoining such impending or actual violation of any of such provisions.

 Section 3. Should any part of this Lock-Up Agreement, for any reason whatsoever, be declared invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced in whole or in part, such decision shall not affect the validity of any remaining portion, which remaining portion shall remain in full force and effect as if this Lock-Up Agreement had been executed with the invalid portion thereof eliminated, and it is hereby declared the intention of the parties hereto that they would have executed the remaining portion of this Lock-Up Agreement without including therein any portion which may for any reason be declared invalid. 

   

 Section 4. This Lock-Up Agreement shall be construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of New York applicable to agreements made and to be performed in such State without application of the principles of conflicts of laws of such State. 

  

 Section 5. This Lock-Up Agreement and all rights hereunder are personal to the parties and shall not be assignable, and any purported assignment in violation thereof shall be null and void. 

   

 Section 6. (a) All notices, requests, demands and other communications to any party hereunder shall be in writing and shall be given to such party at its address or telecopier number set forth on the 

        

signature page hereto, or such other address or telecopier number as such

[now known as Kennedy-Wilson Holdings, Inc.]

  

 PROSPECT ACQUISITION CORP., a corporation existing under the laws of the State of Delaware, does hereby certify as follows: 

  

 1. The name of the Corporation is "Prospect Acquisition Corp." 

  

 2. The Corporation was originally incorporated under the name "Prospect Acquisition Corp." The original Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation was filed in the office of the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on July 9, 2007, which was amended by the Company by the filing of a Certificate of Amendment in the office of the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on October 12, 2007 (the " _Original Certificate_ "). 

  

 3. The First Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation was filed on March 31, 2008 (the _"First Amended and Restated Certificate"_ ) and it amended, restated and integrated the provisions of the Original Certificate of the Corporation. 

  

 4. This Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (this _"Second Amended and Restated Certificate"_ ) amends, restates and integrates the provisions of the First Amended and Restated Certificate of the Corporation. 

   

 4. This Second Amended and Restated Certificate was duly approved and adopted by the board of directors and stockholders of the Corporation in accordance with the applicable provisions of Sections 242 and 245 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware ( _"DGCL"_ ). 

  

 5. The text of the Amended and Restated Certificate is hereby amended and restated to read in its entirety as follows: 

  

 FIRST: The name of the corporation is Kennedy-Wilson Holdings, Inc. (the _"Corporation"_ ). 

   

 SECOND: The purpose of the Corporation shall be to engage in any lawful act or activity for which corporations may be organized under the DGCL. 

  

 THIRD: The address of the Corporation\'s registered office in the State of Delaware is 2711 Centerville Road, Suite 400, Wilmington, County of New Castle, Delaware 19808\. The name of the Corporation\'s registered agent at such address is the Corporation Service Company. 

  

 FOURTH: The total number of shares of all classes of capital stock which the Corporation shall have authority to issue is  _ _, of which  _ _ shares shall be Common Stock with a par value of $.0001 per share (the  _"Common Stock"_ ) and 1,000,000 shares shall be Preferred Stock with a par value of $.0001 per share (the _"Preferred Stock"_ ). 

  

  

 A. _Preferred Stock._ The Board of Directors (the " _Board_ ") is expressly granted authority to issue shares of Preferred Stock, in one or more series, and to fix for each such series such voting powers, full or limited, and such designations, preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special rights and such qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof as shall be stated and expressed in the resolution or resolutions adopted by the Board providing for the issue of such series (a _"Preferred Stock Designation"_ ) and as may be permitted by the DGCL. The number of authorized shares of Preferred Stock may be increased or decreased (but not below the number of shares thereof then outstanding) by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of all of the then outstanding shares of the capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, without a separate vote of   

  

the holders of the Preferred Stock, or any series thereof, unless a vote of
any such holders is required pursuant to any Preferred Stock Designation.

   

 B. _Common Stock._ Except as otherwise required by law or as otherwise provided in any Preferred Stock Designation, the holders of the Common Stock shall exclusively possess all voting power and each share of Common Stock shall have one vote. 

  

  

 FIFTH: The Corporation\'s existence shall be perpetual. 

  

 SIXTH: The following provisions are inserted for the management of the business and for the conduct of the affairs of the Corporation, and for further definition, limitation and regulation of the powers of the Corporation and of its directors and stockholders: 

  

  

 A. The Board of Directors shall consist of such number of directors as is determined from time to time by resolution adopted by the affirmative vote of a majority of the entire Board of Directors; provided, however, that in no event shall the number of directors be less than one nor more than twelve. The directors shall be divided into three classes, designated Class I, Class II and Class III. The number of directors in each class shall be as nearly equal as possible. The directors in Class I shall be elected for a term expiring at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders to be held in 2010. The directors in Class II shall be elected for a term expiring at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders to be held in 2011. The directors in Class III shall be elected for a term expiring at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders to be held in 2012. Beginning with the 2010 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, each class of directors will be elected for a term of office to expire at the third succeeding Annual Meeting of Stockholders after its election. Except as the DGCL may otherwise require, in the interim between annual meetings of stockholders or special meetings of stockholders called for the election of directors and/or the removal of one or more directors and the filling of any vacancy in that connection, newly created directorships and any vacancies in the Board, including unfilled vacancies resulting from the removal of directors for cause, may be filled by the vote of a majority of the remaining directors then in office, although less than a quorum (as defined in the Corporation\'s bylaws), or by the sole remaining director. All directors shall hold office until the expiration of their respective terms of office and until their successors shall have been elected and qualified. A director elected to fill a vacancy resulting from the death, resignation or removal of a director shall serve for the remainder of the full term of the director whose death, resignation or removal shall have created such vacancy and until his successor shall have been elected and qualified. 

  

 B. Election of directors need not be by ballot unless the bylaws of the Corporation so provide. 

   

 C. The Board shall have the power, without the assent or vote of the stockholders, to make, alter, amend, change, add to or repeal the bylaws of the Corporation as provided in the bylaws of the Corporation, subject to the power of stockholders to alter or repeal any bylaw whether adopted by them or otherwise. 

  

 D. The directors in their discretion may submit any contract or act for approval or ratification at any annual meeting of the stockholders or at any meeting of the stockholders called for the purpose of considering any such act or contract, and any contract or act that shall be approved or be ratified by the vote of the holders of a majority of the stock of the Corporation which is represented in person or by proxy at such meeting and entitled to vote thereat (provided that a lawful quorum of stockholders be there represented in person or by proxy), unless a higher vote is required by applicable law, shall be as valid and binding upon the Corporation and upon all the stockholders as though it had been approved or ratified by every stockholder of the Corporation, whether or not the contract or act would otherwise be open to legal attack because of directors\' interests, or for any other reason. 

  

 E. In addition to the powers and authorities hereinbefore or by statute expressly conferred upon them, the directors are hereby empowered to exercise all such powers and do all such acts and things as may be exercised or done by the Corporation; subject, nevertheless, to the provisions   

  
  

of the statutes of Delaware, of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate,
and to any bylaws from time to time made by the stockholders; provided,
however, that no bylaw so made shall invalidate any prior act of the
directors which would have been valid if such bylaw had not been made.

  

  

 SEVENTH: The following paragraphs shall apply with respect to liability and indemnification of the Corporation\'s officers and directors and certain other persons: 

  

  

 A. A director of the Corporation shall not be personally liable to the Corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except for liability (i) for any breach of the director\'s duty of loyalty to the Corporation or its stockholders, (ii) for acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law, (iii) under Section 174 of the DGCL, or (iv) for any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit. If the DGCL is amended to authorize corporate action further eliminating or limiting the personal liability of directors, then the liability of a director of the Corporation shall be eliminated or limited to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL, as so amended. Any repeal or modification of this paragraph (A) by the stockholders of the Corporation shall not adversely affect any right or protection of a director of the Corporation with respect to events occurring prior to the time of such repeal or modification. 

  

 B. The Corporation, to the full extent permitted by Section 145 of the DGCL, as amended from time to time, shall indemnify all persons whom it may indemnify pursuant thereto. Expenses (including attorneys\' fees) incurred by an officer or director in defending any civil, criminal, administrative, or investigative action, suit or proceeding for which such officer or director may be entitled to indemnification hereunder shall be paid by the Corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such director or officer to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that he is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation as authorized hereby. 

  

  

 EIGHTH: Whenever a compromise or arrangement is proposed between the Corporation and its creditors or any class of them and/or between the Corporation and its stockholders or any class of them, any court of equitable jurisdiction within the State of Delaware may, on the application in a summary way of the Corporation or of any creditor or stockholder thereof or on the application of any receiver or receivers appointed for the Corporation under Section 291 of Title 8 of the Delaware Code or on the application of trustees in dissolution or of any receiver or receivers appointed for the Corporation under Section 279 of Title 8 of the Delaware Code order a meeting of the creditors or class of creditors, and/or of the stockholders or class of stockholders of the Corporation, as the case may be, to be summoned in such manner as the said court directs. If a majority in number representing three fourths in value of the creditors or class of creditors, and/or of the stockholders or class of stockholders of the Corporation, as the case may be, agree to any compromise or arrangement and to any reorganization of the Corporation as a consequence of such compromise or arrangement, the said compromise or arrangement and the said reorganization shall, if sanctioned by the court to which the said application has been made, be binding on all the creditors or class of creditors, and/or on all the stockholders or class of stockholders, of the Corporation, as the case may be, and also on the Corporation. 

  

 NINTH: The Corporation reserves the right to amend, alter, change or repeal any provision contained in this Second Amended and Restated Certificate in the manner now or hereafter prescribed by law, and all rights and powers conferred herein on stockholders, directors and officers are subject to this reserved power. 

  

 [Signature Page Follows]    

 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Corporation has caused this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to be duly executed by the undersigned as of this the  _ _ day of November, 2009.

1. Amendment of Warrant Agreement. 

  

  

 (a) _ New Section 11A._ The following shall be added as a new Section 11A of the Warrant Agreement:       

"SECTION 11A. _The Merger_. Pursuant to the Merger (as defined below), the
Warrants shall be treated as follows:

  

 (a) Public Warrants. 

  

  

 (1) Each Public Warrant will be automatically (without any action on the part of the holders of Public Warrants) converted into the right to receive either (x) $0.55 in cash (the " _Cash Amount_ ") or (y) an amended and restated Public Warrant with an exercise price of $12.50, a redemption trigger price of $19.50 and an expiration date of November 14, 2013 (the " _Amended and Restated Public Warrant_ "), in each case as the holder of such Public Warrant shall have elected or be deemed to have elected (an " _Election_ ") in accordance with _Sections 11A(a)(2)_ and _11A(c)_. Following the Merger, the Warrant Agreement shall be amended and restated in the form attached hereto as Exhibit C (the " _Amended and Restated Warrant Agreement_ "). The Amended and Restated Public Warrants will contain the terms and conditions set forth in the Amended and Restated Warrant Agreement. 

  

 (2) Subject to the procedures in _Section 11A(c)_ and the limitations in _Section 11A(a)(3)_, each holder of Public Warrants outstanding immediately prior to the Election Date who makes a valid Election to receive Amended and Restated Public Warrants will be entitled to receive the Amended and Restated Public Warrants in respect of such Public Warrants; _provided that_ , notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, a holder of a Public Warrant shall not be able to make a valid election to receive an Amended and Restated Public Warrant with respect to any Public Warrants that it voted against this Amendment.

 (3) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary: 

    

 (A) the maximum number of Public Warrants to be converted into the right to receive the Amended and Restated Public Warrants will be equal to 12,500,000 (the " _Warrant Limit_ "); and 

   

 (B) the minimum number of Public Warrants to be converted into the right to receive the Cash Amount will be equal to (x) the number of Public Warrants outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time less (y) the Warrant Limit. 

    

 (4) Upon the closing of the Merger: 

    

 (A) all Public Warrants for which Elections to receive the Cash Amount have been made or deemed to have been made (the " _Cash Election Warrants_ ") will be converted into the right to receive the Cash Amount; and 

   

 (B) to the extent the aggregate number of Public Warrants making an Election to receive Amended and Restated Public Warrants (the " _Warrant Election Warrants_ ") exceeds the Warrant Limit, the Warrant Election Warrants will be converted into the right to receive the Cash Amount and the Amended and Restated Public Warrants in the following manner: 

    

 (x) the number of Warrant Election Warrants covered by each Form of Election (as defined below) to be converted into Amended and Restated Public Warrants will be determined by multiplying the number of Warrant Election Warrants covered by such Form of Election by a fraction, (a) the numerator of which is the Warrant Limit and (b) the denominator of which is the aggregate number of Warrant Election Warrants; and 

    

      

    

 (y) all Warrant Election Warrants not converted into Amended and Restated Public Warrants in accordance with clause (x) will be converted into the right to receive the Cash Amount in respect thereof. 

    

  

 (b) _ Sponsors\' Warrants._ Each Sponsors\' Warrant will be amended and restated to provide for an exercise price of $12.50, a redemption trigger price of $19.50 and an expiration date of November 14, 2013 (the " _Amended and Restated Sponsors\' Warrants_ ").

 _(c) Election/Exchange Procedures for Public Warrants_. 

   

 (1) The Company will authorize the Exchange Agent (as defined in the Merger Agreement) to receive Elections. 

  

 (2) The Company will prepare, for use by the holders of Public Warrants in surrendering Warrant Certificates, a form (the " _Form of Election_ ") pursuant to which each holder of Public Warrants may make an Election. The Form of Election will be delivered to such Warrant holders by means and at a time upon which the Company and KW will mutually agree. 

  

 (3) An Election will have been properly made only if a Form of Election properly completed and signed and accompanied by the Warrant Certificate or Warrant Certificates to which such Form of Election relates (x) is received by the Exchange Agent prior to the date and time (the " _Election Date_ ") of the special meeting of warrantholders being held to approve the Warrant Amendment Proposal (the " _Special Meeting_ ") or (y) is tendered for delivery to the Exchange Agent at the Special Meeting. 

  

 (4) Any Public Warrant holder may at any time prior to the Election Date change such holder\'s Election if the Exchange Agent receives (x) prior to the Election Date written notice of such change accompanied by a properly completed Form of Election or (y) at the Special Meeting a new, properly completed Form of Election. The Company will have the right in its sole discretion to permit changes in Elections after the Election Date. 

  

 (5) The Company will have the right to make rules, not inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement or the Merger Agreement, governing the validity of Forms of Election, the manner and extent to which Elections are to be taken into account in making the determinations prescribed by this section, the issuance and delivery of certificates for the Amended and Restated Public Warrants, and the payment of the Cash Amount. 

  

 (6) In connection with the above procedures, (A) the holders of Warrant Certificates evidencing Public Warrants will surrender such certificates to the Exchange Agent, (B) upon surrender of a Warrant Certificate the holder thereof will be entitled to receive the Cash Amount or Amended and Restated Public Warrants, as applicable, and (C) the Warrant Certificates so surrendered will forthwith be canceled.

AMENDED AND RESTATED WARRANT AGREEMENT dated as of [ _
_], 2009, between Kennedy-Wilson Holdings, Inc. (formerly Prospect
Acquisition Corp.), a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ "), and
Continental Stock Transfer and Trust Company, a New York corporation, as
Warrant Agent (the " _Warrant Agent_ ").

  

 WHEREAS, on November 14, 2007, the Company issued (i) 5,250,000 warrants in a private placement bearing the legend set forth in Exhibit B hereto (the " _Sponsors\' Warrants_ "), and (ii) 25,000,000 warrants pursuant to a registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _Public Warrants_ " and together with the Sponsors\' Warrants, the " _Warrants_ "), which in each case entitle the holders thereof to purchase shares of common stock of the Company, $0.0001 par value per share (" _Common Stock_ ," and the Common Stock issuable on exercise of the Warrants, the " _Warrant Shares_ "); 

   

 WHEREAS, the Company desires the Warrant Agent to act on behalf of the Company, and the Warrant Agent is willing so to act, in connection with the issuance, transfer, exchange and exercise of Warrants and other matters as provided herein; 

  

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual agreements herein set forth, the parties hereto agree as follows: 

  

 SECTION 1. _ Appointment of Warrant Agent._ The Company hereby appoints the Warrant Agent to act as agent for the Company in accordance with the instructions set forth hereinafter in this Agreement, and the Warrant Agent hereby accepts such appointment. 

   

 SECTION 2. _ Warrant Certificates._ The certificates evidencing the Warrants (the " _Warrant Certificates_ ") to be delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall be in registered form only and shall be substantially in the form set forth in Exhibit A attached hereto. 

  

 SECTION 3. _ Execution of Warrant Certificates._ Warrant Certificates shall be signed on behalf of the Company by its Chairman of the Board or its President or Chief Executive Officer or a Vice President and by its Secretary or an Assistant Secretary. Each such signature upon the Warrant Certificates may be in the form of a facsimile signature of the present or any future Chairman of the Board, President, Chief Executive Officer, Vice President, Secretary or Assistant Secretary and may be imprinted or otherwise reproduced on the Warrant Certificates and for that purpose the Company may adopt and use the facsimile signature of any person who shall have been Chairman of the Board, President, Chief Executive Officer, Vice President, Secretary or Assistant Secretary, notwithstanding the fact that at the time the Warrant Certificates shall be countersigned and delivered or disposed of he or she shall have ceased to hold such office. 

  

 In case any officer of the Company who shall have signed any of the Warrant Certificates shall cease to be such officer before the Warrant Certificates so signed shall have been countersigned by the Warrant Agent, or disposed of by the Company, such Warrant Certificates nevertheless may be countersigned and delivered or disposed of as though such person had not ceased to be such officer of the Company; and any Warrant Certificate may be signed on behalf of the Company by any person who, at the actual date of the execution of such Warrant Certificate, shall be a proper officer of the Company to sign such Warrant Certificate, although at the date of the execution of this Warrant Agreement any such person was not such officer. 

  

 Warrant Certificates shall be dated the date of countersignature by the Warrant Agent. 

   

 SECTION 4. _ Registration and Countersignature._ Warrant Certificates shall be countersigned by the Warrant Agent and shall not be valid for any purpose unless so countersigned. The Warrant Agent shall, upon written instructions of the Chairman of the Board, the President or Chief Executive Officer, a Vice President, the Treasurer or the Chief Financial Officer of the Company, countersign, issue and deliver Warrants as provided in this Agreement. 

  

 The Company and the Warrant Agent may deem and treat the registered holder(s) of the Warrant Certificates as the absolute owner(s) thereof (notwithstanding any notation of ownership or other writing thereon made by anyone), for all purposes, and neither the Company nor the Warrant Agent shall be affected by any notice to the contrary.      

 SECTION 5. _ Registration of Transfers and Exchanges; Transfer Restrictions._ The Warrant Agent shall from time to time, subject to the limitations of this Section 5, register the transfer of any outstanding Warrant Certificates upon the records to be maintained by it for that purpose, upon surrender thereof duly endorsed or accompanied (if so required by the Warrant Agent) by a written instrument or instruments of transfer in form satisfactory to the Warrant Agent, duly executed by the registered holder or holders thereof or by the duly appointed legal representative thereof or by a duly authorized attorney. Upon any such registration of transfer, a new Warrant Certificate shall be issued to the transferee(s) and the surrendered Warrant Certificate shall be cancelled by the Warrant Agent. Cancelled Warrant Certificates shall thereafter be disposed of by the Warrant Agent in its customary manner. 

  

 The Sponsors\' Warrants may not be sold or transferred prior to [ _ _], 2009(1) (such date, the " _Transfer Restriction Termination Date_ ") except to a Permitted Transferee who agrees in writing with the Company (i) to be subject to such transfer restrictions and (ii) that such Sponsors\' Warrants will be held in an escrow account established pursuant to the Escrow Agreement referred to below until the Transfer Restriction Termination Date. As used herein, " _Permitted Transferee_ " means a transfer (i) to any officer or director of the Company, any affiliates or family members of any officer or director of the Company or any affiliates of any Sponsor (as defined herein), (ii) in the case of a natural person, by gift to a member of such person\'s immediate family or to a trust, the beneficiary of which is a member of such person\'s immediate family, an affiliate of such person or to a charitable organization, (iii) in the case of a natural person, by virtue of the laws of descent and distribution upon death of such person, (iv) with respect to any Sponsor, by virtue of the laws of Delaware or such Sponsor\'s organizational documents upon dissolution of such Sponsor, (v) in the case of a natural person, pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order, or (vi) in the event the Company\'s consummation of a liquidation, merger, stock exchange or other similar transaction which results in all of the Company\'s stockholders having the right to exchange their shares of common stock for cash, securities or other property. Upon issuance, the Sponsors\' Warrants will be deposited with the Continental Stock Transfer and Trust Company, as escrow agent (the " _Escrow Agent_ ") pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement dated November 14, 2007 between the Company and the Escrow Agent, (the " _Escrow Agreement_ "), where they will remain until the Transfer Restriction Termination Date. 

  

 The holders of any Sponsors\' Warrants or Warrant Shares issued upon exercise of any Sponsors\' Warrants further agree prior to any transfer of such securities, to give written notice to the Company expressing its desire to effect such transfer and describing briefly the proposed transfer. Upon receiving such notice, the Company shall present copies thereof to its counsel and the holder agrees not to make any disposition of all or any portion of such securities unless and until: 

  

  

 (a) there is then in effect a registration statement under the Securities Act covering such proposed disposition and such disposition is made in accordance with such registration statement, in which case the legends set forth in Exhibit B or Section 6(c) hereof, as the case may be (collectively the "Legends") with respect to such securities sold pursuant to such registration statement shall be removed; or 

  

 (b) if reasonably requested by the Company, (A) the holder shall have furnished the Company with an opinion of counsel, reasonably satisfactory to the Company, that such disposition will not require registration of such Securities under the Securities Act, (B) the Company shall have received customary representations and warranties regarding the transferee that are reasonably satisfactory to the Company signed by the proposed transferee and (C) the Company shall have received an agreement by such transferee to the restrictions contained in the Legends.  

 (1)

 30 days after the closing of the Merger. 
       

 Subject to the terms of this Agreement, Warrant Certificates may be exchanged at the option of the holder(s) thereof, when surrendered to the Warrant Agent at its principal corporate trust office, which is currently located at the address listed in Section 17 hereof, for another Warrant Certificate or other Warrant Certificates of like tenor and representing in the aggregate a like number of Warrants. Any holder desiring to exchange a Warrant Certificate shall deliver a written request to the Warrant Agent, and shall surrender, duly endorsed or accompanied (if so required by the Warrant Agent) by a written instrument or instruments of transfer in form satisfactory to the Warrant Agent, the Warrant Certificate or Certificates to be so exchanged. Warrant Certificates surrendered for exchange shall be cancelled by the Warrant Agent. Such cancelled Warrant Certificates shall then be disposed of by such Warrant Agent in its customary manner. 

  

 The Warrant Agent is hereby authorized to countersign, in accordance with the provisions of this Section 5 and of Section 4 hereof, the new Warrant Certificates required pursuant to the provisions of this Section 5\. 

  

 SECTION 6. _ Terms of Warrants._ 

  

 (a) _ Exercise Price and Exercise Period._ 

  

 The initial exercise price per share at which Warrant Shares shall be purchasable upon the exercise of Warrants (the " _Exercise Price_ ") shall be $12.50 per share, and each Warrant shall be initially exercisable to purchase one share of common stock of the Company, $0.0001 par value per share (" _Common Stock_ "). The Sponsors\' Warrants shall be exercisable on a cashless basis as set forth in Section 6(d) at the option of any Sponsor (as defined herein) or a Permitted Transferee. 

  

 Subject to the terms of this Agreement (including without limitation Section 6(e) below), each Warrant holder shall have the right, which may be exercised commencing at the opening of business on the first day of the applicable Warrant Exercise Period set forth below and until 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the last day of such Warrant Exercise Period, to receive from the Company the number of fully paid and nonassessable Warrant Shares which the holder may at the time be entitled to receive on exercise of such Warrants and payment of the Exercise Price then in effect for such Warrant Shares. No adjustments as to dividends will be made upon exercise of the Warrants. 

  

 The " _Warrant Exercise Period_ " shall commence (subject to Section 6(d) below), on [ _ _], 2009(2) and shall end on the earlier of: 

  

  

 (i) November 14, 2013; and 

  

 (ii) the Business Day preceding the date on which such Warrants are redeemed pursuant to Section 6(b) below or expire pursuant to Section 6(f) below; 

  

  

 _provided_ that the Sponsors\' Warrants may not be exercised prior to the
Transfer Restriction Termination Date.

  

 The " _Closing Price_ " of the Common Stock on any date of determination means; 

  

  

 (i) the closing sale price for the regular trading session (without considering after hours or other trading outside regular trading session hours) of the Common Stock (regular way) on the American Stock Exchange on that date (or, if no closing price is reported, the last reported sale price during that regular trading session), 

  

 (ii) if the Common Stock is not listed for trading on the American Stock Exchange on that date, as reported in the composite transactions for the principal United States securities exchange on which the Common Stock is so listed, 

   

 (iii) if the Common Stock is not so reported, the last quoted bid price for the Common Stock in the over-the-counter market as reported by the OTC Bulletin Board, the National Quotation Bureau or similar organization, or  

 (2)

 The date of the closing of the Merger. 
      

  

 (iv) if the Common Stock is not so quoted, the average of the mid-point of the last bid and ask prices for the Common Stock from at least three nationally recognized investment banking firms that the Company selects for this purpose. 

  

  

 Each Warrant not exercised or redeemed prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the last day of the Warrant Exercise Period shall become void and all rights thereunder and all rights in respect thereof under this Agreement shall cease as of such time. 

  

 (b) _ Redemption of Warrants._ 

   

 The Company may call the Warrants for redemption, in whole and not in part, at a price of $.01 per Warrant, upon not less than 30 days\' prior written notice of redemption to each Warrant holder, at any time after such Warrants have become exercisable pursuant to Section 6(a), if, and only if, (i) the Closing Price has equaled or exceeded $19.50 per share for any 20 trading days within a 30-trading-day period ending on the third Business Day prior to the notice of redemption to Warrant holders and (ii) at all times between the date of such notice of redemption and the redemption date a registration statement is in effect covering the Warrant Shares issuable upon exercise of the Warrants and a current prospectus relating to those Warrant Shares is available. 

  

 Upon a call for redemption of Warrants by the Company, the Company shall have the right to require all holders of Warrants subject to redemption who exercise such Warrants after the Company\'s call for redemption to do so on a cashless basis in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 6(d). 

  

 Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Sponsors\' Warrants shall be redeemable so long as they are held by the purchasers set forth in Schedule I hereto (the "Sponsors") or a Permitted Transferee; _provided_ that the fact that one or more Sponsors\' Warrants are non-redeemable because they are held by a Sponsor or a Permitted Transferee shall not affect the Company\'s right to redeem the Public Warrants and all Sponsors\' Warrants that are not held by a Sponsor or a Permitted Transferee pursuant to the preceding paragraph. 

  

 (c) _ Exercise Procedure._ 

  

 A Warrant may be exercised upon surrender to the Company at the principal stock transfer office of the Warrant Agent, which is currently located at the address listed in Section 17 hereof, of the certificate or certificates evidencing the Warrants to be exercised with the form of election to purchase on the reverse thereof duly filled in and signed and such other documentation as the Warrant Agent may reasonably request, and upon payment to the Warrant Agent for the account of the Company of the Exercise Price (adjusted as herein provided if applicable) for the number of Warrant Shares in respect of which such Warrants are then exercised. Subject to any Sponsor or Permitted Transferee\'s election to exercise its Sponsors\' Warrants on a cashless basis as set forth in Section 6(d), payment of the aggregate Exercise Price shall be made in cash or by certified or official bank check payable to the order of the Company in New York Clearing House Funds, or the equivalent thereof. In no event will any Warrants be settled on a net cash basis. 

  

 Subject to the provisions of Sections 6(e) and 7 hereof, upon such surrender of Warrants and payment of the Exercise Price, the Company shall issue and cause to be delivered with all reasonable dispatch to and in such name or names as the Warrant holder may designate, a certificate or certificates for the number of full Warrant Shares issuable upon the exercise of such Warrants together with cash as provided in Section 12 hereof. Such certificate or certificates shall be deemed to have been issued and any person so designated to be named therein shall be deemed to have become a holder of record of such Warrant Shares as of the date of the surrender of such Warrants and payment of the Exercise Price. 

       

                                      
The Warrants shall be exercisable, at the election of the holders thereof,
either in full or from time to time in part and, in the event that a
certificate evidencing Warrants is exercised in respect of fewer than all of
the Warrant Shares issuable on such exercise at any time prior to the date of
expiration of the Warrants, a new certificate evidencing the remaining
Warrant or Warrants will be issued, and the Warrant Agent is hereby
irrevocably authorized to countersign and to deliver the required new Warrant
Certificate or Certificates pursuant to the provisions of this Section 6 and
of Section 4 hereof, and the Company, whenever required by the Warrant Agent,
shall supply the Warrant Agent with Warrant Certificates duly executed on
behalf of the Company for such purpose. The Warrant Agent may assume that any
Warrant presented for exercise is permitted to be so exercised under
applicable law and shall have no liability for acting in reliance on such
assumption.

  

 All Warrant Certificates surrendered upon exercise of Warrants shall be canceled by the Warrant Agent. Such canceled Warrant Certificates shall then be disposed of by the Warrant Agent in its customary manner. The Warrant Agent shall account promptly to the Company with respect to Warrants exercised and concurrently pay to the Company all monies received by the Warrant Agent for the purchase of the Warrant Shares through the exercise of such Warrants. 

  

 The Warrant Agent shall keep copies of this Agreement and any notices given or received hereunder available for inspection by the holders with reasonable prior written notice during normal business hours at its office. The Company shall supply the Warrant Agent from time to time with such numbers of copies of this Agreement as the Warrant Agent may request. 

  

 Certificates evidencing Warrant Shares issued upon exercise of a Sponsors\' Warrants shall contain the following legend: 

  

 THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED HEREBY HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, OR ANY STATE SECURITIES LAW, AND MAY NOT BE OFFERED, SOLD, TRANSFERRED OR OTHERWISE DISPOSED OF UNLESS REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, AND ANY APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS OR AN EXEMPTION FROM SUCH REGISTRATION IS AVAILABLE. 

  

 SECURITIES EVIDENCED BY THIS CERTIFICATE WILL BE ENTITLED TO REGISTRATION RIGHTS UNDER A REGISTRATION RIGHTS AGREEMENT TO BE EXECUTED BY THE COMPANY. 

  

 (d) _ Cashless Exercise._ The Sponsors\' Warrants may be exercised on a cashless basis by any Sponsor or Permitted Transferee, at such Sponsor or Permitted Transferee\'s election (the " _Cashless Exercise Election_ "). If any Sponsor or Permitted Transferee makes a Cashless Exercise Election with respect to any Sponsors\' Warrants, then upon surrender of such Sponsors\' Warrants in accordance with Section 6(c), the Company shall issue and cause to be delivered with all reasonable dispatch to and in such name or names as the Sponsors\' Warrant holder may designate, a certificate or certificates for the 

        
  

number of full Warrant Shares issuable upon the exercise of such Sponsor
Warrants computed by using the following formula:

   

   |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|--- 
     |  | X |  | = |  | (A)(Y) 
   

* * *

   (B) 
  |  |   
 

    

   |  |  |  |  |   
---|---|---|---|---|--- 
     | X |  | = |  | The number of Shares of common stock to be
issued in connection with such exercise to the holder of the Sponsors\'
Warrants being exercised.  
   
  | 
Y | 
  | 
= | 
  | 
The number of shares of Common Stock purchasable under the Sponsor Warrant
upon such exercise.  
   
  | 
A | 
  | 
= | 
  | 
The value of one Sponsors\' Warrant as of the date of the exercise, which
shall be determined by using the following formula:  
   
  | 
   | 
  | 
  | 
  | 
 A = B - the Exercise Price  
   
  | 
B | 
  | 
= | 
  | 
The Fair market Value of a share of Common Stock.  
 

    

 For purposes of this Section 6(d), the "Fair Market Value" of a share of Common Stock shall mean the average of the closing price of the Company\'s Common stock quoted on the American Stock Exchange for the ten (10) trading days ending on the trading day prior to the date of exercise. If the shares of Common Stock are traded on a securities exchange other than the American Stock Exchange, the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock shall mean the average of the closing prices of the Company\'s Common Stock quoted on such exchange for the ten (10) trading days ending on the trading day prior to the date of exercise. If the shares of Common Stock are not traded on the American Stock Exchange or any other exchange, the Fair Market Value shall be the price per share that the Company could obtain from a willing buyer for shares of Common Stock sold by the Company from authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock, as such prices shall be determined in good faith by the Company\'s Board of Directors. 

  

 (e) _ Registration Requirement._ Notwithstanding anything else in this Section 6, no Warrant may be exercised unless at the time of exercise (i) a registration statement covering the Warrant Shares to be issued upon exercise is effective under the Act and (ii) a prospectus thereunder relating to the Warrant Shares is current. The Company shall use its best efforts to have a registration statement in effect covering Warrant Shares issuable upon exercise of the Warrants from the date the Warrants become exercisable and to maintain a current prospectus relating to those Warrant Shares until the Warrants expire or are redeemed. In the event that, at the end of the Warrant Exercise Period, a registration statement covering the Warrant Shares to be issued upon exercise is not effective under the Act, all the rights of holders hereunder shall terminate and all of the Warrants shall expire unexercised and worthless, and as a result purchasers of the Units will have paid the full Unit purchase price solely for the share of Common Stock included in each Unit. In no event shall the Warrants be settled on a net cash basis nor shall the Company be required to issue unregistered shares upon the exercise of any Warrant. 

   

 SECTION 7. _ Payment of Taxes._ The Company will pay all documentary stamp taxes attributable to the initial issuance of Warrant Shares upon the exercise of Warrants; provided, however, that the Company shall not be required to pay any tax or taxes which may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the issue of any Warrant Certificates or any certificates for Warrant Shares in a name other than that of the registered holder of a Warrant Certificate surrendered upon the exercise of a Warrant, and the Company shall not be required to issue or deliver such Warrant Certificates unless or until the person or persons requesting the issuance thereof shall have paid to the Company the amount of such tax or shall have established to the satisfaction of the Company that such tax has been paid. 

        

 SECTION 8. _ Mutilated or Missing Warrant Certificates._ In case any of the Warrant Certificates shall be mutilated, lost, stolen or destroyed, the Company shall issue and the Warrant Agent shall countersign, in exchange and substitution for and upon cancellation of the mutilated Warrant Certificate, or in lieu of and substitution for the Warrant Certificate lost, stolen or destroyed, a new Warrant Certificate of like tenor and representing an equivalent number of Warrants, but only upon receipt of evidence satisfactory to the Company and the Warrant Agent of such loss, theft or destruction of such Warrant Certificate and indemnity, also satisfactory to the Company and the Warrant Agent. Applicants for such new Warrant Certificates must pay such reasonable charges as the Company may prescribe. 

  

 SECTION 9. _ Reservation of Warrant Shares._ The Company will at all times reserve and keep available, free from preemptive rights, out of the aggregate of its authorized but unissued Common Stock or its authorized and issued Common Stock held in its treasury, for the purpose of enabling it to satisfy any obligation to issue Warrant Shares upon exercise of Warrants, the maximum number of shares of Common Stock which may then be deliverable upon the exercise of all outstanding Warrants. The Warrant Agent shall have no duty to verify availability of such shares set aside by the Company. 

  

 The Company or, if appointed, the transfer agent for the Common Stock (the " _Transfer Agent_ ") and every subsequent transfer agent for any shares of the Company\'s Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of any of the Warrants will be irrevocably authorized and directed at all times to reserve such number of authorized shares as shall be required for such purpose. The Company will keep a copy of this Agreement on file with the Transfer Agent and with every subsequent transfer agent for any shares of the Company\'s Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of the Warrants. The Warrant Agent is hereby irrevocably authorized to requisition from time to time from such Transfer Agent the stock certificates required to honor outstanding Warrants upon exercise thereof in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. The Company will supply such Transfer Agent with duly executed certificates for such purposes and will provide or otherwise make available any cash which may be payable as provided in Section 12 hereof. The Company will furnish such Transfer Agent a copy of all notices of adjustments and certificates related thereto, transmitted to each holder pursuant to Section 13 hereof. 

   

 Before taking any action which would cause an adjustment pursuant to Section 11 hereof to reduce the Exercise Price below the then par value (if any) of the Warrant Shares, the Company will take any commercially reasonable corporate action which may, in the opinion of its counsel (which may be counsel employed by the Company), be necessary in order that the Company may validly and legally issue fully paid and nonassessable Warrant Shares at the Exercise Price as so adjusted. 

  

 The Company covenants that all Warrant Shares which may be issued upon exercise of Warrants will, upon payment of the Exercise Price therefor and issue, be fully paid, nonassessable, free of preemptive rights and free from all taxes, liens, charges and security interests with respect to the issue thereof. 

   

 SECTION 10. _ Obtaining Stock Exchange Listings._ The Company will from time to time take all commercially reasonable actions which may be necessary so that the Warrant Shares, immediately upon their issuance upon the exercise of Warrants, will be listed on the principal securities exchanges and markets within the United States of America, if any, on which other shares of Common Stock are then listed. 

  

 SECTION 11. _ Adjustment of Number of Warrant Shares._ 

   

 The number of Warrant Shares issuable upon the exercise of each Warrant is subject to adjustment from time to time upon the occurrence of the events enumerated in this Section 11. For purposes of this Section 11, " _Common Stock_ " means shares now or hereafter authorized of any class of common stock of the Company and any other stock of the Company, however designated, that has the right 

        

(subject to any prior rights of any class or series of preferred stock) to
participate in any distribution of the assets or earnings of the Company
without limit as to per share amount.

   

 (a) _ Adjustment for Change in Capital Stock._ 

  

 If the Company: 

  

  

 (1) pays a dividend or makes a distribution on its Common Stock in either case in shares of its Common Stock; 

  

 (2) subdivides its outstanding shares of Common Stock into a greater number of shares; 

  

 (3) combines its outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares; 

  

 (4) makes a distribution on its Common Stock in shares of its capital stock other than Common Stock; or 

  

 (5) issues by reclassification of its Common Stock any shares of its capital stock, 

  

  

then the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of each
Warrant immediately prior to such action shall be proportionately adjusted so
that the holder of any Warrant thereafter exercised shall receive the
aggregate number and kind of shares of capital stock of the Company which he
would have owned immediately following such action if such Warrant had been
exercised immediately prior to such action.

  

 The adjustment shall become effective immediately after the record date in the case of a dividend or distribution and immediately after the effective date in the case of a subdivision, combination or reclassification. 

  

 Such adjustment shall be made successively whenever any event listed above shall occur. 

  

 (b) _ Adjustment for Rights Issue._ 

  

 If the Company distributes any rights, options or warrants to all holders of its Common Stock entitling them to purchase shares of Common Stock at a price per share less than the Closing Price per share on the Business Day immediately preceding the ex-dividend date for such distribution of rights, options or warrants, the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of each Warrant shall be adjusted in accordance with the formula: 

   

   |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|--- 
   N\' |  | = |  | N |  | × |  | O + A 
   

* * *

   O + (A × P/M)  
 

    

 where: 

   

   |  |  |  |  |   
---|---|---|---|---|--- 
     | N\' |  | = |  | the adjusted number of shares of Common Stock
issuable upon exercise of each Warrant.  
   
  | 
N | 
  | 
= | 
  | 
the current number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of each
Warrant.  
   
  | 
O | 
  | 
= | 
  | 
the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on the record date for such
distribution.  
   
  | 
A | 
  | 
= | 
  | 
the number of additional shares of Common Stock issuable pursuant to such
rights or warrants.  
   
  | 
P | 
  | 
= | 
  | 
the purchase price per share of the additional shares.  
   
  | 
M | 
  | 
= | 
  | 
the Closing Price per share of Common Stock on the record date.  
 

         

 The adjustment shall be made successively whenever any such rights, options or warrants are issued and shall become effective immediately after the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive the rights, options or warrants. If at the end of the period during which such rights, options or warrants are exercisable, not all rights, options or warrants shall have been exercised, the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of each Warrant shall be immediately readjusted to what it would have been if "N" in the above formula had been the number of shares actually issued. 

  

 (c) _ Adjustment for Other Distributions._ 

  

 If the Company distributes to all holders of its Common Stock any of its assets (including cash) or debt securities or any rights, options or warrants to purchase debt securities, assets or other securities of the Company (other than Common Stock), the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of each Warrant shall be adjusted in accordance with the formula: 

   

   |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|--- 
   N\' 
 M |  | = 
 - |  | N 
 F |  | × |  | M 
   

* * *

      
 

    

 where: 

   

   |  |  |  |  |   
---|---|---|---|---|--- 
     | N\' |  | = |  | the adjusted number of shares of Common Stock
issuable upon exercise of each Warrant.  
   
  | 
N | 
  | 
= | 
  | 
the current number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of each
Warrant.  
   
  | 
M | 
  | 
= | 
  | 
the Closing Price per share of Common Stock on the Business Day immediately
preceding the ex-dividend date for such distribution.  
   
  | 
F | 
  | 
= | 
  | 
the fair market value on the ex-dividend date for such distribution of the
assets, securities, rights or warrants distributable to one share of Common
Stock after taking into account, in the case of any rights, options or
warrants, the consideration required to be paid upon exercise thereof. The
Board of Directors shall reasonably determine the fair market value in good
faith.  
 

    

 The adjustment shall be made successively whenever any such distribution is made and shall become effective immediately after the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such distribution. 

  

 This subsection (c) does not apply to regular quarterly cash dividends including increases thereof or rights, options or warrants referred to in subsection (b) of this Section 11\. If any adjustment is made pursuant to this subsection (c) as a result of the issuance of rights, options or warrants and at the end of the period during which any such rights, options or warrants are exercisable, not all such rights, options or warrants shall have been exercised, the Warrant shall be immediately readjusted as if "F" in the above formula was the fair market value on the ex-dividend date for such distribution of the indebtedness or assets actually distributed upon exercise of such rights, options or warrants divided by the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on the ex-dividend date for such distribution. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this subsection (c), if "M - F" in the above formula is less than $1.00, the Company may elect to, and if "M - F" or is a negative number, the Company shall, in lieu of the adjustment otherwise required by this subsection (c), distribute to the holders of the Warrants, upon exercise thereof, the evidences of indebtedness, assets, rights, options or warrants (or the proceeds thereof) which would have been distributed to such holders had such Warrants been exercised immediately prior to the record date for such distribution. 

        

 (d) _ Adjustment for Common Stock Issue._ 

  

 If the Company issues shares of Common Stock for a consideration per share less than the Closing Price per share on the date the Company fixes the offering price of such additional shares, the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of each Warrant shall be adjusted in accordance with the formula: 

   

   |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|--- 
   N\' |  | = |  | N |  | × |  | A 
   

* * *

   O + P/M  
 

    

 where: 

   

   |  |  |  |  |   
---|---|---|---|---|--- 
     | N\' |  | = |  | the adjusted number of shares of Common Stock
issuable upon exercise of each Warrant.  
   
  | 
N | 
  | 
= | 
  | 
the current number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of each
Warrant.  
   
  | 
O | 
  | 
= | 
  | 
the number of shares outstanding immediately prior to the issuance of such
additional shares.  
   
  | 
P | 
  | 
= | 
  | 
the aggregate consideration received for the issuance of such additional
shares.  
   
  | 
M | 
  | 
= | 
  | 
the Closing Price per share on the date of issuance of such additional
shares.  
   
  | 
A | 
  | 
= | 
  | 
the number of shares outstanding immediately after the issuance of such
additional shares.  
 

    

 The adjustment shall be made successively whenever any such issuance is made, and shall become effective immediately after such issuance. 

  

 This subsection (d) does not apply to: 

  

  

 (1) any of the transactions described in subsections (b) and (c) of this Section 11, 

   

 (2) the exercise of Warrants, or the conversion or exchange of other securities convertible or exchangeable for Common Stock, or the issuance of Common Stock upon the exercise of rights or warrants issued to the holders of Common Stock, 

  

 (3) Common Stock (and options exercisable therefor) issued to the Company\'s employees, officers, directors, consultants or advisors (whether or not still in such capacity on the date of exercise) under bona fide employee benefit plans or stock option plans adopted by the Board of Directors of the Company and approved by the holders of Common Stock when required by law, if such Common Stock would otherwise be covered by this subsection (d), 

  

 (4) Common Stock issued in a bona fide public offering for cash, 

  

 (5) Common Stock issued in a bona fide private placement in which at least one non-affiliate of the Company participates, including without limitation the issuance of equity as consideration or partial consideration for acquisitions from persons that are not affiliates of the Company. 

  

  

 (e) _ Adjustment for Convertible Securities Issue._ 

   

 If the Company issues any securities convertible into or exchangeable for Common Stock (other than securities issued in transactions described in subsections (b) and (c) of this Section 11) for a consideration per share of Common Stock initially deliverable upon conversion or exchange of such securities less than the Closing Price per share on the date of issuance of such securities, the number of 

        
  

shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of each Warrant shall be
adjusted in accordance with this formula:

   

   |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|--- 
   N\' |  | = |  | N |  | × |  | O + D 
   

* * *

   O + P/M  
 

    

 where: 

   

   |  |  |  |  |   
---|---|---|---|---|--- 
     | N\' |  | = |  | the adjusted number of shares of Common Stock
issuable upon exercise of each Warrant.  
   
  | 
N | 
  | 
= | 
  | 
the current number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of each
Warrant.  
   
  | 
O | 
  | 
= | 
  | 
the number of shares outstanding immediately prior to the issuance of such
securities.  
   
  | 
P | 
  | 
= | 
  | 
the aggregate consideration received for the issuance of such securities.  
   
  | 
M | 
  | 
= | 
  | 
the Closing Price per share on the date of issuance of such securities.  
   
  | 
D | 
  | 
= | 
  | 
the maximum number of shares deliverable upon conversion or in exchange for
such securities at the initial conversion or exchange rate.  
 

    

 The adjustment shall be made successively whenever any such issuance is made, and shall become effective immediately after such issuance. 

  

 If all of the Common Stock deliverable upon conversion or exchange of such securities have not been issued when such securities are no longer outstanding, then the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of each Warrant shall promptly be readjusted to what it would have been had the adjustment upon the issuance of such securities been made on the basis of the actual number of shares of Common Stock issued upon conversion or exchange of such securities. 

  

 This subsection (e) does not apply to: 

  

  

 (1) convertible securities issued in a bona fide public offering for cash; or 

  

 (2) convertible securities issued in a bona fide private placement in which at least one non-affiliate of the Company participates, including the issuance of convertible securities as consideration or partial consideration for acquisitions from persons that are not affiliates of the Company. 

  

  

 (f) _ Adjustment for Tender or Exchange Offer._ If the Company or any of its subsidiaries makes a payment in respect of a tender offer or exchange offer for the Common Stock, if the cash and value of any other consideration included in the payment per share of the Common Stock exceeds the Closing Price of the Common Stock on the trading day next succeeding the last date on which tenders or 

        

exchanges may be made pursuant to such tender or exchange offer, the number
of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of each Warrant will be
increased based on the following formula:

   

   |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|--- 
     |  | N\' |  | = |  | No |  | × |  | AC + (SP\' × OS\') 
   

* * *

   OSo × SP\' 
  |  |   
 

    

 where:  

   

   |  |  |  |  |   
---|---|---|---|---|--- 
     | N\' |  | = |  | the adjusted number of shares of Common Stock
issuable upon exercise of each Warrant;  
   
  | 
No | 
  | 
= | 
  | 
the current number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of each
warrant;  
   
  | 
AC | 
  | 
= | 
  | 
the aggregate value of all cash and any other consideration (as determined by
the Board of Directors of the Company) paid or payable for shares purchased in
such tender or exchange offer;  
   
  | 
OSo | 
  | 
= | 
  | 
the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the date
such tender or exchange offer expires;  
   
  | 
OS\' | 
  | 
= | 
  | 
the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after the date
such tender or exchange offer expires; and  
   
  | 
SP\' | 
  | 
= | 
  | 
the Closing Price of the Common Stock on the trading day next succeeding the
date such tender or exchange offer expires.  
 

    

 The adjustment shall be made successively and shall become effective immediately following the date such tender or exchange offer expires. 

  

 (g) _ Consideration Received._ 

  

 For purposes of any computation respecting consideration received pursuant to subsections (d), (e) and (f) of this Section 11, the following shall apply: 

  

  

 (1) in the case of the issuance of shares of Common Stock for cash, the consideration shall be the amount of such cash, provided that in no case shall any deduction be made for any commissions, discounts or other expenses incurred by the Company for any underwriting or other sale or disposition of the issue or otherwise in connection therewith; 

  

 (2) in the case of the issuance of shares of Common Stock for a consideration in whole or in part other than cash, the consideration other than cash shall be deemed to be the fair market value thereof as reasonably determined by the Board of Directors of the Company (irrespective of the accounting treatment thereof) and described in a Board resolution which shall be filed with the Warrant Agent; and 

  

 (3) in the case of the issuance of securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares, the aggregate consideration received therefor shall be deemed to be the consideration received by the Company for the issuance of such securities plus the additional minimum consideration, if any, to be received by the Company upon the conversion or exchange thereof for the maximum number of shares used to calculate the adjustment (the consideration in each case to be determined in the same manner as provided in clauses (1) and (2) of this subsection). 

  

      

                                       
(h) _ Defined Terms; When De Minimis Adjustment May Be Deferred._ 

  

 As used in this section 11: 

  

  

 (1) "ex-dividend date" means the first date on which the shares of Common Stock trade on the applicable exchange or in the applicable market, regular way, without the right to receive the issuance or distribution in question; 

   

 (2) "trading day" means, with respect to the Common Stock or any other security, a day during which (i) trading in the Common Stock or such other security generally occurs, (ii) there is no market disruption event (as defined below) and (iii) a Closing Price for the Common Stock or such other security (other than a Closing Price referred to in the next to last clause of such definition) is available for such day; provided that if the Common Stock or such other security is not admitted for trading or quotation on or by any exchange, bureau or other organization, "trading day" will mean any Business Day; 

  

 (3) "market disruption event" means, with respect to the Common Stock or any other security, the occurrence or existence of more than one-half hour period in the aggregate or any scheduled trading day for the Common Stock or such other security of any suspension or limitation imposed on trading (by reason of movements in price exceeding limits permitted by the stock exchange or otherwise) in the Common Stock or such other security or in any options, contract, or future contracts relating to the Common Stock or such other security, and such suspension or limitation occurs or exists at any time before 1:00 p.m. (New York time) on such day; and 

  

 (4) "Business Day" means, any day on which the American Stock Exchange is open for trading and which is not a Saturday, a Sunday or any other day on which banks in the City of New York, New York, are authorized or required by law to close. 

  

  

 No adjustment in the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of each Warrant need be made unless the adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least 1% in such number. Any adjustments that are not made shall be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment. 

  

 All calculations under this Section 11 shall be made to the nearest cent or to the nearest 1/100th of a share, as the case may be. 

  

 (i) _ When No Adjustment Required._ 

   

 No adjustment need be made for a transaction referred to in subsections (b), (c), (d), (e) or (f) of this Section 11 if Warrant holders are to participate, without requiring the Warrants to be exercised, in the transaction on a basis and with notice that the Board of Directors of the Company reasonably determines to be fair and appropriate in light of the basis and notice on which holders of Common Stock participate in the transaction. 

  

 No adjustment need be made for a change in the par value or no par value of the Common Stock. 

   

 To the extent the Warrants become convertible into cash, no adjustment need be made thereafter as to the amount of cash into which such Warrants are exercisable. Interest will not accrue on the cash. 

  

 (j) _ Notice of Adjustment._ 

  

 Whenever the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of each Warrant is adjusted, the Company shall provide the notices required by Section 13 hereof. 

        

 (k) _ Notice of Certain Transactions._ 

  

 If: 

  

  

 (1) the Company takes any action that would require an adjustment in the Exercise Price pursuant to subsections (a), (b), (c), (d), (e) or (f) of this Section 11 and if the Company does not arrange for Warrant holders to participate pursuant to subsection (i) of this Section 11; 

   

 (2) the Company takes any action that would require a supplemental Warrant Agreement pursuant to subsection (l) of this Section 11; or 

  

 (3) there is a liquidation or dissolution of the Company, 

  

  

the Company shall mail to Warrant holders a notice stating the proposed
record date for a dividend or distribution or the proposed effective date of a
subdivision, combination, reclassification, consolidation, merger, transfer,
lease, liquidation or dissolution. The Company shall mail the notice at least
15 days before such date. Failure to mail the notice or any defect in it shall
not affect the validity of the transaction.

  

 (l) _ Reorganization of Company._ 

  

 If the Company consolidates or merges with or into, or transfers or leases all or substantially all its assets to, any person, upon consummation of such transaction the Warrants shall automatically become exercisable for the kind and amount of securities, cash or other assets which the holder of a Warrant would have owned immediately after the consolidation, merger, transfer or lease if such holder had exercised the Warrant immediately before the effective date of the transaction; provided that (i) if the holders of Common Stock were entitled to exercise a right of election as to the kind or amount of securities, cash or other assets receivable upon such consolidation or merger, then the kind and amount of securities, cash or other assets for which each Warrant shall become exercisable shall be deemed to be the weighted average of the kind and amount received per share by the holders of Common Stock in such consolidation or merger that affirmatively make such election or (ii) if a tender or exchange offer shall have been made to and accepted by the holders of Common Stock under circumstances in which, upon completion of such tender or exchange offer, the maker thereof, together with members of any group (within the meaning of Rule 13d-5(b)(1) under the Exchange Act) of which such maker is a part, and together with any affiliate or associate of such maker (within the meaning of Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act) and any members of any such group of which any such affiliate or associate is a part, own beneficially (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act) more than 50% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock, the holder of a Warrant shall be entitled to receive the highest amount of cash, securities or other property to which such holder would actually have been entitled as a shareholder if such Warrant holder had exercised the Warrant prior to the expiration of such tender or exchange offer, accepted such offer and all of the Common Stock held by such holder had been purchased pursuant to such tender or exchange offer, subject to adjustments (from and after the consummation of such tender or exchange offer) as nearly equivalent as possible to the adjustments provided for in this Section 11\. Concurrently with the consummation of any such transaction, the corporation or other entity formed by or surviving any such consolidation or merger if other than the Company, or the person to which such sale or conveyance shall have been made, shall enter into a supplemental Warrant Agreement so providing and further providing for adjustments which shall be as nearly equivalent as may be practical to the adjustments provided for in this Section. The successor Company shall mail to Warrant holders a notice describing the supplemental Warrant Agreement. 

  

 If the issuer of securities deliverable upon exercise of Warrants under the supplemental Warrant Agreement is an affiliate of the formed, surviving, transferee or lessee corporation, that issuer shall join in the supplemental Warrant Agreement. 

        

 If this subsection (l) applies, subsections (a), (b), (c), (d), (e) and (f) of this Section 11 do not apply. 

  

 (m) _ Warrant Agent\'s Disclaimer._ 

  

 The Warrant Agent has no duty to determine when an adjustment under this Section 11 should be made, how it should be made or what it should be. The Warrant Agent has no duty to determine whether any provisions of a supplemental Warrant Agreement under subsection (l) of this Section 11 are correct. The Warrant Agent makes no representation as to the validity or value of any securities or assets issued upon exercise of Warrants. The Warrant Agent shall not be responsible for the Company\'s failure to comply with this Section. 

  

 (n) _ When Issuance or Payment May Be Deferred._ 

  

 In any case in which this Section 11 shall require that an adjustment in the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of each Warrant be made effective as of a record date for a specified event, the Company may elect to defer until the occurrence of such event (i) issuing to the holder of any Warrant exercised after such record date the Warrant Shares and other capital stock of the Company, if any, issuable upon such exercise over and above the Warrant Shares and other capital stock of the Company, if any, issuable upon such exercise on the basis of the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of each Warrant and (ii) paying to such holder any amount in cash in lieu of a fractional share pursuant to Section 12 hereof; provided, however, that the Company shall deliver to such holder a due bill or other appropriate instrument evidencing such holder\'s right to receive such additional Warrant Shares, other capital stock and cash upon the occurrence of the event requiring such adjustment. 

  

 (o) _ Adjustment in Exercise Price._ 

  

 Upon each event that provides for an adjustment of the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of each Warrant pursuant to this Section 11, each Warrant outstanding prior to the making of the adjustment shall thereafter have an adjusted Exercise Price (calculated to the nearest ten millionth) obtained from the following formula: 

   

   |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|--- 
     |  | E\' |  | = |  | E |  | × |  | N 
   

* * *

   N\' 
  |  |   
 

    

 where: 

   

   |  |  |  |  |   
---|---|---|---|---|--- 
     | E\' |  | = |  | the adjusted Exercise Price.  
   
  | 
E | 
  | 
= | 
  | 
the Exercise Price prior to adjustment.  
   
  | 
N\' | 
  | 
= | 
  | 
the adjusted number of Warrant Shares issuable upon exercise of a Warrant by
payment of the adjusted Exercise Price.  
   
  | 
N | 
  | 
= | 
  | 
the number of Warrant Shares previously issuable upon exercise of a Warrant by
payment of the Exercise Price prior to adjustment.  
 

    

 Following any adjustment to the Exercise Price pursuant to this Section 11, the amount payable, when adjusted and together with any consideration allocated to the issuance of the Warrants, shall never be less than the par value per Warrant Share at the time of such adjustment. Such adjustment shall be made successively whenever any event listed above shall occur. 

  

 (p) _ Form of Warrants._ 

   

 Irrespective of any adjustments in the number or kind of shares issuable upon the exercise of the Warrants or the Exercise Price, Warrants theretofore or thereafter issued may continue to express the 

        
  

same number and kind of shares and Exercise Price as are stated in the
Warrants initially issuable pursuant to this Agreement.

  

 (q) _ Other Dilutive Events._ 

   

 In case any event shall occur affecting the Company, as to which the provisions of this Section 11 are not strictly applicable, but would impact the holders of Warrants adversely as compared to holders of Common Stock, and the failure to make any adjustment would not fairly protect the purchase rights represented by the Warrants in accordance with the essential intent and principles of this Section then, in each such case, the Company shall appoint a firm of independent public accountants, investment banking or other appraisal firm of recognized national standing which shall give their opinion upon the adjustment, if any, on a basis consistent with the essential intent and principles established in this Section 11, necessary to preserve, without dilution, the purchase rights represented by the Warrants. 

   

 SECTION 12. _ Fractional Interests._ The Company shall not be required to issue fractional Warrant Shares on the exercise of Warrants. If more than one Warrant shall be presented for exercise in full at the same time by the same holder, the number of full Warrant Shares which shall be issuable upon the exercise thereof shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate number of Warrant Shares purchasable on exercise of the Warrants so presented. If any fraction of a Warrant Share would, except for the provisions of this Section 12, be issuable on the exercise of any Warrants (or specified portion thereof), the Company shall pay an amount in cash equal to the fair market value on the day immediately preceding the date the Warrant is presented for exercise, multiplied by such fraction. 

   

 SECTION 13. _ Notices to Warrant Holders._ Upon any adjustment of the Exercise Price pursuant to Section 11, the Company shall promptly thereafter, and in any event within five days, (i) cause to be filed with the Warrant Agent a certificate executed by the Chief Financial Officer of the Company setting forth the number of Warrant Shares issuable upon exercise of each Warrant after such adjustment and setting forth in reasonable detail the method of calculation and the facts upon which such calculations are based, and () cause to be given to each of the registered holders of the Warrant Certificates at his address appearing on the Warrant register written notice of such adjustments by first-class mail, postage prepaid. Where appropriate, such notice may be given in advance and included as a part of the notice required to be mailed under the other provisions of this Section 13\. The Warrant Agent shall be fully protected in relying on any such certificate and on any adjustment therein contained and shall not be deemed to have knowledge of such adjustment unless and until it shall have received such certificate. 

  

 In case: 

  

  

 (a) the Company shall authorize the issuance to all holders of shares of Common Stock of rights, options or warrants to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock or of any other subscription rights or warrants; or 

  

 (b) the Company shall authorize the distribution to all holders of shares of Common Stock of evidences of its indebtedness or assets (other than regular cash dividends or dividends payable in shares of Common Stock or distributions referred to in subsection (b) of Section 11 hereof); or 

  

 (c) of any consolidation or merger to which the Company is a party and for which approval of any shareholders of the Company is required, or of the conveyance or transfer of the properties and assets of the Company substantially as an entirety, or of any reclassification or change of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Warrants (other than a change in par value, or from par value to no par value, or from no par value to par value, or as a result of a subdivision or combination), or a tender offer or exchange offer for shares of Common Stock; or 

  

 (d) of the voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the Company; or 

  

      

  

 (e) the Company proposes to take any action not specified above which would require an adjustment of the Exercise Price pursuant to Section 11 hereof; 

  

  

 then the Company shall cause to be filed with the Warrant Agent and shall cause to be given to each of the registered holders of the Warrant Certificates at his address appearing on the Warrant register, at least 10 calendar days prior to the applicable record date hereinafter specified, or as promptly as practicable under the circumstances in the case of events for which there is no record date, by first-class mail, postage prepaid, a written notice stating (i) the date as of which the holders of record of shares of Common Stock to be entitled to receive any such rights, options, warrants or distribution are to be determined, or (ii) the initial expiration date set forth in any tender offer or exchange offer for shares of Common Stock, or (iii) the date on which any such consolidation, merger, conveyance, transfer, dissolution, liquidation or winding up is expected to become effective or consummated, and the date as of which it is expected that holders of record of shares of Common Stock shall be entitled to exchange such shares for securities or other property, if any, deliverable upon such reclassification, consolidation, merger, conveyance, transfer, dissolution, liquidation or winding up. The failure to give the notice required by this Section 13 or any defect therein shall not affect the legality or validity of any distribution, right, option, warrant, consolidation, merger, conveyance, transfer, dissolution, liquidation or winding up, or the vote upon any action. 

   

 Nothing contained in this Agreement or in any of the Warrant Certificates shall be construed as conferring upon the holders thereof the right to vote or to consent or to receive notice as shareholders in respect of the meetings of shareholders or the election of Directors of the Company or any other matter, or any rights whatsoever as shareholders of the Company. 

  

 SECTION 14. _ Merger, Consolidation or Change of Name of Warrant Agent._ Any corporation into which the Warrant Agent may be merged or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger or consolidation to which the Warrant Agent shall be a party, or any corporation succeeding to all or substantially all the corporate trust or agency business of the Warrant Agent, shall be the successor to the Warrant Agent hereunder without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of any of the parties hereto, provided that such corporation would be eligible for appointment as a successor warrant agent under the provisions of Section 16\. In case at the time such successor to the Warrant Agent shall succeed to the agency created by this Agreement, and in case at that time any of the Warrant Certificates shall have been countersigned but not delivered, any such successor to the Warrant Agent may adopt the countersignature of the original Warrant Agent; and in case at that time any of the Warrant Certificates shall not have been countersigned, any successor to the Warrant Agent may countersign such Warrant Certificates either in the name of the predecessor Warrant Agent or in the name of the successor to the Warrant Agent; and in all such cases such Warrant Certificates shall have the full force and effect provided in the Warrant Certificates and in this Agreement. 

  

 In case at any time the name of the Warrant Agent shall be changed and at such time any of the Warrant Certificates shall have been countersigned but not delivered, the Warrant Agent whose name has been changed may adopt the countersignature under its prior name, and in case at that time any of the Warrant Certificates shall not have been countersigned, the Warrant Agent may countersign such Warrant Certificates either in its prior name or in its changed name, and in all such cases such Warrant Certificates shall have the full force and effect provided in the Warrant Certificates and in this Agreement. 

       

                                      
SECTION 15. _ Warrant Agent._ The Warrant Agent undertakes the duties
and obligations imposed by this Agreement (and no implied duties or
obligations shall be read into this Agreement against the Warrant Agent) upon
the following terms and conditions, by all of which the Company and the
holders of Warrants, by their acceptance thereof, shall be bound:

  

  

 (a) The statements contained herein and in the Warrant Certificates shall be taken as statements of the Company and the Warrant Agent assumes no responsibility for the correctness of any of the same except such as describe the Warrant Agent or action taken or to be taken by it. The Warrant Agent assumes no responsibility with respect to the distribution of the Warrant Certificates except as herein otherwise provided. 

  

 (b) The Warrant Agent shall not be responsible for any failure of the Company to comply with any of the covenants contained in this Agreement or in the Warrant Certificates to be complied with by the Company. 

  

 (c) The Warrant Agent may consult at any time with counsel of its own selection (who may be counsel for the Company) and the Warrant Agent shall incur no liability or responsibility to the Company or to any holder of any Warrant Certificate in respect of any action taken, suffered or omitted by it hereunder in good faith and in accordance with the opinion or the advice of such counsel. The Warrant Agent may execute any of the trusts or powers hereunder or perform any duties hereunder either directly or through agents or attorneys and the Warrant Agent shall not be responsible for any misconduct or negligence on the part of any agent or attorney appointed with due care by it hereunder. 

  

 (d) The Warrant Agent may conclusively rely, as to the truth of the statements and the correctness of the opinions expressed therein, upon certificates or opinions furnished to the Warrant Agent and conforming to the requirements of this Agreement. The Warrant Agent shall incur no liability or responsibility to the Company or to any holder of any Warrant Certificate for any action taken in reliance on any Warrant Certificate, certificate of shares, notice, resolution, waiver, consent, order, certificate, or other paper, document or instrument (whether in its original or facsimile form) believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed, sent or presented by the proper party or parties. 

  

 (e) The Company agrees to pay to the Warrant Agent such compensation for all services rendered by the Warrant Agent in the administration and execution of this Agreement as the Company and the Warrant Agent shall agree in writing to reimburse the Warrant Agent for all expenses, taxes and governmental charges and other charges of any kind and nature incurred by the Warrant Agent in the execution of this Agreement (including fees and expenses of its counsel) and to indemnify the Warrant Agent (and any predecessor Warrant Agent) and save it harmless against any and all claims (whether asserted by the Company, a holder or any other person), damages, losses, expenses (including taxes other than taxes based on the income of the Warrant Agent), liabilities, including judgments, costs and counsel fees and expenses, for anything done or omitted by the Warrant Agent in the execution of this Agreement except as a result of its negligence or willful misconduct. The provisions of this Section 15(e) shall survive the expiration of the Warrants and the termination of this Agreement. 

  

 (f) The Warrant Agent shall be under no obligation to institute any action, suit or legal proceeding or to take any other action likely to involve expense unless the Company or one or more registered holders of Warrant Certificates shall furnish the Warrant Agent with security and indemnity satisfactory to it for any costs and expenses which may be incurred, but this provision shall not affect the power of the Warrant Agent to take such action as it may consider proper, whether with or without any such security or indemnity. All rights of action under this Agreement or under any of the Warrants may be enforced by the Warrant Agent without the possession of any of the Warrant Certificates or the production thereof at any trial or other proceeding relative 

  

      

  
  

thereto, and any such action, suit or proceeding instituted by the Warrant
Agent shall be brought in its name as Warrant Agent and any recovery of
judgment shall be for the ratable benefit of the registered holders of the
Warrants, as their respective rights or interests may appear.

  

 (g) The Warrant Agent, and any stockholder, director, officer or employee of it, may buy, sell or deal in any of the Warrants or other securities of the Company or become pecuniarily interested in any transaction in which the Company may be interested, or contract with or lend money to the Company or otherwise act as fully and freely as though it were not Warrant Agent under this Agreement. Nothing herein shall preclude the Warrant Agent from acting in any other capacity for the Company or for any other legal entity. 

   

 (h) The Warrant Agent shall act hereunder solely as agent for the Company, and its duties shall be determined solely by the provisions hereof. The Warrant Agent shall not be liable for anything which it may do or refrain from doing in connection with this Agreement except for its own negligence or willful misconduct. The Warrant Agent shall not be liable for any error of judgment made in good faith by it, unless it shall be proved that the Warrant Agent was negligent in ascertaining the pertinent facts. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall the Warrant Agent be liable for special, indirect, punitive or consequential loss or damage of any kind whatsoever (including but not limited to lost profits), even if the Warrant Agent has been advised of the likelihood of the loss or damage and regardless of the form of the action. 

   

 (i) The Warrant Agent shall not at any time be under any duty or responsibility to any holder of any Warrant Certificate to make or cause to be made any adjustment of the Exercise Price or number of the Warrant Shares or other securities or property deliverable as provided in this Agreement, or to determine whether any facts exist which may require any of such adjustments, or with respect to the nature or extent of any such adjustments, when made, or with respect to the method employed in making the same. The Warrant Agent shall not be accountable with respect to the validity or value or the kind or amount of any Warrant Shares or of any securities or property which may at any time be issued or delivered upon the exercise of any Warrant or with respect to whether any such Warrant Shares or other securities will when issued be validly issued and fully paid and nonassessable, and makes no representation with respect thereto. 

  

 (j) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, neither the Company nor the Warrant Agent shall have any liability to any holder of a Warrant Certificate or other Person as a result of its inability to perform any of its obligations under this Agreement by reason of any preliminary or permanent injunction or other order, decree or ruling issued by a court of competent jurisdiction or by a governmental, regulatory or administrative agency or commission, or any statute, rule, regulation or executive order promulgated or enacted by any governmental authority prohibiting or otherwise restraining performance of such obligation; provided that (i) the Company must use its reasonable best efforts to have any such order, decree or ruling lifted or otherwise overturned as soon as possible and (ii) nothing in this Section 15(j) shall affect the Company\'s obligation under Section 6(d) to use its best efforts to have a registration statement in effect covering the Warrant Shares issuable upon exercise of the Warrants and to maintain a current prospectus relating to those Warrant Shares. 

  

 (k) Any application by the Warrant Agent for written instructions from the Company may, at the option of the Warrant Agent, set forth in writing any action proposed to be taken or omitted by the Warrant Agent under this Agreement and the date on and/or after which such action shall be taken or such omission shall be effective. The Warrant Agent shall not be liable for any action taken by, or omission of, the Warrant Agent in accordance with a proposal included in such application on or after the date specified in such application (which date shall not be less than 

  

      

  
  

three Business Days after the date any officer of the Company actually
receives such application, unless any such officer shall have consented in
writing to any earlier date) unless prior to taking any such action (or the
effective date in the case of an omission), the Warrant Agent shall have
received written instructions in response to such application specifying the
action to be taken or omitted.

  

 (l) No provision of this Agreement shall require the Warrant Agent to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in the performance of any of its duties hereunder or in the exercise of its rights. 

  

 (m) In addition to the foregoing, the Warrant Agent shall be protected and shall incur no liability for, or in respect of, any action taken or omitted by it in connection with its administration of this Agreement if such acts or omissions are not the result of the Warrant Agent\'s reckless disregard of its duty, gross negligence or willful misconduct and are in reliance upon (i) the proper execution of the certification concerning beneficial ownership appended to the form of assignment and the form of the election attached hereto unless the Warrant Agent shall have actual knowledge that, as executed, such certification is untrue, or (ii) the non-execution of such certification including, without limitation, any refusal to honor any otherwise permissible assignment or election by reason of such non-execution. 

  

  

 SECTION 16. _ Change of Warrant Agent._ The Warrant Agent may at any time resign as Warrant Agent upon written notice to the Company. If the Warrant Agent shall become incapable of acting as Warrant Agent, the Company shall appoint a successor to such Warrant Agent. If the Company shall fail to make such appointment within a period of 30 days after it has been notified in writing of such resignation or of such incapacity by the Warrant Agent or by the registered holder of a Warrant Certificate, then the registered holder of any Warrant Certificate or the Warrant Agent may apply, at the expense of the Company, to any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor to the Warrant Agent. Pending appointment of a successor to such Warrant Agent, either by the Company or by such a court, the duties of the Warrant Agent shall be carried out by the Company. The holders of a majority of the unexercised Warrants shall be entitled at any time to remove the Warrant Agent and appoint a successor to such Warrant Agent. If a Successor Warrant Agent shall not have been appointed within 30 days of such removal, the Warrant Agent may apply, at the expense of the Company, to any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor to the Warrant Agent. Such successor to the Warrant Agent need not be approved by the Company or the former Warrant Agent. After appointment the successor to the Warrant Agent shall be vested with the same powers, rights, duties and responsibilities as if it had been originally named as Warrant Agent without further act or deed; but the former Warrant Agent upon payment of all fees and expenses due it and its agents and counsel shall deliver and transfer to the successor to the Warrant Agent any property at the time held by it hereunder and execute and deliver any further assurance, conveyance, act or deed necessary for the purpose. Failure to give any notice provided for in this Section 16, however, or any defect therein, shall not affect the legality or validity of the appointment of a successor to the Warrant Agent. 

  

 SECTION 17. _ Notices to Company and Warrant Agent._ Any notice or demand authorized by this Agreement to be given or made by the Warrant Agent or by the registered holder of any Warrant Certificate to or on the Company shall be sufficiently given or made when and if deposited in the mail, first class or registered, postage prepaid, addressed (until another address is filed in writing by the Company with the Warrant Agent), as follows:

 Any notice pursuant to this Agreement to be given by the Company or by the registered holder(s) of any Warrant Certificate to the Warrant Agent shall be sufficiently given when and if deposited in the mail, first-class or registered, postage prepaid, addressed (until another address is filed in writing by the Warrant Agent with the Company) to the Warrant Agent as follows:

 SECTION 18. _ Supplements and Amendments._ The Company and the Warrant Agent may from time to time supplement or amend this Agreement without the approval of any holders of Warrant Certificates in order to cure any ambiguity or to correct or supplement any provision contained herein which may be defective or inconsistent with any other provision herein, or to make any other provisions in regard to matters or questions arising hereunder which the Company and the Warrant Agent may deem necessary or desirable and which shall not in any way adversely affect the interests of the holders of Warrant Certificates theretofore issued. Upon the delivery of a certificate from an appropriate officer of the Company which states that the proposed supplement or amendment is in compliance with the terms of this Section 18, the Warrant Agent shall execute such supplement or amendment. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the prior written consent of the Warrant Agent must be obtained in connection with any supplement or amendment which alters the rights or duties of the Warrant Agent. The Company and the Warrant Agent may amend any provision herein with the consent of the holders of Warrants exercisable for a majority of the Warrant Shares issuable on exercise of all outstanding Warrants that would be affected by such amendment. 

  

 SECTION 19. _ Successors._ All the covenants and provisions of this Agreement by or for the benefit of the Company or the Warrant Agent shall bind and inure to the benefit of their respective successors and assigns hereunder. 

  

 SECTION 20. _ Termination._ This Agreement will terminate on any earlier date if all Warrants have been exercised or expired without exercise. The provisions of Section 15 hereof shall survive such termination. 

  

 SECTION 21. _ Governing Law._ This Agreement and each Warrant Certificate issued hereunder shall be deemed to be a contract made under the laws of the State of New York and for all purposes shall be construed in accordance with the internal laws of said State. The parties agree that, all actions and proceedings arising out of this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, shall be brought in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York or in a New York State Court in the County of New York and that, in connection with any such action or proceeding, submit to the jurisdiction of, and venue in, such court. Each of the parties hereto also irrevocably waives all right to trial by jury in any action, proceeding or counterclaim arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. 

  

 SECTION 22. _ Benefits of This Agreement._ Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to give to any person or corporation other than the Company, the Warrant Agent and the registered holders of the Warrant Certificates any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under this Agreement, and this Agreement shall be for the sole and exclusive benefit of the Company, the Warrant Agent and the registered holders of the Warrant Certificates. 

        

 SECTION 23. _ Counterparts._ This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts and each of such counterparts shall for all purposes be deemed to be an original, and all such counterparts shall together constitute but one and the same instrument.

 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Agreement to be duly executed, as of the day and year first above written.

WARRANT CERTIFICATE

  

 _This Warrant Certificate certifies that _ __, or registered assigns, is the registered holder of _ _ warrants (the " _Warrants_ ") to purchase shares of Common Stock, $.0001 par value (the " _Common Stock_ "), of Kennedy-Wilson Holdings, Inc. (formerly Prospect Acquisition Corp.), a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ "). Each Warrant entitles the holder, upon exercise during the period set forth in the Warrant Agreement referred to below, to purchase from the Company that number of fully paid and non-assessable shares of Common Stock (each, a " _Warrant Share_ ") as set forth below at the exercise price (the " _Exercise Price_ ") as determined pursuant to the Warrant Agreement payable in lawful money of the United States of America upon surrender of this Warrant Certificate and payment of the Exercise Price at the office or agency of the Warrant Agent, but only subject to the conditions set forth herein and in the Warrant Agreement. Defined terms used in this Warrant Certificate but not defined herein shall have the meanings given to them in the Warrant Agreement. 

  

 Each Warrant is initially exercisable for one fully paid and non-assessable share of Common Stock. The number of Warrant Shares issuable upon exercise of the Warrants is subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events set forth in the Warrant Agreement. 

  

 The initial Exercise Price per share of Common Stock for any Warrant is equal to $12.50 per share. The Exercise Price is subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events set forth in the Warrant Agreement. 

  

 Warrants may be exercised only during the Warrant Exercise Period subject to the conditions set forth in the Warrant Agreement and to the extent not exercised by the end of such Warrant Exercise Period such Warrants shall become void. 

  

 Reference is hereby made to the further provisions of this Warrant Certificate set forth on the reverse hereof and such further provisions shall for all purposes have the same effect as though fully set forth at this place. 

  

 This Warrant Certificate shall not be valid unless countersigned by the Warrant Agent, as such term is used in the Warrant Agreement.      

 This Warrant Certificate shall be governed and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of New York, without regard to conflicts of laws principles thereof.

[Form of Warrant Certificate] 

[Reverse] 

  

 The Warrants evidenced by this Warrant Certificate are part of a duly authorized issue of Warrants entitling the holder on exercise to receive shares of Common Stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of the Company (the " _Common Stock_ "), and are issued or to be issued pursuant to an amended and restated Warrant Agreement dated as of [ _ _], 2009 (the " _Warrant Agreement_ "), duly executed and delivered by the Company to Continental Stock Transfer and Trust Company, a New York corporation, as warrant agent (the " _Warrant Agent_ "), which Warrant Agreement is hereby incorporated by reference in and made a part of this instrument and is hereby referred to for a description of the rights, limitation of rights, obligations, duties and immunities thereunder of the Warrant Agent, the Company and the holders (the words "holders" or "holder" meaning the registered holders or registered holder) of the Warrants. A copy of the Warrant Agreement may be obtained by the holder hereof upon written request to the Company. Defined terms used in this Warrant Certificate but not defined herein shall have the meanings given to them in the Warrant Agreement. 

  

 Warrants may be exercised at any time during the Warrant Exercise Period set forth in the Warrant Agreement. The holder of Warrants evidenced by this Warrant Certificate may exercise them by surrendering this Warrant Certificate, with the form of election to purchase set forth hereon properly completed and executed, together with payment of the Exercise Price as specified in the Warrant Agreement, at the principal corporate trust office of the Warrant Agent. In the event that upon any exercise of Warrants evidenced hereby the number of Warrants exercised shall be less than the total number of Warrants evidenced hereby, there shall be issued to the holder hereof or his assignee a new Warrant Certificate evidencing the number of Warrants not exercised. No adjustment shall be made for any dividends on any Common Stock issuable upon exercise of this Warrant. 

  

 Notwithstanding anything else in this Warrant Certificate or the Warrant Agreement, no Warrant may be exercised unless at the time of exercise (i) a registration statement covering the Warrant Shares to be issued upon exercise is effective under the Act and (ii) a prospectus thereunder relating to the Warrant Shares is current. In no event shall the Warrants be settled on a net cash basis during the Warrant Exercise Period nor shall the Company be required to issue unregistered shares upon the exercise of any Warrant. 

   

 Once the Warrants become exercisable and there is an effective registration statement covering the shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Warrants available and current throughout the 30-day redemption period defined below, the Company may redeem the outstanding Warrants (except with respect to the sponsors\' Warrants held by a sponsor or its permitted transferee) in whole and not in part at a price of $0.01 per Warrant upon a minimum of 30 days\' prior written notice of redemption (the " _30-day redemption period_ ") and if, and only if, the last sale price of the Company\'s Common Stock equals or exceeds $19.50 per share for any 20 trading days within a 30-trading day period ending three business days before the notice of redemption is sent. If the Company calls the Warrants for redemption, it will have the option to require all holders that wish to exercise Warrants to do so on a "cashless basis." In such event, each holder would pay the exercise price by surrendering the Warrants for that number of shares of Common Stock equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the product of the number of shares of Common Stock underlying the Warrants, multiplied by the difference between the exercise price of the Warrants and the "fair market value" (defined below) by (y) the fair market value. The " _fair market value_ " shall mean the average reported last sale price of the Common Stock for the ten trading days ending on the third trading day prior to the date on which the notice of redemption is sent to the holders of Warrants. 

   

 The Warrant Agreement provides that upon the occurrence of certain events the number of Warrant Shares set forth on the face hereof may, subject to certain conditions, be adjusted. No 

        
  

fractions of a share of Common Stock will be issued upon the exercise of any
Warrant, but the Company will pay the cash value thereof determined as
provided in the Warrant Agreement.

  

 Warrant Certificates, when surrendered at the principal corporate trust office of the Warrant Agent by the registered holder thereof in person or by legal representative or attorney duly authorized in writing, may be exchanged, in the manner and subject to the limitations provided in the Warrant Agreement, but without payment of any service charge, for another Warrant Certificate or Warrant Certificates of like tenor evidencing in the aggregate a like number of Warrants. 

  

 Upon due presentation for registration of transfer of this Warrant Certificate at the office of the Warrant Agent a new Warrant Certificate or Warrant Certificates of like tenor and evidencing in the aggregate a like number of Warrants shall be issued to the transferee(s) in exchange for this Warrant Certificate, subject to the limitations provided in the Warrant Agreement, without charge except for any tax or other governmental charge imposed in connection therewith. 

   

 The Company and the Warrant Agent may deem and treat the registered holder(s) thereof as the absolute owner(s) of this Warrant Certificate (notwithstanding any notation of ownership or other writing hereon made by anyone), for the purpose of any exercise hereof, of any distribution to the holder(s) hereof, and for all other purposes, and neither the Company nor the Warrant Agent shall be affected by any notice to the contrary. Neither the Warrants nor this Warrant Certificate entitles any holder hereof to any rights of a stockholder of the Company. 

      

                                     

   

    
Election to Purchase 

(To Be Executed Upon Exercise Of Warrant) 

  

 The undersigned hereby irrevocably elects to exercise the right, represented by this Warrant Certificate, to receive  _ _ shares of Common Stock and herewith tenders payment for such shares to the order of Kennedy-Wilson Holdings, Inc. in the amount of $ _ _ in accordance with the terms hereof. The undersigned requests that a certificate for such shares be registered in the name of  _ _, whose address is _ _ and that such shares be delivered to  _ _ whose address is _ _.
