the Bank Secrecy Act, as amended (the &#147;<U>BSA</U>&#148;), or anti-money laundering statutes in a manner
that would materially delay the receipt of approvals of Governmental Authorities required to

conducted in the ordinary course, no investigation or review by any Governmental Authority with
respect to National City or any National City Subsidiary is pending or, to the Knowledge of

National City, any National City Subsidiary, or any director, officer or employee of National City
or of any National City Subsidiary, has committed any breach of trust or fiduciary duty with
respect to any such fiduciary account that is reasonably likely to have, either individually or in
the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect, and the accountings for each such fiduciary account are

adequacy, its credit or reserve policies or its management, nor has National City been advised by
any Governmental Authority that it is contemplating issuing or requesting (or is considering the

City nor any National City Subsidiary is required by Section&nbsp;32 of the Federal Deposit Insurance
Act, as amended (&#147;<U>FDIA</U>&#148;) to give prior notice to a Federal banking agency of the proposed
addition of any individual to its Board of Directors or the employment of an individual as a senior

1502 of the Code, or other exceptions as set forth in such opinion), (B)&nbsp;no gain or loss will be
recognized by the stockholders of MAF who exchange their shares of MAF Common Stock solely for
