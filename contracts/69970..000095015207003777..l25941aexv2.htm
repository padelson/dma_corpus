III. CONSIDERATION; CONVERSION OF SHARES; EXCHANGE PROCEDURES 

   

 3.1 _Consideration; Conversion of Shares_. 

  

 (a) _Merger Consideration_. Subject to Sections 3.1(b) and 3.1(f) below, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of MAF Common Stock, each share of MAF Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, with respect to each holder of record of such shares, will be converted into the right to receive a number of fully paid and non-assessable shares of National City Common Stock equal to the product (rounded down to the nearest whole share) of (i) the Exchange Ratio, multiplied by (ii) the number of shares of MAF Common Stock held by such holder of record (such product and the consideration provided in Section 3.1(f) below dealing with fractional shares, is referred to herein as, the " _Merger Consideration_ "). Notwithstanding anything in this Section 3.1(a) to the contrary, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger, each share of MAF Common Stock (A) beneficially owned by National City or any direct or indirect National City Subsidiary (except for any such shares held in trust accounts, managed accounts or in any similar manner as trustee or in a fiduciary or custodial capacity (" _Trust Account Shares_ ") or acquired in satisfaction of debts previously contracted (" _DPC Shares_ ")), and (B) shares of MAF Common Stock held in the treasury of MAF, will be cancelled and no shares of National City Common Stock or other consideration will be issued or paid in exchange therefor. 

   

 (b) _Cancellation of Shares_. At the Effective Time, the shares of MAF Common Stock will no longer be outstanding and will automatically be cancelled and will cease to exist. At and after the Effective Time, certificates that represented shares of MAF Common Stock before the Effective Time shall only represent the right to receive the Merger Consideration. 

   

 (c) _Rights of Stockholders_. At the Effective Time, holders of MAF Common Stock will cease to be, and will have no rights as, stockholders of MAF, other than rights to (i) receive any then declared and unpaid dividend or other distribution with respect to such MAF Common Stock having a record date before the Effective Time and (ii) receive the Merger Consideration provided under this Article III. After the close of business on the Business Day immediately preceding the date of the Effective Time, there will be no transfers of shares of MAF Common Stock on the stock transfer books of MAF, and shares of MAF Common Stock presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason will be canceled and exchanged in accordance with this Article III. 

   

 (d) _Anti-Dilution Adjustments_. If National City changes (or the Board of Directors of National City sets a related record date that will occur before the Effective Time and after setting the Exchange Ratio for a change in) the number or kind of shares of National City Common Stock outstanding by way of a stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, reclassification, reorganization or similar transaction, then the Exchange Ratio will be adjusted proportionately to account for such change. 

  

 (e) _Effect on National City Common Stock_. Each share of National City Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will remain outstanding. 

   ##### 

  

       

 (f) _No Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, neither certificates nor scrip for fractional shares of National City Common Stock shall be issued in the Merger. Each holder of shares of MAF Common Stock who otherwise would have been entitled to a fraction of a share of National City Common Stock shall receive in lieu thereof cash (without interest) in an amount determined by multiplying the fractional share interest to which such holder would otherwise be entitled (after taking into account all shares of MAF Common Stock owned by such holder at the Effective Time) by the Average National City Stock Price. No such holder shall be entitled to dividends, voting rights or any other rights of a stockholder of National City in respect of any fractional share of National City Common Stock. 

   

 3.2 _Conversion of Stock Options and RSU s_. 

  

 (a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of any holder of any outstanding option to purchase shares of MAF Common Stock granted by MAF or its predecessors pursuant to MAFs existing stock option plans listed in Section 3.2(a) of the MAF Disclosure Letter (the " _MAF Option Plans_ "), whether vested or unvested (each, a " _MAF Option_ "), each MAF Option that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to represent a right to acquire shares of MAF Common Stock and shall be converted automatically into the right to acquire shares of National City Common Stock (a " _Converted Option_ "), on the same terms and conditions as were applicable under the terms of the MAF Option Plan under which the MAF Option was granted and the applicable award agreement thereunder, including, but not limited to, vesting, such number of shares of National City Common Stock and at such an exercise price per share determined as follows: 

    

 (i) The number of shares of National City Common Stock subject to a Converted Option shall be equal to the product of (A) the number of shares of MAF Common Stock purchasable upon exercise of the MAF Option and (B) the Exchange Ratio, the product being rounded down to the nearest whole share; and 

   

 (ii) The exercise price per share of National City Common Stock purchasable upon exercise of a Converted Option shall be equal to (A) the exercise price per share of MAF Common Stock under the MAF Stock Option divided by (B) the Exchange Ratio, the quotient being rounded up to the nearest cent. 

  

 As soon as practicable after the Closing Date, National City will provide each Optionee with a letter confirming the number of shares of National City Common Stock, exercise price and other relevant terms and conditions of the Converted Option. 

  

 (b) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of any holder of RSUs, all RSUs outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted to a number of RSUs equal to the number of RSUs held by such holder immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio. At and after the Effective Time, each outstanding RSU (a " _Converted RSU_ ") shall represent the right to receive a share of National City Common Stock in accordance with the terms of the agreements and plans

   ##### 

  

  

  

applicable thereto. Upon the conversion of the RSUs of a holder to National
City Common Stock, cash shall be paid in lieu of any fractional share
interest of such holder. 

   

 3.3 _Exchange of Certificates_. 

  

 (a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, National City shall designate National City Bank, or a depository or trust institution of recognized standing selected by National City and reasonably satisfactory to MAF, to act as exchange agent (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") in connection with the Merger pursuant to an exchange agent agreement providing for, among other things, the matters set forth in this Section 3.3. Except as set forth herein, from and after the Effective Time each holder of a certificate(s) evidencing share(s) of MAF Common Stock (the " _Old Certificates_ ") shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, upon surrender thereof to the Exchange Agent, the Merger Consideration for the shares of MAF Common Stock so represented by the Old Certificate surrendered by such holder thereof. The certificates representing shares of National City Common Stock that constitute the Merger Consideration shall be properly issued and countersigned and executed and authenticated, as appropriate. 

   

 (b) _Exchange Fund_. As of the Effective Time, for the benefit of the holders of Old Certificates, National City shall make available to the Exchange Agent (i) the number of shares of National City Common Stock issuable to holders of Old Certificates pursuant to Section 3.1(a) above and (ii) the estimated cash payable pursuant to Section 3.1(f) above with respect to fractional shares. The Exchange Agent shall invest any deposited cash as directed by National City. Any net profit resulting from, or interest or income produced by, such investments will be payable to National City. The Exchange Agent shall not be entitled to vote or exercise any rights of ownership with respect to the shares of National City Common Stock held by it from time to time hereunder, except that it shall receive and hold all dividends or other distributions paid or distributed with respect to such shares for the account of the Persons entitled thereto. 

   

 (c) _Notice of Exchange_. Within five (5) Business Days after its receipt of the necessary MAF shareholder information in a format compatible with the Exchange Agents systems, National City shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail and/or make available to each record holder of Old Certificates a notice and letter of transmittal (the " _Letter of Transmittal_ ") advising such holder of the effectiveness of the Merger and the procedures to be used in effecting the surrender of the Old Certificate(s) for exchange. Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of Old Certificate(s), together with a Letter of Transmittal duly executed and completed in accordance with the instructions thereon, and such other documents as may reasonably be requested, the Exchange Agent shall promptly deliver to the Person entitled thereto appropriate dividends or other distributions as provided in Section 3.3(f) below and the Merger Consideration for the shares of MAF Common Stock represented by the Old Certificate(s) surrendered by such holder thereof, and such Old Certificate(s) shall forthwith be canceled. At National Citys option, National City shall issue a certificate or evidence of shares in book entry form, representing the number of shares of National City Common Stock (a " _New Certificate_ ") issuable to the holder of the Old Certificate(s) under this Article III 

   

 (d) _Transfer_. If delivery of all or part of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name a surrendered Old Certificate is   ##### 

  

  

  

registered, it shall be a condition to such delivery or exchange that the Old
Certificate surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in
proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such delivery or
exchange shall have paid any transfer and other Taxes required by reason of
such delivery or exchange in a name other than that of the registered holder
of the Old Certificate surrendered or shall have established to the
reasonable satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax either has been
paid or is not payable. 

   

 (e) _Right to Merger Consideration_. Until surrendered and exchanged in accordance with this Section 3.3, Old Certificates shall, after the Effective Time, represent solely the right to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration, together with any dividends or other distributions as provided in Section 3.3(f) below, and shall have no other rights. From and after the Effective Time, National City and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to treat such Old Certificates that have not yet been surrendered for exchange as evidencing the right to the ownership of the Merger Consideration into which the shares of MAF Common Stock represented by such Old Certificates may be converted, notwithstanding any failure to surrender such Old Certificates. One hundred eighty (180) days following the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall deliver to National City any shares of National City Common Stock and funds (including any interest received with respect thereto) that National City has made available to the Exchange Agent and which have not been disbursed to holders of Old Certificates, and thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look to National City (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) with respect to the Merger Consideration deliverable or payable upon due surrender of their Old Certificates, together with any dividends or other distributions as provided in Section 3.3(f) below. Neither Exchange Agent nor any Party shall be liable to any holder of shares of MAF Common Stock for any shares of National City Common Stock (or dividends, distributions or interest with respect thereto) delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. 

   

 (f) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Certificates_. Whenever a dividend or other distribution is declared by National City on shares of National City Common Stock, the record date for which is at or after the Effective Time, the declaration shall include dividends or other distributions on all shares issuable pursuant to this Agreement, provided that no dividends or other distributions declared or made with respect to shares of National City Common Stock shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Old Certificate with respect to the shares of National City Common Stock represented thereby until the holder of such Old Certificate shall surrender such Old Certificate in accordance with this Article III. Upon surrender of Old Certificate(s), there shall be paid to the record holder of the Old Certificate(s) the amount of dividends, if any, without interest, less any taxes that may have been imposed thereon with a record date after the Effective Time, which have become payable with respect to the number of whole shares of National City Common Stock represented by the Old Certificate(s). National City shall pay any dividends or make any other distributions with a record date prior to the Effective Time that may have been declared or made by MAF on MAF Common Stock in accordance with the terms of this Agreement on or prior to the Effective Time and which remain unpaid at the Effective Time. 

   

 (g) _Lost or Destroyed Exchanged Certificates_. In the event that any Old Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Old Certificate, upon the making of an affidavit of   ##### 

  

   

that fact by the holder thereof in form satisfactory to the Exchange Agent,
the Merger Consideration, as may be required pursuant to this Agreement;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Exchange Agent may, in its sole discretion
and as a condition precedent to the delivery of the Merger Consideration to
which the holder of such Old Certificate is entitled as a result of the
Merger, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Old Certificate
to deliver a bond in such sum as it may direct as indemnity against any claim
that may be made against MAF, National City or the Exchange Agent or any
other party with respect to the Old Certificate alleged to have been
lost, stolen or destroyed. 

   

 (h) _Rights With Respect to Unexchanged Certificates_. After the Effective Time, holders of unsurrendered Old Certificates shall not have any rights as a stockholder of MAF, National City or the Surviving Corporation, including, without limitation, the right to vote at any meeting of any such entitys stockholders. 

   

 (i) _Closing of MAF s Transfer Books_. The stock transfer books of MAF shall be closed at the close of business on the Business Day immediately preceding the date of the Effective Time. In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of MAF Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of MAF, the Merger Consideration to be distributed pursuant to this Agreement may be delivered to a transferee, if an Old Certificate is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and by payment of any applicable stock transfer taxes. National City and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to rely upon the stock transfer books of MAF to establish the identity of those Persons entitled to a notice and Letter of Transmittal pursuant to Section 3.3(c) above and receive the Merger Consideration specified in this Agreement for their shares of MAF Common Stock, which books shall be conclusive with respect to the ownership of such shares. In the event of a dispute with respect to the ownership of any such shares, National City and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deposit any New Certificates not already delivered representing such disputed shares in escrow and thereafter be relieved with respect to any claims to such Merger Consideration. 

   

 3.4 _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. In the event that MAF changes the number of shares of MAF Common Stock, or securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for shares of MAF Common Stock, issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a result of a reclassification, stock split (including reverse stock split), stock dividend or distribution, recapitalization, subdivision, or similar transaction, the Merger Consideration shall be adjusted accordingly. 

  

IV. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF NATIONAL CITY 

   

 Except as disclosed in the National City Disclosure Letter, National City hereby represents and warrants to MAF that: 

  

 4.1 _Corporate Organization_.

Each National City Significant Subsidiary has the requisite corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and assets and to carry on its businesses as they are now being conducted.

any National City Subsidiary is a party or to which they or any of their
respective properties or assets are subject, except for such violations,
conflicts, breaches, defaults, terminations, accelerations or creations of
Liens, which will not have nor reasonably expected to have, individually or in

nor has the PBGC instituted proceedings to terminate a defined benefit plan

entitling the PBGC to institute any such proceedings, and (vi) no pension plan
is a "multiemployer plan" within the meaning of Section 3(37) of ERISA or a
"multiple employer plan" within the meaning of 413(c) of the Code. 

   

 (c) Neither National City nor any National City Subsidiary has incurred any liability to the PBGC with respect to any "single employer plan" within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(15) of ERISA currently or formerly maintained by any Person considered one employer with it under Section 4001 of ERISA or Section 414 of the Code, except for premiums all of which have been paid when due. Neither National City nor any National City Subsidiary has incurred any withdrawal liability with respect to a multiemployer plan under Subtitle E of Title IV of ERISA.

 (d) With respect to any insurance policy that heretofore has or currently does provide funding for benefits under any National City Employee Plan, (i) as of the date hereof, there is no material liability on the part of National City or any National City Subsidiary in the nature of a retroactive or retrospective rate adjustment, loss sharing arrangement, or other actual or contingent liability, nor would there be any such liability if such insurance policy was terminated, and (ii) no insurance company issuing such policy is in receivership, conservatorship, liquidation or similar proceeding and, to the Knowledge of National City, no such proceeding with respect to any such insurer is imminent. 

   

 (e) Neither the execution of this Agreement, nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will (i) constitute a stated triggering event under any National City Employee Plan that will result in any payment (whether of severance pay or otherwise) becoming due from National City or any National City Subsidiary to any present or former officer, employee, director, stockholder, consultant or dependent of any of the foregoing or (ii) accelerate the time of payment or vesting, or increase the amount of compensation due to any present or former officer, employee, director, stockholder, consultant, or dependent of any of the foregoing. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (f) Neither National City nor any National City Subsidiary has any obligations for retiree health and life benefits under any National City Employee Plan, program or contract.

 4.10 _Material Contracts_. Except as disclosed in the National City Reports or Section 6.5(g) of the Agreement, neither National City nor any National City Subsidiary is a party to, or is bound or affected by, or receives benefits under (a) any employment, severance, termination, consulting or retirement agreement (collectively, " _Benefit Agreements_ ") that was required to be filed with the SEC pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K of the Exchange Act, (b) any material agreement, indenture or other instrument relating to the borrowing of money by National City or any National City Subsidiary or the guarantee by National City or any National City Subsidiary of any such obligation (other than trade payables and instruments relating to borrowings or guaranties made in the ordinary course of business) or (c) any other contract or agreement or amendment thereto that would be required to be filed as an exhibit to a Form 10-K filed by National City with the SEC as of the date thereof (each, a " _National City Contract_ "). National City has delivered or made available to MAF a correct and complete copy of each National City Contract, together with all amendments and supplements thereto. Neither National City nor any National City Subsidiary is in default under any National City Contract, which default is reasonably likely to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect, and there has not occurred any event that with the lapse of time or the giving of notice or both would constitute such a default. 

  

 4.11 [ _Reserved_ ]. 

  

 4.12 _Litigation_. Except as disclosed in the National City Reports, there is no Action pending, or, to the Knowledge of National City, threatened against or affecting National City or any National City Subsidiary that, if decided adversely to National City or any applicable National City Subsidiary, would be reasonably expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect, nor is there any Governmental Order outstanding against National City or any of National City Subsidiary having, or which would, to the Knowledge of National City, now or in the future have, or would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. 

  

 4.13 _Compliance with Laws_. 

  

 (a) National City and each National City Subsidiary hold all licenses, franchises, permits and authorizations necessary for the lawful conduct of their respective businesses under and pursuant to each, and have complied in all respects with and are not in default in any respect under any, applicable Law, and implementing rules, regulations or publicly-issued statements of policy of any Governmental Authority relating to National City or any National City Subsidiary, except where the failure to hold such license, franchise, permit or authorization or such noncompliance or default is not reasonably likely to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. 

   

 (b) Except as disclosed in the National City Reports, the businesses of National City and each National City Subsidiary are not being conducted in violation of any   ##### 

  

  

  

applicable Law or Governmental Order (including, without limitation, in the
case of a National City Subsidiary that is a bank, all applicable Laws
pertaining to the conduct of the banking business and the exercise of
trust powers), except for violations that individually or in the aggregate do
not, and, to the Knowledge of National City, will not, have a Material
Adverse Effect. To the Knowledge of National City, any National City
Subsidiary that is a bank is not in violation of those Laws applicable to
depository institutions, and corresponding regulations and publicly-issued
statements of policy of any Governmental Authority relating to the Community
Reinvestment Act (" _CRA_ "), privacy Laws, the Bank Secrecy Act, as amended
(the " _BSA_ "), or anti-money laundering statutes in a manner that would
materially delay the receipt of approvals of Governmental Authorities required
to consummate the transactions contemplated in this Agreement. Other than
regulatory examinations conducted in the ordinary course, no investigation or
review by any Governmental Authority with respect to National City or any
National City Subsidiary is pending or, to the Knowledge of National City,
threatened, nor has any Governmental Authority indicated an intention to
conduct the same in each case other than those the outcome of which will not
have nor reasonably expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect. 

   

 (c) Except as is not reasonably likely to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect, National City and each National City Subsidiary have properly administered all accounts for which it acts as a fiduciary, including accounts for which it serves as a trustee, agent, custodian, personal representative, guardian, conservator or investment advisor, in accordance with the terms of the governing documents, applicable Laws and common law. None of National City, any National City Subsidiary, or any director, officer or employee of National City or of any National City Subsidiary, has committed any breach of trust or fiduciary duty with respect to any such fiduciary account that is reasonably likely to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect, and the accountings for each such fiduciary account are true and correct and accurately reflect the assets of such fiduciary account except as would not be reasonably likely to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. 

   

 4.14 _Agreements with Regulators, Etc_. Neither National City nor any National City Subsidiary is a party to any written agreement or memorandum of understanding with, or a party to any commitment letter with, board resolution or similar undertaking to, or is a recipient of any extraordinary supervisory letter from, or is subject to any other Governmental Order by, any Governmental Authority, which (i) restricts materially the conduct of its business, (ii) may materially delay the receipt of approvals of Governmental Authorities required to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or (iii) in any manner relates to its capital adequacy, its credit or reserve policies or its management, nor has National City been advised by any Governmental Authority that it is contemplating issuing or requesting (or is considering the appropriateness of issuing or requesting) any such agreement, memorandum of understanding, extraordinary supervisory letter, commitment letter or other Governmental Order. Neither National City nor any National City Subsidiary is required by Section 32 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, as amended (" _FDIA_ ") to give prior notice to a Federal banking agency of the proposed addition of any individual to its Board of Directors or the employment of an individual as a senior executive officer. To the Knowledge of National City, there is no reason why the regulatory approvals referred to in Section 4.6(c) above should not be obtained. 

   ##### 

  

  

 4.15 _National City Ownership of MAF Common Stock_. As of the date of this Agreement, neither National City nor any of its Affiliates (i) beneficially owns, directly or indirectly, or (ii) are parties to any agreement, arrangement or understanding for the purpose of acquiring, holding, voting or disposing of, MAF Common Stock (other than DPC Shares or Trust Account Shares), which in the aggregate, represent five percent (5%) or more of the outstanding shares of MAF Common Stock.

 4.17 _National City Action_. The Board of Directors of National City (at a meeting duly called, constituted and held) has by the requisite vote of all directors present (i) determined that the Merger is advisable and in the best interests of National City and its stockholders and (ii) approved this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger. 

  

 4.18 _Environmental Matters_. To the Knowledge of National City, (i) neither National City nor any National City Subsidiary is in material violation of or has any material liability, absolute or contingent, in connection with or under any Environmental Law, except any such violations or liabilities which would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect; (ii) the condition of the Loan Portfolio Properties, Trust Properties and Other Properties of National City or a National City Subsidiary does not constitute a violation of or has not resulted in any liability, absolute or contingent to National City or any National City Subsidiary, under any Environmental Law, except any such violations or liabilities which would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect; and (iii) there are no Actions pending or, to the Knowledge of National City, threatened relating to any Loan Portfolio Properties, Trust Properties and Other Properties, including, without limitation, any notices, demand letters or requests for information from any federal or state environmental agency relating to any such liability under or violation of Environmental Law, which would impose a liability upon National City or any National City Subsidiary pursuant to any Environmental Law, except such as would not, individually or in the aggregate have a Material Adverse Effect. This Section 4.18 contains the sole and exclusive representations and warranties of National City related to Environmental Laws and Hazardous Substances.

payments to any of its current or former officers, directors, employees or
agents for any wages, salaries, commissions, bonuses, benefits or
other compensation for any services performed by them or amounts required to
be reimbursed to them. 

   

 4.20 _Sarbanes-Oxley Act_. National City is in compliance with the provisions, including Section 404, of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and the certifications provided pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 thereof were accurate as of the date such certifications were made and such future certifications to be provided pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 will be accurate as of the date such certifications are made. 

  

 4.21 _Tax Treatment_. As of the date hereof, to the Knowledge of National City, there is no reason why the Merger will fail to qualify as a reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code. 

  

 4.22 _Notice of Breach or Potential Breach_. National City shall promptly notify MAF of any change, circumstance or event which would cause any of the representations or warranties made by National City pursuant to this Agreement to be untrue as of the date hereof or at the Closing Date or which prevents National City from complying with any of its obligations hereunder. There is no fact or development known to National City which would have or reasonably expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on National Citys or any National City Subsidiarys continuing business, which has not been set forth in this Agreement or the National City Disclosure Letter. 

  

 4.23 _Disclosure_. No representation or warranty by National City in this Agreement after giving effect to the totality of the disclosures set forth in the National City Disclosure Letter, contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact required to be stated herein or therein or necessary to make any statement herein or therein not materially misleading. Any claim by MAF of a breach of representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or obligation of National City hereunder will not be affected by any investigation conducted by MAF with respect to, or knowledge acquired (or capable of being acquired), with respect to the accuracy or inaccuracy of or compliance with any such representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or obligation. 

  

V. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF MAF 

   

 Except as disclosed in the MAF Disclosure Letter, MAF hereby represents and warrants to National City that: 

  

 5.1 _Corporate Organization_. 

  

 (a) _MAF_. MAF is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the State of Delaware and is duly qualified to do business as a foreign corporation in each jurisdiction in which its ownership or lease of property or the nature of the business conducted by it makes such qualification necessary, except for such jurisdictions in which the failure to be so qualified would not have or would reasonably be expected not to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. MAF is registered as a unitary savings and loan holding company under HOLA. MAF has the requisite corporate power and 

     ##### 

 

  

authority to own, lease and operate its properties and assets and to carry on
its business as it is now being conducted. MAF has delivered or made
available to National City true and complete copies of its certificate of
incorporation and by-laws. 

   

 (b) _MAF Bank_. MAF Bank is a federally-chartered stock savings bank organized with valid corporate existence under the Laws of the United States of America. 

   

 5.2 _Authority_. MAF has the requisite corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and, except for the requisite approval of MAFs stockholders set forth in Section 5.17 of this Agreement, to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated herein have been duly approved by the Board of Directors of MAF and no other corporate proceedings on the part of MAF are necessary to authorize this Agreement or to consummate the transactions so contemplated by this Agreement, subject only to approval by the stockholders of MAF as provided in Section 5.17 below. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by, and (assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement by National City) constitutes the valid and binding obligation of MAF enforceable against MAF in accordance with its terms, except as the enforceability thereof may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, fraudulent transfer, moratorium and other similar Laws affecting the enforcement of creditors rights generally and except that the availability of the equitable remedy of specific performance or injunctive relief is subject to the discretion of the court before which any proceedings may be brought. 

  

 5.3 _Capitalization_. The authorized capital stock of MAF consists of (a) 80,000,000 shares of MAF Common Stock, and (b) 5,000,000 shares of MAF preferred stock, par value $.01 per share (" _MAF Preferred Stock_ "). As of the close of business on April 27, 2007, 32,933,888 shares of MAF Common Stock were validly issued and outstanding, fully paid and nonassessable, and there are no shares of MAF Preferred Stock issued or outstanding. As of the date of this Agreement, there were outstanding under MAF Option Plans options to purchase 3,046,838 shares of MAF Common Stock, which MAF Options had a weighted average exercise price of $33.88 and for which adequate shares of MAF Common Stock have been reserved for issuance under the MAF Option Plans. There are 120,620 RSUs outstanding on the date hereof. Section 5.3 of the MAF Disclosure Letter sets forth as of the close of business on the date of this Agreement, with respect to each MAF Option, a true, accurate complete list of (i) the name of each optionee for the MAF Option (each, an " _Optionee_ "), (ii) the number of shares of MAF Common Stock the Optionee has the right to purchase under the MAF Option, (iii) the exercise price for the MAF Option and (iv) the date the MAF Option was granted to the Optionee. The exercise price per share of MAF Common Stock under the MAF Options was determined based on the market value of such shares of MAF Common Stock on the date such MAF Options were granted. No MAF Option (x) has a stated exercise price lower than the market value (as then defined in the respective MAF Option Plan under which the MAF Option was granted) on the grant date of the MAF Option, or (y) has a grant date "backdated." Except as set forth in this Section 5.3, there are no shares of capital stock of (or any other type of equity interest in) MAF that are authorized, issued or outstanding, and there are no outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants, rights, convertible securities or any other agreements (including, without limitation, restricted stock award agreements) or commitments of any character relating to the issued or unissued capital stock or other securities of MAF obligating MAF to issue, deliver or sell, or 

   ##### 

  

    

cause to be issued, delivered or sold, additional shares of capital stock of
MAF or obligating MAF to grant, extend or enter into any subscription,
option, warrant, right, convertible security or other similar agreement or
commitment. There are no voting trusts or other agreements or understandings
to which MAF or any MAF Subsidiary is a party with respect to the voting of
the capital stock of MAF. 

  

 5.4 _Subsidiaries_. Section 5.4 of the MAF Disclosure Letter sets forth with respect to each Subsidiary of MAF (each, a " _MAF Subsidiary_ ") the (i) name of the MAF Subsidiary, (ii) state of incorporation or organization of the MAF Subsidiary, (iii) the owners and their respective ownership interests in the MAF Subsidiary and (iv) the primary activities of the MAF Subsidiary and the primary activities the MAF Subsidiary is engaged in as of the date hereof. Each MAF Subsidiary is a savings bank, a corporation, a limited liability company or other business entity or association duly organized, validly existing and in good standing (or the local Law equivalent) under the Laws of its respective jurisdiction of incorporation or organization and is qualified to do business as a foreign corporation or foreign business entity or association in each jurisdiction in which its ownership or lease of property or the nature of the business conducted by it makes such qualification necessary, except for such jurisdictions in which the failure to be so qualified would not have nor reasonably expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. Each MAF Subsidiary has the requisite corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and assets and to carry on its businesses as they are now being conducted. All outstanding shares of capital stock of each MAF Subsidiary are owned by MAF or a MAF Subsidiary and are validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable, are not subject to preemptive rights and are owned free and clear of all Liens. There are no outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants, rights, convertible securities or any other agreements or commitments of any character relating to the issued or unissued capital stock or other securities of any MAF Subsidiary obligating any MAF Subsidiary to issue, deliver or sell, or cause to be issued, delivered or sold additional shares of its capital stock or obligating any MAF Subsidiary to grant, extend or enter into any subscription, option, warrant, right, convertible security or other similar agreement or commitment. 

  

 5.5 _Information in Registration Statement and Proxy Statement_. None of the information with respect to MAF or any MAF Subsidiary provided by MAF for inclusion in the Proxy Statement or the Registration Statement will, in the case of the Proxy Statement or any amendments or supplements thereto, at the time of the mailing of the Proxy Statement and any amendments or supplements thereto, and at the time of the MAF Meeting, or, in the case of the Registration Statement, at the time it becomes effective, contain any untrue statement of material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. The information provided by MAF for inclusion in the Proxy Statement or the Registration Statement will comply as to form in all material respects with the provisions of the Exchange Act. 

  

 5.6 _Consents and Approvals_. Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement by MAF nor the consummation by MAF of the transactions contemplated hereby will (a) conflict with or result in any breach of any provision of its certificate of incorporation or by-laws of MAF, (b) violate, conflict with, constitute a default (or an event which, with notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a default) under, or result in the termination of, or accelerate the 

   ##### 

  

    

performance required by, or result in the creation of any Lien upon any of
the properties or assets of MAF or any MAF Subsidiary under, any of the
terms, conditions or provisions of any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, deed
of trust, license, lease, agreement or other instrument or obligation to
which MAF or any MAF Subsidiary is a party or to which they or any of their
respective properties or assets are subject, except for such violations,
conflicts, breaches, defaults, terminations, accelerations or creations of
Liens, which will not have nor reasonably expected to have, individually or
in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect, or (c) require any consent,
approval, authorization or permit of or from, or filing with or notification

which, if not obtained or made will not have nor reasonably expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect. 

  

 5.7 _Reports and Financial Statements_. 

  

 (a) Since January 1, 2002, MAF and each MAF Subsidiary have timely filed all reports, registrations and statements, together with any amendments thereto, that they were required to file with the SEC under Sections 12(b), 12(g), 13(a) or 14(a) of the Exchange Act, including, but not limited to Forms 10-K, Forms 10-Q and proxy statements (the " _MAF Reports_ "). MAF has delivered or made available to National City true and complete copies of each of MAFs annual reports on Form 10-K for fiscal years 2002 through 2006. As of their respective dates, the MAF Reports complied with the requirements of the Exchange Act and did not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstance under which they were made, not misleading. The audited consolidated financial statements and unaudited interim financial statements of MAF included in the MAF Reports (i) have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP applied on a consistent basis (except as may be indicated therein or in the notes thereto), (ii) fairly present the financial position of MAF and MAF Subsidiaries taken as a whole as at the respective dates thereof and the consolidated results of their operations and cash flows for the respective periods then ended subject, in the case of the unaudited interim financial statements, to normal year end and audit adjustments and any other adjustments described therein, and (iii) MAF has prepared an impairment analysis of the Real Estate on the balance sheet of MAF Developments, Inc. relating to the Springbank Project as of March 31, 2007, consistent with U.S. GAAP. The results of the impairment analysis indicate that MAFs investment in the Springbank Project will be fully recovered over the life of the project. Since January 1, 2002, neither MAF nor any MAF Subsidiary has incurred any liability, contingent or otherwise of a type required to be disclosed in accordance with U.S. GAAP as in effect as of the respective dates of such financial statements, except as disclosed in the MAF Reports.

The MAF Unaudited Interim Financial Information 

    ##### 

  

    

(i) has been accurately derived from the books and records of MAF, (ii) fairly
presents, in all material respects, the financial condition and the results
of operations of MAF and the MAF Subsidiaries taken as a whole as of the
respective dates and for the periods indicated, and (iii) were prepared on a
basis consistent with the accounting principles and practices that MAF used to

there are no restrictions on the rights of MAF or MAF Subsidiaries to amend
or terminate any such MAF Employee Plan without incurring any liability
thereunder. 

   

 (f) Section 5.9(f)(i) of the MAF Disclosure Letter identifies each MAF Employee Plan that is non-qualified, including those deferred compensation plans identified as the "MAF Deferred Compensation Plans" (collectively, the " _MAF Non-Qualified Plans_ "), and Section 5.9(f)(ii) of the MAF Disclosure Letter identifies each MAF Non-Qualified Plan that has a trust for the benefit of the participants of the MAF Non-Qualified Plan. MAF and each applicable MAF Subsidiary have accrued expenses, on a basis consistent with U.S. GAAP, for the value of all of the required distributions due and owing or expected to become due and owing under any MAF Non-Qualified Plans as of the end of the most recent fiscal quarter and any trust maintained by MAF for the benefit of the participants in a MAF Non-Qualified Plan has adequate balances to pay any and all "benefit liabilities" due. 

   

 (g) Neither the execution of this Agreement nor the undertaking or consummation of any transaction contemplated by this Agreement shall (i) constitute a partial termination of the MAF Bank Employee Stock Ownership Plan (the " _ESOP_ ") or otherwise require or compel the termination of the ESOP or (ii) prevent or impose limitations on or otherwise restrict National Citys ability to assume, continue, maintain, administer, terminate or take any other action with respect to any MAF Employee Benefit Plan, including, but not limited to, the ESOP. There are no outstanding loan obligations under the ESOP. 

   

 5.10 _Material Contracts_. Except as disclosed in the MAF Reports, or the agreements referenced in Section 6.5(g) of this Agreement, neither MAF nor any MAF Subsidiary is a party to, or is bound or affected by, or receives benefits under (a) any Benefit Agreements providing for aggregate payments to any Person in any calendar year in excess of $100,000, (b) any material agreement, indenture or other instrument relating to the borrowing of money by MAF or any MAF Subsidiary or the guarantee by MAF or any MAF Subsidiary of any such obligation (other than trade payables and instruments relating to transactions entered into in the ordinary course of business), (c) any other contract or agreement or amendment thereto that would be required to be filed as an exhibit to a Form 10-K filed by MAF with the SEC as of the date of this Agreement, or (d) any contract, agreement, plan, policy or understanding that by its terms is affected (including, but not limited to accelerated vesting or payment, setting of benefits, change in payment, or establishing benefits or payments) as a result of a change in control (each, an " _MAF Contract_ "). MAF has delivered or made available to National City a correct and complete copy of each MAF Contract, together with all amendments and supplements thereto. Neither MAF nor any MAF Subsidiary is in default under any MAF Contract, which default is reasonably likely to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect, and there has not occurred any event that with the lapse of time or the giving of notice or both would constitute such a default. 

  

 5.11 [ _Reserved_ ]. 

  

 5.12 _Litigation_. Except as disclosed in MAF Reports, there is no Action pending, or, to the Knowledge of MAF, threatened against or affecting MAF or any MAF Subsidiary which, if decided adversely to MAF or an applicable MAF Subsidiary, would be reasonably expected to 

   ##### 

  

 

have a Material Adverse Effect, nor is there any Governmental Order,
outstanding against MAF or any MAF Subsidiary having, or which would, to the
Knowledge of MAF, now or in the future have a Material Adverse Effect. 

   

 5.13 _Compliance with Laws and Orders_. 

  

 (a) MAF and each MAF Subsidiary hold all licenses, franchises, permits and authorizations necessary for the lawful conduct of their respective businesses under and pursuant to each, and have complied in all respects with and are not in default in any respect under any, applicable Law, and implementing rules, regulations or publicly-issued statements of policy of any Governmental Authority relating to MAF or a MAF Subsidiary, except where the failure to hold such license, franchise, permit or authorization or such noncompliance or default is not reasonably likely to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. 

   

 (b) Except as disclosed in MAF Reports, the businesses of MAF and each MAF Subsidiary are not being conducted in violation of any applicable Law or Governmental Order (including, without limitation, in the case of a MAF Subsidiary that is a thrift, all applicable Laws pertaining to the conduct of the banking business and the exercise of trust powers), except for violations which individually or in the aggregate do not have, and to the Knowledge of MAF, will not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. To the Knowledge of Seller, any MAF Subsidiary that is a bank or thrift is not in violation of those Laws applicable to depository institutions, and corresponding regulations and publicly-issued statements of policy of any Governmental Authority relating to CRA, privacy Laws, the BSA or anti-money laundering statutes in a manner that would materially delay the receipt of approvals of Governmental Authorities required to consummate the transactions contemplated in this Agreement. Other than regulatory examinations conducted in the ordinary course, no investigation or review by any Governmental Authority with respect to MAF or any MAF Subsidiary is pending or, to the Knowledge of MAF, threatened, nor has any Governmental Authority indicated an intention to conduct the same in each case other than those the outcome of which will not have nor reasonably expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. 

   

 (c) Except as is not reasonably likely to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect, MAF and each MAF Subsidiary have properly administered all accounts for which it acts as a fiduciary, including accounts for which it serves as a trustee, agent, custodian, personal representative, guardian, conservator or investment advisor, in accordance with the terms of the governing documents, applicable Law and common law. None of MAF, any MAF Subsidiary, or any director, officer or employee of MAF or of any MAF Subsidiary, has committed any breach of trust or fiduciary duty with respect to any such fiduciary account that is reasonably likely to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect, and the accountings for each such fiduciary account are true and correct and accurately reflect the assets of such fiduciary account except as would not be reasonably likely to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. 

   

 5.14 _Agreements with Regulators, Etc_. Neither MAF nor any MAF Subsidiary is a party to any written agreement or memorandum of understanding with, or a party to any commitment letter with, board resolution or similar undertaking to, or is a recipient of any 

   ##### 

  

    

extraordinary supervisory letter from, or is subject to any other Governmental
Order by, any Governmental Authority, which (i) restricts materially the
conduct of its business, (ii) may materially delay the receipt of approvals
of Governmental Authorities required to consummate the
transactions contemplated in this Agreement or (iii) in any manner relates to
its capital adequacy, its credit or reserve policies or its management, nor
has MAF been advised by any Governmental Authority that it is contemplating
issuing or requesting (or is considering the appropriateness of issuing
or requesting) any such agreement, memorandum of understanding, extraordinary
supervisory letter, commitment letter or other Governmental Order. Neither
MAF nor any MAF Subsidiary is required by Section 32 of the FDIA to give
prior notice to a federal banking agency of the proposed addition of any
individual to its Board of Directors or the employment of an individual as a
senior or executive officer. To the Knowledge of MAF, there is no reason why
the regulatory approvals referred to in Section 5.6(c) above should not be
obtained. 

  

 5.15 _Financial Advisors_. Except for fees paid and payable to Keefe Bruyette and Woods, Inc.

This Section 5.19 contains the sole and exclusive representations and warranties of MAF related to Environmental Laws and Hazardous Substances.

All of the loans, leases, installment sales contracts and other credit transactions on the books of MAF and the MAF Subsidiaries are valid and properly documented and were made in the ordinary course of business, and the security therefor, if any, is valid and properly perfected, except where such failure is not reasonably likely to have, either individually 

   ##### 

  

    

or in the aggregate a Material Adverse Effect. Neither the terms of such
loans, leases, installment sales contracts and other credit transactions, nor
any of the documentation evidencing such transactions, nor the manner in
which such loans, leases, installment sales contracts and other credit

National City shall honor, maintain and perform on and after the Effective Time, without deduction, counterclaims, interruptions or deferment (other than withholding under applicable Law and such deductions, counterclaims, interruptions or deferments as may be permitted under the MAF Employee Plans), all of MAFs and MAF Subsidiaries vested obligations under MAF Employee Plans; _provided_ , _further_ , that this provision shall not be construed as precluding the merger of a MAF Employee Plan into a National City Employee Plan or the termination of such MAF Employee Plan; and _provided_ , _further_ , that National City shall have the right to delay the payment, or limit the form of payment, of any amount under any MAF Employee Plan and the right to amend any MAF Employee Plan to delay the payment, or limit the form of payment, of any amount under any MAF Employee Plan to the extent National City, in good faith, determines that such delay or limitation is necessary to avoid adverse tax consequences under Section 409A of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder, and National City shall not exercise any discretion or take any action to cause any such adverse tax consequences. 

   

 (b) _Employment of Continuing Employees_. National City acknowledges that each individual who is an employee of MAF or any MAF Subsidiary immediately prior to the Effective Time (a " _Continuing Employee_ ") shall continue to be an employee of the SURVIVING CORPORATION or a MAF Subsidiary after the Effective Time. After the conversion of the Continuing Employees to National Citys welfare plans as contemplated by Section 6.5(d) below, each Continuing Employee, while employed by National City or a National City Subsidiary, shall continue to receive base pay and the benefits under the Eligible Plans that in the aggregate are no less favorable than the benefits under the Eligible Plans enjoyed generally by National City employees working in similar business lines.

In the event that applicable Law or the terms of National City Employee Plans do not permit immediate eligibility for the Continuing Employees for any such National City Employee Plans, then the Continuing Employees shall be eligible to participate in such National City Employee Plans as of the earliest eligibility date. National City or the applicable National City Subsidiary shall accomplish the migration of the Continuing Employees to the Eligible Plans as set forth in Section 6.5(d) of the MAF Disclosure Letter.

 (f) _Severance Upon Termination of Continuing Employee_. If a Continuing Employee is terminated without cause at or after the Effective Time by National City or any National City Subsidiary, such Continuing Employee shall be entitled to the severance benefits that would be paid from time to time under the severance benefit plan or program of MAF attached as Section 6.5(f) to the MAF Disclosure Letter.

   ##### 

  

 

(i) would be reasonably likely, in the advice of counsel, to result in the
loss or impairment of any privilege generally recognized under Law with
respect to such information or (ii) would be precluded by any Law or
Governmental Order. Any claim by a Party for a breach of representation,
warranty, covenant, agreement or obligation of such Party hereunder shall not
be affected by any investigation conducted by such Party with respect to, or
knowledge acquired (or capable of being acquired), with respect to the
accuracy or inaccuracy of or compliance with any such representation,

National Citys obligations under this Section 6.9(a) shall continue in full force and effect for a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that all rights to

If National City is unable to obtain such Insurance Policy with the coverage required hereby within the Insurance Expense Cap, then National City shall use the full amount of the Insurance Expense Cap to obtain one or more alternate insurance policies with as much coverage as is commercially obtainable. 

   

 (d) If National City or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation of such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, to the extent necessary, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of National City assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.9.

 6.19 _Section 16_. National City and MAF agree that, in order to most effectively compensate and retain MAF Insiders in connection with the Merger, both prior to and after the Effective Time, it is desirable that MAF Insiders not be subject to a risk of liability under

applicable Law in connection with the conversion of shares of MAF Common
Stock and MAF Options to acquire shares of MAF Common Stock into shares of

City Common Stock in the Merger, and for that compensatory and retentive
purpose agree to the provisions of this Section 6.19. " _MAF Insiders_ "

DSUs, by such Persons pursuant to the Merger shall be exempt from
liability pursuant to Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act, and (y) the Board of
Directors of National City shall take such action consistent with the SECs
interpretive guidance to approve the acquisition of shares of National City
Common Stock by each director and officer of National City for purposes of
Rule 16b-3(d) under the Exchange Act such that the deemed "purchase" of such
shares of National City Common Stock, by such Persons pursuant to the Merger
shall be exempt from liability pursuant to Section 16(b) of the Exchange
Act. 

   

 6.20 _Tax-Free Reorganization Treatment_. Neither National City nor MAF shall intentionally take or cause to be taken any action, whether before or after the Effective Time, which would disqualify the Merger as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. 

  

 6.21 _Title Examination_. MAF shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause, at its sole cost and expense, a title company, mutually acceptable to National City and MAF, to deliver title examinations for each Owned Real Property, as soon as practicable, but in no event later than July 31, 2007.

 (e) No temporary restraining order, preliminary or permanent injunction or other Governmental Order by any Governmental Authority that prevents the consummation of the Merger shall have been issued and remain in effect; _provided_ , _however_ , that prior to the earlier of (i) April 30, 2008, or (ii) the time at which such injunction or Governmental Order becomes final and non-appealable, the entry of any such injunction or Governmental Order shall
