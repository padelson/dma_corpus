Date, (A) the full amount of the Debt Financing will not be available to be

the Surviving Company, its right, title or interest in, to or under any of the
rights, properties or assets of either of the Company or Purchaser vested in
or to be vested in the Surviving Company as a result of, or in connection

the holders of any of the following securities:

" _Merger Consideration_ ").

(b) _Treatment of Treasury Shares and Parent-Owned Shares_. Each Share held
in the treasury of the Company or owned by any direct or indirect wholly-owned
Company Subsidiary and each Share owned by Purchaser, Parent or any direct or
indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall automatically be cancelled without any conversion thereof and no
payment or distribution shall be made with respect thereto (other than any
Share owned by any direct or indirect wholly-owned Company Subsidiary, which

the Surviving Company so as to maintain the same relative ownership
percentage).

 

(c) _Shares of Purchaser_. Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per
share, of Purchaser issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the
Surviving Company.

 



16 SECTION 3.09 _Exchange of Certificates_.

 

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Acceptance Time, Parent shall (i) appoint a
bank or trust company approved (such approval not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed) in advance by the Company to act as agent
(the " _Paying Agent_ ") for the purpose of effecting payments (A) to the
holders of Shares entitled to receive the Offer Price pursuant to  _Section_
__ _ 2.01(a)_ and (B) to the holders of Shares entitled to receive the Merger
Consideration pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.08(a)_, and (ii) enter into a
paying agent agreement, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the
Company, with such Paying Agent for the payment of the Offer Price and Merger
Consideration in accordance with this Agreement. Promptly following the
Acceptance Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with
the Paying Agent, for the benefit of the holders of Shares validly tendered
and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer, cash in an amount sufficient to pay
the aggregate Offer Price required to be paid pursuant to  _Section_ __ _
2.01(e)_. On or prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall deposit, or shall
cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent, for the benefit of the holders
of Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time,
cash in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration
required to be paid pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.08(a)_ (such cash, together
with the amount deposited pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence,
being hereinafter referred to as the " _Payment Fund_ "). The Payment Fund
shall not be used for any other purpose. The Payment Fund shall be invested by
the Paying Agent as directed by Parent; _provided_ , _ _ _however_ , that
such investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States
of America or any agency or instrumentality thereof and backed by the full
faith and credit of the United States of America, in commercial
paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service,
Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively, or in certificates
of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial
banks with capital exceeding $10 billion (based on the most recent financial
statements of such bank which are then publicly available), or a combination
of the foregoing. Any net profit resulting from, or interest or income
produced by, such investments shall be payable to or at the direction of the
Surviving Company. To the extent that there are losses with respect to such
investments, or the Payment Fund diminishes for other reasons below the level
required to make prompt payments of the Merger Consideration as contemplated
hereby, Parent shall promptly replace or restore the portion of the Payment
Fund lost through investments or other events so as to ensure that the
Payment Fund is, at all times, maintained at a level sufficient to make such
payments.

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time (and in no event
later than two (2) Business Days thereafter), Parent shall cause to be mailed
to each person who was, at the Effective Time, a holder of record of Shares
entitled to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section_ __ _
3.08(a)_: (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall be in customary form and
shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
the Shares shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Shares to the Paying
Agent) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
certificates evidencing such Shares (each, a " _Certificate_ " and, together,
the " _Certificates_ ") or the non-certificated Shares represented by book-
entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon
surrender of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.09(e)_) to the Paying Agent for cancellation,
together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed
in

 



17  accordance with the instructions thereto (and such other documents as may
customarily be required by the Paying Agent), the holder of such Shares shall
be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration which
such holder has the right to receive pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.08(a)_, and
the Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. In the event of
a transfer of ownership of Shares that is not registered in the transfer
records of the Company, payment of the Merger Consideration may be made to a
person other than the person in whose name the Certificate or Book-Entry Share
so surrendered is registered if the Certificate or Book-Entry Share
representing such Shares shall be presented to the Paying Agent, accompanied
by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer or otherwise be
in proper form for transfer, and the person requesting such payment shall pay
any transfer or other taxes required solely by reason of the payment of the
Merger Consideration to a person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share or establish to the reasonable satisfaction of
Parent that such tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 3.09_, each Certificate or Book-Entry
Share shall be deemed at all times after the Effective Time to represent only
the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration to which
the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share is entitled pursuant to
this _Article III_. No interest shall be paid or will accrue on any cash
payable to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares pursuant to the
provisions of this _Article III_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this _Section_ __ _ 3.09(b)_, any holder of Book-Entry Shares shall not be
required to deliver a Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the
Paying Agent to receive the Merger Consideration that such holder is entitled
to receive pursuant to this _Article III_. In lieu thereof, each registered
holder of one or more Book-Entry Shares shall upon receipt by the Paying
Agent of an "agents" message in customary form (or such other evidence, if
any, as the Paying Agent may reasonably require) be entitled to receive, and
the Surviving Company shall cause the Paying Agent to pay and deliver as soon
as reasonably practicable after receipt of such agents message (or such other
evidence, if any, as the Paying Agent may reasonably require), the Merger
Consideration for each Book-Entry Share.

 

(c) _No Further Rights_. From and after the Effective Time, holders of Shares
shall cease to have any rights as stockholders of the Company, except as
provided herein or by Law.

(d) _Termination of Payment Fund_. Any portion of the Payment Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of Shares twelve (12) months after the
Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Company, upon demand, and
any holders of Shares who have not theretofore complied with this _Article
III_ shall thereafter look only to Parent or the Surviving Company for, and
Parent and the Surviving Company shall remain liable for, payment of their
claim for the Merger Consideration. Any portion of the Payment Fund remaining
unclaimed by holders of Shares as of a date which is immediately prior to
such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any
Governmental Authority shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
become the property of Parent free and clear of any claims or interest of any
person previously entitled thereto. Neither Parent nor the Surviving Company
shall be liable to any person in respect of any Merger Consideration delivered
to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat
or similar Law.

(e) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, then upon (i) the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, and (ii) if
required by the Surviving Company, an

 



18  indemnity bond in form and substance and with surety reasonably satisfactory
to the Surviving Company, the Paying Agent shall pay in respect of such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration to which the holder
thereof is entitled pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.08(a)_.

SECTION 3.10  _Stock Transfer Books_. At the close of business on the day of
the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed
and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of Shares
on the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders
of Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to
have any rights with respect to such Shares, except as otherwise provided in
this Agreement or by Law. On or after the Effective Time, any Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares presented to the Paying Agent or Parent for any reason shall
be cancelled against delivery of the Merger Consideration to which the holders
thereof are entitled pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 3.08(a)_.

SECTION 3.11 _Company Stock Options, Restricted Shares, Performance_ _Shares
and Restricted Stock Units_.

(a) At the Effective Time,

 

(i) each outstanding option (each, a " _Company Stock Option_ ") to purchase
Shares granted under the Company Stock Plans that is outstanding and
unexercised as of the Effective Time and has an exercise price per Share
subject to the Company Stock Option equal to or greater than the Merger
Consideration (each, an " _Underwater Stock Option_ ") shall be cancelled as

(ii) (A) each holder of a Company Stock Option that is outstanding, vested
and exercisable as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (or that vests

_Vested Company Stock Options_ "), and has an exercise price per Share that is
less than the Merger Consideration, shall be paid by the Surviving Company
immediately after the Effective Time (and in no event later than five (5)
calendar days following the Effective Time), in exchange for the cancellation
of such Vested Company Stock Option, an amount in cash, without interest,
equal to the product of (x) the amount by which the Merger Consideration
exceeds the applicable exercise price per Share of such Company Stock Option
(the " _Stock Option Merger Consideration_ "), and (y) the aggregate number
of Shares issuable upon exercise of such Company Stock Option, and (B) each
Company Stock Option that is not a Vested Company Stock Option nor an
Underwater Stock Option  _(_ collectively, the " _Unvested Company Stock
Options_ "), shall be converted into the right of the holder to receive, on
the first payroll date following each applicable vesting date, an amount in
cash, without interest, equal to the product of (x) the Stock Option Merger
Consideration and (y) the aggregate number of Shares subject to the Unvested
Company Stock Option that would have vested on the applicable vesting date
(collectively, the " _Stock Option Restricted Cash_ "). The holders shall
have no rights under the Company Stock Option agreement following such
conversion. The Stock Option Restricted Cash shall have the same vesting

extent applicable, will be subject to all of the terms and conditions of the
Company Stock Plan, grant agreements and any other agreements governing

Effective Time in accordance with its terms) (collectively, the " _Vested
Restricted Shares_ "), shall be cancelled in exchange for the right of the
holder to receive, immediately after the Effective Time (and in no event later
than five (5) calendar days following the Effective Time), an amount in cash,
without interest, equal to the product of (A) the Merger Consideration and
(B) the aggregate number of Vested Restricted Shares and (ii) each Restricted
Share that is not a Vested Restricted Share (collectively, the " _Unvested
Restricted Shares_ "), shall be converted into the right of the holder to
receive, on the first payroll date following each applicable vesting date, an
amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product of (A) the Merger
Consideration and (B) the aggregate number of Unvested Restricted Shares that
would have vested on the applicable vesting date (collectively, the "
_Restricted Share Restricted Cash_ "). The holders shall have no rights under
the Restricted Share agreement following such conversion. The Restricted
Share Restricted Cash shall have the same vesting schedule and acceleration
provisions as the Restricted Shares and will, to the extent applicable, be
subject to all of the terms and conditions of the Company Stock Plan, grant
agreements and any other agreements governing the Restricted Shares as in
effect on the date hereof. All such payments set forth in this _Section_ __ _
3.11(b)_ shall be payable by the Surviving Company and subject to
all applicable Tax withholding requirements.

(c) At the Effective Time, (i) each Share subject to performance-based
restrictions (each, a " _Performance Share_ ") granted under the Company
Stock Plans and outstanding and vested as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time (or that vests upon the Effective Time in accordance with its
terms) (collectively, the " _Vested Performance Shares_ "), shall be
cancelled in exchange for the right of the holder to receive, immediately
after the Effective Time (and in no event later than five (5) calendar days
following the Effective Time), an amount in cash, without interest, equal to
the product of (A) the Merger Consideration and (B) the aggregate number of
Vested Performance Shares, assuming maximum performance of performance
criteria and (ii) each Performance Share that is not a Vested Performance
Share (collectively, the " _Unvested Performance Shares_ "), shall be
converted into the right of the holder to receive, on the first payroll date
following each applicable vesting date, an amount in cash, without interest,
equal to the product of (A) the Merger Consideration and (B) the aggregate
number of Unvested Performance Shares that would have vested on the applicable
vesting date, assuming maximum performance of performance criteria
(collectively, the " _Performance Share Restricted Cash_ "). The holders shall
have no rights under the Performance Share agreement following such
conversion. The Performance Share Restricted Cash shall have the same
vesting schedule and acceleration provisions as the Performance Shares
(provided that the performance vesting criteria will no longer apply to the
Performance Share Restricted Cash) and will, to the extent applicable, be
subject to all of the terms and conditions of the Company Stock Plan, grant
agreements and any other agreements governing the Performance Shares as in
effect on the date hereof. All such payments set forth in this _Section_ __ _
3.11(c)_ shall be payable by the Surviving Company and subject to all
applicable Tax withholding requirements.

(d) At the Effective Time, (i) each restricted stock unit (each, a "
_Restricted Stock Unit_ ") that is subject to a Restricted Stock Unit award

cash, without interest, equal to the product of (A) the Merger Consideration

 



20  and (B) the aggregate number of Shares subject to such Vested Restricted
Stock Units and (ii) each Restricted Stock Unit that is not a Vested
Restricted Stock Unit (collectively, the " _Unvested Restricted Stock Units_

Company Stock Plan, grant agreements and any other agreements governing the
Restricted Stock Units as in effect on the date hereof. All such payments
set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 3.11(d)_ shall be payable by the Surviving
Company and be subject to all applicable Tax withholding requirements.

 

(e) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all steps reasonably
necessary to cause the Transactions and any other dispositions of Shares or
other equity securities of the Company (including derivative securities) in
connection with this Agreement by each person who is a director or officer of
the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act,
as amended. At the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions
necessary to terminate the Company Stock Plans and to resolve to treat the
outstanding awards in accordance with this  _Section_ __ _ 3.11_. All
actions taken under this _Section_ __ _ 3.11_ shall be done in compliance
with Section 409A of the Code, to the extent necessary.

 

SECTION 3.12 _Certain Adjustments_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if between
the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time the outstanding Shares
shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a different
class, by reason of any stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification,
recapitalization, split, combination, consolidation or exchange of shares, or
any similar event shall have occurred, then the Offer Price, the Merger
Consideration and any other amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement shall
be appropriately adjusted to provide the holders of Shares the same economic
effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.

SECTION 3.13 _Dissenting Shares_. (a) Notwithstanding any provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, Shares that are outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time and that are held by stockholders who are entitled to
demand and who shall have demanded properly in writing appraisal for such
Shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (collectively, the "
_Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into, or represent the right to
receive, the Merger Consideration, unless such holder fails to perfect,
withdraws or otherwise loses the right to appraisal. Such stockholders shall
be entitled only to such rights granted to them under the DGCL, except that
all Dissenting Shares held by stockholders who shall have failed to perfect or
who effectively shall have withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal of
such Shares under such Section 262 shall thereupon be deemed to have been
converted into, and to have become exchangeable for, as of the Effective Time,
the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon,
upon surrender, in the manner provided in _Section_ __ _ 3.09_, of the
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares that formerly evidenced such Shares.

 



21 (b) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice and copies of any demands
for appraisal received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands, and any
other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company and
(ii) the opportunity to direct and control all negotiations and proceedings
with respect to demands for appraisal under the DGCL; _provided_ that until
the Effective Time, Parent shall consult with the Company with respect
thereto. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of
Parent, make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal or offer
to settle or settle any such demands.

Company, Purchaser and Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from
the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder
of Shares, Company Stock Options, Restricted Shares, Performance Shares or
Restricted Stock Units such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold
with respect to such payment under all applicable Tax laws and pay such
withholding amount over to the appropriate Governmental Authority. To the
extent that amounts are so properly withheld and timely paid over to the
appropriate Governmental Authority by the Paying Agent, the Surviving Company,
Purchaser or Parent, as the case may be, such withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder
of the Shares, Company Stock Options, Restricted Shares, Performance Shares or
Restricted Stock Units in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made by the Paying Agent, the Surviving Company, Purchaser or Parent, as the
case may be.

ARTICLE IV

contained under the heading "Risk Factors" (other than any factual information
contained therein) or "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market
Risk" and any disclosure of risks explicitly included in any "forward-looking
statements" disclaimer and any other disclosures contained or referenced
therein of information, factors or risks that are cautionary, predictive or
forward-looking in nature (other than any factual information
contained therein)), the Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent and
Purchaser as follows:

SECTION 4.01 _Organization and Qualification; Company Subsidiaries_.

(a) Each of the Company and each Company Subsidiary is a corporation, exempted

requisite power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to
carry on its business as it is now being conducted, except (other than with
respect to the Companys due organization, valid existence, good standing and
power and authority) where the failure to be so duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing would not have a Material Adverse Effect. Each
of the Company and each Company Subsidiary is duly qualified or licensed as a
foreign legal entity to do business, and is in good standing, in each 

 



22  jurisdiction where the character of the properties owned, leased or operated
by it or the nature of its business makes such qualification or licensing
necessary, except for such failures to be so qualified or licensed and in
good standing that would not have a Material Adverse Effect.

(b) Section 4.01(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true and
complete list of all the Subsidiaries of the Company (each a " _Company
Subsidiary_ "), together with the jurisdiction of organization of each Company
Subsidiary and the percentage of the outstanding share capital or other
equity or voting interests of each Company Subsidiary owned by the Company and
each other Company Subsidiary. The Company does not directly or indirectly own

incorporation and by-laws (or equivalent organizational documents) is in
full force and effect. The Company is not in violation of any provisions of
the Company Charter or the Company By-laws. None of the Company Subsidiaries
is in violation of any of the provisions of its certificate of incorporation
and by-laws (or equivalent organizational documents), except for violations
that would not have a Material Adverse Effect.

 

SECTION 4.03 _Capitalization_.

 

(a) The authorized share capital of the Company consists of (i) 650,000,000
Shares and (ii) 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per

(b) As of July 21, 2017, (i) 37,916,825 Shares (including 632,518 Restricted

is vested and/or exercisable, the date of grant or issuance, the exercise
price (if any) and the vesting schedule and expiration date of each award. As
of July 21, 2017, and without giving effect to the Transactions, there were
outstanding $400,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 2.50% Convertible

corporation, have received and accepted (i) an executed commitment letter
dated July 24, 2017 from the lenders party thereto (collectively, the "
_Lenders_ ") pursuant to which the Lenders have committed, subject to the
terms and conditions thereof, to provide the debt financing in the amounts
set forth therein at or prior to the Closing (the " _Debt Financing_ ") for
the purpose of funding the Transactions and the related fees and expenses
thereto, together with any fee letters related thereto (with customary
redactions for fee amounts, pricing cap and "market flex" related solely to
economic terms) (including all exhibits, schedules, and annexes thereto, and
the redacted executed fee letters associated therewith, collectively, the "
_Debt Commitment Letter_ ") and (ii) an executed equity commitment letter
dated July 24, 2017 (the " _Equity Commitment Letter_ " and, together with the
Debt Commitment Letter, the " _Commitment Letters_ ") from KKR North America
Fund XI L.P. (the " _Sponsor_ "), pursuant to which the Sponsor has agreed,
subject to the terms and conditions thereof, to invest in Parent the amount
set forth therein (the " _Equity Financing_ "). The Equity Commitment Letter
provides that the Company is a third party beneficiary thereof and is entitled
to enforce such agreement, in each case, solely to the extent set forth
therein. The Debt Financing pursuant to the Debt Commitment Letter and the
Equity Financing pursuant to the Equity Commitment Letter are collectively
referred to in this Agreement as the " _Financing_." Purchaser has delivered
to the Company true, complete and correct copies of the executed Commitment
Letters and any fee letters related thereto (with any fee letters related to
the Debt Financing being subject to customary redactions of fee amounts,
pricing caps and "market flex" related solely to economic terms). 

(b) Except as expressly set forth in the Commitment Letters, there are no
conditions precedent to the obligations of the Lenders and the Sponsor to
provide the Financing or any contingencies that would permit the Lenders or
the Sponsor to reduce the total amount of the Financing. As of the date
hereof, assuming the satisfaction of the Offer Conditions, Parent and
Purchaser do not have any reason to believe that any of the conditions to the
Financing applicable to them will not be satisfied or that the Financing will
not be available to Purchaser on or prior to the Closing Date.

 

(c) Assuming the satisfaction of the Offer Conditions and the Financing is
funded in accordance with the Commitment Letters, Purchaser will have,
together with cash on hand of the Company, cash proceeds at the Closing (after
netting out applicable fees, expenses, original issue discount and similar
premiums and charges under the Commitment Letters and any fee letters related
thereto) sufficient for Purchaser and the Surviving Company to pay the
aggregate Offer Price and the aggregate Merger Consideration, any prepayment,
repayment, refinancing or conversion of debt contemplated by this Agreement,
including in respect of the Convertible Securities, amounts payable pursuant
to _Section_ __ _ 3.11_ and any fees and expenses of or payable by Parent or
Purchaser in connection with the Transactions and the Financing (such amount
collectively, the " _Required Amount_ ").

 



41 (d) As of the date of this Agreement, the Commitment Letters are (i) legal,
valid and binding obligations of Parent and Purchaser and (in the case of the
Debt Commitment Letter, to the knowledge of Parent) of each of the other
parties thereto (subject to the effect of any Laws relating to bankruptcy,
reorganization, insolvency, moratorium, fraudulent conveyance or preferential
transfers, or similar Laws relating to or affecting creditors rights
generally and subject, as to enforceability, to the effect of general
principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered
in an Action in equity or at law)) and (ii) in full force and effect. As of
the date hereof, assuming the accuracy of the Companys representations and
warranties in _Article IV_ , in all material respects, no event has occurred
that, with or without notice, lapse of time, or both, would reasonably be
expected to (i) constitute a default or breach or a failure to satisfy a
condition precedent on the part of Parent or Purchaser under the terms
and conditions of the Commitment Letters or (ii) to the knowledge of Parent
and Purchaser, result in any portion of the Financing being unavailable on the
Closing Date. As of the date of this Agreement, assuming the accuracy of the
Companys representations and warranties in _Article IV_ , in all material
respects, Parent is not aware of any fact or occurrence that makes any of the
representations or warranties of Parent or Purchaser, in any of the Commitment
Letters inaccurate in any material respect. Parent or Purchaser has paid in
full any and all commitment fees or other fees required to be paid pursuant to
the terms of the Commitment Letters on or before the date of this Agreement,
and will pay in full any such amounts due at or prior to the Acceptance Time
and on or prior to the Closing Date. As of the date of this Agreement, none of
the Commitment Letters have been modified, amended or altered, and none of the
commitments under any of the Commitment Letters have been withdrawn,
terminated, amended, modified or rescinded in any respect. As of the date of
this Agreement, there are no side letters or other agreements, Contracts or
arrangements to which Parent, Purchaser or any of their respective Affiliates
is a party related to the funding or investing, as applicable, of the full
amount of the Financing that could affect the availability of the Financing in
an amount required to pay the Required Amount.

 

(e) The Merger constitutes a "Permitted Acquisition", a "Permitted Investment"
and a "Limited Condition Acquisition" under and as defined in each of the
Existing Credit Agreements. As of the date hereof the Existing Borrowers have
made an "LCA Election" (pursuant to and as defined under each of the Existing
Credit Agreements) with respect to the Merger and have taken all action
necessary to designate the Transactions as a "Limited Condition Acquisition"
(under and as defined under each of the Existing Credit Agreements), and from
and after the date hereof the Existing Borrowers will not take any action to
alter or rescind such LCA Election or such designation. No consent, waiver,
amendment or other modification to either of the Existing Credit Agreements or
to any of the other "Credit Documents" (as defined in each of the Existing
Credit Agreements) is necessary in connection with the Merger or the
consummation thereof (including, without limitation, the funding of the
Financing contemplated by the Commitment Letters) or the incurrence and
implementation of the Incremental Facilities (as defined in the Debt
Commitment Letters), the commitments in respect thereof and the funding
thereof on the Closing Date, other than (x) amendments to each of the Existing
Credit Agreements necessary to implement the "Incremental Facilities" (as
defined in the Debt Commitment Letter) (the " _Incremental Implementing
Amendments_ "), which Incremental Implementing Amendments will not require the
consent of any person other than the

 



42  Lenders party to the Debt Commitment Letter and the Existing Borrowers and
(y) the conditions precedent to the funding of the Debt Financing expressly
set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter. The Existing Credit Agreements are
(i) the legal valid and binding obligations of the Parents and the Borrowers
and (to the best of Purchaser and Parents knowledge) of each of the other
parties thereto and (ii) in full force and effect. The Existing Borrowers are
in compliance with all conditions necessary under the Existing Credit
Agreements for consummation of the Transactions (including the incurrence of
the full amount of the Debt Financing), including, for the avoidance of
doubt, compliance with all applicable ratios, incurrence tests, baskets and
other similar requirements. As of the date hereof, no event has occurred that,
with or without notice, lapse or time or both, would reasonably be expected
to constitute a default or breach under the Existing Credit Agreements or any
of the other Credit Documents (as defined in each of the Existing Credit
Agreements).

 

(f) In no event shall the receipt or availability of any funds or financing
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Financing) by Parent, Purchaser
or any Affiliate or any other financing or other transactions be a condition
to any of Parents or Purchasers obligations hereunder.

 

SECTION 5.09 _Solvency_. On the Closing Date, immediately after giving effect
to the consummation of the Transactions (including the payment of the
aggregate Offer Price and Merger Consideration, any other payments in respect
of prepayment, repayment, refinancing or conversion of debt contemplated by
this Agreement (including in respect of the Convertible Securities),
the Financing and payment of all related fees and expenses) and assuming (a)
the satisfaction of the Offer Conditions, (b) the accuracy in all material
respects of the representations and warranties contained in _Article IV_ (for
such purposes, without giving effect to any "Knowledge" or "Material Adverse
Effect" qualifications or exceptions therein), and (c) the estimates,
projections or forecasts provided by or on behalf of the Company or the
Company Subsidiaries to Parent or Purchaser prior to the date hereof have
been prepared in good faith on assumptions that were, and continue to be,
reasonable, at and immediately after the Closing and (d) immediately prior to
the Effective Time the Company is Solvent, the Surviving Company will be
Solvent as of immediately after the Effective Time. For purposes of this
Agreement, " _Solvent_ " means that, with respect to any person, as of any
date of determination, (a) the amount by which the "fair saleable value" of
the assets of such person will, as of such date, exceed the sum of (i) the
value of all "liabilities of such person including contingent and other
liabilities," as of such date, as such quoted terms are generally determined
in accordance with applicable Laws governing determination of the insolvency
of debtors, and (ii) the amount that will be required to pay the probable
liabilities of such person, as of such date, on its existing debts (including
contingent and other liabilities) as such debts become absolute and mature,
(b) such person will not have, as of such date, an unreasonably small amount
of capital for the operation of the businesses in which it is engaged or
proposed to be engaged following such date and (c) such person will be able to
pay its liabilities, as of such date, including contingent and other
liabilities, as they mature.

 

SECTION 5.10 _Guarantee_. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement,
Parent and Purchaser have delivered to the Company the guarantee addressed to
the Company from the Sponsor, guaranteeing certain obligations of Parent and
Purchaser under this Agreement on the terms set forth therein (the "
_Guarantee_ "). As of the date hereof, the Guarantee is valid and in full
force and effect and constitutes the valid and binding obligation of the
Sponsor, enforceable in accordance with its terms. As of the date hereof, no
event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would
constitute a default on the part of the Sponsor under the Guarantee.

 



43 SECTION 5.11 _Offer Documents_. Neither the Offer Documents nor any
information supplied by Parent or Purchaser for inclusion or incorporation by
reference in Schedule 14D-9 shall, at the time the Offer Documents (or any
amendments or supplements thereto) are filed with the SEC or are first
published, sent or given to stockholders of the Company, as the case may be,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent and Purchaser make
no representation or warranty with respect to any information supplied by the
Company or any of its representatives for inclusion in any of the foregoing
documents or the Offer Documents. The Offer Documents (including any
amendments or supplements thereto) shall comply in all material respects as to
form with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
thereunder.

SECTION 5.12 _Brokers_. The Company will not be responsible prior to the
Effective Time for any brokerage, finders or other fee or commission to any
broker, finder or investment banker in connection with the Transactions based

to the Company Board to the extent the Company Board determines in good faith
(after consultation with its outside legal counsel) that its failure to do so
would be reasonably expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
under applicable Law; _provided_ , _further_ , that, prior to the Acceptance
Time, nothing contained in this Agreement shall, and Parent and Purchaser
shall have no right to, prevent the Company or the Company Board from
furnishing information to, or engaging in discussions or negotiations with,

faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel) that its failure to
take such actions would be reasonably expected to be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law, and (B) the Company receives from such

provide Parent notice of (A) the receipt of any Acquisition Proposal and (B)
any written inquiries, proposals or offers received by, or any discussions or

an Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall promptly (and in any event within
forty-eight hours), following a determination by the Company Board that an

determination.

or exchange offer subject to Regulation 14D under the Exchange Act within five
(5) Business Days after the commencement of such Acquisition Proposal (any
such action, an " _Adverse Recommendation Change_ ") or (ii) except as
expressly permitted by, and after compliance with, _Section_ __ _ 7.02(e)_
hereof, enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding,
agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement or other
similar agreement (other than a confidentiality agreement referred to in
_Section_ __ _ 7.02(b)_ entered into in compliance with this _Section_ __ _
7.02(d)_) (an " _Alternative Acquisition Agreement_ ") relating to any
Acquisition Proposal or otherwise resolve or agree to do so.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, prior to the
Acceptance Time, the Company Board may (1) effect an Adverse Recommendation
Change or cause the Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 9.01(d)(ii)_ and enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement if the
Company receives an unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal not resulting
from a breach of this _Section_ __ _ 7.02_ that the Company Board determines
in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal and financial
advisors) is a Superior Proposal and determines in good faith
(after consultation with its outside legal counsel) that its failure to take
such actions would be reasonably expected to be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law or (2) effect an Adverse Recommendation
Change if an Intervening Event occurs and as a result thereof the Company
Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal
counsel) that the failure to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change would be
reasonably expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law; _provided_ that:

(i) prior to effecting an Adverse Recommendation Change with respect to a
Superior Proposal or authorizing a termination of this Agreement pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 9.01(d)(ii)_, (A) the Company has notified Parent in writing
that it intends to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change, (B) the Company
has provided Parent a

 



49  summary of the material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal
(including the consideration offered therein and the identity of the person or
group of persons making the Superior Proposal) and unredacted copies of the
Alternative Acquisition Agreement and all other documents related to the
Superior Proposal, (C) if requested to do so by Parent, for a period of four
(4) Business Days following delivery of such notice, the Company shall have
discussed and negotiated in good faith, and shall have made its
Representatives available to discuss and negotiate in good faith, with
Parents Representatives, any bona fide proposed modifications to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, and (D) no earlier than the end of
such four (4) Business Day period, the Company Board shall have concluded,
after considering the terms of any proposed amendment or modification to this
Agreement proposed by Parent during such four (4) Business Day period and in
consultation with its outside legal and financial advisors, that such Superior
Proposal still constitutes a Superior Proposal (it being understood and agreed
that any change to the financial or other material terms of a proposal that
was previously the subject of a notice hereunder shall require a new notice to
Parent as provided above, but with respect to any such subsequent notice
references herein to a "four (4) Business Day period" shall be deemed
references to a "three (3) Business Day period"); and

 

(ii) prior to effecting an Adverse Recommendation Change with respect to an
Intervening Event, (A) the Company has notified Parent in writing that it
intends to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change, describing in reasonable
detail the reasons for such Adverse Recommendation Change, (B) if requested to
do so by Parent, for a period of four (4) Business Days following delivery of
such notice, the Company shall have discussed and negotiated in good faith,
and shall have made its Representatives available to discuss and negotiate in
good faith, with Parents Representatives any bona fide proposed
modifications to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and (C) no earlier
than the end of such four (4) Business Day period, the Company Board shall
have determined in good faith, after considering the terms of any proposed
amendment or modification to this Agreement proposed by Parent during such
four (4) Business Day period, that the failure to effect an Adverse
Recommendation Change would still be reasonably expected to be inconsistent
with the Company Boards fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

(f) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent the Company or the
Company Board from (i) issuing a "stop, look and listen" communication
pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f), making a statement contemplated by Item 1012(a) of
Regulation M-A under the Exchange Act or otherwise complying with Rule 14d-9
and Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange Act with respect to an Acquisition Proposal
or (ii) making any disclosure to the Companys stockholders if the Company
Board determines (after consultation with its outside legal counsel) that its
failure to do so would be reasonably expected to be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided_ that any Adverse
Recommendation Change may only be made in accordance with _Section_ __ _
7.02(e)_. For the avoidance of doubt, a factually accurate public statement
that describes the Companys receipt of an Acquisition Proposal and the
operation of this Agreement with respect thereto shall not be deemed an
Adverse Recommendation Change; _provided_ that the Company Board expressly
publicly reaffirms the Company Board Recommendation in such disclosure (other
than a customary "stop-look-and-listen" communication to the stockholders of
the Company pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act) if required
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.02(d)_.

Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (B) more than 20% of any class of equity
securities or voting power of the Company; (2) any tender offer or
exchange offer, as defined pursuant to the Exchange Act, that if consummated
would result in any person beneficially owning 20% or more of any class of
equity securities or voting power of the Company; or (3) any merger,
consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation,
dissolution or other similar transaction involving the Company.

(ii) " _Intervening Event_ " means any positive material event, circumstance,
change, effect, development or condition (other than an Acquisition Proposal
or Superior Proposal) occurring or arising after the date of this Agreement

if known, the magnitude or consequences of which were not known or reasonably
foreseeable by the Company Board as of the date of this Agreement).

 

(iii) " _Superior Proposal_ " means any bona fide written Acquisition Proposal
that (1) relates to more than 50% of the outstanding Shares, voting power or
assets of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries taken as a whole, and (2)
the Company Board determines in good faith (after receiving the advice of its
financial advisor and outside legal counsel and after taking into account all
the terms and conditions of the Acquisition Proposal and the legal, financial
(including financing terms), regulatory, timing and other aspects of such
Acquisition Proposal (x) is reasonably capable of being consummated in
accordance with its terms and (y) if consummated would result in a
transaction) more favorable to the Companys stockholders, from a financial
point of view, than the Transactions (taking into account any
proposed amendment or modification proposed by Parent pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 7.02(e)(i)_).

SECTION 7.03  _Directors_ __ _and Officers_ __ _Indemnification and
Insurance_. (a) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Company and

respects the obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries under any and all
indemnification agreements between the Company or any Company Subsidiary and
any of their respective present or former directors and officers
(collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ "). In addition, the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Company shall contain provisions no
less favorable with respect to exculpation and indemnification than are set
forth in the Company Charter or the Company By-laws, which provisions shall
not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six years from
the Effective Time in any manner that would affect adversely the rights
thereunder of individuals who, at or prior to the Effective Time, were
directors, officers, employees, fiduciaries or agents of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary.

 



 



51 (b) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Company shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to, to the
fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, indemnify and hold harmless
each Indemnified Party against all costs and expenses (including attorneys
fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and settlement
amounts paid in connection with any Action (whether arising before or after
the Effective Time), whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative,
arising out of or relating to any action or omission in their capacity as an
officer, director, employee, fiduciary or agent of the Company or its
Subsidiaries, whether occurring on or before the Effective Time. To the
fullest extent permitted by Law, the Surviving Company shall, and Parent shall
cause the Surviving Company to, pay all expenses of each Indemnified Party in
advance of the final disposition of any such Action, subject to receipt of an
undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined in
accordance with applicable Law that such Indemnified Party is not entitled to
indemnification. In the event of any such Action, (i) the Surviving Company
shall have the right to control the defense thereof and the Indemnified
Parties shall cooperate with the Surviving Company in such defense, (ii) the
Surviving Company shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to, pay
the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel selected by the Indemnified
Parties, which counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Surviving
Company, promptly after statements therefor are received, (iii) neither Parent
nor the Surviving Company shall settle, compromise or consent to the entry of
any judgment in any pending or threatened Action to which an
Indemnified Party is a party (and in respect of which indemnification could
be sought by such Indemnified Party hereunder), unless such settlement,
compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified
Party from all liability arising out of such Action or such Indemnified Party
otherwise consents, and (iv) Parent and the Surviving Company shall cooperate
in the defense of any such matter if the Surviving Company elects not to
assume the defense thereof; _provided_ , _ _ _however_ , that no Indemnified
Party shall effect any settlement, and neither Parent nor the Surviving
Company nor any of their Affiliates shall be liable for any settlement
effected, without the Surviving Companys written consent (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); and _provided_
___further_ that, in the event that any claim for indemnification is asserted
or made within such six-year period, all rights to indemnification in respect
of such claim shall continue until the disposition of such claim. The rights
of each Indemnified Party under this  _Section_ __ _ 7.03(b)_ shall be in
addition to any rights such person may have under the certificate of
incorporation or bylaws (or similar organizational documents) of the Company
and the Surviving Company or any of their Subsidiaries, or under any Law or
under any agreement of any Indemnified Party with the Company or any Company
Subsidiary.

occurred on or prior to the Effective Time; or (ii) maintain in effect for six
(6) years from the Effective Time, if available, the current directors and
officers liability insurance policies maintained by the Company; _provided_
that the Surviving Company may substitute therefor policies of at least the

52  with respect to matters occurring prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ ,
___however_ , that in no event shall the Surviving Company be required to
expend pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 7.03(c)_ more than an amount per
year equal to 300% of current annual premiums paid by the Company for such
insurance, which amounts are set forth on _Section_ __ _ 7.03(c)_ of the
Company Disclosure Schedule; _provided_ ___further_ that in the event of an
expiration, termination or cancellation of such current policies, the
Surviving Company shall be required to obtain as much coverage as is possible
under substantially similar policies for amounts not to exceed such maximum
annual amount in aggregate annual premiums.

(d) In the event Parent or the Surviving Company or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates or amalgamates with or merges into any
other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving company or entity of
such consolidation, amalgamation or merger, or (ii) transfers all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in
each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of Parent or the Surviving Company, as the case may be, shall succeed
to the obligations set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 7.03_.

(e) Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to perform all of the
obligations of the Surviving Company under this _Section_ __ _ 7.03_.

SECTION 7.04  _Employee Benefits Matters_. (a) Parent hereby agrees that, for

the aggregate, was provided to each such Employee immediately prior to the
Effective Time, and (ii) provide the Employees and their covered dependents
with employee benefits that are substantially similar in the aggregate than
those provided to such Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time.
From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Company
and its Subsidiaries to honor in accordance with their terms, all contracts,
agreements, arrangements, policies, plans and commitments of the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time
that are applicable to any current or former employees or directors of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary.

 

(b) Except to the extent necessary to avoid the duplication of benefits,
Employees shall receive credit for all purposes (including, for purposes of
eligibility to participate, vesting, benefit accrual and eligibility to
receive benefits, but excluding benefit accruals under any defined benefit
pension plan) under any employee benefit plan, program or arrangement
established or maintained by Parent, the Surviving Company or any of their
respective Subsidiaries under which each Employee may be eligible to
participate on or after the Effective Time to the same extent recognized by
the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries under comparable Plans
immediately prior to the Effective Time. Such plan, program or arrangement
shall credit each such Employee for service accrued or deemed accrued on or
prior to the Effective Time with the Company, any Company Subsidiary and all
Affiliates where service with the Affiliate was credited under a comparable
Plan of the Company prior to the Effective Time.

 



53 (c) With respect to the welfare benefit plans, programs and arrangements
maintained, sponsored or contributed to by Parent or the Surviving Company ("
_Purchaser Welfare Benefit Plans_ ") in which an Employee may be eligible to

covered dependent for any co-payments, deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses
paid by such Employee or covered dependent under the Plans during the relevant
plan year, up to and including the Effective Time.

(d) The provisions contained in this _Section_ __ _ 7.04_ are included
for the sole benefit of the parties hereto, and nothing in this _Section_ __
_ 7.04_, whether express or implied, shall create any third party beneficiary
or other rights in any other person, including, without limitation,
any employees, former employees, any participant in any Plan or other benefit
plan or arrangement, or any dependent or beneficiary thereof, or any right to
continued employment with the Company, the Company Subsidiaries, Parent, the
Surviving Company or any of their respective Affiliates. Nothing contained
herein, whether express or implied, shall be treated as an amendment or other
modification of any Plan or other employee benefit plan or arrangement, or
shall limit the right of the Company, the Company Subsidiaries, Parent, the
Surviving Company or any of their respective Affiliates to amend, terminate or
otherwise modify any Plan or other employee benefit plan or arrangement in
accordance with its terms.

 

SECTION 7.05 _Further Action_. (a) (i) Parent and the Company, as applicable,
shall use reasonable best efforts to promptly obtain all authorizations,
consents, Orders, approvals, licenses, permits, and waivers of all
Governmental Authorities that may be or become necessary for its execution and
delivery of, and the performance of its obligations pursuant to,
this Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions, (ii) each of Parent
and the Company shall (A) cooperate fully with the other party in promptly
seeking to obtain all such authorizations, consents, Orders, approvals,
licenses, permits and waivers, (B) provide such other information to any
Governmental Authority as such Governmental Authority may lawfully request in
connection herewith and (iii) Parent and the Company, as applicable, shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all necessary consents, approvals
or waivers from third parties; _provided_ , _however_ , that neither party
shall be obligated to make any payments or otherwise pay any consideration to
any third party to obtain any applicable consents, approvals or waivers
pursuant to this clause (iii). As promptly as reasonably practicable, but in
any event no later than ten (10) Business Days, following the date of this
Agreement, each party shall make its respective filing, if necessary,
pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the Transactions and shall supply as
promptly as reasonably practicable thereafter to the appropriate Governmental
Authorities any additional information and documentary material that may be
requested pursuant to the HSR Act. Each party hereto agrees to, and shall
cause its respective Affiliates to, make as promptly as practicable (and in
any event within ten (10) Business Days) after the date of this Agreement its
respective filings and notifications, if any, required to obtain the
Transaction Approvals pursuant to any other Antitrust Law identified on
_Section_ __ _ 7.05_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, and to supply as
promptly as reasonably practicable to the appropriate Governmental
Authorities any additional information and material that may be requested
pursuant to the applicable Law. Parent will pay all filing fees or make other
payments to any Governmental Authority in order to make such filings or
obtain any such authorizations, consents, Orders or approvals.

 



54 (b) Without limiting the generality of the undertaking of Parent pursuant to 
_Section_ __ _ 7.05(a)_, Parent shall, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to, use their reasonable best efforts to take any and all steps
necessary to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under any Antitrust
Law that may be asserted by any Governmental Authority or any other party so
as to enable the parties hereto to consummate the Transactions as promptly as
practicable, and in any event prior to the Outside Date, including proposing,
negotiating, committing to and effecting, by consent decree, hold separate
orders, or otherwise, the sale, divestiture, license or other disposition of
such of its and their assets, properties or businesses or of the assets,
properties or businesses to be acquired by Parent pursuant hereto, and
entering into such other arrangements, as are necessary or advisable in order
to avoid the entry of, and the commencement of litigation seeking the entry
of, or to effect the dissolution of, any injunction, temporary restraining
order or other Order in any suit or proceeding that would otherwise have the
effect of materially delaying or preventing the consummation of the
Transactions. In addition, Parent shall bring or defend through litigation on
the merits any claim asserted in court by any party in order to avoid entry
of, or to have vacated or terminated, any Order (whether temporary,
preliminary or permanent) that would prevent the Closing prior to the Outside
Date; _provided_ , _ _ _however_ , that such obligation to litigate in no way
limits the obligation of Parent to use, and cause each of its Subsidiaries to
use, its and their reasonable best efforts, and to take any and all steps
necessary to eliminate each and every impediment under any Antitrust Law to
consummate the Transactions prior to the Outside Date. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, nothing in this _Section_ __ _
7.05_ or elsewhere in this Agreement shall require Parent to take or agree to
take any action with respect to any of its Affiliates (other than its
Subsidiaries, the Company and its Subsidiaries), including selling, divesting,
conveying, holding separate, or otherwise limiting its freedom of action with
respect to any assets, rights, products, licenses, businesses, operations, or
interest therein, of any such Affiliates (the Company and its Subsidiaries) or
any direct or indirect portfolio companies (as such term is understood in the
private equity industry) of investment funds advised or managed by one or more
Affiliates of Parent.

(c) Each party shall keep the other parties reasonably apprised of the
content and status of any communications with, and communications from, any
Governmental Authority with respect to the Transactions, including promptly
notifying the other parties hereto of any substantive communication it or any
of its Affiliates receives from any Governmental Authority relating to any
review or investigation of the Transactions under the HSR Act or any other
applicable Antitrust Laws and shall permit the other parties to review in
advance (and to consider in good faith any comments made by the other party in
relation to) any proposed substantive communication by such party to any
Governmental Authority relating to such matters. None of the parties to this
Agreement shall agree to participate in any substantive meeting, telephone
call or discussion with any Governmental Authority in respect of any
submissions, filings, investigation (including any settlement of the
investigation), litigation or other inquiry relating to the matters that are
the subject of this Agreement unless it consults with the other parties in
advance and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Authority, gives the
other parties the opportunity to attend and participate at such substantive
meeting, telephone call or discussion. The parties to this Agreement will
coordinate and cooperate fully with each other in exchanging such information
and providing such assistance as the other party may reasonably request in 

 



55  connection with the foregoing and in seeking early termination of any
applicable waiting periods, including under the HSR Act. The parties to this
Agreement shall provide each other with copies of all correspondence, filings
or communications between them or any of their representatives, on the one
hand, and any Governmental Authority or members of its staff, on the other
hand, with respect to this Agreement and the Transactions. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, Parent or Company may, as it deems advisable and necessary,
reasonably designate any competitively sensitive material provided to the
Company or Parent, as applicable, under this  _Section_ __ _ 7.05(c)_ as
"outside counsel only;" _provided_ , ___however_ , that materials may be
redacted (i) to remove references concerning the valuation of the Company,
(ii) as necessary to comply with contractual arrangements and (iii) as
necessary to address reasonable attorney-client or other privilege or
confidentiality concerns.

 

(d) None of (i) Parent, Purchaser, the Parents (as defined in each of the
Existing Credit Agreements as in effect on the date hereof) or any of their
controlled Affiliates shall enter into any agreement, transaction or any
agreement to effect any transaction (including any merger or acquisition) that
might reasonably be expected to make it more difficult, or to increase the
time required, to: (x) obtain the expiration or termination of the waiting
period under the HSR Act, or the authorizations, consents, Orders and
approvals required under any other applicable Antitrust Law, applicable to the
Transactions, (y) avoid the entry of, the commencement of litigation seeking
the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any injunction, temporary
restraining order or other Order that would materially delay or prevent the
consummation of the Transactions, or (z) obtain all authorizations, consents,
Orders and approvals of Governmental Authorities necessary for the
consummation of the Transactions; and (ii) except as contemplated by the
Transactions (as defined in the Debt Commitment Letter) as in effect on the
date hereof) and hereby, none of Purchaser, Parent, the Parents (as defined in
each of the Existing Credit Agreements as in effect on the date hereof), the
Existing Borrowers or any of their controlled Affiliates will merge or
amalgamate with, consolidate with, acquire all or substantially all of the
assets or stock or equity interests of, or otherwise combine, merge or
amalgamate with or acquire, any person or any operating division of
any person, if, after giving effect to any such merger, amalgamation,
consolidation, acquisition or combination on a pro forma basis, the
Consolidated Total Debt to Consolidated EBITDA Ratio (as defined in each of
the Existing Credit Agreements as in effect on the date hereof (but for
purposes of such calculation with the references to "Restricted Subsidiaries"
therein and in the component definitions thereof to be deemed to be references
to both "Restricted Subsidiaries" and "Unrestricted Subsidiaries", in each
case, under and as defined in the Existing Credit Agreements as in effect on
the date hereof) and measured for the most recent period of four consecutive
fiscal quarters ended prior to the date of such proposed transaction) would
be greater than the Consolidated Total Debt to Consolidated EBITDA Ratio (as
so defined and measured) prior to giving effect to such merger, amalgamation,
consolidation, acquisition or combination. Except (1) as required by
applicable Law or (2) with the prior written consent of the Company, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, during the
Pre-Closing Period, Parent shall not declare, set aside, establish a record
date for, make or pay any cash dividend with respect to any of its equity
interests.

 

SECTION 7.06 _Obligations of Parent and Purchaser_. Parent hereby guarantees
the due, prompt and faithful payment, performance and discharge by Purchaser
of, and the compliance by Purchaser with, all of the covenants, agreements,
obligations and undertakings of Purchaser under this Agreement in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement, and covenants 

 



56  and agrees to take all actions necessary or advisable to ensure such
payment, performance and discharge by Purchaser hereunder. During the Pre-
Closing Period, Purchaser shall not, and Parent shall not permit Purchaser
to, engage in any activity of any nature except as provided in or expressly
contemplated by this Agreement.

 

SECTION 7.07 _Public Announcements_. The initial press release relating to
this Agreement shall be a joint press release, the text of which has been
agreed to by each of Parent and the Company. Thereafter, except with respect
to any matters contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 7.02_ (but subject to the terms
thereof) or _Section_ __ _ 9.01_, each of Parent and the Company shall
consult with each other before issuing any press release or otherwise making
any public statements with respect to this Agreement or any of the
Transactions, except to the extent public disclosure is required
by applicable Law or the rules or regulations of any United States or non-
United States securities exchange, in which case the issuing party shall use
its reasonable efforts to consult with the other party before issuing any
press release or making any such public statements. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, (A) each party hereto may, without such consultation, make any
public statement in response to questions from the press, analysts, investors
or those attending industry conferences, make internal announcements to
employees and make disclosures in documents (including exhibits and all other
information incorporated therein) required to be filed or furnished by the
Company with the SEC, so long as such statements are consistent with previous
press releases, public disclosures or public statements made jointly by the
Parties and (B) Parent, Purchaser and their Affiliates may, without such
consultation or consent, make ordinary course disclosures and communications
to existing or prospective general and limited partners, equity holders,
members, managers and investors of such person or any Affiliates of such
person, in each case who are subject to customary
confidentiality restrictions, and on such persons website in the ordinary
course of business.

SECTION 7.08 _Transfer Taxes_. The Company and Parent shall cooperate in the
preparation, execution and filing of all returns, questionnaires, applications
or other documents regarding any sales, transfer, stamp, stock transfer, value
added, use, real property transfer or gains and any similar Taxes which
become payable in connection with the Transactions. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary herein, each of Parent and the Surviving Company agrees to
assume liability for and pay any sales, transfer, stamp, stock
transfer, value added, use, real property transfer or gains and any similar
Taxes, as well as any transfer, recording, registration and other fees that
may be imposed upon, payable or incurred by the Company, any Company
Subsidiary, Parent or Purchaser in connection with this Agreement and the
Transactions.

SECTION 7.09 _Stock Exchange  De-Listing_. Parent shall cause the Companys
securities to be de-listed from the Nasdaq and de-registered under
the Exchange Act as soon as practicable following the Effective Time and,
prior to the Effective Time, the Company will cooperate with Parent and use
its reasonable best efforts to accomplish the foregoing.

 

SECTION 7.10 _Stockholder Litigation_. The Company shall be entitled to direct
and control the defense of any stockholder litigation brought against the
Company or its directors or officers relating to the Transactions; _provided_
, _however_ , the Company shall give Parent the right to consult with respect
to the defense, settlement and prosecution of such litigation (and shall
consider in good faith Parents advice with respect to such litigation), and
no settlement, compromise or arrangement with respect to such litigation shall
be agreed to without

 



57  Parents prior written consent. The Company shall notify Parent of any
stockholder litigation (including by providing copies of all pleadings with
respect thereto) and shall keep Parent reasonably informed with respect to
the status thereof.

SECTION 7.11 _Takeover Laws_. If any "fair price," "moratorium," "control
share acquisition," "interested shareholder" or other anti-takeover Law
becomes or is deemed to be applicable to this Agreement or the Transactions,
then the Company Board shall grant such approvals and take such actions as
are necessary so that the Transactions may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act to render such
Law or Laws inapplicable to the foregoing.

 

SECTION 7.12 _Certain Filings and Consents_ _; Notices of Certain Matters_.

 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, the
Company and Parent shall cooperate with one another (i) in connection with
the preparation of the Offer Documents and the Schedule 14D-9, (ii) in
determining whether any action by or in respect of, or filing with, any
Governmental Authority is required, or any actions, consents, approvals or
waivers are required to be obtained from parties to any material contracts, in
connection with the consummation of the Transactions and (iii) in taking such
actions or making any such filings, furnishing information required in
connection therewith or with the Offer Documents or the Schedule 14D-9 and
seeking timely to obtain any such actions, consents, approvals or waivers (
_provided_ _neither_ the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries will make or
agree to make any payment of a consent fee, "profit sharing" payment or other
consideration (including increased or accelerated payments) or concede
anything of monetary or economic value for the purposes of obtaining any such
consents without the prior consent of Parent), including such actions as may
be required by the Indentures.

 

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall give prompt notice to the
Company, and the Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, of (i) any
written notice or other communication received by such party from any
Governmental Authority in connection with this Agreement or the Transactions
or from any Person reasonably alleging in writing that the consent of such
Person is required in connection with the Transactions or (ii) any fact,
event or circumstance that (A) has or would reasonably be expected to result
in any Material Adverse Effect or Parent Material Adverse Effect, as
applicable, or (B) is reasonably likely to result in the failure of any of
the Offer Conditions or any of the conditions set forth in _Article VIII_ to
be satisfied; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such notification (or failure
to provide such notification) shall affect any of the representations,
warranties, covenants, rights or remedies, or the conditions to the
obligations of, the parties hereunder. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, a partys good faith failure to comply with this _Section_
__ _ 7.12(b)_ shall not provide any other party the right not to effect the
Transactions, except to the extent that any other provision of this Agreement
would independently provide such right.

 

SECTION 7.13 _Rule 14d-10 Matters_ . Prior to the Acceptance Time, to the
extent necessary, the Compensation Committee of the Company Board will take
all steps that may be necessary or reasonably advisable to cause any employee
agreement, plan or arrangement (whether in existence prior to or after the
date hereof) pursuant to which consideration is or becomes payable to any
officer, director or employee to be approved by the Compensation Committee of
the Company Board as an "employment compensation, severance

 



58  or other employee benefit arrangement" within the meaning of Rule
14d-10(d)(2) of the Exchange Act and to take all actions otherwise necessary
to satisfy the requirements of the non-exclusive safe harbor set forth in
Rule 14d-10(d) of the Exchange Act. Each member of the Compensation Committee
is an "independent director" within the meaning of the requirements of Rule
14d-10(d) promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 

SECTION 7.14 _Convertible Securities_. As promptly as practicable after the
execution and delivery of this Agreement, Purchaser, Parent and the Company
shall cooperate to prepare any supplemental indenture(s) (each a "
_Supplemental Indenture_ ") as required by any of the Indentures. On the
Closing Date, Purchaser, Parent and the Company, as and to the
extent required by any of the Indentures, shall execute with the Trustee any
such Supplemental Indenture(s) and, in each case, deliver any required
certificates, legal opinions and other documents required by any such
Indenture to be delivered by such persons in connection with such
Supplemental Indenture(s). The Company shall deliver all notices and take all
other actions required under the terms of the Convertible Securities, the
Indentures or under applicable Law, including, without limitation, the giving
of any notices that may be required in connection with the Transactions,
including with respect to any repurchases or conversions of the Convertible
Securities occurring as a result of or in connection with the Transactions
to the extent constituting a "Fundamental Change" or "Make-Whole Fundamental
Change," as such terms are defined in the 1.50% Indenture and the 2.625%
Indenture, or a "Change in Control," "Make Whole Change of Control" or
"Public Acquirer Change of Control," as such terms are defined in the 2.50%
Indenture; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company will provide copies of
such notice to Parent at the time of delivering any such notice or taking any
such action described in this _Section_ __ _ 7.14_. After the Effective Time,
the Surviving Company will, and Parent will cause the Surviving Company to,
comply with its obligations (including any repurchase obligations) under the
Indentures and any Supplemental Indentures thereto. For the avoidance of
doubt, the term "Transactions" as used in this Agreement shall be deemed to
include effecting any repurchases or conversions and taking all other actions
required under the terms of the Convertible Securities and the Indentures.

SECTION 7.15 _Financing_.

 

(a) Parent and Purchaser shall use their reasonable best efforts to obtain the
proceeds of the Debt Financing and shall use best efforts to obtain the
proceeds of the Equity Financing, in each case, at or prior to the Acceptance
Time on the terms and conditions described in the Commitment Letters,
including (i) maintaining in effect the Commitment Letters, (ii)
negotiating definitive agreements with respect to the Debt Financing to be
entered into at or prior to the Acceptance Time (the " _Definitive Financing
Agreements_ ") consistent with the terms and conditions contained in the Debt
Commitment Letters (including, as necessary, in accordance with any "flex"
provisions contained in the Debt Commitment Letter or any related fee letter),
in each case which terms shall not in any respect expand on the conditions to
the funding of the proceeds from the Debt Financing at or prior to the
Acceptance Time or reduce the aggregate amount of the proceeds from the Debt
Financing to an amount less than the Required Amount, (iii) satisfying on a
timely basis (taking into account the Marketing Period) all conditions in the
Commitment Letters and the Definitive Financing Agreements applicable to and
within the control of Parent or Purchaser to obtain the Financing and (iv)
borrowing an amount necessary in accordance with the terms of the Definitive
Financing Agreements to consummate the Transactions. In the event that all
conditions contained in the Commitment Letters (other than,

 



59  with respect to the Debt Financing, the availability of the Equity
Financing) have been satisfied (or upon funding will be satisfied), Parent and
Purchaser shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause the Lenders, and
shall cause the Sponsor, to fund at or prior to the Acceptance Time the
respective portion of the Financing required to consummate the Transactions
and to pay related fees and expenses at or prior to the Acceptance
Time (including by seeking through litigation to enforce its rights under the
Commitment Letters and Definitive Financing Agreements, as applicable). Parent
and Purchaser shall comply with their respective obligations, and enforce
their rights, under the Commitment Letters in a timely and diligent manner.
Parent and Purchaser will not, and will not permit the Existing Borrowers to,
amend, modify, replace (including pursuant to a refinancing) either of the
Existing Credit Agreements in a manner that would be likely to impair, impede
or delay the consummation of the Transactions or the timely funding of the
full amount of the Financing contemplated by the Commitment Letters. Parent
and Purchaser shall not, without the prior written consent of the Company,
(A) permit any amendment, supplement or modification to, or any waiver of any
provision or remedy under, or replace, the Commitment Letters if such
amendment, supplement, modification, waiver or replacement (1) would
(x) adversely impact the ability of either Parent or Purchaser to enforce
their respective rights against any other parties to the Commitment Letters or
the Definitive Financing Agreements in any material respect, (y) add new (or
expand, amend, or otherwise modify any existing) conditions to the receipt of
the Financing or otherwise adversely affect (including with respect to timing)
the ability or likelihood of Parent or Purchaser to timely consummate the
Offer at the Acceptance Time, the Merger at the Closing or any of the
Transactions or (z) be reasonably expected to make the timely funding of the
Financing or satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the Financing less
likely to occur, (2) reduces the amount of the Financing (including by
changing the amount of fees to be paid in respect of the Debt Financing or
original issue discount in respect of the Debt Financing) to an amount less
than the Required Amount, (3) materially and adversely affects the ability of
Parent or Purchaser to enforce its rights against any of the other parties to
the Commitment Letters or the Definitive Financing Agreements as so amended,
replaced, supplemented or otherwise modified, relative to the ability of
Purchaser to enforce its rights against any of such other parties to the
Commitment Letters as in effect on the date hereof or (4) would otherwise
reasonably be expected to prevent, impede or delay the consummation of the
Transactions; provided, that Parent or Purchaser may amend the Debt
Commitment Letter to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication
agents or similar entities that have not executed the Debt Commitment Letter
as of the date of this Agreement or (B) take or fail to take any action or
enter into any transaction that would reasonably be expected to materially
impair, delay or prevent consummation of the Financing contemplated by the
Commitment Letters. Upon any such permitted amendment,
supplement, modification, waiver or replacement of the Debt Commitment Letter
in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 7.15(a)_, the terms "Debt Commitment
Letter" and "Debt Financing" shall refer to the Debt Commitment Letter as so
amended, supplemented, modified, waived or replaced and the debt financing
contemplated thereby.

(b) In the event that any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable,
regardless of the reason therefor, Parent and Purchaser will (i) use their
respective reasonable best efforts to obtain, as promptly as practicable
following the occurrence of such event (and, in the case of the Debt
Financing, in any event no later than the last day of the Marketing Period),
alternative financing (" _Replacement Financing_ ") (as applicable, in an
amount sufficient to replace such unavailable Financing and in any event in
an amount sufficient to consummate the Transactions and satisfy the
obligations of Parent and Purchaser under this Agreement) from the

 



60  same or other sources and on terms and conditions not less favorable to
Parent and Purchaser in the aggregate than such unavailable Financing
(including, in the case of the Debt Financing, the "flex" provisions
contained in any related fee letter) and which do not include any conditions
to the consummation of such alternative debt or equity financing, as
applicable, that are more onerous than the conditions set forth in
the applicable Financing and which do not include any additional conditions
to the consummation of such alternative debt or equity financing, as
applicable, that are not conditions in the applicable Financing, with it being
understood and agreed that if Parent and Purchaser proceed with any
alternative debt financing, Parent and Purchaser shall be subject to the same
obligations with respect to such alternative debt financing as set forth in
this Agreement with respect to the Debt Financing and (ii) promptly notify
the Company of such unavailability and the reason therefor. For the purposes
of this Agreement, the terms "Debt Commitment Letter" and "Equity Commitment
Letter" shall be deemed to include any commitment letter (or similar
agreement) with respect to any alternative financing arranged in compliance
herewith (and any Debt Commitment Letter or Equity Commitment Letter, as
applicable, remaining in effect at the time in question). Parent and
Purchaser shall keep the Company reasonably informed, in reasonable detail,
of the status of their efforts to arrange the Financing. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, Parent and Purchaser shall provide the Company
with prompt written notice (i) of (A) any material breach or default by any
party to any Commitment Letters or the Definitive Financing Agreements of
which Parent or Purchaser becomes aware, (B) the receipt of any written notice
or other written communication from any Lender, the Sponsor, or other
financing source with respect to any actual or threatened breach, default (or
accusation of breach or default), termination or repudiation by any party to
any Commitment Letters or the Definitive Financing Agreements of any
provision thereof or (C) any material dispute or disagreement between or among
Parent and Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Lenders, on the other hand, or
among any Lenders to any of the Commitment Letters or the
Definitive Financing Agreements with respect to the obligation to fund any of
the Financing or the amount of the Financing to be funded at the Acceptance
Time, and (ii) if at any time for any reason Parent or Purchaser believes in
good faith that it will not be able to obtain all or any portion of the
Financing on the terms and conditions, in the manner or from the sources
contemplated by any of the Commitment Letters or the Definitive Financing
Agreements, and Parent and Purchaser shall keep the Company reasonably
informed on a current basis of the status of its efforts to consummate the
Financing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, compliance by Parent and Purchaser
with this _Section_ __ _ 7.15_ shall not relieve Parent or Purchaser of
their obligations to consummate the Transactions whether or not the Financing
is available.

(c) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall, and shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cause its Representatives to, use reasonable best efforts to
provide such reasonable cooperation as is customary and reasonably requested
by Parent in connection with the arrangement of the Debt Financing,
including:

(i) prior to and during the Marketing Period, upon reasonable notice,
participating in a reasonable number of lender meetings, presentations and
sessions with rating agencies,

(ii) (A) assist reasonably in the preparation of one or more credit or other
agreements, as well as customary pledge and security documents, and other

Subsidiaries) and (B) reasonably facilitating the taking of all corporate
actions by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries with respect to entering
such definitive financing documents and otherwise necessary to permit
consummation of the Financing, it being understood and agreed that (A) no
such actions or documentation (other than customary authorization letters)
will take effect prior to the Closing and (B) any such action will only be

the Company and its Subsidiaries who retain their respective positions as of,
and after, the Closing,

(iii) furnishing Parent as promptly as reasonably practicable with the
Required Information,

(iv) assist with the preparation of materials for rating agency

at least eight (8) Business Days prior to the Closing Date that is required
in connection with the Debt Financing by U.S. regulatory authorities under
applicable "know-your-customer" and anti-money laundering rules and
regulations, including the USA PATRIOT Act. If the Company at any time in
good faith believes that it has delivered the Required Information in
accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 7.15(c)_, it may (but is under no
obligation to) deliver to Parent a written notice to such effect, in which
case the Company shall be deemed to have delivered the Required Information
unless Parent in good faith reasonably believes the Company has not completed
the delivery of the Required Information and delivers to the Company within
two (2) Business Days a written notice describing in reasonable detail what
information that constitutes Required Information has not yet been delivered.
All non-public or otherwise confidential information regarding the Company or
its Affiliates obtained by Parent or Purchaser or their Representatives
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 7.15_ shall be kept confidential in
accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement, including any joinder or other
agreement entered into in connection therewith. The Company hereby consents to
the use of its and the Company Subsidiaries logos in connection with the
Financing; provided, that such logos are used solely in a manner that is not
intended to or reasonably likely to harm or disparage the Company or any of
the Company Subsidiaries or the reputation or goodwill of the Company or any
of the Company Subsidiaries.

 



 



62 (d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (i) none of the Company,
its Affiliates or any persons who are directors, employees, officers,
members, partners or managers of the Company or its Affiliates shall be
required to pass resolutions or consents to approve or authorize the execution
of the Debt Financing or to execute, deliver or enter into, or perform any
agreement, document or instrument (other than customary authorization
letters), including any Definitive Financing Agreements, with respect to the
Debt Financing, in each case, that would be effective prior to the Closing

performance will only be required of the respective directors, employees,
officers, members, partners or managers of the Company and its Subsidiaries
who retain their respective positions as of, and after, the Closing, (ii) no
obligation of the Company, its Affiliates or any of their respective
Representatives undertaken pursuant to the foregoing shall be effective until
Closing and (iii) none of the Company, its Affiliates or any of their
respective Representatives shall be required to (A) pay any commitment or
other similar fee in connection with the Debt Financing, (B) incur any other
cost or expense that will not be promptly reimbursed by Parent in connection
with the Debt Financing prior to the Closing, (C) take any actions to the
extent such actions would unreasonably interfere with the ongoing business or
operations of the Company and its Affiliates, (D) take any actions that would
conflict with or violate the Companys or its Affiliates organizational
documents or any Laws, or (E) take any actions that would cause any
representation or warranty in this Agreement to be breached or that would
cause any closing condition set forth in _Article VIII_ or _Annex A_ to fail
to be satisfied or that would otherwise cause a breach of this Agreement.
Nothing contained in this  _Section_ __ _ 7.15_ or otherwise shall require
the Company or its Affiliates to be an issuer or other obligor with respect to
the Debt Financing (except for the Company and its Subsidiaries after the
Closing Date). For the avoidance of doubt, none of the respective directors,
employees, officers, members, partners or managers of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries who will not be continuing directors, employees, officers,
members, partners or managers of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in
such respective capacity after the Closing shall be required to execute or
enter into or perform, or otherwise authorize or consent to, or pass any
resolutions in connection with, any agreement with respect to the Financing.
Parent shall, promptly upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company for
all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred
by the Company, its Affiliates or their respective Representatives in
connection with such cooperation and shall indemnify and hold harmless the
Company, its Affiliates and their respective Representatives for and against
any and all losses suffered or incurred by them in connection with the
arrangement of the Debt Financing, any action taken by them pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 7.15_ and any information utilized in connection therewith
(other than written information provided by the Company).

, _however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement under this _Section_

terminated the Offer in breach of the terms of this Agreement or (C) made any
change to the Offer that constitutes a Willful and Material Breach of this
Agreement;

_provided_ , that the Company is not then in material breach of this
Agreement; or

 

(iv) if (i) the Marketing Period has ended, (ii) the Offer Conditions have
been and continue to be satisfied or waived (other than those Offer

willing, and able to consummate the Closing and (iv) Purchaser fails to
consummate (as defined in Section 251(h) of the DGCL) the Offer within three
Business Days following the Expiration Date.

 

SECTION 9.02 _Notice of Termination; Effect of Termination_.

 

(a) A terminating party shall provide written notice of termination to the
other party specifying with reasonable particularity the reason for such
termination, and any such termination in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 9.01_
shall be effective immediately upon delivery of such written notice to the
other party.

 

(b) In the event of termination of this Agreement by any party as provided in
_Section_ __ _ 9.01_, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and of no
further force or effect and there shall be no liability or obligation on the
part of any party, except that (i) this _Section_ __ _ 9.02_, __  

 



65   _Section_ __ _ 2.01(d)_, _Section_ __ _ 7.01(b)_, _Section_ __ _ 9.03_
and _Article X_ shall remain in full force and effect and (ii) subject to
_Section_ __ _ 9.03(g)_, nothing herein shall relieve any party from
liability for any Willful and Material Breach of this Agreement prior to the
date of such termination.

 

SECTION 9.03 _Fees and Expenses_. (a) All expenses incurred in connection with
this Agreement, the Transactions and all other matters related to the Offer
and the Merger shall be paid by the party incurring such expenses, whether or
not the Offer, the Merger or any other Transaction is consummated, except as
otherwise set forth in this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent
will pay all filing fees or make other payments to any Governmental Authority
in connection with the filings made pursuant to the HSR Act or any other
Antitrust Law.

 

(b) If this Agreement shall be terminated:

 

(i) (A) (1) by the Company or Parent pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.01(b)(i)_
and only in circumstances where all of the Offer Conditions have been
satisfied except for the Minimum Condition or the Offer Conditions set forth
in _clauses (d_ ), ( _e_ ), ( _f_ ) or ( _g_ ) of _Annex A_ (but subject to
such conditions being able to be satisfied) or (2) by Parent pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 9.01(c)(ii)_, (B) at or prior to the Termination Date an
Acquisition Proposal shall have been publicly announced or publicly known and
not publicly withdrawn and (C) within twelve (12) months of the Termination
Date the Company enters into a definitive agreement with respect to, and
subsequently consummates, such Acquisition Proposal, in each case whether or
not involving the same Acquisition Proposal or the person making the
Acquisition Proposal referred to in _clause (B)_ , then the Company shall pay
to Parent (or its designee), upon consummation of such Acquisition Proposal,
the amount of $75,000,000 (the " _Company Termination Fee_ ") in accordance
with _Section_ __ _ 9.03(c)_; or

(ii) by Parent pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 9.01(c)(i)_, or the Company
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.01(d)(ii)_, then the Company shall pay to Parent
(or its designee) the Company Termination Fee in accordance with  _Section_
__ _ 9.03(c)_.

(c) The Company Termination Fee payable by the Company under this  _Section_
__ _ 9.03_ shall be paid to Parent or its designee by the Company in
immediately available funds (i) immediately prior to or concurrently with a
termination of this Agreement by the Company pursuant to  _Section_ __ _
9.01(d)(ii)_ and (ii) within two (2) Business Days after the date of the event
giving rise to the obligation to make such payment in all other circumstances.
Subject to  _Section_ __ _ 10.09_, the payment to Parent or its designees of
the Company Termination Fee shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent
and Purchaser for any loss suffered by Parent or Purchaser as a result of the
failure of the Transactions to be consummated and, upon such payment in
accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 9.03_, the Company shall not have any
further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement
or the Transactions.

(d) If this Agreement shall be terminated by the Company pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 9.01(d)(i)_,  _Section_ __ _ 9.01(d)(iii)_ or _Section_ __ _
9.01(d)(iv)_, Parent shall pay to the Company the amount of $175,000,000 (the
" _Parent Termination Fee_ ") in immediately available funds within two (2)
Business Days after the date of such termination.

 



66 (e) For purposes of _Section_ __ _ 9.03(b)(i)_, Acquisition Proposal shall
have the meaning assigned to such term in _Section_ __ _ 7.02(g)(i)_, except
that references to 20% in _clauses (1)_ and _(2)_ of the definition thereof
shall be deemed to be references to 50% and _clause (3)_ of the definition
thereof shall be deemed amended and replaced in its entirety by the following
language: "(3) any merger, consolidation, business combination,
recapitalization or other similar transaction involving the Company pursuant
to which stockholders of the Company immediately prior to the consummation of
such transaction would cease to own directly or indirectly at least 50% of the
voting power of the outstanding securities of the Company (or of another
person that directly or indirectly would own all or substantially all the
assets of the Company) immediately following such transaction in the same
proportion as they owned prior to the consummation of such transaction."

 

(f) The parties acknowledge and agree that the agreements contained in this
_Section_ __ _ 9.03_ are an integral part of the Transactions, and that,
without these agreements, the parties would not enter into this Agreement.
Each of the parties further acknowledges that the payment of the amounts by
the Company or Parent specified in this  _Section_ __ _ 9.03_ is not a
penalty, but, in each case, is liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that
will compensate Parent and Purchaser or the Company, as applicable, in the
circumstances in which such fees are payable for the efforts and resources
expended and the opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and
in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of
the Transactions, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate
with precision. In no event shall the Company or Parent be required to pay a
fee in connection with the termination of this Agreement more than once.

 

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, but
subject to _Section_ __ _ 10.09_, each of the parties hereto expressly
acknowledges and agrees that the Companys right to terminate this Agreement
and for the Company to receive payment of the Parent Termination Fee pursuant
to this _Section_ __ _ 9.03_ shall constitute the sole and exclusive remedy
of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and their respective Affiliates
and any of their respective former, current or future general or limited
partners, stockholders, equityholders, members, managers,
directors, officers, employees, agents or Affiliates (collectively, the "
_Company Related Parties_ ") against Parent, the Sponsor and their respective
Affiliates, the Financing Sources, any other potential debt or equity
financing source and any of their respective former, current or future
general or limited partners, stockholders, equityholders, members, managers,
directors, officers, employees, agents or Affiliates or any former, current or
future general or limited partner, stockholder, equityholder, member,
manager, director, officer, employee, agent or Affiliate of any of the
foregoing (collectively, the " _Parent Related Parties_ ") for all losses and
damages in respect of this Agreement (or the termination thereof) or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (or the failure of such
transactions to occur for any reason or for no reason) or any breach (whether
willful, intentional, unilateral or otherwise) of any covenant or agreement or
otherwise in respect of this Agreement or any oral representation made or
alleged to be made in connection herewith, and upon payment of the Parent
Termination Fee to the Company pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.03(d)_, none of
the Parent Related Parties shall have any further liability or obligation to
any of the Company Related Parties relating to or arising out of this
Agreement, the Guarantee, the Commitment Letters or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby, and none of the Company, its Subsidiaries nor
any other Company Related Party shall seek to recover any other damages or
seek any other remedy, whether based on a claim at law or in equity, in
contract, tort or otherwise, with respect to any losses or damages 

 



67  suffered in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby or any oral representation made or alleged to be made in connection
herewith. In no event shall Parent be subject to (nor shall any Company
Related Party seek to recover) monetary damages in excess of an amount equal
to the Parent Termination Fee, in the aggregate, for any losses or other
liabilities arising out of or in connection with breaches by Parent of its
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this
Agreement or arising from any claim or cause of action that any Company
Related Party may have, including for a breach of _Section_ __ _ 2.01(e)_ as
a result of the Debt Financing not being available to be drawn down or
otherwise arising from the Commitments Letters or in respect of any oral
representation made or alleged to be made in connection herewith or therewith.

 

(h) While the Company may pursue both a grant of specific performance or other
equitable relief under _Section_ __ _ 10.09_ and, following termination of
this Agreement, the payment of the Parent Termination Fee under this _Section_
__ _ 9.03_, under no circumstances shall the Company be permitted or entitled
to receive both a grant of specific performance or other equitable relief and
the Parent Termination Fee in connection with this Agreement or any
termination of this Agreement.

SECTION 10.03 _Interpretation and Rules of Construction_. When a reference is
made in this Agreement to an Exhibit, an Article or a Section, such reference
shall be to an Exhibit, an Article or a Section of this Agreement unless
otherwise indicated. The table of contents, index of defined terms and
headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and
shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.
Whenever the words "include", "includes" or "including" are used in this
Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words
"without limitation." The words "hereof", "hereto", "hereby", "herein" and
"hereunder" and words of similar import when used in this Agreement shall
refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of
this Agreement. Documents, materials and information are deemed to have been
"made available" to Parent and Purchaser, if such documents, materials or
information were (a) available for review by such person and its
Representatives through the electronic data room entitled "Project House",
which is hosted by Merrill Datasite in connection with the Transactions, (b)
otherwise provided by or on behalf of the Company to Parent, Purchaser
or their Representatives. The term "or" is not exclusive. The word "extent"
in the phrase "to the extent" shall mean the degree to which a subject or
other thing extends, and such phrase shall not mean simply "if." The
definitions contained in this Agreement are applicable to the singular as well
as the plural forms of such terms. Any agreement, instrument or Law defined or
referred to herein means such agreement, instrument or Law as from time to
time amended, modified or supplemented, unless otherwise

 



69  specifically indicated. References to a person are also to its successors
and permitted assigns. When calculating the period of time before which,
within which or following which any act is to be done or step taken pursuant
to this Agreement, the date that is the reference date in calculating such
period shall be excluded, and if the last day of such period is not a Business
Day, the period shall end on the immediately following Business Day (if being
calculated based on Business Days). Unless otherwise specifically indicated,
all references to "dollars" and "$" will be deemed references to the lawful
money of the United States of America. Each of the parties has participated
in the drafting and negotiation of this Agreement. If an ambiguity or question
of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement must be construed as if it
is drafted by all the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof
shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of authorship of any
of the provisions of this Agreement. References to "days" shall mean "calendar
days" unless expressly stated otherwise.

 

SECTION 10.04 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law, or
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the Transactions is not affected in any manner
materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or
other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to
effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in a
mutually acceptable manner in order that the Transactions be consummated as
originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

 

SECTION 10.05 _Disclaimer of Other Representations and Warranties_. Parent,
Purchaser and the Company each hereby acknowledges and agrees that, except
for the representations and warranties expressly set forth in _Article IV_ and
_Article V_ , as applicable, and notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, (a) no party nor its Representatives makes, and has not made, any
representations or warranties, express or implied, at Law or in equity,
relating to itself or its businesses or otherwise in connection with the
Transactions, (b) no person has been authorized by any party to make
any representation or warranty relating to such party or its businesses or
otherwise in connection with the Transactions and, if made, such
representation or warranty must not be relied upon as having been authorized
by such party, and (c) any estimates, projections, predictions, data,
financial information, memoranda, presentations or any other materials or
information provided or addressed to any party or any of its Representatives
are not and shall not be deemed to be or to include representations or
warranties unless any such materials or information is the subject of any
representation or warranty set forth in this Agreement.

 

SECTION 10.06 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, taken together with the
Company Disclosure Schedule, the Guarantee, the Equity Commitment Letter and
the Confidentiality Agreement (together with any joinders or other agreements
entered into in connection therewith), constitutes the entire agreement among
the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof
and supersedes all prior agreements and undertakings, both written and oral,
among the parties hereto, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter
hereof and thereof.

 



70 SECTION 10.07 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned, in whole or
in part, by operation of Law or otherwise by any of the parties hereto without
the prior written consent of the other parties hereto; _provided_ that Parent
and Purchaser may assign all or any of their rights and obligations hereunder
to any direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent so long as (a)
Parent continues to remain liable for all of such obligations as if no such
assignment had occurred and (b) such assignment in no way causes a delay or
impairs the ability of Parent and Purchaser to consummate the Transactions.
Any purported assignment without such consent shall be void. Subject to the
preceding sentences, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the
benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties and their respective successors
and assigns.

SECTION 10.08  _Parties in Interest_. This Agreement shall be binding upon
and inure solely to the benefit of each party hereto, and nothing in this
Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other
person any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by
reason of this Agreement, except for (a) the provisions of _Section_ __ _
7.03_ (which are for the benefit of the persons covered thereby and may be
enforced by such persons following the Effective Time); _provided_ that
notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 10.08_,
_Section_ __ _ 10.10(c)_, _Section_ __ _ 10.11_ and the last sentence of
_Section_ __ _ 10.12_ shall be enforceable by each Financing Source and each
Financing Source shall be an intended third party beneficiary of this Section
and such Sections.

 

SECTION 10.09 _Specific Performance_. (a) The parties acknowledge and agree
that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions
of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms
or were otherwise breached. Each party agrees that, in the event of any breach
or threatened breach by any other party of any covenant or
obligation contained in this Agreement, the non-breaching party shall be
entitled (in addition to any other remedy that may be available to it whether
in Law, equity or otherwise, including monetary damages, except as limited by
_Section_ __ _ 9.03_) to (i) an Order of specific performance to enforce the
observance and performance of such covenant or obligation, and (ii) an
injunction restraining such breach or threatened breach. In circumstances
where Parent, Purchaser or the Company is obligated to consummate any
Transaction and such Transaction has not been consummated, each of Parent,
Purchaser and the Company expressly acknowledges and agrees that the other
party shall have suffered irreparable harm, that monetary damages will be
inadequate to compensate such other party and that such other party shall be
entitled to enforce specifically Parents or the Companys, as the case may
be, obligation to consummate such Transaction. Notwithstanding the foregoing
or any other provision of this Agreement, the parties acknowledge and agree
that (x) Parent shall not be entitled to enforce specifically the obligations
of the Company to consummate the Transactions unless all of the conditions
set forth in _Article VIII_ shall have been satisfied or, to the extent
permitted, waived in writing by the Company and (y) the Company shall not be
entitled to enforce specifically the obligations of Parent and Purchaser to
consummate the Transactions unless all of the conditions set forth in _Annex
A_ and _Article VIII_ shall have been satisfied or waived in writing by Parent
(other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the
Expiration Date or the Closing, as applicable, but subject to the satisfaction
or waiver of such conditions). Each party further agrees that no other party
or any other person shall be required to obtain, furnish or post any bond or

agreements related thereto, including by requiring that Parent and Purchaser

SECTION 10.10  _Governing Law_.

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
Laws of the State of Delaware without regard to the principles of conflicts
of law that would cause the application of law of any jurisdiction other than
those of the State of Delaware.

 

(b) The parties hereto agree that any Action seeking to enforce any provision
of, or based on any matter arising out of or in connection with, this
Agreement or the Transactions (whether brought by any party or any of its
Affiliates or against any party or any of its Affiliates) shall be heard and
determined exclusively in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that if such court does not have jurisdiction over
such Action, such Action shall be heard and determined exclusively in any
federal or state court located in the State of Delaware. Consistent with the
preceding sentence, each of the parties hereto hereby (i) submits to the
exclusive jurisdiction of any federal or state court sitting in the State of
Delaware for the purpose of any Action arising out of or relating to this
Agreement brought by either party 

 



72  hereto; (ii) agrees that service of process will be validly effected by
sending notice in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 10.02_; and (iii)
irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert by way of motion, defense, or
otherwise, in any such Action, any claim that it is not subject personally to
the jurisdiction of the above-named courts, that its property is exempt or
immune from attachment or execution, that the Action is brought in an
inconvenient forum, that the venue of the Action is improper, or that this
Agreement or the Transactions may not be enforced in or by any of the above
named courts.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, each
of the Parties hereto: (i) agrees that it will not bring or support any
Person, or permit any of its Affiliates to bring or support any Person, in any
Action of any kind or description, whether in law or in equity, whether in
contract or in tort or otherwise, against the Financing Sources or any other
Person that has committed or subsequently commits to provide or otherwise
enters into agreements in connection with providing the Debt Financing to
Parent or any of its Affiliates, and each of its or their respective former,
current and future Affiliates, equityholders, members, partners, controlling
persons, officers, directors, employees, agents, advisors and representatives
involved in such Debt Financing (collectively, the " _Lender Parties_ ") in
any way relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including, but not limited to, any dispute arising out of or
relating in any way to the Debt Commitment Letters or the performance thereof
or the financings contemplated thereby, in any forum other than the federal
and New York State courts located in the Borough of Manhattan within the City
of New York; (ii) agrees that, except as specifically set forth in the Debt
Commitment Letter, all claims or causes of action (whether at law, in equity,
in contract, in tort or otherwise) against any of the Lender Parties in any
way relating to the Debt Commitment Letters or the performance thereof or the
financings contemplated thereby, shall be exclusively governed by,
and construed in accordance with, the internal laws of the State of New York,
without giving effect to principles or rules of conflict of laws to the extent
such principles or rules would require or permit the application of laws of
another jurisdiction; and (iii) HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES
ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION
(WHETHER AT LAW OR IN EQUITY, IN CONTRACT, IN TORT OR OTHERWISE) DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING IN ANY WAY TO THE DEBT COMMITMENT
LETTER OR THE PERFORMANCE THEREOF OR THE FINANCINGS CONTEMPLATED THEREBY.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
Lender Parties are intended third-party beneficiaries of, and shall be
entitled to the protections of this provision to the same extent as if the
Financing Sources were parties to this Agreement. This Section may not be
amended, modified or supplemented, or any of its provisions waived, without
the written consent of the Financing Sources, which consent may be granted or
withheld in the sole discretion of the Financing Sources.

 

SECTION 10.11 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY WAIVES
TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A
TRIAL BY JURY WITH RESPECT TO ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING
OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS
(INCLUDING ANY SUCH SUIT AGAINST THE FINANCING SOURCES). EACH OF THE
PARTIES HERETO HEREBY (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY
OF THE OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH

 



73  OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE
FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO
THIS AGREEMENT AND THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT, AS
APPLICABLE, BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN
THIS _SECTION 10.11_.

 

SECTION 10.12 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended, by written agreement
of the parties hereto, at any time prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ ,
___however_ , that, following the Acceptance Time, no amendment may be made
that would reduce the amount or change the form of Merger Consideration.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions of this  _Section_ __ _
10.12_, _Section_ __ _ 10.08_, _Section_ __ _ 10.10(c)_ and _Section_ __ _
10.11_ shall not be amended, modified, supplemented or waived in a manner that
is adverse in any material respect to any Financing Source without the prior
written consent of the applicable Financing Source.

 

SECTION 10.13 _Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, Parent (on
behalf of itself and Purchaser), on the one hand, and the Company, on the
other hand, may (a) extend the time for the performance of any obligation or
other act of any other party hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracy in the
representations and warranties of any other party contained herein or in any
document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) waive compliance with any agreement
of any other party or any condition to its own obligations contained herein.
Any such extension or waiver shall be valid if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed by the party or parties to be bound thereby. The failure of
any party to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall
not constitute a waiver of those rights.

 

SECTION 10.14 _Company Disclosure Schedule_. The parties hereto agree that any
reference in a particular Section of the Company Disclosure Schedule shall be
deemed to be disclosed and incorporated by reference in each other Section of
the Company Disclosure Schedule to which such information reasonably relates
as though fully set forth in such other Section to the extent
the applicability and relevance of such information to such other Section is
reasonably apparent. Certain items and matters may be listed in the Company
Disclosure Schedule for informational purposes only and may not be required to
be listed therein by the terms of this Agreement. In no event shall the
listing of items or matters in the Company Disclosure Schedule be deemed or
interpreted to broaden, or otherwise expand the scope of, the representations
and warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement. The mere inclusion
of an item in the Company Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a
representation or warranty (x) shall not be deemed an admission that such item
represents a material exception or material event, circumstance, change,
effect, development or condition or that such item would have a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company and (y) shall not be construed as an admission
by the Company of any non-compliance with, or violation of, any third party
rights (including any intellectual property rights) or any Law or Order of any
Governmental Authority, such disclosures having been made solely for
the purposes of creating exceptions to the representations made herein or of
disclosing any information required to be disclosed under this Agreement.
Without limiting the foregoing, no reference to or disclosure of a possible
breach or violation of any Contract or agreement, Law or Order shall be
construed as an admission or indication that a breach or violation exists or
has actually occurred.

 

SECTION 10.15 _No Recourse_. This Agreement may only be enforced against,
and any claim, action, suit or other legal proceeding based upon, arising out
of, or related to this

 



74  Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement,
may only be brought against the entities that are expressly named as parties
hereto and then only with respect to the specific obligations set forth
herein with respect to such party, except for claims that the Company may
assert in accordance with the Guarantee or Equity Commitment Letter. No past,
present or future director, officer, employee, incorporator, manager, member,
general or limited partner, stockholder, equityholder, controlling person,
Affiliate, agent, attorney or other Representative of any party hereto or any
of their successors or permitted assigns or any direct or indirect
director, officer, employee, incorporator, manager, member, general or
limited partner, stockholder, equityholder, controlling person, Affiliate,
agent, attorney, Representative, successor or permitted assign of any of the
foregoing (each, a " _Non-Recourse Party_"), shall have any liability for any
obligations or liabilities of any party hereto under this Agreement or for any
claim or proceeding (whether in tort, contract or otherwise) based on, in
respect of or by reason of the transactions contemplated hereby or in respect
of any written or oral representations made or alleged to be made in
connection herewith. Without limiting the rights of the Company against
Parent, in no event shall the Company or any of its Affiliates seek to
enforce this Agreement against, make any claims for breach of this Agreement
against, or seek to recover monetary damages from, any Non-Recourse Party
(other than in accordance with the Guarantee or Equity Commitment Letter).

SECTION 10.16 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed and delivered
(including by facsimile transmission or other means of electronic
transmission, such as by electronic mail in "pdf" form) in counterparts, and
by the different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when
executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken together
shall constitute one and the same agreement.

 _Conditions to the Offer_

 

Notwithstanding any other provision of the Agreement or the Offer and in
addition to (and not in limitation of) Purchasers right to extend and amend
the Offer pursuant to the provisions of the Agreement, subject to any
applicable rules and regulations of the SEC, Purchaser shall not be required
to (and Parent shall not be required to cause Purchaser to) accept for payment
or pay for any Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the
Offer, and, subject to the terms of this Agreement, may extend, terminate or
amend the Offer, if, as of the Expiration Date of the Offer, any of the
following conditions shall not be satisfied or, to the extent permitted,
waived in writing by Parent:

(a) there shall have been validly tendered and not validly withdrawn that
number of Shares (excluding shares tendered pursuant to notices of guaranteed
delivery that have not yet been "received" (as such term is defined in Section
251(h)(6)(f) of the DGCL)) that, when added to the Shares then owned
by Parent and its Subsidiaries, would represent a majority of all Shares
outstanding as of the expiration of the Offer (the " _Minimum Condition_ ")
(it being understood that, for purposes of calculating whether the Minimum
Condition has been satisfied, the aggregate number of Shares outstanding
shall (i) include, without duplication, Shares issuable in respect of (A)
Company Stock Options for which the holders thereof have satisfied all of the
requirements for exercise thereof prior to the expiration of the Offer, even
if delivery of Shares resulting from such exercises to the respective
optionholders has not occurred prior to the expiration of the Offer, (B)
Restricted Stock Units for which the holders thereof have satisfied all of
the requirements for vesting thereof prior to the expiration of the Offer,
even if delivery of the Shares resulting from such vesting to the respective
RSU holders has not occurred prior to the expiration of the Offer and (C)
Convertible Securities for which the holders thereof have satisfied all of the
requirements for conversion (as set forth in the applicable Indenture) prior
to the expiration of the Offer, even if delivery of Shares resulting from
such conversions (including any applicable "Additional Shares" (as defined in
the Convertible Securities) deliverable in connection therewith) to the
respective converting holders has not occurred prior to the expiration of the
Offer, and (ii) not include Shares held in treasury by the Company as of the
expiration of the Offer or any other Shares acquired by the Company prior to
the expiration of the Offer (including any such Shares acquired in connection
with tax withholding for the vesting of Restricted Shares or Restricted Stock
Units or in connection with tax withholding or payment of the exercise price
for the exercise of Company Stock Options), even if delivery to the Company of
Shares so acquired has not occurred prior to the expiration of the Offer);

(b) any applicable waiting period under the HSR Act shall have expired or been
terminated and, to the extent applicable, all clearances and authorizations
required by the Antitrust Laws of Germany and Austria shall have been
obtained;

 

(c) no Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction shall have enacted,
issued, promulgated, enforced or entered any Law that is in effect and
enjoins or otherwise prohibits or makes illegal the consummation of the Offer,
the acquisition of the Shares by Parent or Purchaser, the Merger or the other
Transactions; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent and Purchaser shall not
be permitted to invoke this _clause (c)_ unless they shall have complied
with their obligations under _Section_ __ _ 7.05_ in all material respects;

 

 (d) (i) the representations and warranties of the Company contained in the
first sentence of  _Section_ __ _ 4.01(a)_ (solely to the extent concerning
the Company), the first sentence of _Section_ __ _ 4.02_ (solely to the
extent concerning the Company), _Section_ __ _ 4.03(a)_, the first, third
and fourth sentences of _Section_ __ _ 4.03(b)_ (other than for inaccuracies
that are individually or in the aggregate _de minimis_ relative to the total
fully diluted equity capitalization of the Company),  _Section_ __ _ 4.04_
and _Section_ __ _ 4.10(a)_ shall be true and correct in all respects at and
as of immediately prior to such time with the same force and effect as if made
on and as of such time (except to the extent such representations and
warranties are, by their terms, made as of a specified time, in which case
such representations and warranties shall be true and correct as of such
specified time), (ii) the representations and warranties of the Company
contained in Section 4.20, Section 4.22 and Section 4.24 shall be true and
correct in all material respects at and as of immediately prior to such time
with the same force and effect as if made on and as of such time (except to
the extent such representations and warranties are, by their terms, made as of
a specified time, in which case such representations and warranties shall be
true and correct as of such specified time) (without giving effect to any
qualification by materiality contained therein) and (iii) the other
representations and warranties contained in _Article IV_ shall be true and
correct as of such time with the same force and effect as if made on and as of
such time (except to the extent such representations and warranties are, by
their terms, made as of a specified time, in which case such representations
and warranties shall be true and correct as of such specified time) (without
giving effect to any qualification by materiality or Material Adverse Effect
contained therein), except for failures to be so true and correct that would
not have a Material Adverse Effect;

 

(e) the Company shall have performed or complied with, in all material
respects, each covenant, agreement and obligation required by this Agreement
to be performed or complied with by it on or prior to such time;

(f) since the date of the Agreement there shall not have been any event,
circumstance, change, development or effect that, individually or in the
aggregate, has had, or would reasonably be expected to have, a Material
Adverse Effect;

 

(g) the Company shall have delivered to Parent a certificate, dated as of the
then-scheduled Expiration Date, signed by an executive officer of the
Company, certifying that the Offer Conditions specified in paragraphs (d), (e)
and (f) have been satisfied;

(h) the Marketing Period shall have expired; or

(i) the Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance with _Section_
__ _ 9.01_. 

The foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of Parent and Purchaser and,
other than the Minimum Condition, may be waived by Parent and Purchaser in
whole or in part at any time and from time to time in their sole discretion,
in each case subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and to the
extent such waiver is permitted by applicable Law. The failure by
Parent, Purchaser or any other Affiliate of Parent at any time to exercise
any of the

 

  foregoing rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any such right, the waiver
of any such right with respect to particular facts and circumstances shall not
be deemed a waiver with respect to any other facts and circumstances and each
such right shall be deemed an ongoing right that may be asserted at any time
and from time to time.

 

The capitalized terms used in this _Annex A_ shall have the meanings set forth
in the Agreement to which it is annexed.
