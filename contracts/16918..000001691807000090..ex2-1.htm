consistent with the  Financial Statements presenting Seller's good faith

(iii) For  purposes of determining the value of the Inventory for the
Estimated Closing  Net  Working Capital and the Preliminary Closing Net
Working Capital, Seller and  Purchaser shall value the Inventory in
accordance with past  practice.

 

 

(b) _Preliminary  Statement of Working Capital and Preliminary Cash Balance

(c) _Review  of Preliminary Statement of Working Capital and Preliminary Cash

Capital and the Preliminary  Cash  Balance Statement, Purchaser and its
representatives may review the Preliminary  Statement of Working Capital and
the Preliminary Cash Balance Statement and  may  make inquiry of Seller and
its representatives, and Seller will make available  to Purchaser and its
representatives all books and records relating to the  Preliminary Statement
of Working Capital and the Preliminary Cash Balance  Statement as reasonably
requested by Purchaser in connection with its review  thereof. The
Preliminary Statement of Working Capital and the  Preliminary Cash Balance
Statement shall be binding and conclusive upon,  and  deemed accepted by,

of Working Capital or the Preliminary  Cash  Balance Statement that cannot
be resolved by Purchaser and Seller within  fifteen  (15) days after receipt
by Seller of the notice referred to in _Section  2.3(c)_ shall be referred
thereafter for decision at the insistence of either  Purchaser or Seller to
an independent nationally recognized accounting firm  not  engaged by Seller
or Purchaser as agreed to by Purchaser and Seller (the  " _Arbiter_ "). If
within ten (10) days of referral of such  disagreements to the agreed upon
accounting firm, the agreed upon accounting  firm declines to accept its
appointment as Arbiter, or if Purchaser and Seller  are unable to agree on
the selection of an independent nationally recognized  accounting firm that
will agree to act as Arbiter within ten (10) days, then  either Purchaser or
Seller may request the American Arbitration Association  to  appoint such a
firm, and such appointment shall be conclusive and binding  on all  of the
parties hereto. Promptly, but no later than thirty (30) days  after its
acceptance of its appointment as Arbiter, the Arbiter shall determine,  based
solely on presentations by Purchaser and Seller and on the definitions 
herein, and not by independent review, those items in dispute on the
Preliminary  Statement of Working Capital or the Preliminary Cash Balance
Statement and  shall  render a written report as to the resolution of each
dispute and the resulting  calculation of the Final Statement of Working
Capital or the Preliminary  Cash  Balance Statement, as the case may be. The
Arbiter may only consider  those items and amounts in the Preliminary
Statement of Working Capital that  Purchaser and Seller are unable to resolve
or are reasonably dependent upon  or  affected by the unresolved items. In
resolving any such item, the  Arbiter may not assign a value to any item
greater than the greatest value  claimed by either party for such item or
less than the smallest value claimed  by  either party for such item. The
Arbiter shall have exclusive  jurisdiction over, and resort to the Arbiter as
provided in this _Section  2.3(d)_ shall be the sole recourse and remedy of
the parties against one  another or any other Person with respect to, any
disputes arising out of  or  relating to the Preliminary Statement of
Working Capital or the Preliminary  Cash  Balance Statement. The Arbiter's
determination shall be conclusive  and binding on all of the parties hereto
and shall be enforceable in a court  of  law. The fees and expenses of the
Arbiter shall be allocated between  Seller and Purchaser based on the
percentage which the portion of the contested  amount not awarded to each
party bears to the amount actually contested by  such  party. Seller will
make available to Purchaser and, if applicable,  the Arbiter, the work papers
used in preparing the Preliminary Statement  of  Working Capital or the
Preliminary Cash Balance Statement in connection with  (i)  the review by
Seller of the Preliminary Statement of Working Capital and  the  Preliminary
Cash Balance Statement and (ii) the resolution by the parties  hereto  of
any disputes relating thereto.

 

 

(e) _Final  Statement._ Each  of  the Preliminary Statement of Working
Capital and the Preliminary Cash Balance  Statement shall become final and
binding upon the parties hereto upon the  earlier of (i) the failure by
Purchaser to object thereto within the period  permitted under, and otherwise
in accordance with the requirements of,  _Section 2.3(c)_ , (ii) the written
agreement between Purchaser and Seller  with respect thereto and (iii) the
decision by the Arbiter with respect to  disputes under _Section 2.3(d)_. The
Preliminary Statement  of Working Capital, as accepted pursuant to _Section
2.3(c)_ or as adjusted  pursuant to any written agreement of the parties
hereto or the decision of  the  Arbiter, when final and binding, is referred
to herein as the " _Final  Statement of Working Capital_." The Preliminary
Cash Balance  Statement, as accepted pursuant to _Section 2.3(c)_ or as
adjusted pursuant  to any written agreement of the parties hereto or the
decision of the Arbiter,  when final and binding, is referred to herein as
the " _Final Cash Balance  Statement_."

 

 

(f) _Adjustments  to Closing Purchase Price; Payment of Purchase Price
Adjustment_.  Upon  the  determination of the Final Statement of Working
Capital and the Final Cash  Balance Statement in accordance with this
_Section 2.3_ ,

 

 

(i) first,  (x) the Closing Purchase Price shall be increased by the amount,
if any,  by  which the Net Working Capital set forth on the Final Statement
of Working  Capital exceeds the Estimated Closing Net Working Capital or (y)
the Closing  Purchase Price shall be decreased by the amount, if any, by
which the Net  Working Capital set forth on the Final Statement of Working
Capital is less  than  the Estimated Closing Net Working Capital; and

 

 

(ii) second,  the Closing Purchase Price as adjusted pursuant to subclause
(i) shall be  (x)  increased by the amount, if any, by which the Cash
Balance set forth on the  Final Cash Balance Statement exceeds the Estimated
Cash Balance or (y) decreased  by the amount, if any, by which the Cash
Balance set forth on the Final Cash  Balance Statement is less than the

to or  cause  to exist any other employee benefit plan, program or
arrangement, or (ii)  to  enter into any other contract or agreement to
provide compensation or benefits  to any individual.

 

 

(b) No  Acquired Company has engaged in a transaction in connection with
which it  could  be subject either to a material civil penalty assessed
pursuant to Section  502  of ERISA or a material Tax imposed by Section 4975
of the Code. No  Acquired Company has incurred or would be reasonably
expected to incur any  material Tax under Chapter 43 of Subtitle D of the
Code.

 

 

(c) There  does not now exist, and there are no existing circumstances that
could  reasonably be expected to result in, any liability under Title IV of
ERISA  or  Sections 412 and 4971 of the Code that would be a liability of an
Acquired  Company following the Closing. Without limiting the generality of
the  foregoing, to the Knowledge of the Company, neither the Company nor any
of  its  ERISA Affiliates has engaged in any transaction described in
Section 4069  of  ERISA or any transaction that constitutes a withdrawal
under Section 4201  et  seq. of ERISA.

 

 

(d) Neither  the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the
consummation of the  transactions contemplated hereby will (either alone or
in conjunction with  any  other event, such as termination of employment or
other service) (i) result  in  or cause any payment (whether of severance
pay or otherwise), acceleration,  forgiveness of indebtedness, vesting,
distribution or increase in benefits  with  respect to any Company Benefit
Plan for any current or former director, officer,  employee or other service
provider of an Acquired Company (other than any  partial termination
resulting from the consummation of this Agreement), (ii)  give rise to any
obligation to fund any payment or benefit by an Acquired  Company, (iii) give
rise to any limitation on the ability of an Acquired  Company  to amend or
terminate any Company Benefit Plan, or (iv) result in any payment  or 
benefit that will be characterized as an "excess parachute payment," within
the  meaning of Section 280G of the Code.

 

 

(e) Each  Company Benefit Plan may be unilaterally amended or terminated by
such Acquired  Company (with respect to the Company Employees), without
material liability  or  penalty, subject to the rights of existing
participants under the Company  Benefit Programs.

 

 

(f) No  Acquired Company has participated in, maintained or contributed to or
been  required to contribute to a "multiemployer plan," as such term is

claims (other  than  routine claims for benefits in the ordinary course),
lawsuits or arbitrations  which have been asserted or instituted against the
Company Benefit Plans,  any  fiduciaries of the Company Benefit Plans with
respect to their duties to  the  Company Benefit Plans or the assets of any
of the trusts under any of the  Company Benefit Plans which would reasonably
be expected to result in any  material liability of the Acquired Companies.

 

 

(h) To  the  Knowledge of the Company, no Acquired Company has any Company
Benefit Plan  or  any other agreement or arrangement under which an Acquired
Company has any  material liability under a "nonqualified deferred
compensation plan" within the  meaning of Section 409A of the Code and the
applicable Treasury guidance  thereunder (the " _Company 409A Plans_ ") which
does not comply with the  requirements of Section 409A of the Code or which
does not have a remaining  period of time to bring such Company Benefit Plan
into compliance with Section  409A of the Code and the guidance issued
thereunder. _Section  3.20(h)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth
each Company Employee  who is a "specified employee" within the meaning of
Code Section  409A.

 

 

(i) The  Internal Revenue Service has issued a favorable determination letter
or has  an  application pending or has remaining a period of time to seek a
determination  letter with respect to each Benefit Plan that is intended to
be a "qualified  plan" within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code,
copies of which have  been made available to Purchaser, **** and to the
Knowledge of  the Company, there are no existing circumstances nor any events
that have  occurred that could reasonably be expected to materially adversely
affect  the  qualified status of any such plan or the tax-exempt status of
any related  trust.

 

 

(j) All  contributions to, and any payments from, each Benefit Plan that have
been  required to be made by an Acquired Company in accordance with the terms
of  such  Benefit Plan and applicable law have been made or fully accrued
for and  accounted for by reserves on the Reference Balance Sheet. No
Acquired  Company has any unfunded benefit obligations under any Benefit Plan
which  have  not been accounted for by reserves, or otherwise fully accrued
on the Reference  Balance Sheet.

 

 

(k) Each  Benefit Plan has been maintained and operated, in all material
respects,  in  accordance with its terms and all provisions of applicable
laws and regulations,  including, without limitation, ERISA and the Code.

communication with, and  any  proposed understanding, undertaking, or
agreement with, any Governmental  Entity  regarding any such filings or any
such transaction. Neither party  will withdraw the HSR Submission without the
written consent of the other  party.

 

 

(d) Each  of  Purchaser and Seller, on behalf of the Company, shall use good
faith best  efforts to resolve such objections, if any, as may be asserted by
any  Governmental Entity with respect to the transactions contemplated by
this  Agreement under the HSR Act, the Sherman Act, as amended, the Clayton
Act,  as  amended, the Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, and any
other federal,  state or foreign statutes, rules, regulations, orders or
decrees that are  designed to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having
the purpose or  effect  of monopolization or restraint of trade
(collectively, " _Antitrust  Laws_ "). In connection therewith, if any
administrative or  judicial action or proceeding is instituted (or threatened
to be instituted)  challenging any transaction contemplated by this Agreement
as violative of  any  Antitrust Law, each of Purchaser and Seller shall
cooperate and use its  reasonable best efforts to vigorously contest and
resist any such action  or  proceeding and to have vacated, lifted,
reversed, or overturned any decree,  judgment, injunction or other order,
whether temporary, preliminary or  permanent, that is in effect and that
prohibits, prevents, or restricts  consummation of any such transaction. Each
of Purchaser and Seller  shall use its good faith best efforts to take such
action as may be required  or  advisable to cause the expiration of the
waiting periods under the HSR Act  or  other Antitrust Laws with respect to
such transactions as promptly as possible  after the execution of this
Agreement.

 

 

(e) Seller  and Purchaser each shall keep each other apprised of the status
of matters  relating to completion of the transactions contemplated hereby.
Each  party may, in its reasonable discretion, furnish the other party with
copies  of  all filings, correspondence, notices or other communications
sent or received  (including file memoranda evidencing telephonic
conferences) by Seller, the  Company or Purchaser, as the case may be, or by
any of their respective  Affiliates, to or from representatives of either the
Federal Trade Commission,  the Antitrust Division of the United States
Department of Justice, or any  other  Governmental Entity, with respect to
the transactions contemplated by this  Agreement, except for documents filed
pursuant to Item 4(c) of the  Notification and Report Form or communications
regarding the  same. Seller and Purchaser each shall give prompt notice to
the other  upon becoming aware of, including a reasonably detailed statement
of the  relevant facts relating to: (i) the occurrence or nonoccurrence of 
any event which would reasonably be likely to cause any representation or 
warranty of such party contained in this Agreement or the Company Disclosure 
Schedule to be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect, such that the 
condition set forth in _Section 6.2(a)_ or _Section 6.3(a)_ , as  applicable,
would not be satisfied as of the date of such event or as of  the  Closing
Date; (ii) any failure of the Company, Seller or Purchaser, as the  case 
may be, to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to 
be  complied with or satisfied by it hereunder; or (iii) the occurrence or 
nonoccurrence of any event which would reasonably be likely to cause any 
condition to the obligations of any party to effect the transactions 
contemplated hereby not to be satisfied.

 

 

(f) Seller  may, from time to time prior to or at the Closing, by notice in
accordance  with  the terms of this Agreement, supplement or amend any
Company Disclosure Schedule  hereto (any such notice, a " _Schedule Update_
"), including one or more  supplements or amendments to correct any matter
which would constitute a  breach  of any representation, warranty, covenant
or obligation contained  herein. No such Schedule Update shall be deemed to
cure any breach  for purposes of _Section 6.2_ , and no such Schedule Update
shall be deemed  to supplement or amend the Company Disclosure Schedule for
the purpose of  determining the accuracy of the representations and
warranties made by Seller  in  this Agreement for purposes of _Section
8.2(a)_. Any such  Schedule Update will be effective to cure and correct for
all other purposes  any  inaccuracy in or breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or obligation  which would have existed if Seller had not
made provided such Schedule Update,  and, subject to the immediately
preceding sentence, all references to the  Company Disclosure Schedule hereto
which is supplemented or amended as provided  in this _Section 5.3(f)_ shall
for all purposes after the  Closing be deemed to be a reference to such
Company Disclosure Schedule as  so  supplemented or amended.

 

 

(g) Notwithstanding  anything in this _Section 5.3_ to the contrary, neither
Purchaser nor  Seller shall be required to divest, hold separate or license
any of its or  its  Affiliates' business, assets or product lines or to take
any action or accept  any limitations on its or its Affiliates' business,
assets or operations or  agree to do any of the foregoing.

 

 

5.4 _Confidentiality_. Seller  shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
ensure that all information  concerning the Acquired Companies with which
Seller and its Affiliates, any  of  their respective employees, attorneys,
agents, investment bankers, or  accountants may now possess or may hereafter
create or obtain relating to  the  financial condition, results of
operations, business, properties, assets,  liabilities or future prospects of
the Acquired Companies or relating to  the  assets of the Acquired Companies
or any customer or supplier of the Acquired  Companies shall not be
published, disclosed, or made accessible by any of  them  to any other
Person at any time or used by any of them without the prior  written 
consent of Purchaser; provided, however, that the restrictions of this
provision  shall not apply (i) as may otherwise be required by law, (ii) as
may be  necessary or appropriate in connection with the enforcement of this
Agreement,  or (iii) to the extent such information shall have otherwise
become publicly  available other than as the result of a breach by Seller of
its obligations  under this Agreement. The restrictions of this _Section 5.4_
  shall survive for a period of two (2) years following the Closing.

 

 

5.5 _Use  of  Name_.

 

 

(a) Immediately  following the Closing, Purchaser shall take any and all
actions necessary,  including amending the Company's certificate of
incorporation, to change the  Company's name to a name that does not include
"Beam" and shall record that name  change with all appropriate authorities,
including but not limited to the  U.S.  Patent and Trademark Office.

 

 

(b) As  soon  as practicable, and in any event within thirty (30) days
following the Closing,  Purchaser shall cease, and cause each Acquired
Company to cease, in any manner  whatsoever to use or display any trade or
service marks, trade or service  names  or logos used or held by Seller or
any of its Affiliates or any confusingly  similar mark, name, or logo,
including, without limitation, the Beam  Names. In particular, following the
Closing, Purchaser shall not use,  and shall cause each Acquired Company not
to use, the Beam Names and for  this  purpose Purchaser hereby undertakes to
ensure that all publicly visible  references to the Beam Names and other
trade or service names and assets  or  logos of Seller and its Affiliates
are removed from all signage and from  any  material or asset of each
Acquired Company or relating to the business of  any  Acquired Company.
Likewise, as soon as practicable, and  in any event within thirty (30) days
following the Closing, Seller shall  cease,  and shall cause each of
Seller's Affiliates to cease, in any manner whatsoever  to use or display the
Acquired Companies' Brands and Domain Names.

 

 

(c) Following  the Closing, Purchaser agrees that no brochures, leaflets,
packaging,  stationery, purchase orders, invoices, receipts or other similar
documents  containing any reference to the Beam Names shall be printed,
ordered or produced  and shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries not to
print, order or produce  any such materials. As soon as practicable, and in
any event within  sixty (60) days following the Closing, Purchaser shall, and
shall cause the  Company and its Subsidiaries to, cease to use any brochure,
leaflet, packaging,  stationery, purchase order, invoice, receipt or other
similar document  containing any reference to the Beam Names or shall only
use such materials  after having deleted, pasted over or placed a sticker
over such  references.

 

 

(d) Following  the Closing, except as otherwise provided herein, none of
Purchaser, the  Acquired Companies or any of their Affiliates shall have any
rights to use  any  trademarks, trade names, logos, or any contraction,
abbreviation, or simulation  thereof, of Seller or any of its Affiliates, and
Purchaser shall not, and  shall  cause the Acquired Companies and
Purchaser's Affiliates not to, hold itself or  themselves out as having any
affiliations with Seller or any of its  Affiliates. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing,  Purchaser expressly agrees that neither it nor
any of its Affiliates nor  the  Acquired Companies is acquiring any rights
to or interest in the name or  mark "Beam," "Cockburn's," "Harveys" or
"Roth" or any variation thereof or any rights  associated therewith, all of
which are retained by Seller and its  Affiliates.

 

 

5.6 _Access;  Confidentiality_

 

 

 

(a) Upon  reasonable notice to Seller and subject to the prior written
consent of Allan  Snape or Anthony Trotta (which shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed),  Seller shall cause each Acquired Company to afford the
officers, employees,  counsel, accountants and other authorized
representatives  (" _Representatives_ ") of Purchaser reasonable access,
during normal  business hours throughout the period prior to the Closing, to
the executive  officers, properties, books, contracts and records of each
Acquired Company  and,  during such period, shall furnish promptly to the
Representatives all  information concerning the business, properties, results
of operations and  personnel of the Acquired Companies as may reasonably be
requested; provided,  however, that Seller may restrict the foregoing access
to the extent that  (i) in the reasonable judgment of Seller, any law,
treaty, rule or  regulation of any Governmental Entity applicable to an
Acquired Company or  Seller requires Seller or an Acquired Company to
restrict or prohibit access  to  any such properties or information, (ii) in
the reasonable judgment of  Seller, the information is subject to
confidentiality obligations to a third  party, (iii) such disclosure would
result in disclosure of any Trade  Secrets of third parties, or (iv)
disclosure of any such information or  document could result in the loss of
attorney-client privilege; provided,  however, that with respect to this
clause (iv), Seller and/or its counsel  shall use their reasonable efforts to
enter into such joint defense agreements  or other arrangements, as
appropriate, so as to avoid the loss of  attorney-client privilege; and
provided further that as a condition to such  access, Purchaser hereby agrees
(x) that Purchaser and its Representatives  shall  not interfere with the
operations of the properties, (y) to pay for the cost  to  repair any damage
caused by Purchaser or its Representatives and (z) to  indemnify, defend and
hold Seller and the Acquired Companies harmless with  respect to any personal
injury or property damage arising from or relating  to  entry on the Real
Property by Purchaser or its Representatives. All  requests for information
and access made pursuant to this _Section 5.6_   shall be made in writing
directed to Allan Snape or Anthony  Trotta. **** Further, Purchaser shall not
contact any supplier  or customer of an Acquired Company without obtaining
prior written consent  of an  executive officer of Seller, provided,
however, that Purchaser shall not  be  prohibited from contacting any
supplier or customer of an Acquired Company  that  is also a supplier or
customer of Purchaser or its Affiliates with regard  to  matters unrelated
to this Agreement. The parties hereto will hold any  such information which
is nonpublic in confidence pursuant to the terms of  the  confidentiality
agreement, dated August 30, 2007, between an Affiliate of  Seller  and
Purchaser (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ") and the parties hereby 
acknowledge that Seller is a third party beneficiary of such  agreement.

 

 

(b) From  and  after the Closing, Purchaser shall preserve and retain (and
cause each Acquired  Company to preserve and retain) all information and
books and records of  the  Acquired Companies, including accounting, legal,
personnel, auditing and  other  books and records and any documents relating
to any governmental or  non-governmental claims, actions, suits, proceedings
or investigations with  respect to an Acquired Company or the business of an
Acquired Company on  or  prior to the Closing Date in a manner consistent
with Purchaser's document  retention policies.

 

 

(c) In  the  event and for so long as Seller is contesting or defending
against or  prosecuting any third-party charge, complaint, action, suit,
proceeding,  hearing, investigation, claim or demand relating to the
indemnification matters  provided for in _Section 8.2_ , Purchaser will (and
will cause each Acquired  Company to) (i) fully cooperate with Seller and its
counsel in, and assist  Seller and its counsel with, the contest, defense or
prosecution, (ii) make  available its personnel (including for purposes of
fact finding, consultation,  interviews, depositions and, if required, as
witnesses), and (iii) provide  such  information, testimony and access to
its books and records, in each case  as  shall be reasonably requested in
connection with the contest, defense or  prosecution.

 

 

(d) Seller  shall reimburse Purchaser for reasonable out-of-pocket
administrative costs  and  expenses incurred at the request of Seller in
assisting Seller pursuant to  subsection (c) of this _Section 5.6_. No party
shall be required  by this _Section 5.6_ to take any action that would
unreasonably interfere  with the conduct of its business or unreasonably
disrupt its normal  operations. Any information received by any party
pursuant to this  _Section 5.6_ shall be subject to the Confidentiality 
Agreement.

 

 

5.7 _Publicity_

 

 

(a) .Seller  and Purchaser shall consult with each other prior to issuing any
press releases  or otherwise making public announcements with respect to this
Agreement and  the  transactions contemplated hereby and prior to making any
filings with any  third  party and/or any Governmental Entity (including any
national securities  exchange) with respect thereto, except as may be
required by applicable law  or  by obligations pursuant to any listing
agreement with or rules of any national  securities exchange. Nothing
contained in this Agreement shall  prohibit the Company, Seller or Purchaser
from publicly disclosing this  Agreement to the extent such disclosure is
required under applicable law  or by  obligations pursuant to any listing
agreement with, or any rules of, any  national securities exchange.

 

 

5.8 _Employee  Benefits_.

 

 

(a) Except  for those employees listed on _Section 5.8_ of the Company
Disclosure  Schedule who become employees of the Seller or its Affiliates
(other than  any  Acquired Company) at or prior to the Closing, Purchaser
agrees to continue  the  employment of, and retain on the payroll of the
Acquired Companies, all of  the  employees of each Acquired Company
immediately prior to the Closing (each,  a " _Company Employee_ ") through
December 31, 2007; provided, however,  Purchaser may terminate one or more
Company Employees in the ordinary course  provided that the aggregate number
of Company Employees terminated on or  prior  to December 31, 2007 shall not
exceed two percent (2%) of the number of Company  Employees immediately prior
to the Closing. For a period of at least  twelve (12) months following the
Closing, Purchaser shall cause the Acquired  Companies to provide the Company
Employees with (i) retirement and welfare  benefit plans and other fringe
benefits that are no less favorable in the  aggregate than the benefits that
the Acquired Companies and their Affiliates  provided to the Company
Employees under the Benefits Plans prior to the Closing  Date (" _Purchaser
Plans_ "); and (ii) the severance benefits pursuant to the  severance program
maintained by the Acquired Companies as of the Closing;  and  (iii) the
compensation provided pursuant to the Beam Wine Estates, Inc.  Long-Term
Incentive Plan as of the Closing for any cycle including the 2007  year  in
accordance with the terms of such plan, except as otherwise provided in 
_Section 5.8(h)_. Purchaser shall cause the Acquired Companies  to continue
to be obligated and liable for any accrued and unpaid vacation  and  sick
leave of the Company Employees. To the extent Purchaser's retirement and 
welfare benefit plans and other fringe benefits are less favorable than
required  by this _Section 5.8(a)_ , Purchaser may determine alternative or
additional  compensation reasonably designed to compensate Company Employees
such that  the  aggregate benefits provided to such Company Employees are no
less favorable  than  those required by this _Section 5.8(a)_.

 

 

(b) Following  the Closing, Purchaser shall cause service performed by
Company Employees  for  the Acquired Companies (or any predecessor entities)
to be taken into account  for purposes of determining eligibility, accruals,
and vesting under Purchaser's  employee benefit plans, programs and
arrangement, including all benefit programs  defined under Section 3(3) of
ERISA to the extent such service was credited  by  the Acquired Companies
under similar Benefit Plans. Notwithstanding  the foregoing, nothing in this
_Section 5.8(b)_ shall be construed to  require crediting of service that
would result in (i) duplication of  benefits, or (ii) service credit under a
newly established plan for which  prior service is not taken into account, in
each case unless otherwise required  by law.

 

 

(c) From  and  after the Closing, Purchaser shall (i) caused to be waived
any pre-existing  condition limitations under welfare benefit plans, programs
or policies of  Purchaser or its Subsidiaries in which Company Employees
participate after  the  Closing, and (ii) cause to be credited under
Purchaser's welfare plans,  programs or policies that cover Company Employees
any deductibles and  out-of-pocket expenses, co-pays and similar payments
incurred by such employees  and their beneficiaries and dependents under a
comparable Benefit Plan in  the  plan year which contains the Closing Date.

 

 

(d) Seller  will transfer the aggregate health care flexible spending account
balances  and  the aggregate dependent care flexible spending account
balances of Company  Employees under the Seller-Sponsored Benefit Plans to
the health care flexible  spending plan and dependent care flexible spending
plan, respectively,  maintained by Purchaser or the Company, as applicable,
not later than thirty  (30) days following the Closing Date. The health care
flexible  spending plan and dependent care flexible spending plan maintained
by Purchaser  or the Company, as applicable, shall provide for the health
care reimbursement  and dependent care reimbursement benefits for the Company
Employees under  those  plans, respectively, for the remainder of the
current plan years of those  plans;  provided, however, that each such
affected Company Employee receives the  appropriate credit (or debt) for his
or her transferred recordkeeping balances  under Purchaser's applicable
flexible spending plan for such  year. Seller shall not be responsible for
the provision of the health  care reimbursement and dependent care
reimbursement benefits to the Company  Employees following the transfer of
the health care flexible spending account  balances and dependent care
flexible spending account balances of the Company  Employees to the
Purchaser's plans.

 

 

(e) Seller  shall assume and be solely responsible for complying with the
requirements  of  the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of
1985, as amended  (" _COBRA_ ") including, without limitation, the provisions
of continuation  coverage with respect to all current and former employees of
the Acquired  Companies, and their spouses and dependents, for whom a
qualifying event  occurs  or has occurred prior to the Closing.

 

 

(f) Within  a  reasonable time, but not exceeding 120 days, following the
Closing Date,  Purchaser shall designate or establish one or more defined
contribution plans  to  receive a transfer of account balances of the
Company Employees maintained  under  the Seller 401(k) Plan. As soon as
reasonably possible after the  requirements set forth in the preceding
sentence are satisfied, Seller shall  cause the portion of the Seller 401(k)
Plan representing the vested and  unvested account balances of the Company
Employees to be transferred or spun  off  to the plan(s) designated or
established by Purchaser pursuant to the first  sentence of this paragraph.
Seller and Purchaser shall take all steps  necessary or appropriate to carry
out the plan-to-plan transfer or spin off  contemplated by this paragraph
(which shall be made in cash or securities  as  mutually agreed to by Seller
and Purchaser), including but not limited to,  providing any advance notice
to participants and beneficiaries of the Seller  401(k) Plan and filing any
advance notices required by any federal laws,  including the Code and the
regulations issued thereunder. Purchaser  and Seller shall make such transfer
in compliance with all applicable laws  and  shall take any and all steps
necessary or appropriate to maintain the  tax-qualified status of any plan(s)
(and the related tax-exempt status of  the  accompanying trust(s))
designated or maintained pursuant to this  paragraph. Seller shall not
accelerate the vesting of any Company  Employee in his/her benefit under the
Seller 401(k) Plan.

 

 

(g) Except  as  otherwise provided in this _Section 5.8_ and the Transition
Services  Agreement, the active participation by Company Employees in the
Seller-Sponsored  Benefit Plans shall terminate effective as of the Closing
Date; provided,  however, that Seller shall be responsible to provide, or to
arrange to provide,  all benefits and to pay, or to have paid, all amounts
owed under such plans  to  Company Employees based on their participation in
such plans through the  Closing  Date, in each case, pursuant to the terms
and conditions of the Seller-Sponsored  Benefit Plans (and as specified in
the Disclosure Schedule).

 

 

(h) Seller  shall be responsible for and assume all obligations relating to
paying any  amounts owing under the Beam Wine Estates, Inc. Long-Term
Incentive Plan  (i) to  Company Employees for the cycle 2005 through 2007 as
if such Company Employees  continued in active employment through December
31, 2007, and  satisfied all other conditions for receiving such awards and
(ii) as set  forth  in _Section 5.8(h)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule.
As of  the Closing Date, Seller shall accrue all amounts payable under the
Beam  Wine  Estates, Inc. Management Incentive Plan through the Closing
Date, and Purchaser  shall pay amounts due under such plan to the extent so 
accrued. Seller shall be responsible for any amounts owed under the  Beam
Wine Estates, Inc. Management Incentive Plan in excess of those amounts 
accrued. Prior to Closing, Seller shall amend the Beam Wine Estates,  Inc.
Management Incentive Plan to eliminate the restriction that provides  that 
such plan cannot be amended or terminated for certain individuals for twelve 
(12) months following the Closing. For the twelve (12)-month period 
following Closing, Purchaser shall provide Company Employees with annual 
incentive compensation opportunities that are substantially similar to those 
provided to employees of Purchaser.

 

 

(i) Notwithstanding  any provision in this Agreement or the Transition
Services Agreement, nothing  herein is intended to or shall be construed to
amend, modify or terminate  any  benefit plan, program or arrangement or to
affect Purchaser's or Seller's  ability to amend, modify or terminate any
benefit plan, program or  arrangement.

 

 

5.9 _Expenses_. Whether  or not the transactions contemplated hereby are
consummated, all costs and  expenses incurred in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions  contemplated hereby shall be paid by the
party incurring such  expense. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Purchaser shall
reimburse  Seller for the reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses
incurred by Seller  in  connection with providing the information provided
pursuant to _Section  5.13_ after receipt of reasonable documentation of such
costs and  expenses.

 

 

5.10 _Indebtedness_. Prior  to the Closing, the Company or Seller shall
satisfy, eliminate or cause to  be  paid all loans owing by the Acquired
Companies to Seller or any of its  Affiliates or owning to the Acquired
Companies by Seller or any of its  Affiliates.

 

 

5.11 _WARN  Act Compliance_. For  at least ninety-one (91) days following
the Closing, Purchaser will cause  the  Acquired Companies to continue the
employment of a legally sufficient number  of  employees at each "single
site of employment" (and at each "facility" and "unit" within each "single
site" of employment) so that no Acquired Company shall be  deemed to have
effected a "plant closing" or "mass layoff" under the Worker  Adjustment and
Retraining Act, 29 U.S.C. 2101-2109 (the " _WARN  Act_ "). All quoted terms
used in this _Section 5.11_ and not  otherwise defined herein shall have the
meaning ascribed to such terms under  the  WARN Act.

 

 

5.12 _Treatment  of Seller Guaranties_. Purchaser  shall use its reasonable
best efforts to have released and cancelled at the  Closing each Seller
Guaranty. If Purchaser is not able to release and  cancel such Seller
Guaranty, then Purchaser shall, at its election (a) obtain  and deliver to
Seller at the Closing letters of credit in favor of Seller,  on  terms and
conditions, and from financial institutions, which in each case  are 
reasonably satisfactory to Seller, with respect to all the obligations
covered  by each Seller Guaranty or (b) otherwise indemnify, defend and hold
harmless  Seller and each such Affiliate of Seller with respect to all
liabilities  or  expenses that might arise or be incurred by Seller or such
Affiliate of Seller  with respect to any such Seller Guaranty. Seller will,
and shall  cause its Affiliates to, cooperate and use its reasonable best
efforts to  assist  Purchaser in performing its obligations under this
_Section  5.12_.

 

 

5.13 _Further  Assurances; Post-closing Cooperation_

 

 

 

(a) From  time  to time after the Closing, each of the Seller and Purchaser
will execute  and  deliver such further instruments of conveyance and
transfer and take such  other  action as the other party may reasonably
request in order to more effectively  convey and transfer the Shares, and to
assist in completing the transactions  contemplated by this Agreement.

 

 

(b) Except  as  otherwise provided in _Article IX_, following the Closing,
to the  extent permitted under applicable law or third party confidentiality
agreements,  Seller shall afford the Purchaser and the Acquired Companies,
its counsel  and  its accountants, during normal business hours, reasonable
access to the books,  records and other data relating to the Acquired
Companies in its or its  Affiliates' possession with respect to periods prior
to the Closing and the  right to make copies and extracts therefrom, to the
extent that such access  may  be reasonably required by Purchaser and the
Acquired Companies in connection  with (i) compliance with the requirements
of any Governmental Entity, or  (ii) in connection with any actual or
threatened action or Governmental  Entity proceeding. Further, Seller agrees
for a period extending  seven (7) years after the Closing Date not to destroy
or otherwise dispose  of  any such books, records and other data unless such
party shall first offer  in  writing to surrender such books, records and
other data to the Purchaser  and the  Purchaser shall not agree in writing
to take possession thereof during the  ten  (10) day period after such offer
is made.

 

 

(c) Except  as  otherwise provided in _Article IX_, if, in order to properly
prepare  documents or reports required to be filed with Governmental Entity
or its  financial statements or to fulfill its obligations hereunder, it is
necessary  that Purchaser or Acquired Company be furnished with additional
information,  documents or records relating to the Acquired Companies not
referred to in  paragraph (b) above, and such information, documents or
records are in the  possession or control of Seller or an Affiliate thereof,
Seller agrees to  use  their commercially reasonable efforts to furnish or
make available such  information, documents or records (or copies thereof).

 

 

(d) Following  the Closing and upon Purchaser's request and in connection
with its preparation  of any audited or unaudited financial statements of the
Company and the other  Acquired Companies, Seller shall use its good faith
best efforts to provide  to  Purchaser and its Affiliates any information
relating to the Acquired Companies  determined by Purchaser or its Affiliates
to be (a) required by applicable  provisions of the Securities Laws to be
included in any filings to be made  by  Purchaser or its Affiliates with the
Securities and Exchange Commission,  or (b)  required by GAAP or applicable
Securities Laws to be included in the financial  statements of Purchaser or
its Affiliates. Such information shall be  provided to Purchaser or its
Affiliates as soon as practicable after Purchaser's  request, but in no event
later than ninety (90) days after such request for  information relevant to
Purchaser's preparation of audited financial statements  or forty-five (45)
days after such request for information relevant to  Purchaser's preparation
of unaudited financial statements or other  information. With respect to any
audited financial statements or  other information derived therefrom, Seller
shall use commercially reasonable  efforts to cause its outside independent
public accountants to (i) deliver  such  consents and comfort letters as are
required by applicable Securities Laws  or  are customary as promptly as
reasonably practicable, but in no event later  than  the date the
corresponding audited financial statements or other information  is 
required to be provided, and (ii) make available to Purchaser, any Affiliate 
of  Purchaser, any lender, any underwriter and their respective advisors
its  work  papers or other materials in its possession relating to such
financial  statements or other information and to otherwise cooperate in any
due diligence  investigation. Purchaser shall promptly reimburse Seller and
its  Affiliates for any and all out-of-pocket costs (exclusive of internal
costs)  incurred by Seller or any of the Affiliates in connection with the
actions  contemplated under this _Section 5.13_.

 

 

5.14 _Acquisition  Transactions_. Seller  shall not authorize or permit any
officer, director, employee, investment  banker, financial advisor, attorney,
accountant or other agent or representative  retained by or acting for or on
behalf of Seller to initiate or solicit an  Acquisition Transaction, or
intentionally encourage any unsolicited Acquisition  Transaction, by any
Person, or group. Seller will immediately cease  and cause to be terminated
any existing activities, discussions or negotiations  with any parties
conducted on or prior to the date of this Agreement heretofore  with respect
to any Acquisition Transaction. As used in this  Agreement, " _Acquisition
Transaction_ " means any merger, consolidation or  other business combination
or transaction involving the acquisition of the  Acquired Companies or
acquisition of the equity securities or substantially  all  of the Acquired
Company Assets (other than sales of Inventory in the ordinary  course of
business), whether for cash, securities or any other consideration  or 
combination thereof, other than pursuant to this Agreement.

 

 

5.15 _Inventory_. The  Acquired Companies shall not ship Inventory in excess
of the shipments  contemplated in Seller's 2007 shipment plan, which calls
for shipment of an  aggregate of 2,735,000 9-litre cases during the fiscal
year ended December  31,  2007.

 

 

5.16 _Owens-Illinois  Glass Company_

 

 

(a) . The  Company shall use its best efforts to enter into a contract for
the supply  of  glass from Owens-Illinois Glass Company on substantially
similar terms to  those  attached hereto as _Exhibit A_ with such changes,
insertions or omissions  as the Company, in its sole discretion determines to
be in the best interests  of  the Company.

 

 

5.17 _Insurance_. The  Acquired Companies will use commercially reasonable
efforts to maintain coverage  under the insurance policies listed in _Section
3.18_ of the Company  Disclosure Schedule for occurrences on or prior to the
Closing Date subject  to  availability of such coverage at reasonable cost
as determined in Seller's sole  discretion. Seller will use commercially
reasonable efforts to assist  any Acquired Company making a claim for

Losses for  which it may assert any other right to indemnification,
contribution or recovery  from the other party or its Affiliates (whether
under this Agreement or under  any common law theory or any statute or other
law), that party hereby waives,  releases and agrees not to assert such
right, and that party agrees to cause  each of its Affiliates to waive,

warranty, strict liability or any other theory of  liability.

 

 

(d) Notwithstanding  anything contained herein to the contrary, neither
Seller nor any of its  Affiliates shall have any liability under or otherwise

extent of a specific  accrual or reserve on or in the Final Statement of
Working Capital or to  the  extent of a specific liability on or in Final

(i) any  fraudulent, willful or intentional breach by a party of any of its

payments Seller  is  obligated to make, under this _Article VIII_ of this 
Agreement.

 

 

8.5 _Claims_. As  promptly as is reasonably practicable after becoming aware
of a claim for  indemnification under this Agreement not involving a claim,
or the commencement  of any suit, action or proceeding, of the type described
in _Section 8.6_ ,  but in any event no later than fifteen (15) days after
first becoming aware  of such claim, the Indemnified Person shall give notice
to the Indemnifying  Person of such claim, which notice shall specify the
facts alleged to constitute  the basis for such claim, the representations,
warranties, covenants and  obligations alleged to have been breached and the
amount that the Indemnified  Person seeks hereunder from the Indemnifying
Person, together with such  information as may be necessary for the
Indemnifying Person to determine  that  the limitations in _Section 8.4_
have been satisfied or do not apply;  provided that, the failure of the
Indemnified Person to give such notice  shall  not relieve the Indemnifying
Person of its obligations under this _Article  VIII_ , except to the extent
(if any) that the Indemnifying Person shall have  been prejudiced thereby.

 

 

8.6 _Notice  of Third Party Claims; Assumption of Defense_. The  Indemnified
Person shall give notice as promptly as is reasonably practicable,  but in
any event no later than fifteen (15) days after receiving notice thereof,  to
the Indemnifying Person of the assertion of any claim, or the commencement 
of  any suit, action or proceeding, by any Person not a party hereto in
respect  of  which indemnity may be sought under or pursuant to this
Agreement (which  notice  shall specify in reasonable detail the nature and
amount of such claim together  with such information as may be necessary for
the Indemnifying Person to  determine that the limitations in _Section 8.4_
have been satisfied or do  not apply); provided, that the failure of the
Indemnified Person to give  such  notice shall not relieve the Indemnifying
Person of its obligations under  this  _Article VIII_ except to the extent
(if any) that the Indemnifying Person  shall have been prejudiced thereby.
The Indemnifying Person may, at  its own expense, (a) participate in the
defense of any such claim, suit,  action or proceeding and (b) upon notice to
the Indemnified Person, at any  time during the course of any such claim,
suit, action or proceeding,  acknowledge its indemnification obligations
under this Agreement and assume  the  defense or investigation thereof with
counsel of its own choice and in the  event  of such acknowledgment and
assumption, shall have the exclusive right, subject  to clause (i) in the
proviso in _Section 8.7_ , to settle or compromise  such claim, suit, action
or proceeding. If the Indemnifying Person  assumes such defense, the
Indemnified Person shall have the right (but not  the  duty) to participate
in the defense thereof and to employ counsel, at its  own  expense, separate
from the counsel employed by the Indemnifying  Person. Whether or not the
Indemnifying Person chooses to defend or  prosecute any such claim, suit,
action or proceeding, all of the parties  hereto  shall cooperate in the
defense or prosecution thereof.

 

 

8.7 _Settlement  or Compromise_. Any  settlement or compromise made or
caused to be made by the Indemnified Person  (unless the Indemnifying Person
has the exclusive right to settle or compromise  under clause (b) of _Section
8.6_ ) or the Indemnifying Person, as the  case may be, of any such claim,
suit, action or proceeding of the kind referred  to in _Section 8.6_ shall
also be binding upon the Indemnifying Person or  the Indemnified Person, as
the case may be, in the same manner as if a final  judgment or decree had
been entered by a court of competent jurisdiction  in the  amount of such
settlement or compromise; provided, that (i) no obligation,  course of
remediation, restriction or Loss shall be imposed on the Indemnified  Person
as a result of such settlement or compromise without its prior written 
consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or 
delayed, and (ii) the Indemnified Person will not compromise or settle any 
claim, suit, action or proceeding without the prior written consent of the 
Indemnifying Person, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, 
conditioned or delayed.

 

 

8.8 _Time  Limits_. Any  right to indemnification or other recovery for
breach of representations  and  warranties under this _Article VIII_ shall
only apply to Losses with  respect to which the Indemnified Person shall have
notified the Indemnifying  Person in writing within the applicable survival
period for such representations  and warranties set forth in _Section 8.1_.
If any claim for  indemnification or other recovery is timely asserted under
this _Article  VIII_ , the Indemnified Person shall have the right to bring
an action, suit  or proceeding with respect to such claim within two (2)
years after first  giving the Indemnifying Person notice thereof, but may not
bring any such  action, suit or proceeding thereafter.

 

 

8.9 _Net  Losses and Subrogation_.

 

 

(a) Notwithstanding  anything contained herein to the contrary, the amount of
any Losses incurred  or  suffered by any Indemnified Person shall be
calculated after giving effect  to  (i) any insurance proceeds received by
the Indemnified Person (or any of  its Affiliates) with respect to such
Losses, and (ii) any recoveries  obtained by the Indemnified Person (or any
of its Affiliates) from any other  third party. Each Indemnified Person shall
exercise commercially  reasonable efforts to obtain such proceeds, benefits
and  recoveries. If any such proceeds, benefits or recoveries are received 
by an Indemnified Person (or any of its Affiliates) with respect to any
Losses  after an Indemnifying Person has made a payment to the Indemnified
Person  with  respect thereto, the Indemnified Person (or such Affiliate)
shall promptly  pay  to the Indemnifying Person the amount of such proceeds,
benefits or recoveries  (up to the amount of the Indemnifying Person's
payment).

 

 

(b) Upon  making any payment to an Indemnified Person in respect of any
Losses, the  Indemnifying Person will, subject to the subrogation rights of
any applicable  insurance policy maintained by the Indemnified Person, to the
extent of such  payment, be subrogated to all rights of the Indemnified
Person (and its  Affiliates) against any third party in respect of the Losses
to which such  payment relates. Such Indemnified Person (and its Affiliates)
and  Indemnifying Person will execute upon request all instruments
reasonably  necessary to evidence or further perfect such subrogation rights.

withheld or delayed) any filings made pursuant to  or in  furtherance of the
Section 338(h)(10) Election (including IRS Form 8883)  prior  to the making
of such filing and (iii) take all actions necessary and  appropriate
(including filing any necessary forms, returns, elections, schedules  and
other documents) as may be required to timely effect and preserve (and 
refrain from taking any actions that interfere with or prevent) the Section 
338(h)(10) Election in accordance with the provisions of Section 338(h)(10) 
of  the Code and Treasury Regulation Section 1.338(h)(10)-1 (or any
comparable  provisions of state or local Tax law). Notwithstanding any
other  provision of this Agreement, Seller and its Affiliates (other than the
Acquired  Companies) shall include any income, gain, loss or deduction
resulting from  any  Section 338(h)(10) Election on its or their Income Tax
Returns as required  by  applicable law, and Purchaser shall have no
responsibility for paying Taxes  attributable to such income or gain or
reimbursing Income Taxes paid with  respect to such income or gain. For
purposes of clarity, for purposes  of the prior sentence, Taxes resulting
from any Section 338(h)(10) Election  made  in 2007 include, but are not
limited to, state or local Taxes due in 2008  Tax  Returns to the extent
that they are attributable to income and gain resulting  from a Section
338(h)(10) Election (e.g., the net income basis of the Ohio  corporation
franchise tax on the 2008 Ohio corporate franchise tax return  and  the
Texas margin tax or the tax due on net taxable earned surplus on the  2008 
Texas corporation franchise tax report, as the case may be).

 

 

(b) Without  limitation on any other provision hereof, not fewer than five
(5) Business  Days  prior to the Closing Date, Purchaser shall provide to
Seller a fully completed  and executed IRS Form 8023, dated as of the Closing
Date, in respect of the  Section 338(h)(10) Election. Seller, after reviewing
such Form 8023  pursuant to _Section 9.1(a)(ii)(B) above,_ shall execute and
deliver to  Purchaser at Closing such Form 8023 and Purchaser shall promptly
file such  form  with the appropriate IRS Center and provide Seller with
proof of  mailing. No later than 90 days after the Closing Date, or earlier
if  required under applicable state and local law, Seller and Purchaser
shall  mutually prepare any forms or schedules similar to IRS Form 8023 that
are  required for provisions of state or local law that are comparable to
Treasury  Regulations Section 1.338(h)(10)-1, and Purchaser shall file such
form on  a  timely basis and provide Seller with notice of such filing, in a
manner similar  to the procedures described in the preceding sentence.

 

 

(c) The  "aggregate deemed sales price" (as defined in Treasury Regulation
Section  1.338-4) and the "adjusted grossed-up basis" (as defined in Treasury
Regulation  Section 1.338-5) (the " _AGUB_ ") shall be allocated among the
assets of the  Acquired Companies (the " _Assets_ ") in accordance with
Treasury Regulation  Sections 1.338-6 and 1.338-7. Purchaser shall provide
Seller with the  amount of Purchaser's acquisition costs that are to be set
forth in box 5b of  IRS Form 8883 within 60 days after the Closing Date.
Seller shall  provide to Purchaser, and Purchaser and Seller shall mutually
determine the  AGUB  and agree upon, an allocation of the AGUB among the
Assets within 120 days  after  the Closing Date (the " _Allocation Schedule_
"). If within 30  days of receipt of the Allocation Schedule, the parties do
not agree to one  or  more items to be reflected on the Allocation Schedule,
Purchaser and Seller  shall negotiate in good faith to resolve such dispute.
If Purchaser  and Seller fail to resolve any such dispute within 30 days, the
parties shall  submit the dispute for resolution to the Arbiter, whose
resolution of the  dispute shall be conclusive and binding on both parties.
The fees and  disbursements of the Arbiter shall be paid 50% by Purchaser and
50% by  Seller. The Allocation Schedule shall be adjusted in accordance
with  the Arbiter's resolution of the dispute. Seller and Purchaser shall 
file IRS Form 8883 and any other state or local Tax forms required for the 
Section 338(h)(10) Election in accordance with the Allocation  Schedule. The
parties agree not to take any position inconsistent  with the Allocation
Schedule for Tax reporting purposes.

for the most  recent Tax periods for which Tax Returns involving similar
matters have been  filed.

 

 

(d) The  Acquired Companies will be included in the consolidated federal
Income Tax  Return that include the Seller for the calendar year 2007 (the "

packages (which shall be prepared in accordance with instructions  and
procedures furnished by Seller), and such other information as Seller  may 
reasonably request, to enable Seller to include the Acquired Companies in 
the  2007 Consolidated Return (to the extent information was not previously

shall furnish to  Purchaser a copy of the pro forma separate federal Income
Tax Returns of  each  Acquired Company, or similar data, used in the
preparation and filing of  the  2007 Consolidated Return.

 

 

(e) At  least  sixty (60) days prior to the due date (taking into account
applicable  extensions) (or filing date in the case of an amended Tax Return)
for filing  any  Tax Return for which Purchaser is responsible for filing
under _Section  9.2(b)_ , Purchaser shall make available a substantially
final draft of such  Tax Return (or relevant portions thereof) for review and
comment by the  Seller. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, all
decisions  relating to the preparation of such Tax Returns shall be made in
the sole  discretion of the Purchaser. Seller shall provide Purchaser with 
comments, if any, to any Straddle Period Tax Return that Purchaser is 
responsible for filing under _Section 9.2(b)_ no later than 30 days 
following Seller\'s receipt of the draft of such Straddle Period Tax Return, 
which comments Purchaser shall consider in good faith in connection with 
the  filing of such Straddle Period Tax Return. Purchaser and Seller shall

Straddle Period Tax Return within 10 days of Purchaser's receipt of Seller's 
comments. If Purchaser and Seller fail to resolve such dispute within  ten
(10) days, the appropriate treatment of such items shall be determined  by 
the Arbiter (with joint instruction by Seller and Purchaser to deliver its 
determination no later than seven (7) Business Days prior to the due date  of
any  Straddle Period Tax Return (taking into account applicable
extensions)),  and  such Straddle Period Tax Return shall be filed in
accordance with the Arbiter's  determination. No later than five (5) Business
Days prior to the due  date of any Straddle Period Tax Return (taking into
account applicable  extensions) to be prepared by Purchaser, Seller shall
reimburse Purchaser  for  the portion of Taxes related to such Straddle
Period Tax Return that  are allocable to the portion of the Straddle Period
ending on the Closing  Date  as determined under _Section 9.6_ to the extent
Seller's portion of such  Taxes exceeds the sum of (i) all estimates and
credits paid or taken by or  on  behalf of the Acquired Companies on or
prior to the Closing Date in respect  of  such Straddle Period Taxes and
(ii) the amount included as a liability in  the  Final Statement of Working
Capital. All such Straddle Period Tax  Returns will be filed by Purchaser
when due in accordance with applicable  laws.

 

 

(f) At  least  sixty (60) days prior to the due date (taking into account
applicable  extensions) (or filing date in the case of an amended Tax Return)
for filing  any  stand-alone Straddle Period Income Tax Return for which
Seller is responsible  for filing under _Section 9.2(a)_ , Seller shall make
available a  substantially final draft of such Tax Return (or relevant
portions thereof)  for  review and comment by the Purchaser. Subject to the
provisions of  this Agreement, all decisions relating to the preparation of
such Tax Returns  shall be made in the sole discretion of the Seller.
Purchaser shall  provide Seller with comments, if any, to any Straddle Period
Income Tax Return  that Seller is responsible for filing under _Section
9.2(a)_ no later than  30 days following Purchaser's receipt of the draft of
such Straddle Period  Income Tax Return, which comments Seller shall consider
in good faith in  connection with the filing of such Straddle Period Income
Tax  Return. Purchaser and Seller shall negotiate in good faith to resolve 
any disputed items with respect to such Straddle Period Income Tax Return 
within  10 days of Seller's receipt of Purchaser\'s comments. If Purchaser
and  Seller fail to resolve such dispute within ten (10) days, the
appropriate  treatment of such items shall be determined by the Arbiter (with
joint  instruction by Seller and Purchaser to deliver its determination no
later  than  seven (7) Business Days prior to the due date of any Straddle
Period Income  Tax  Return (taking into account applicable extensions)) ,
and such Straddle Period  Income Tax Return shall be filed in accordance with
the Arbiter's  determination. No later than five (5) Business Days prior to
the due  date of any Straddle Period Income Tax Return (taking into account
applicable  extensions) to be prepared by Seller, Purchaser shall reimburse
Seller for  the  portion of Taxes related to such Straddle Period Income Tax
Return  that are allocable to the portion of the Straddle Period commencing
after  the  Closing Date as determined under _Section 9.6_ to the extent

and credits  paid  or taken by or on behalf of the Acquired Companies after
the Closing Date  in  respect of such Straddle Period Income Taxes. All such
Straddle  Period Income Tax Returns will be filed by Seller when due in
accordance  with  applicable laws.

 

 

9.3 _Tax  Contests_.  

 

 

(a) Seller  shall have the exclusive right to represent the interests of the
Acquired  Companies in any and all Tax audits, assessments or administrative
or court  proceedings (" _Tax Proceedings_ ") relating to Tax Returns for Tax
periods  that end on or prior to the Closing Date to the extent that such Tax
Proceeding  (i) may affect the Tax liability of Seller or any Acquired
Company for any  Tax  period ending on or prior to the Closing Date or any
Straddle Period or (ii)  may  give rise to a Seller indemnification
obligation under this Agreement; provided,  however, that Purchaser, at its
own expense, shall have the right to participate  in any such Tax Proceeding
and to employ counsel of its choice (which counsel  shall be reasonably
acceptable to Seller) for purposes of such participation  to  the extent
that any compromise, settlement, consent or agreement in such  Tax 
Proceeding would have a material adverse affect on Purchaser and its
Affiliates  after the Closing Date. Seller and Purchaser shall jointly agree
on  the conduct of any Tax Proceedings relating to any Straddle Period Tax
Return  to  the extent that Seller may have an indemnification obligation
with respect  to  such Straddle Period Tax Return under this Agreement.

 

 

(b) In  the  event that Purchaser proposes to compromise or settle any Tax
claim, or consent  or agree to any Tax liability relating to the Acquired
Companies for any  Tax  period ending on or before the Closing Date or any
Straddle Period, Seller  shall  have the right to review such proposed
compromise, settlement, consent,  agreement or amendment. Without the prior
written consent of Seller,  which shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed, Purchaser shall not  agree  or consent to compromise or settle any
issue or claim arising in any such  Tax  Proceeding, or otherwise agree to
or consent to any Tax liability, to the  extent  that any such compromise,
settlement, consent, agreement or amendment may  affect  the Tax liability
of the Seller or any Acquired Company (or any Tax Group  of  which Seller or
any Acquired Company is a member) for any Tax period ending  on  or prior to
the Closing Date or any Straddle Period.

 

 

(c) Purchaser  shall promptly notify Seller in writing upon receipt by the
Purchaser or  any  Affiliate of Purchaser (including any Acquired Company)
of any pending or  threatened Tax Proceedings relating to the income,
properties or operations  of  any Acquired Company for any Tax period ending
on or prior to the Closing  Date  or any Straddle Period.

 

 

9.4 _Payments_.  

 

 

(a) _Timing  Adjustments_.

 

 

(i) _Timing  Differences_. If a Tax Proceeding or an amendment to a Tax
Return  results in a Timing Difference, and such Timing Difference results in
a decrease  in an indemnity obligation Seller has or would otherwise have
under _Section  8.2_ and/or an increase in the amount of a Tax refund or
credit to which  Seller is entitled under _Section 9.5_ for a Tax period,
then in each  subsequent Tax period in which an Acquired Company (or any Tax
Group of which  such Acquired Company is a member) Actually Realizes an
Income Tax Detriment,  Seller shall pay to Purchaser an amount equal to such
Income Tax Detriment;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the aggregate payments
which Seller shall  be required to make under this _Section 9.4(a)(i)_ with
respect to any  Timing Difference shall not exceed the aggregate amount of
the Income Tax  Benefits realized by the Seller (or any Tax Group of which
the Seller or  any  Affiliate is a member) for such initial Tax period as a
result of such Timing  Difference. Seller shall make all such payments within
ten days after  Purchaser notifies Seller that the relevant Income Tax
Detriment has been  Actually Realized.

 

 

(ii) _Reverse  Timing Differences_. If a Tax Proceeding or an amendment to a
Tax  Return results in a Reverse Timing Difference, and such Reverse Timing 
Difference results in an increase in an indemnity payment obligation of
Seller  under _Section 8.2_ (or Seller otherwise bears or has borne such
increase  in Taxes without reimbursement by Purchaser), and/or a decrease in
the amount  of  a Tax refund or credit to which Seller is or would otherwise
be entitled  under  _Section 9.5_ for a Tax period, then in each subsequent
Tax period in which  an Acquired Company (or any Tax Group of which such
Acquired Company is a  member) Actually Realizes an Income Tax Benefit,
Purchaser shall pay to Seller  within ten days after Purchaser has Actually
Realized such Income Tax Benefit  an  amount equal to such Income Tax
Benefit; _provided_ , _however_ , that  the aggregate payments which
Purchaser shall be required to make under this  _Section 9.4(a)(ii)_ with
respect to Reverse Timing Differences shall not  exceed the aggregate amount
of the Income Tax Detriments realized by Seller  (or  any Tax Group of which
the Seller or any Affiliate is a member) for such  initial  Tax period as a
result of such Reverse Timing Difference.

 

 

(iii) _Offsetting  Liabilities_. If a Tax Proceeding or an amendment to a Tax
Return  relating to an Acquired Company results in an increase in foreign,
state  or  local Income Tax liability that results in an increase in an
indemnity payment  obligation of Seller under _Section 8.2(a)_ (or Seller
otherwise bears or  has borne such increase in Taxes without reimbursement by
Purchaser), coupled  with a reduction in U.S. federal, state or local Income
Tax liability  attributable to such Tax Proceeding or amendment to a Tax
Return for the  same  Tax year, then to the extent the Acquired Company (or
a Tax Group of which  an  Acquired Company is a member) Actually Realizes an
Income Tax Benefit, Purchaser  shall pay to Seller within ten days after
Purchaser has Actually Realized  such  Income Tax Benefit an amount equal to
such Income Tax Benefit; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the aggregate
payments which Purchaser shall be required  to  make under this _Section
9.4(a)(iii)_ shall not exceed the aggregate amount  of the Income Tax Benefit
arising in respect of such increase in state, local  or  foreign Income Tax
liability for which Seller is liable under _Section  8.2(a)_ (or for which
Seller otherwise bears or has borne without  reimbursement by Purchaser).

 

 

(b) _Time  for Payment_. Except as otherwise provided in this _Section
9.4(b)_ , any  indemnity payment for Taxes required to be made pursuant to
this Agreement  shall  be paid within thirty days after the indemnified
party makes written demand  (which written demand shall set forth such
computations and descriptions  as may  be necessary to identify and support
the basis for the determination of the  indemnity payment amount) upon the
indemnifying party, provided that in no  event  shall such payment be
required to be made earlier than five Business Days  prior  to the date on
which the relevant Taxes (including estimated Taxes) are required  to be paid
(or would be required to be paid if no such Taxes are due) to  the  relevant
Tax authority.

 

 

(c) _Payments  Net of Taxes and Tax Benefits_. All amounts paid pursuant to
the  indemnification provisions of _Article VIII_ shall, to the extent
permitted  by applicable law, be treated as adjustments to the Purchase Price
for all  Tax  purposes. The amount of any indemnity payment under Article
VIII  shall be (i) reduced to take into account any net Tax benefit realized
by  the  recipient's Tax Group arising from the incurrence or payment by
such recipient's  Tax Group of any amount in respect of which such payment is
made and (ii)  increased to take into account any net Tax cost incurred by
the recipient's Tax  Group as a result of the receipt or accrual of payments
hereunder (grossed-up  for such increase), in each case determined by
treating the recipient as  recognizing all other items of income, gain, loss,
deduction or credit before  recognizing any item arising from the receipt of
accrual of any payment  hereunder; provided, that the parties hereto
acknowledge that the Tax items  giving rise to payments hereunder, and the
payments hereunder, may affect  computations of earnings and profits and
stock basis and that no such effects  on  earnings and profits or stock
basis shall be taken into account in computing  the  amount of any payment
due under this Agreement. In determining the amount  of any  such Tax
benefit or Tax cost, (I) if the recipient's Tax Group's taxable income  for
the year, after taking into account tax loss carryovers, is negative  or 
zero, the recipient's Tax Group shall be deemed not subject to Tax for such 
purpose, and (II) in all other cases, the recipient's Tax Group shall be
deemed  to be subject to Tax as follows: (A) U.S. federal Income Taxes at the
maximum  statutory rate then in effect and (B) U.S. state and local Income
Taxes at  an  assumed rate of five percent (which rate is assumed to have
been reduced  to take  into account the deductibility of state and local
Income Taxes for U.S. federal  Income Tax purposes). Except as otherwise
provided in this Agreement  or unless the parties otherwise agree to an
alternative method for determining  the present value of any such anticipated
Tax benefit or Tax cost, any payment  hereunder shall initially be made
without regard to this _Section 9.4(c)_   and shall be increased or reduced
to reflect any such net Tax cost (including  gross-up) or net Tax benefit
only after the recipient's Tax Group has Actually  Realized such Tax cost or
Tax benefit.

 

 

9.5 _Tax  Refunds and Carrybacks_.

 

 

(a) _Retention  and Payment of Tax Refunds_. Except as otherwise provided in
this  Agreement, Seller shall be entitled to retain, and to receive within
ten  days  after Actually Realized by an Acquired Company (or a Tax Group of
which an  Acquired Company is a member), the portion of all refunds or
credits of Taxes  that relate to Tax Periods or portions thereof ending on or
before the Closing  Date.

 

 

(b) _Carrybacks_. Unless  the parties otherwise agree in writing, Purchaser
shall elect and shall cause  each Acquired Company to elect, where permitted
by law, to carry forward  any net  operating loss, net capital loss,
charitable contribution or other item arising  after the Closing Date that
could, in the absence of such election, be carried  back to any period ending
on or prior to the Closing Date.

 

 

(c) _Refund  Claims_. Seller shall be permitted to file at Seller's sole 
expense, and each Acquired Company (and any Tax Group of which an Acquired 
Company is a member) shall reasonably cooperate with Seller in connection 
with,  any claims for refund of Taxes to which Seller is entitled pursuant to
this  _Section 9.5_ or any other provision of this Agreement. Seller  shall
reimburse the relevant Acquired Company (or Tax Group of which it is  a 
member) for any reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by such 
Acquired Company (or such Tax Group) in connection with such  cooperation.
Each Acquired Company shall be permitted to file at such  Acquired Company's
sole expense, and Seller shall reasonably cooperate with such  Acquired
Company in connection with, any claims for refunds of Taxes to which  such
Acquired Company is entitled pursuant to this _Section 9.5_ or any  other
provision of this Agreement.

 

 

(d) _Duty  Drawback Claims_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to 
the contrary, the Acquired Companies and Purchaser shall be entitled to
apply  for and receive, solely for their own account, any credits under 19
U.S.C. § 1313(j)(2) to which the Acquired Companies and Purchaser may be 
entitled.

 

 

9.6 _Straddle  Period Taxes_.

 

 

It  is  anticipated that, in the case of each Acquired Company that files an
Income  Tax  Return with a member of the Tax Group that includes Seller or
any Affiliate  of  Seller (other than an Acquired Company) during all or a
portion of calendar  year  2007, (i) the relevant Tax year of such Acquired
Company beginning on January  1,  2007 will end on the Closing Date, and
items of income, gain, loss, deduction  and credit with respect to such short
Tax year shall be included in such  Income  Tax Return and (ii) items of
income, gain, loss, deduction and credit with  respect to the short Tax year
of such Acquired Company beginning on the day  after the Closing Date will
not be included in such Income Tax  Return. Accordingly, it is not
anticipated that any Straddle Period  will exist with respect to any such
Income Tax Return. If a Straddle  Period Income Tax Return exists, for all
purposes of this Agreement, the  Taxes  of any Acquired Company or its
business, assets or activities for that portion  of any Straddle Period
ending on the Closing Date shall be computed on a  "closing-of-the-books"
basis as if such Tax period ended as of the close of  business on the Closing
Date, and the Taxes of such Acquired Company or its  business, assets or
activities for that portion of any Straddle Period beginning  after the
Closing Date shall be computed on a "closing-of-the-books" basis as if  such
Tax period began on the day after the Closing Date. For all  Taxes (other
than Income Taxes), the Taxes of any Acquired Company or its  business,
assets or activities for any Straddle Period shall be computed  on a  per
diem basis and allocated between the period ended as of the close of 
business on the Closing Date the period beginning after the Closing Date 
based  on the number of days in such periods divided by the total number of
days  in the  relevant Straddle Period.

 

 

9.7 _Cooperation  on Tax Matters_

 

 

 

(a) Purchaser  and Seller shall, and Seller shall cause the Acquired
Companies to, cooperate  fully and promptly, as and to the extent reasonably
requested by the other  party, in connection with (i) filing any Tax Return,
amended Tax Return or  other Tax filing or claim for refund of Taxes, (ii)
determining any Tax  liability or right to refund of Taxes, (iii) conducting
or defending any  Tax Proceeding, or (iv) effectuating the terms of this 
Agreement. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the  other
party's request) the provision of records and information which are 
reasonably relevant to any such audit, litigation or other proceeding and 
making  employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide
additional  information and explanation of any material provided  hereunder.
Purchaser and Seller agree (i) to retain all books and  records with respect
to Tax matters pertinent to the Acquired Companies relating  to any taxable
period beginning before the Closing Date until the expiration  of  the
statute of limitations (and, to the extent notified by Purchaser or Seller, 
any extensions thereof) of the respective taxable periods, and to abide by 
all  record retention agreements entered into with any Tax authority, and
(ii)  to  give the other party reasonable written notice prior to
transferring, destroying  or discarding any such books and records and, if
the other party so requests,  Purchaser or Seller, as the case may be, shall
allow the other party to take  possession of copies of such books and
records. Notwithstanding the  foregoing, no party shall be unreasonably
required to prepare any document,  or  determine any information, not then
in its possession in response to a request  under this _Section 9.7(a)_.

 

 

(b) Purchaser  and Seller further agree, upon request, to use their best
efforts to obtain  any  certificate or other document from any Governmental
Entity or any other Person  as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or
eliminate any Tax that could be  imposed (including, but not limited to, with
respect to the transactions  contemplated hereby).

 

 

(c) Purchaser  and Seller further agree, upon request, to provide the other
party with all  information that either party may be required to report
pursuant to Section  6043  of the Code and the regulations promulgated
thereunder.

 

 

9.8 _Stock  Option Tax Deductions_. Purchaser  agrees and acknowledges that
any post-Closing Date Tax deductions in respect  of  Fortune Brands, Inc.
common stock options exercised by Acquired Company  employees and former
employees shall be for the benefit of Seller or its  Affiliates. In the event
the IRS disallows or prohibits Seller or its  Affiliate from claiming any
such post-Closing Date Tax deductions, then  Purchaser shall cause the
appropriate Acquired Company (or Tax Group of which  it  is a member) to
cooperate and use all reasonable good faith efforts to claim  such post-
Closing Date Tax deductions and remit the amount of any Tax benefit  in 
respect of such Tax deductions within ten (10) business days after such
amount  is Actually Realized by such Acquired Company (or Tax Group of which
it is  a  member). In the event the IRS disallows or prohibits Purchaser or
its  Affiliates from claiming any such Tax deduction, then Seller shall
reimburse  Purchaser any amounts Purchaser paid to Seller under this
Section  9.8.

 

 

9.9 _Transfer  and Similar Taxes_.  

 

 

(a) Purchaser  shall be responsible for the payment of all transfer,
documentary, sales,  use,  stamp, excise, registration, documentary
transfer, real estate transfer or  gain,  and other such similar Taxes and
fees incurred in connection with this Agreement  and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Purchaser shall  prepare all necessary Tax
Returns and other documentation that it is required  to  prepare under
applicable law with respect to all Taxes referenced in the  previous
sentence. If required by applicable law, Seller will, and  will cause its
Affiliates to, join in the execution of any such Tax Returns  and  other
documentation.

 

 

(b) Seller  shall terminate or cause to be terminated any and all Tax
allocation or sharing  agreements in effect on the Closing Date as between
the Seller and its  Affiliates (other than the Acquired Companies), on the
one hand, and the  Acquired Companies, on the other hand.

 

 

_ARTICLE  X_

 

 

_Termination_

 

 

10.1 _Termination_. This  Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to
the Closing:

 

 

(a) by  mutual  written consent of Seller and Purchaser;

 

 

(b) by  either  Seller or Purchaser, upon written notice to the other party,
if any Governmental  Entity of competent jurisdiction shall have issued an
order, decree or ruling  or  taken any other action permanently enjoining,
restraining or otherwise  prohibiting the transactions contemplated hereby
and such order, decree or  ruling or other action shall have become final and
nonappealable; provided,  however, that the right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this _Section  10.1(b)_ shall not be available to any party that
has not used its  commercially reasonable efforts to cause such order, decree
or ruling to  be  lifted;

 

 

(c) by  Seller, upon written notice to Purchaser, at any time, if Purchaser
fails  to  complete and file the HSR Submission within three (3) Business
Days of the  date  hereof;

dollar amount or any item or matter in any provision  of  this Agreement nor
the inclusion of any specific item or matter in any Company  Disclosure
Schedule hereto is intended to imply that such amount, or higher  or  lower

matter, or other items or matters, are or are not in the ordinary course

course of business  for purposes of this Agreement.

 

 

11.3 _Disclaimer  of Warranties_. Neither  Seller nor any of its Affiliates
make any representations or warranties with  respect to any projections,
forecasts or forward-looking statements made  available to Purchaser or its
Representatives. There is no assurance  that any projected or forecasted
results will be achieved. Purchaser  acknowledges and agrees that it is not
relying on any representations or  warranties, except for the representations
and warranties contained in  _Article III_ hereof. The Purchaser acknowledges
and agrees that  neither Seller, the Company, their Affiliates, any of their
respective  representatives nor any other Person has made any representation
or warranty,  express or implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of any
memoranda,  presentations, charts, summaries, schedules or other information
heretofore  made  available by Seller, the Company, their Affiliates or
their respective  Representatives to Purchaser, any of its Affiliates or
their Representatives  (including the discussion materials dated September,
2007 and October, 2007)  or  any information that is not included in this
Agreement or the Company Disclosure  Schedules hereto, and neither Seller,
the Company, their Affiliates, any  of  their respective Representatives nor
any other Person will have or be subject  to  any liability to Purchaser,
any of its Affiliates or their Representatives  resulting from the
distribution of any such information to, or the use of  any  such
information by, Purchaser, any of its Affiliates or any of their 
Representatives.

 

 

11.4 _Assignment_. No  party hereto may assign its rights or obligations
hereunder without the other  party's prior written consent; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Purchaser  may (a) assign any or all of its rights, title,
privileges, benefits, interests  and remedies hereunder to any one or more of
its Affiliates; (b) designate  any  one or more of its Affiliates to perform
its obligations hereunder (in any  or  all of which cases Purchaser
nonetheless shall remain responsible for the  performance of all of its
obligations hereunder); and (c) assign any or all  of  its rights, title,
privileges, benefits, interests and remedies hereunder  to and  for the
benefit of any lender to Purchaser, or the Acquired Companies for  the 
purpose of providing collateral security. Subject to the foregoing,  this
Agreement benefits and binds Seller and Purchaser and their respective 
heirs, personal representatives, successors and assigns.

 

 

11.5 _Entire  Agreement_. This  Agreement, the Company Disclosure Schedules
and Exhibits attached hereto,  and  the Confidentiality Agreement constitute
the entire agreement between Seller  and  Purchaser and supersede all other
prior agreements, understandings,  representations and warranties both
written and oral, among the parties,  with  respect to the subject matter
hereof. This Agreement shall not confer  any rights or remedies upon any
Person other than the parties hereto and  their  respective successors and
permitted assigns and, to the extent specified  herein,  their respective
Affiliates, and no person shall be deemed a third party  beneficiary
hereunder.

 

 

11.6 _Specific  Performance_. The  parties hereto agree and acknowledge
that, in the event of a breach of any  provision of this Agreement, the
aggrieved party may be without an adequate  remedy at law. The parties
therefore agree that in the event of a  breach of any provision of this
Agreement the aggrieved party may elect to  institute and prosecute
proceedings in any court of competent jurisdiction  to  obtain specific
performance or to enjoin the continuing breach of such  provision, as well as
to obtain damages for breach of this Agreement and  to  obtain reasonable
attorneys' fees. By seeking or obtaining any such  relief, the aggrieved
party will not be precluded from seeking or obtaining  any  other relief to
which it may be entitled.

 

 

11.7 _Governing  Law and Venue_. This  Agreement shall be construed under
and governed by the internal substantive  laws  of the State of New York
without reference to choice of law  principles. Each of the parties
irrevocably submits to the exclusive  jurisdiction of the United States
District Court for the Southern District  of  New York located in the
borough of Manhattan in the City of New York, or  if such  court does not
have jurisdiction, the Supreme Court of the State of New York,  New York
County, for the purposes of any suit, action or other proceeding  arising out
of this Agreement or any transaction contemplated  hereby. Each of the
parties hereto irrevocably and fully waives the  defense of an inconvenient
forum to the maintenance of such suit, action  or  proceeding. Each of the
parties further agrees that service of any  process, summons, notice or
document to such party's respective address listed  above in one of the
manners set forth in _Section 11.1_ hereof shall be  deemed in every respect
effective service of process in any such suit, action  or  proceeding.
Nothing herein shall affect the right of any Person to  serve process in any
other manner permitted by law. Each of the  parties hereto irrevocably and
unconditionally waives any objection to the  laying of venue of any action,
suit or proceeding arising out of this Agreement  or the transactions
contemplated hereby in the United States District Court  for  the Southern
District of New York, or if such court does not have  jurisdiction, the
Supreme Court of the State of New York, New York County,  and  hereby
further irrevocably and unconditionally waives and agrees not to plead  or 
claim in any such court that any such action, suit or proceeding brought  in
any  such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum.

 

 

11.8 _Waivers;  Amendment_. No  waiver by any party of any provision hereof
shall be deemed a waiver of any  other provision hereof or of any subsequent
breach by any party of the same  or  any other provision. This Agreement may
be amended only by a writing  executed by each of the Parties hereto.

 

 

11.9 _Captions_. The  captions and Article and Section numbers appearing in
this Agreement are  inserted only as a matter of convenience and in no way
define, limit, construe  or describe the scope or intent of such Articles or
Sections of this Agreement  nor in any way affect this Agreement.

 

 

11.10 _Severability_. The  provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed
severable and the invalidity  or  unenforceability of any provision shall
not affect the validity or  enforceability or the other provisions hereof. If
any provision of  this Agreement, or the application thereof to any Person or
any circumstance,  is  invalid or unenforceable, (a) a suitable and
equitable provision shall be  substituted therefor in order to carry out, so
far as may be valid and  enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid
or unenforceable provision  and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and the
application of such  provision to other Persons or circumstances shall not be
affected by such  invalidity or unenforceability, nor shall such invalidity
or unenforceability  affect the validity or enforceability of such provision,
or the application  thereof, in any other jurisdiction.

 

 

11.11 _Interpretation_. The  table of contents and headings herein are for
convenience of reference only,  do  not constitute part of this Agreement
and shall not be deemed to limit or  otherwise affect any of the provisions
hereof. Where a reference in  this Agreement is made to a Section, Company
Disclosure Schedule or Exhibit,  such reference shall be to a Section of or
Company Disclosure Schedule or  Exhibit to this Agreement unless otherwise
indicated. Whenever the  words "include," "includes" or "including" are used
in this Agreement, they  shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without
limitation."

 

 

11.12 _Time  of Essence_. With  regard to all dates and time periods set
forth or referred to in this Agreement,  time is of the essence.

 

 

11.13 _Counterparts_. This  Agreement may be executed simultaneously in any
number of counterparts, each  of  which shall be deemed an original, but all
of which together shall constitute  one and the same instrument.
