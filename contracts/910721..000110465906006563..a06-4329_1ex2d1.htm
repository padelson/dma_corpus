Section 1.03 Certificate of Incorporation. At the Effective Time, and
without any further action on the part of the Company or Merger Sub, subject

Article II

  


 EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

  



  

Section 2.01 Effect on Capital Stock. At the Effective Time, as a result of
the Merger and without any further action on the part of the Company,
Acquirer, Merger Sub or any holder of any shares of capital stock of the
Company, Acquirer or Merger Sub:

  



  

(a) _Merger Sub_. Each share of common stock, par value of $0.01 per share,
of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and non-
assessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving
Corporation (which newly issued shares will be owned by Acquirer) and shall
thereafter constitute the only issued and outstanding shares of capital stock
of the Surviving Corporation.

  



        
   

  



  

(b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Acquirer-Owned Stock_.  Each share
of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the " _Company
Common Stock_ ") that is owned by the Company directly as treasury stock or
by Acquirer, Merger Sub or any Subsidiary of Acquirer shall automatically be
retired and shall cease to be outstanding, and no cash or other consideration
shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

  



  

(c) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Subject to Section 2.03, each
issued and outstanding share of Company Common Stock (other than shares
of Company Common Stock to be retired in accordance with Section
2.01(b)), shall be converted into the right to receive $24.05 in cash,
without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). As of the Effective Time,
all such shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and
shall automatically be retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of
any such shares of Company Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration upon
the surrender of a certificate representing such shares of Company Common
Stock in accordance with the provisions of this Article II.

  



  

(d) _Stock Options_. As of the Effective Time, each outstanding option to
purchase shares of Company Common Stock under any employee stock option or
compensation plan or arrangement of the Company (a " _Company Option_ "),
whether or not exercisable or vested, shall by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of any holder of any Company Option be
canceled and the holder thereof will receive as soon as
reasonably practicable following the Effective Time a cash payment (less any
required tax withholdings) with respect thereto equal to the product of (a)
the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per
share of such Company Option and (b) the number of shares of Company Common
Stock issuable upon exercise of such Company Option (the " _Option Cash
Payment_ "). As of the Effective Time, all Company Options shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically cease to exist, and each holder of a
Company Option shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except
the right to receive the Option Cash Payment. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall take any and all actions necessary to effectuate this Section
2.01(d), including obtaining any necessary consents.

  



  

Section 2.02 Exchange of Share Certificates.

  



  

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Acquirer shall designate a
paying agent reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as paying agent (the
" _Paying Agent_ ") for the payment of the Merger Consideration or other
payment to which holders of Company Options shall become entitled pursuant to
Section 2.01; provided that in the case of Company Options held by employees
of the Company, Acquirer shall have the option of making payment of the
applicable Option Cash Payment to such employees through the Companys
payroll, in lieu of the Paying Agent. Prior to the filing of the Certificate
of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, Acquirer
shall deposit with the Paying Agent, for the benefit of the holders of
Certificates and Company Options, cash equal to the product of (A) the number
of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding (and not to be retired pursuant
to Section 2.01(b)) as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (the "
_Company Outstanding Shares_ ") multiplied by (B) the Merger Consideration,
plus an amount equal to (C) the sum of the Option Cash Payments, such amount
subject to Acquirers option to make Option Cash Payments through the
Companys payroll as set forth above. The deposit made by Acquirer pursuant
to

  



        
   

  



  

this Section 2.02(a) is hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_."
The Paying Agent shall cause the Exchange Fund to be (i) held for the benefit
of the holders of Company Common Stock and holders of Company Options and
(ii) applied promptly to making the payments provided for in Section 2.01.
 The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any purpose that is not expressly
provided for in this Agreement.  If the Paying Agent invests the Exchange
Fund, the Paying Agent shall only invest the Exchange Fund in obligations of
or guaranteed by the United States of America and backed by the full faith
and credit of the United States of America or in commercial paper obligations
rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Services, Inc. or Standard and
Poors Corporation, respectively. Earnings from such investments shall be
the sole and exclusive property of Acquirer, and no part of such earnings
shall accrue to the benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock.

  



  

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time, Acquirer shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder
of record of a certificate representing shares of Company Common Stock (a "
_Certificate_ ") (i) a letter of transmittal specifying that delivery of the
Certificates shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) to the Paying Agent, such letter of
transmittal to be in customary form and have such other provisions
as Acquirer may reasonably specify and (ii) instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger
Consideration (such instructions shall include instructions for the payment
of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the Person in whose name
the surrendered Certificate is registered on the transfer books of the
Company, subject to the receipt of appropriate documentation for such
transfer). Upon surrender to the Paying Agent of a Certificate (or evidence
of loss in lieu thereof) for cancellation together with such letter of
transmittal, duly completed and validly executed, and such other documents as
may reasonably be requested by the Paying Agent, the holder of such
Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger
Consideration that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to this Article
II, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled; provided
that in no event will a holder of a Certificate be entitled to receive the
Merger Consideration if Merger Consideration was already paid with respect to
the shares of Company Common Stock underlying such Certificate in connection
with an affidavit of loss. No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount
payable upon due surrender of the Certificates. In the event of a
transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock that is not registered in the
transfer records of the Company, payment may be issued to such a transferee
if the Certificate formerly representing such Company Common Stock is
presented to the Paying Agent, accompanied by all documents required to
evidence and effect such transfer, and the Person requesting such issuance
pays any transfer or other taxes required by reason of such payment to a
Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or establishes to
the satisfaction of Acquirer and the Company that such tax has been paid or
is not applicable.

  



  

For the purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Person_ " shall mean any
individual, corporation (including not-for-profit corporations), general or
limited partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, estate, trust,
association, organization, Governmental Entity or other entity or group (as
defined in Section 13(d)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended (including the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the "
_Exchange Act_ ")).

  



        
   

  



  

(c) _Transfers_. After the Effective Time, there shall be no registration of
transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of Company Common Stock
that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates are presented to Acquirer or the Surviving
Corporation, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the consideration set
forth in this Article II deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this
Agreement in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 3.02.

  



  

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund; No Liability_. Any portion of the
Exchange Fund relating to the Merger Consideration that remains unclaimed by
the stockholders of the Company or holders of Company Options one year after
the Effective Time shall be returned to Acquirer. Any stockholders of the
Company or holders of Company Options who have not theretofore complied with
this Article II shall thereafter look only to Acquirer for payment of the
Merger Consideration upon due surrender of their Certificates (or affidavits
of loss in lieu thereof), without any interest thereon.  Notwithstanding the
foregoing, none of Acquirer, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation, the
Paying Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any former holder of
Company Common Stock or holder of Company Options for any amount properly
delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Laws. If any Certificates shall not have been surrendered
prior to the date immediately prior to the date that such unclaimed funds
would otherwise become subject to any abandoned property, escheat or similar
law, unclaimed funds payable with respect to such Certificates shall, to the
extent permitted by applicable law, become the property of the Surviving
Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto.

  



  

(e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed and, if required by Acquirer, the posting by such Person
of a bond reasonably satisfactory to Acquirer as indemnity against any claim
that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying
Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate
the Merger Consideration upon due delivery of such affidavit pursuant to this
Agreement.

  



  

(f) _Withholding Rights_. Each of Acquirer, Merger Sub, the Paying Agent and
the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Article II
such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the
making of such payment under provision of any United States federal, state,
local or non-United States tax law. If Acquirer, Merger Sub, the Paying Agent
or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, so withholds amounts, then
such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the holder of the Company Common Stock or Company Option
in respect of which Acquirer, Paying Agent or the Surviving Corporation, as
the case may be, made such deduction and withholding.

  



  

Section 2.03 Dissenters Rights.

  



  

(a) Notwithstanding anything in any other Section of this Agreement to the
contrary, any shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time and held by a holder who has not voted in favor of the
Merger or consented thereto in

  



        
   

  



  

writing, and who has demanded appraisal for such shares in accordance with
Section 262 of the DGCL (the " _Dissenting Shares_ "), shall not be converted
into, or represent the right to receive, the Merger Consideration, unless
such holder fails to perfect or withdraws or otherwise loses his right to
appraisal.  At the Effective Time, all Dissenting Shares shall no longer
be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist,
and each holder of Dissenting Shares shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except the right to receive, subject to and net of any
applicable withholding of Taxes, payment of the appraised value of such
Dissenting Shares held by them in accordance with the provisions of Section
262 of the DGCL. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any such holder shall
fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to
appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL or a court of competent jurisdiction
shall determine that such holder is not entitled to the relief provided by
Section 262 of the DGCL, then the right of such holder to receive, subject to
and net of any applicable withholding of Taxes, payment of the appraised
value of such Dissenting Shares held by them in accordance with the
provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL shall cease and such Dissenting Shares
shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted into, and to have become
exchangeable for, as of the Effective Time or the occurrence of such event,
whichever last occurs, the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without
any interest thereon, upon surrender, in the manner provided in Section 2.02,
of the Certificate or Certificates that formerly evidenced such Dissenting
Shares.

  



  

(b) The Company shall give Acquirer prompt notice of any demands for
appraisal received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands and any other
instruments served on or otherwise received by the Company pursuant to the
DGCL, and Acquirer shall have the right to participate in and control all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the
DGCL. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of
Acquirer, make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal or offer
to settle or settle any such demands.

New York, New York 10022 at 10:00 a.m. Eastern time on the second Business

other place and time and/or on such other date as the Company and Acquirer

Section 4.01 Representations and Warranties of the Company. Except as set
forth in the section of the disclosure schedules delivered to Acquirer by the
Company on or prior to the date of this Agreement (the " _Company Disclosure
Schedule_ ") that corresponds with the applicable subsection of Section 4.01,
the Company hereby represents and warrants to Acquirer and Merger Sub that:

power and authority to own, lease, use and operate its properties and assets
and to carry on its business as currently conducted and is qualified to do
business and is in good standing as a foreign corporation in each
jurisdiction where the ownership, lease, use or operation of its properties
and assets or conduct of its business requires such qualification, except
where the failure to be so qualified or be in good standing would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect. The Company has heretofore made available
to Acquirer true, complete and correct copies of the Companys and each of
its Subsidiaries certificate of incorporation and by-laws (or comparable
governing instruments). The certificate of incorporation and by-laws or
comparable governing instruments (" _Organizational Documents_ ") of each of
the Company and its Subsidiaries so made available are in full force and
effect.

  



  

As used in this Agreement, the term " _Affiliate_ " shall mean, with respect
to any Person, any other Person directly or indirectly controlling,
controlled by, or under common control with, such Person and shall include
any director, executive officer or other senior manager of the relevant
Person; provided, that, for the purposes of this definition, "control"
(including, with correlative meanings, the terms "controlled by" and "under
common control with"), as used with respect to any Person, shall mean the
possession, directly or indirectly, of the power to direct or cause the
direction of the management and policies of such Person, whether through the
ownership of voting securities, by contract or otherwise.

  



  

As used in this Agreement, the term " _Company Material Adverse Effect_ "
means (a) an effect that would prevent, materially delay or materially impair
the ability of the Company to consummate the Merger or otherwise prevent the
performance by the Company of any of its material obligations under this
Agreement or (b) a material adverse effect on the condition (financial or
otherwise), business, assets, liabilities, revenues or expenses of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole; provided, however, that none
of the following shall be deemed to constitute a Company Material Adverse
Effect: (i) any effect resulting from a change in the market price or trading
volume of the Company Common Stock, in and of itself, or related to any
failure by the Company to meet or exceed forecasts of the Company (ii) any
effect resulting from events, facts or circumstances relating to the economy
in general, including changes in financial, banking, or securities markets
(including any disruption thereof and any decline in the price of any
security or any market index), or to the Companys industry in general and
not specifically relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, other
than any such effects that

  



        
   

  



  

disproportionately impact the Company and its Subsidiaries, (iii) any effect
resulting from changes in legal or regulatory conditions generally affecting
the industries in which the Company conducts business, other than any such

Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (including the impact of
this Agreement on relationships with customers, suppliers, distributors,

As used in this Agreement, the term "knowledge," of any Person which is not
an individual means the actual knowledge of such Persons executive officers
or other senior managers who should have knowledge of such matters in the
course of performing their professional duties.

  



  

(b) _Capital Structure_. The authorized capital stock of the Company
consists of 31,000,000 shares, consisting of (i) 30,000,000 shares of Company
Common Stock, of which 20,399,196 shares are outstanding as of the date
hereof, and (ii) 1,000,000 shares of special preferred stock, par value $0.01
per share, none of which are outstanding as of the date hereof. Each of the
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock is duly authorized,
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable.  Each of the outstanding
shares of capital stock or other securities of each of the Companys
Subsidiaries that is a corporation is duly authorized, validly issued, fully
paid and nonassessable and is owned by the Company or a direct or indirect
wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company, free and clear of any Lien (including
any restriction on the right to vote, sell or otherwise dispose of such

partnership arrangements) or have any investment in any other Person. Section
4.01(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule lists, as to each Company Option,
the holder, date of grant, exercise price and number of shares
subject thereto. Other than options to purchase up to 3,296,952 shares of
Company Common Stock at a weighted average exercise price of $16.061 per
share pursuant to the Companys 2001 Incentive and Non-Statutory Stock Option
Plan and the Companys 1993 Incentive and Non-Qualified Stock Option Plan
(collectively, the " _Company Option Plans_ "), and other than shares of
Company Common Stock issuable pursuant to the Companys 1998 Employee Stock
Purchase Plan (the " _ESPP_ "), there are no preemptive or other outstanding
rights, options, warrants, conversion rights, stock appreciation rights,
redemption rights, repurchase rights, agreements, arrangements or commitments
of any kind to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, or by
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries are bound, obligating the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to issue, deliver or sell, or cause to be
issued, delivered or sold, any shares of capital stock or other securities of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any securities or obligations
convertible or exchangeable

  



        
   

  



  

into or exercisable for, or giving any Person a right to subscribe for or
acquire, any securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and no
securities or obligations evidencing such rights are authorized, issued or
outstanding. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or
has knowledge of any voting or other stockholders agreement with respect to
its securities or the securities of any of its Subsidiaries. There are not
any outstanding contractual obligations of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire or to file any
registration statement with respect to any shares of capital stock of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Following the consummation of the
Merger, there will not be outstanding any rights, warrants, options or other
securities entitling the holder thereof to purchase, acquire or otherwise
receive any shares of the capital stock of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (or any other securities exercisable for or convertible
into such shares). Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has
outstanding any bonds, debentures, notes or other obligations the holders of
which have the right to vote (or convertible into or exercisable for
securities having the right to vote) with the stockholders of the Company or
any Subsidiary of the Company on any matter or any agreements with respect to
the voting of any Company Common Stock.

  



  

As used in this Agreement, the term " _Subsidiary_ " means with respect to
any Person, any corporation, partnership, joint venture, limited liability
company or other legal entity of which such Person (either alone or through
or together with any other Subsidiary) owns, directly or indirectly, 50% or
more of the economic interests in, or voting rights with respect to the
election of the board of directors or other governing body of, such
corporation or other legal entity.

  



  

As used in this Agreement, the term " _Lien_ " means, with respect to any
property or asset, any mortgage, lien, pledge, charge, security interest,
encumbrance, easements, rights-of-way, licenses, use restrictions, options,
title defects option, conditional sale agreement, right of first refusal,
first offer, termination, participation or similar adverse claim of any kind
in respect of such property or asset (including any agreement to give any of
the foregoing); provided, however, that in no event shall a "bare" license to
intellectual property (e.g., a license alone, or a license that is part of a
larger arrangement but excluding all other portions of such larger
arrangement) in itself constitute a Lien on such intellectual property.
For purposes of this Agreement, a Person shall be deemed to own subject to a
Lien any property or asset that it has acquired or holds subject to the
interest of a vendor or lessor under any conditional sale agreement, capital
lease or other title retention agreement relating to such property or asset.

  



  

(c) _Corporate Authority_.

  



  

#### (i) The Company has all requisite corporate power and authority and has
taken all corporate action necessary in order to execute, deliver and perform
its obligations under this Agreement and, except any actions to be taken by
its stockholders at a Special Meeting as contemplated herein, to consummate,

transactions contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been duly authorized,
executed and delivered by the Company, and no other corporate proceedings on
the part of the Company are necessary to authorize or approve this Agreement
or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby (other than, with
respect to the Merger, the adoption of this Agreement by the affirmative vote
of the holders of a majority of the then outstanding shares of Common Stock
entitled to vote thereon, to the extent required by applicable Law). Assuming
due authorization,

this Agreement is a valid and legally binding agreement of the Company
enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms.

  

#### 

  

#### (ii) The Companys Board of Directors has unanimously approved this
Agreement and the Merger and other transactions contemplated hereby and has
recommended that the stockholders of the Company adopt this Agreement and
approve the Merger.

  

#### 

  

(d) _No Defaults_. Neither the execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement and the consummation by the Company of the transactions
contemplated hereby nor compliance by the Company with any of the provisions
hereof or thereof will constitute or result in (A) a breach or violation of,
or a default under, the Organizational Documents of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, or (B) a breach or violation of, a default under, the
termination or acceleration of any obligations under, the loss of any right
or benefit under, or the creation of a Lien on any assets of the Company or
any Subsidiary of the Company (with or without notice, lapse of time or both)
pursuant to any agreement, lease, contract, note, mortgage, indenture, bond,
deed of trust, undertaking, arrangement or other instrument or obligation
binding upon the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company or any Law or
governmental or non-governmental permit or license to which the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries is subject or (C) any change in the rights
or obligations of any party under contracts binding on the Company or
any Subsidiary of the Company, except, in the case of clause (B) or (C)
above, for such breaches, violations, defaults, accelerations, creations or
changes that would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

(e) _Consents and Approvals_. Neither the execution and delivery of this
Agreement by the Company nor the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement will result in a violation of Law by the
Company. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not
require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to (i) obtain any material
approval of any Person or (ii) observe any waiting period imposed by, or make
any filing with or notification to or seek any approval or authorization
from, any Governmental Entity except for antitrust filings under the Hart-
Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 (the " _HSR Act_ "), and
except under the rules of the Exchange Act and under the DGCL.

  



  

(f) _The Company Reports; Financial Statements_.

  



  

#### (i) The Company and its Subsidiaries have filed with the United States
Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") all registration
statements, prospectuses, forms, reports, schedules, statements and other
documents required to be filed by them since December 27, 2003 under the
Exchange Act or the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the " _Securities
Act_ ") (such documents, as supplemented and amended since the time of
filing, collectively, the " _Company Reports_ ").  The Company Reports,
including any financial statements or schedules included in the Company
Reports, at the time filed (and, in the case of registration statements and
proxy statements, on the dates of effectiveness and the dates of mailing,
respectively, and, in the case of any Company Report amended or superseded by
a filing prior to the date of this Agreement, then on the

property or assets. Each of the parties hereto shall promptly notify the
others in writing of (i) any representation or warranty made by such party
contained in this Agreement becoming untrue or inaccurate in any respect
which would be material to the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole
and (ii) any failure of such party, to comply with or satisfy, in any
material respect, any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or
satisfied by it hereunder.  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, no such notification or investigation by any party shall affect the
representations, warranties or covenants of any party or the conditions to
the obligations of any party hereunder, nor shall it limit or otherwise
affect the remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such notice.

practicable, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, the parties hereto will use
reasonable best efforts to take, and will cause each of their respective
Subsidiaries to use reasonable best efforts to take, all actions necessary
(i) to comply promptly with all legal requirements which may be imposed on
them with respect to the Merger, (ii) to cooperate promptly with and furnish
information to each other party hereto in connection with any such
requirements imposed upon any party hereto in connection with the Merger and
(iii) to obtain

effort or attempt by any other Person (other than Merger Sub, Acquirer or any
of their Representatives, as applicable) to make or effect an Acquisition
Proposal, (iii) enter into any agreement, arrangement, understanding or
contract (including a letter of intent) with respect to, or otherwise
endorse, any Acquisition Proposal, (iv) enter into any
agreement, arrangement, or contract requiring the Company to abandon,

shall prohibit the Companys Board of Directors prior to adoption of this
Agreement and approval of the Merger by the stockholders of the Company at
the Special Meeting, from furnishing information to, or engaging in
discussions or negotiations with (including making counter proposals to), any
Person that makes an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal
(which did not result from a breach of this Section 6.07) if (A) the
Companys Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation
with its financial advisors and outside legal advisors, that the failure to
take such action would be reasonably be expected to result in a breach of its
fiduciary duties to the Companys stockholders under applicable Law and (B)
the Acquisition Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead
to a Superior Proposal (as defined in Section 6.07(f)).

  

### 

  

### (b) The Company shall notify Acquirer of any determination to take any of
the actions contemplated under Section 6.07(a) with respect to an Acquisition
Proposal prior to the date that the Company first takes any such action,

amount or form of consideration) to the terms of the Acquisition Proposal.

negotiations with, any other Person with

  



        
   

  



  

### respect to an Acquisition Proposal, the Company shall enter into a
customary confidentiality agreement with such Person (if the Company has not
already entered into a customary confidentiality agreement with such Person
in connection with its exploration of strategic alternatives), it being
understood that such confidentiality agreement (x) shall not include any
provision calling for any exclusive right to negotiate with such Person
or having the effect of prohibiting the Company from satisfying its
obligations hereunder and (y) shall be no less favorable to the Company than
the Confidentiality Agreement, and the Company shall provide Acquirer with a
copy of such nonpublic information delivered to such Person promptly
following its delivery to the requesting Person or, to the extent that such
nonpublic information has been previously furnished by the Company to
Acquirer, advise Acquirer of the nature of such nonpublic information
delivered to such Person promptly following its delivery to the requesting
Person.

  

### 

  

### (c) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent the Companys Board
of Directors from taking, and disclosing to the holders of Company Common

permitted by Section 6.07(a), propose to approve or recommend any Acquisition
Proposal.

  

###

Companys Representatives to cease any and all existing activities,
discussions or negotiations with any parties (other than Merger Sub, Acquirer
or any of their Representatives, as applicable) conducted heretofore with
respect to any Acquisition Proposal, and shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause any such parties in possession of confidential information
about the Company that was furnished by or on behalf of the Company to return
or destroy all such information in the possession of any such party or its
representatives.

  

### 

  

### (e) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Acquisition Proposal_ " shall mean

consolidated assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, in a single
transaction or series of transactions, other than inventory disposed of in
the ordinary course of business of the Company consistent with past practice,
(ii) any direct or indirect acquisition or purchase of 15% or more of any
class of equity securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, in a
single transaction or series of transactions (including through a merger,

transaction), (iii) any tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated
would result in any person beneficially owning 15% or more of any class of

### consultation with the Companys financial advisors and legal advisors, is
more favorable from a financial point of view to the Companys stockholders
than the Merger (including any adjustment to the terms and conditions thereof
proposed in writing by Acquirer in response to any such Acquisition
Proposal), and (ii) that the Companys Board of Directors has determined in
good faith, after consultation with its outside legal advisors, that is of
such a nature that the failure to accept such Acquisition Proposal would be
reasonably be expected to result in a breach of its fiduciary duties to the
Companys stockholders under applicable Law, taking into account for these
purposes, whether such Acquisition Proposal is reasonably capable of being
consummated in a timely manner (taking into account all
financial, regulatory, legal and other aspects of such proposal (including
the ready availability of cash on hand and/or commitments for the same, in
each case as applicable, required to consummate any such Acquisition
Proposal, conditions to consummation, fees payable to Acquirer pursuant to

aggregate to the base wages, salary, non-equity incentive compensation and
health and welfare benefits provided to the Company Employees (other than
severance) immediately prior to the Effective Time. The preceding sentence
shall not preclude the Surviving Corporation from terminating the employment
of any employee, subject to applicable severance obligations.  From and
after the Effective Time, Acquirer shall (i) assume and agree to be bound by,

provided, further, that if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage
exceed such amount, the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to obtain a
policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding the
Maximum Annual Premium. In addition, the Company may, after consultation with
Acquirer, and will at Acquirers request, purchase a six-year "tail" prepaid
policy prior to the Effective Time on terms and conditions no less
advantageous to the Indemnified Parties than the existing directors
and officers liability insurance maintained by the Company; provided, that
the amount paid by the Company shall not exceed six times the Maximum
Annual Premium. If such "tail" prepaid policies have been obtained by the
Company prior to the Closing, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Acquirer
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain such policies in full
force and effect, and continue to honor the respective obligations
thereunder, and all other obligations under this Section 6.14(b)
shall terminate.

### (c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before, at or
after the Effective Time) is made against any Indemnified Person or any other
party covered by directors and officers liability insurance, on or prior to
the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the provisions of this Section
6.14 shall continue in effect until the final disposition of such claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation.

  

### 

  

### (d) This Section 6.14 shall survive the consummation of the Merger and is
intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each
Indemnified Person and their heirs and legal representatives and shall be
binding on the Surviving Corporation and its successors and assigns.  The
indemnification provided for herein shall not be deemed exclusive of any
other rights to which an Indemnified Person is entitled, whether pursuant to
Law, contract or otherwise. Acquirer and the Surviving Corporation shall pay
all reasonable, documented out-of-pocket expenses, including reasonable
attorneys fees, that may be incurred by any Indemnified Person in enforcing
the indemnity and other obligations provided in this Section 6.14. From and
after the Closing, Acquirer hereby guarantees the payment and performance of
the Surviving Corporations obligations in this Section 6.14. The provisions
of this Section 6.14 are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any
other rights to indemnification that the Indemnified Persons, their heirs and
personal representatives may have by contract or otherwise. If Acquirer or
the Surviving Corporation or any of their successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its

  



        
   

  



  

### properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each case, as a
condition to such consolidation, merger, transfer or conveyance, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Acquirer or the
Surviving Corporation shall assume and agree to perform the obligations set
forth in this Section 6.14.

Acquisition Proposal had been entered into on such date), the Company shall
pay the Company Break Up Fee by wire transfer of same-day funds, not later

Company Break Up Fee shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Acquirer,
Merger Sub and their respective Affiliates hereunder and that the Company
Break Up Fee shall serve as the sole and exclusive source of payment and
remedy to satisfy any losses, liabilities, damages or claims that Acquirer,

Agreement by the stockholders of the Company, no such amendment or waiver
shall be made or given that requires the approval of the stockholders of the
Company, unless such required approval is obtained.

  

### 

  

### (b) No failure or delay by any party hereto in exercising any right,
power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any
single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise
thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The rights
and remedies herein provided shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any
rights or remedies provided by law.
