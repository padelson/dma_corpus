concluded, or deemed to have concluded according to applicable Law, by the
Offer Termination Time, Purchaser has materially breached its obligations
with respect to the Consultation Process pursuant to clause (b) of paragraph 7
of the failure of Consultation Process, and such breach was the proximate

with respect to the Consultation Process), then Purchaser shall not be

Section 2.9 _Adjustment to Base Purchase Price_.

 

(a) _Section_ __ _ 2.9_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedules sets forth a
calculation of the Working Capital, the Cash Amounts (after deducting the
amount of any outstanding uncleared issued checks, drafts or wire transfers or
other payments issued before the Balance Sheet Date and not deducted from the
bank accounts of such Target Entities as of immediately prior to the Balance
Sheet Date) and the Funded Debt, in each case, as of the Balance Sheet Date
(the " _Sample Closing Statement_ "), including the classification of asset
and liability line items and general ledger accounts, which has been prepared
in accordance with the accounting principles set forth on _Section_ __ _ 2.9_
of the Seller Disclosure Schedules (the " _Working Capital Accounting
Principles_ ").

 

(b) At least four (4) Business Days prior to the anticipated Closing Date,
Seller shall cause to be prepared and delivered to Purchaser a closing
statement (the " _Closing Statement_ ") setting forth Sellers good-faith
estimate of (i) the Adjustment Amount (such estimate, the " _Estimated
Adjustment Amount_ "), (ii) the Closing Cash Amounts (such estimate, the "
_Estimated Closing Cash Amounts_ ") and (iii) the Closing Funded Debt (such
estimate, the " _Estimated Closing Funded Debt_ "). The Closing Statement
shall set forth the calculations of such amounts in a manner consistent with
the Sample Closing Statement and be prepared in accordance with the Working
Capital Accounting Principles. The Estimated Adjustment Amount, the Estimated
Closing Cash Amount and the Estimated Closing Funded Debt shall be used to
calculate the Closing Purchase Price to be paid by Purchaser to Seller at the
Closing.

 

(c) As promptly as reasonably possible and in any event within ninety (90)
days after the Closing Date, Seller shall prepare or cause to be prepared,
and will provide to Seller, a written statement (the " _Post-Closing
Statement_ "), setting forth the Adjustment Amount,

 



-26-  the Closing Cash Amounts and the Closing Funded Debt. The Post-Closing
Statement shall set forth in reasonable detail Sellers calculations of such
amounts in substantially the same format as, and in a manner consistent with,
the Sample Closing Statement and the Closing Statement and shall be prepared
in accordance with the Working Capital Accounting Principles.

 

(d) Within forty-five (45) days following receipt by Purchaser of the Post-
Closing Statement, Purchaser shall deliver written notice to Seller of any
dispute Purchaser has with respect to the calculation, preparation or content
of the Post-Closing Statement (the " _Dispute Notice_ "); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if Purchaser does not deliver any Dispute Notice to Seller
within such forty-five (45) day period, the Post-Closing Statement will be
final, conclusive and binding on the Parties. The Dispute Notice shall set
forth in reasonable detail (i) any item on the Post-Closing Statement that
Purchaser disputes and (ii) the proposed amount of such item; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Purchaser may not dispute the accounting principles,
practices, methodologies and policies used in preparing the Post-Closing
Statement unless they are inconsistent with the Working Capital Accounting
Principles. Any item on the Post-Closing Statement that is not disputed by
Purchaser in the Dispute Notice will be final, conclusive and binding on the
Parties. Upon receipt by Seller of a Dispute Notice, Purchaser and Seller
shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any disputed items set forth therein.
If Purchaser and Seller fail to resolve any such disputed items within thirty
(30) days after delivery of the Dispute Notice (the " _Dispute Resolution
Period_ "), then Purchaser and Seller jointly shall engage, within ten (10)
Business Days following the expiration of the Dispute Resolution Period, an
internationally recognized major accounting firm selected jointly by Seller
and Purchaser (the " _Independent_ ___Accounting Firm_ ") to resolve any such
disputed items; _provided_ that, if Seller and Purchaser are unable to agree
on the Independent Accounting Firm, then each of Seller and Purchaser shall
select an internationally recognized major accounting firm, and the two firms
will mutually select a third internationally recognized major accounting firm
to serve as the Independent Accounting Firm. As promptly as practicable, and
in any event not more than fifteen (15) days following the engagement of the
Independent Accounting Firm, Purchaser and Seller shall each prepare and
submit a presentation detailing each Partys complete statement of proposed
resolution of each item still in dispute to the Independent Accounting Firm
(it being understood that the content of each such presentation shall be
limited to whether the Adjustment Amount, the Closing Cash Amounts and the
Closing Funded Debt were calculated in accordance with the Working Capital
Accounting Principles and this Agreement, the proposed resolution of each
disputed item by such Party and reasonable supporting detail for
the foregoing). Purchaser and Seller shall instruct the Independent
Accounting Firm to, as soon as practicable after the submission of the
presentations described in the immediately preceding sentence and in any event
not more than twenty (20) days following such presentations, make a final
determination, binding on the Parties, of the appropriate amount of each of
the items that remain in dispute as indicated in the Dispute Notice. With
respect to each disputed item, such determination, if not in accordance with
the position of either Seller or Purchaser, shall not be in excess of the
higher, nor less than the lower, of the amounts proposed by Seller or
Purchaser, as applicable, in their respective presentations to the
Independent Accounting Firm described above. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the scope of the disputes to be resolved by the Independent Accounting Firm
shall be limited to whether any disputed items were properly calculated in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement, including the Working Capital
Accounting Principles. All fees and expenses relating to the work, if any, to
be performed by the Independent Accounting Firm shall be borne by Seller and
Purchaser in proportion to the allocation of the dollar value of the amounts
in

 



-27-  dispute between Seller and Purchaser resolved by the Independent Accounting
Firm, such that the party prevailing on the greatest dollar value of such
disputes pays the lesser proportion of the fees. All determinations made by
the Independent Accounting Firm, and the Post-Closing Statement, as modified
by the Independent Accounting Firm, will be final, conclusive and binding on
the Parties. The Parties agree that any adjustment as determined pursuant to
this _Section_ __ _ 2.9(d)_ shall be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase
Price, except as otherwise required by Law.

 

(e) For purposes of complying with the terms set forth in this _Section_ __
_ 2.9_, each of Seller and Purchaser shall reasonably cooperate with and
make available to each other and their respective Representatives all
information, records, data and working papers, in each case to the extent
related to the Purchased Assets, the Assumed Liabilities, the Business or the
Target Entities, and shall permit access to its facilities and personnel, in
each case as may be reasonably required in connection with the preparation and
analysis of the Post-Closing Statement and the resolution of any disputes
thereunder.

(f) The " _Final Purchase Price_ " shall mean the Base Purchase Price, 
_plus_ (i) the Closing Cash Amounts, _plus_ (ii) the Adjustment Amount (which
may be a positive or negative number), _minus_ (iii) the Closing Funded Debt,
in each of cases, (i), (ii) and (iii), as finally determined pursuant to
_Sections 2.9(c)_ and _2.9(d)_.

(g) If the Closing Purchase Price shall exceed the Final Purchase Price,
then Seller shall pay or cause to be paid an amount in cash equal to such
excess to Purchaser or a Purchaser Designee by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account or accounts designated in writing by Purchaser
to Seller; or if the Final Purchase Price shall exceed the Closing Purchase
Price, then Purchaser shall pay or cause to be paid an amount in cash equal to
such excess to Seller by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account or accounts designated in writing by Seller to Purchaser. Any such
payment is to be made within five (5) Business Days of the date on which the
Adjustment Amount, Closing Cash Amounts and Closing Funded Debt are finally
determined pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 2.9_, except as expressly
provided for in this Agreement, and any amounts owing pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 2.9(g)_ shall be paid in full.

 

Section 2.10 _Purchase Price Allocation_.

 

(a) Seller and Purchaser agree to allocate and, as applicable, to cause
their relevant Affiliates to allocate, the Purchase Price (as finally
determined pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.9_) and any other items that are
treated as additional consideration for Tax purposes among the Purchased
Assets (including among the Purchased Entity Shares) in accordance with
_Exhibit D_ attached hereto (the " _Allocation Schedule_ ").

(b) To the extent necessary to prepare bills of sale, transfer agreements,
or to otherwise timely comply with the requirements of applicable Law in
respect of the sale of any of the Purchased Assets or Purchased Entities,
Seller and Purchaser agree to cooperate in good faith to allocate and, as
applicable, to cause their relevant Affiliates to allocate, the Purchase Price
(as determined as of the applicable date of such allocation) and any other
items that are treated as additional consideration for Tax purposes among the
applicable Seller Entities and Purchased Assets in a manner consistent with
the Allocation Schedule, Section 1060 of the Code and the

 



-28-  Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder (and any similar provision of
state, local or foreign law, as appropriate) (any such allocation as agreed to
by the Seller and Purchaser or, if the Seller and Purchaser are unable to
agree on such allocation, as finally determined pursuant to _Section_ __ _
2.10(d)_, an " _Interim Allocation")_.

 

(c) No later than ninety (90) days after the date on which the Purchase
Price is finally determined pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 2.9_, Seller shall
deliver to Purchaser a proposed allocation of the Purchase Price (as finally
determined pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.9_) and any other items that are
treated as additional consideration for Tax purposes to Seller as of the
Closing Date determined in a manner consistent with the Allocation Schedule,
the Interim Allocations, Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations
promulgated thereunder (and any similar provision of state, local or foreign
law, as appropriate) (the " _Seller s Allocation_"). If Purchaser disagrees
with Sellers Allocation, Purchaser may, within thirty (30) days after
delivery of Sellers Allocation, deliver a notice (the " _Purchaser s
Allocation Notice_") to Seller to such effect, specifying those items as to
which Purchaser disagrees and setting forth Purchasers proposed allocation.
If the Purchasers Allocation Notice is duly delivered, Seller and Purchaser
shall, during the twenty (20) days following such delivery, use reasonable
best efforts to reach agreement on the disputed items or amounts in order to
determine the allocation of the Purchase Price (as finally determined
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.9_) and any other items that are treated as
additional consideration for Tax Purposes (such allocation as agreed to by the
Seller and Purchaser or, if the Seller and Purchaser are unable to agree on
such allocation, as finally determined pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.10(d)_,
the " _Allocation_ ").

 

(d) If Seller and Purchaser are unable to reach agreement on an Interim
Allocation or the Allocation, they shall promptly cause the Independent
Accounting Firm (or such firm as is chosen in accordance with the methodology
set forth in _Section 2.9(d)_ if an Independent Accounting Firm has not been
chosen) to resolve any remaining disputes. Any Interim Allocation or the
Allocation as finally determined by such accounting firm shall be conclusive
and binding on the Parties. All fees and expenses relating to the work, if
any, to be performed by the accounting firm shall be borne by one-half by
Seller and one-half by Purchaser.

 

(e) Seller and Purchaser shall (and shall cause their respective Affiliates
to) file all Tax Returns consistent with the Allocation. Neither Purchaser
nor Seller shall (nor shall they permit their respective Affiliates to) take
any Tax position inconsistent with such Allocation or fail to defend
diligently and in good faith the allocation before any Taxing Authority or in
any Tax Proceeding. and neither Purchaser nor Seller shall (nor shall they
permit their respective Affiliates to) agree to any proposed adjustment to the
Allocation by any Taxing Authority without first giving the other Party
prior written notice (a " _Proposed Allocation Settlement Notice_ "). The
Party providing such Proposed Allocation Settlement Notice (the " _Settling
Party_ ") shall be entitled to agree to such adjustment to the Allocation
with the relevant Taxing Authority unless notified in writing by such other
Party (the " _Non-Settling Party_") within five (5) days of receiving such
Proposed Allocation Settlement Notice that the Non-Settling Party requires
that the Settling Party not agree to such adjustment to the Allocation with
the relevant Taxing Authority except as otherwise required pursuant to a
"determination" within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code or any
analogous provision of state, local or foreign law (a " _Determination_ "). If
such notice is received from the Non-Settling Party, the Non-Settling Party
shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Settling Party and its
Affiliates from and against all reasonable costs and expenses related to
pursuing such Determination (including the costs of outside advisors and
attorneys), and shall pay the Settling Party reasonable fees for the time of
the employees and use of other resources of the Settling Party and its
Affiliates.

 



-29- Section 2.11 _Non-Assignment; Consents; Shared Contracts_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, this
Agreement shall not constitute an agreement to sell, assign, transfer or
convey any Purchased Asset if an attempted sale, assignment, transfer or
conveyance thereof would be prohibited by Law or would, without the approval,
authorization or consent of, filing with, notification to, or granting or
issuance of any license, order, waiver or permit by, any third party or
Governmental Entity (collectively, " _Approvals_ "), (i) constitute a breach
or other contravention thereof, (ii) be ineffective, void or voidable,
or (iii) adversely affect, in any respect, the rights thereunder of the
Seller Entities, the Target Entities, Purchaser, or any of their respective
officers, directors, agents or Affiliates, unless and until such Approval is

Affiliates to, use reasonable best efforts to obtain, or cause to be
obtained, any Approval (other than Regulatory Approvals, which shall be

Approvals_") required to sell, assign, transfer or convey the Purchased
Assets to Purchaser or the applicable Purchaser Designee at the Closing, and
Purchaser shall provide reasonable cooperation to Seller and its Affiliates in
connection therewith. If such Non-Regulatory Approval is not obtained prior to
Closing, then, until the earliest of (x) such time as such Non-Regulatory
Approval is obtained, (y) one (1) year following the Closing Date and (z)
with respect to a Purchased Asset that is a Contract, the expiration of the
term of such Contract in accordance with its current term or the execution of
a replacement Contract by Purchaser or its Affiliate, Seller shall, and shall
cause its controlled Affiliates to, use reasonable best efforts to obtain, or
cause to be obtained, such Non-Regulatory Approval, and Purchaser shall
provide reasonable cooperation to Seller and its Affiliates in connection
therewith. From and after the Closing until the earlier of (x) such time as
such Non-Regulatory Approval is obtained and (y) with respect to a Purchased
Asset that is a Contract, the expiration of the term of such Contract in
accordance with its current term or the execution of a replacement Contract by
Purchaser or its Affiliate, Seller shall, and shall cause its controlled
Affiliates to, cooperate with Purchaser to put in place any arrangement
reasonably acceptable to Purchaser and Seller that is intended to both (x)
provide Purchaser or the applicable Purchaser Designee, to the fullest extent
practicable and permissible, the claims, rights, remedies and benefits of any
such Purchased Assets and (y) cause Purchaser to assume and bear all costs and
Liabilities thereunder from and after the Closing in accordance with this
Agreement (including by means of any subcontracting, sublicensing or
subleasing arrangement). In furtherance of the foregoing, Purchaser will
timely pay, perform or discharge when due any Liability (including any
Liability for Taxes) arising thereunder after the Closing. Upon obtaining the
relevant Non-Regulatory Approval, Seller shall, and shall cause each other

either a Target Entity or Purchaser, if so assignable, transferrable or
conveyable; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) in no event shall any Person be
required to assign (or amend), either in its entirety or in part, any Shared
Contract that is not assignable (or cannot be amended) by its terms without
obtaining one or more Approvals, (ii) Seller shall be entitled to amend or
modify such Shared Contract prior to Closing to separate out any

cannot be so assigned by its terms or otherwise, or cannot be amended,
without such Approval or Approvals then, as from the Closing until such time
as such Approval or Approvals are obtained or until the expiration of such
Shared Contract in accordance with its terms, Seller will cooperate with
Purchaser to establish an agency or other similar arrangement reasonably
satisfactory to Seller and Purchaser intended to both (x) provide Purchaser,
to the fullest extent practicable under such Shared Contract, the claims,
rights and benefits of those parts of such Shared Contract that relate to the
Business and (y) cause Purchaser to bear all costs and Liabilities thereunder

(e) If a Shared Contract that is not amended or modified prior to Closing
to separate out any portions thereof that do not relate to the Business has
been assigned, transferred or conveyed to Purchaser or a Purchaser Designee in

conveyable, or appropriately amend such Shared Contract after the Closing, so
that Seller or another Seller Entity designated by Seller shall be entitled to
the rights and benefit of those parts of such Shared Contract that does not
relate to the Business; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) in no event shall
any Person be required to assign (or amend), either in its entirety or in
part, any Shared Contract that is not assignable (or cannot be amended) by its
terms without obtaining one or more Approvals and (ii) if any Shared Contract
cannot be so partially assigned by its terms or otherwise, or cannot be
amended, without such Approval or Approvals then, as from the Closing until
such time as such Approval or 

 



-31-  Approvals are obtained or until the expiration of such Shared Contract in
accordance with its terms, Purchaser will cooperate with Seller to establish
an agency or other similar arrangement reasonably satisfactory to Seller and
Purchaser intended to both (x) provide Seller, to the fullest extent
practicable under such Shared Contract, the claims, rights and benefits of
those parts of such Shared Contract that do not relate to the Business and
(y) cause Seller to bear all costs and Liabilities thereunder (to the extent
not related to the Business) from and after the Closing in accordance with

or any of its Affiliates any claims, rights and benefits of any such Purchased
Asset or Shared Contract pursuant to an arrangement described in _Section_ __
_ 2.11(b)_ or  _Section_ __ _ 2.11(d)_, (i) Seller and the Seller Entities
shall hold and operate such Purchased Assets and operate under such Shared

which Seller and the Seller Entities hold and operate their other assets and
operate under their other Contracts, subject to the instructions of the
Purchaser and its Affiliates, and (ii) Purchaser shall indemnify and hold
Seller, such Seller Entities and their respective Affiliates harmless from

Shared Contracts (only to the extent that such Covered Losses relate to the
Business). Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, any

Agreement for the transfer of Purchased Assets (other than the transfer of a
Purchased Entity) shall be in substantially the same form as the form of
Foreign Acquisition Agreement attached as _Exhibit_ __ _ E_ hereto, and each
Foreign Acquisition Agreement for the transfer of a Purchased Entity shall be
in substantially the same

that, in each case, that the Foreign Acquisition Agreements shall serve
purely to effect the legal transfer of the applicable Purchased Entity or
Purchased Asset and shall not have any significant effect on the value being
received by Purchaser or given by the Seller Entities, including
the allocation of assets and Liabilities as between them, all of which shall
be determined by this Agreement. Unless otherwise agreed by Purchaser and
Seller, the Foreign Acquisition Agreements will be executed and delivered on

therein will be consummated on the Closing Date.

 

Section 2.13 _Transfer of Beneficial Ownership_. Notwithstanding anything

entities located in the jurisdictions listed in _Section_ __ _ 2.13(_ _i_
_)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedules, pursuant to the form of
agreements/transfer instruments included in _Annex C_ hereto, until such time
as legal title to such Beneficial Shares is permitted to pass to Purchaser or
a Purchaser Designee as forth in such agreements/transfer instruments (which
will occur automatically on the terms forth therein). Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained in this Agreement, pursuant to the Pre-Closing
Restructuring, Seller and Purchaser acknowledge and agree that Seller or
another Seller Entity will acquire beneficial, but not legal, title to all of
the shares of the entity set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 2.13(ii)_ of the
Seller Disclosure Schedules prior to the Closing, pursuant to the form of

provide Seller (or Person in respect of which such deduction or withholding
will be made) with commercially reasonable 15-day advance notice of the amount
it intends to deduct or withhold and the basis for such deduction or
withholding. Purchaser shall cooperate in good faith with Seller to the extent
commercially reasonable to eliminate or reduce any required deduction or
withholding. To the extent that amounts are deducted and withheld in
accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 2.14_ and are properly remitted to the
appropriate Governmental Entity, such amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of
which such deduction or withholding was made.

Section 2.15 _Real Property Matters_.

 

(a) From the date hereof until the Closing Date, Seller and Purchaser shall
use reasonable best efforts to negotiate in good faith, execute (or cause

schedules of the Transition Services Agreement for applicable facilities or
office space, in each case to give effect to the Real Estate Steps Plan and
the schedules to the form of the Transition Services Agreement as of the date
hereof.

 

(b) Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that, following the Closing, it may
own, directly or indirectly, real estate in Mexico and Japan a portion of
each of which is an Excluded Asset as generally shown in the Real Estate Steps
Plan as a result of Seller having not obtained the subdivision of the
applicable deed to such real estate prior to the Closing. Following the
Closing, Seller and Purchaser shall use reasonable best efforts to continue
the process of subdividing such real estate in accordance with the Real Estate
Steps Plan and after each such subdivision is complete, Purchaser shall, or
shall cause its applicable Affiliate to, transfer such subdivided real estate
to Seller or another Seller Entity designated by Seller for no additional
consideration.

 

(c) All costs and expenses resulting from the subdivision of real estate
(including ancillary matters, such as installation of electricity and
metering) as set forth in the Real Estate Steps Plan (including any Taxes as a
result of such subdivisions) shall be the sole responsibility of Seller.

relating to bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, moratorium, fraudulent
conveyance or preferential transfers, or similar Laws relating to or

by Seller of this Agreement does not, and the consummation of the Transaction
and the other transactions contemplated hereby and compliance by Seller with
the terms hereof will not, conflict with, or result in any violation of or

any of the Purchased Assets (other than the Purchased Entity Shares) under,
any provision of (a) the Organizational Documents of any Seller Entity or
Target Entity, (b) any Judgment or Law applicable to the Business, or (c) any

in the aggregate, a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect. No Approval of any
Governmental Entity is required to be obtained or made by or with respect to
Purchaser or its Subsidiaries in connection with the execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement or the consummation of the Transaction and the
other transactions contemplated hereby, other than in respect of any
applicable Antitrust Laws.

 



-49- Section 4.4 _Financial Ability to Perform_. Purchaser has available to it
as of the date hereof, and will have available to it at the Closing, funds
sufficient to enable Purchaser to perform all of its obligations hereunder,
including delivering the Closing Purchase Price and the Purchase Price to
Seller, as and when contemplated by this Agreement and to pay or otherwise
perform all of the obligations of Purchaser under the other Transaction
Documents.

 

Section 4.5 _Proceedings_. There are no Proceedings, Judgments or claims
pending, or, to the Knowledge of Purchaser, threatened, against Purchaser or
any of its Affiliates that would reasonably be expected to have, individually
or in the aggregate, a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect.

other Person is entitled to any brokers, finders, financial advisors or
other similar fee or commission in connection with the Transaction and the

Section 4.7 _Investigation; Acquisition of Shares for Investment_.
Purchaser has such knowledge and experience in financial and business
matters, and is capable of evaluating the merits and risks of the Transaction
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Purchaser is
acquiring the Purchased Entity Shares for investment purposes and not with a
view toward or for offer or sale in connection with any distribution thereof,
or with any present intention of offering, distributing or selling any of the
Purchased Entity Shares. Purchaser acknowledges that the Purchased
Entity Shares have not been registered under the securities Laws of any
jurisdiction, including the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the " _Securities Act_ "), or
any state securities Laws, and agrees that the Purchased Entity Shares may
not be sold, transferred, offered for sale, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise
disposed of without compliance with (or exemption from) such Laws. Purchaser
is an "accredited investor" within the meaning of Rule 501 under the
Securities Act, and is acting solely on behalf of itself and its Affiliates
and not for the account or benefit of any other Person. Purchaser is able to
bear the economic risk of holding the Purchased Entity Shares for an
indefinite period (including total loss of its investment) (it being agreed
that nothing in this sentence shall limit or restrict any of Sellers
representations or warranties contained in _Article III_ or any right or
remedy of Purchaser hereunder).

Section 4.8 _Acknowledgment of No Other Representations or Warranties_.
Purchaser expressly agrees and acknowledges, on behalf of itself and its
Affiliates, that (a) none of Seller, the Seller Entities or any of their
respective Affiliates has made any representation or warranty, expressed
or implied, as to the Purchased Assets, the Assumed Liabilities, the
Business, the Target Entities, their financial condition, results of
operations, future operating or financial results, estimates, projections,
forecasts, plans or prospects (including the reasonableness of the
assumptions underlying such estimates, projections, forecasts, plans or
prospects) or the accuracy or completeness of any information regarding the
Purchased Assets, the Assumed Liabilities, the Business or the Target
Entities furnished or made available to Purchaser and its Affiliates and
Representatives, except as expressly set forth in _Article III_ , (b)
Purchaser has not relied on any representation or warranty from Seller, the
Seller Entities or any of their respective Affiliates in

 



-50-  determining to enter into this Agreement, except as expressly set forth in
_Article III_ , and (c) none of Seller, the Seller Entities or any of their
respective Affiliates shall have or be subject to any Liability to Purchaser
or any of its Affiliates or Representatives resulting from the distribution to
Purchaser or its Affiliates or Representatives, or Purchasers or its
Affiliates or Representatives use of, any such information, including any
information, documents or material made available to Purchaser or its
Affiliates or Representatives in any "data rooms," management presentations or
in any other form in expectation of or negotiation of this Agreement, the
Transaction and the other transactions contemplated hereby.

ARTICLE V

 

COVENANTS

 

Section 5.1 _Efforts_. (a) From and after the date hereof, Purchaser,
Seller and their respective Affiliates shall use reasonable best efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary, proper or advisable under any applicable Law to consummate
and make effective in the most expeditious manner possible the Transaction
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including (i) the
preparation and filing of all forms, registrations and notices required to be
filed to consummate the Transaction and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement as soon as practicable and (ii) the execution and delivery
of any additional instruments necessary to consummate the Transaction and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to fully carry out the
purposes of this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, Purchaser, Seller
and their respective Affiliates shall use reasonable best efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary, proper or advisable to obtain (and shall cooperate with
each other in obtaining) any Regulatory Approvals (which actions shall include
furnishing all information required in connection with such Approvals)
required to be obtained or made by Purchaser, Seller, the other Seller
Entities or the Target Entities in connection with the Transaction or the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Additionally, each of
Purchaser and Seller (and their respective Affiliates) shall use their
respective reasonable best efforts to fulfill all conditions precedent to this
Agreement (including those set forth in _Section_ __ _ 7.1_) and shall not
take any action after the date of this Agreement that would reasonably be
expected to impair or materially delay the obtaining of, or result in not
obtaining, any Regulatory Approval necessary to be obtained prior to the
Closing. To the extent that transfers of any Permits are required as a result
of the execution of this Agreement or the consummation of the Transaction or
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Parties shall use
reasonable best efforts to effect such transfers.

 

(b) Prior to the Closing, Purchaser and Seller shall each keep the other
apprised of the status of matters relating to the completion of the
Transaction and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and work
cooperatively in connection with obtaining all required Regulatory Approvals.
In that regard, prior to the Closing, subject to the
Confidentiality Agreement and _Section_ __ _ 5.3_ of this Agreement, each
Party shall promptly consult with the other Party to provide any necessary
information with respect to (and, in the case of correspondence, provide the
other Party (or its counsel) copies of) all filings made by such Party with
any Governmental Entity or any other information supplied by such Party to, or
correspondence with, a Governmental Entity in connection with this Agreement,
the Transaction and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Subject to the Confidentiality Agreement and _Section_ __ _5.3_ of this
Agreement, each Party shall promptly inform the other Party,

 



-51-  and if in writing, furnish the other Party with copies of (or, in the case
of material oral communications, advise the other Party orally of) any
communication from any Governmental Entity regarding the Transaction and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and permit the other Party
to review and discuss in advance, and consider in good faith the views of the
other Party in connection with, any proposed written (or any material
proposed oral) communication with any such Governmental Entity. If either
Party or any Representative of such Party receives a request for additional
information or documentary material from any Governmental Entity with respect
to the Transaction or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
then such Party will use reasonable best efforts to make, or cause to be made,
promptly and after consultation with the other Party, an appropriate response
in compliance with such request. No Party shall participate in any meeting
(whether in person or via video or telephone conference) with any Governmental
Entity in connection with this Agreement and the Transaction or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (or make oral submissions at
meetings or in telephone or other conversations) unless it consults with the
other Party in advance and, to the extent not prohibited by such Governmental
Entity, gives the other Party and its Representatives the opportunity to
attend and participate thereat (it being agreed that, for the avoidance of
doubt, such rights shall not give any Party approval, consent or similar
rights in respect of any agreements, orders or similar undertakings made by
the other Party to any Governmental Entity). Subject to the Confidentiality
Agreement and _Section_ __ _ 5.3_, each Party shall furnish the other Party
with copies of all correspondence, filings and communications (and
memoranda setting forth the substance thereof) between it and any such
Governmental Entity with respect to this Agreement and the Transaction or the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and furnish the other Party
with such necessary information and reasonable assistance as the other Party
may reasonably request in connection with its preparation of filings or
submissions of information to any such Governmental Entity. Purchaser and
Seller may, as each deems advisable and necessary, reasonably designate any
competitively sensitive material provided to the other under this _Section_ __
_ 5.1_ as "outside counsel only." Such materials and the information
contained therein shall be given only to the outside legal counsel and will
not be disclosed by such outside counsel to employees, officers, or directors
of the recipient unless express permission is obtained in advance from the
source of the materials (Purchaser or Seller, as the case may be) or its
legal counsel; _provided_ , _however_ , that materials provided pursuant to
this _Section_ __ _ 5.1(b)_ may be redacted (i) to remove references
concerning the valuation of or future plans for the Business, (ii) as
necessary to comply with contractual obligations, and (iii) as necessary to
address reasonable privilege concerns.

 

(c) Each of Purchaser, Seller and their respective Affiliates shall use
their reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all other
actions and do, or cause to be done, all other things necessary, proper or
advisable to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated
hereby, including using their reasonable best efforts to take all such
further action as may be necessary to resolve such objections, if any, as any
Governmental Entity or any other Person may assert under any Antitrust Law
with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby, so as to enable the
Closing to occur as soon as reasonably possible (and in any event no later
than the Outside Date), including the filing of applicable applications in the
jurisdictions listed on _Section 5.1(c)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedules.
Purchaser shall proffer to, or agree to, sell, divest, lease, license,
transfer, dispose of or otherwise encumber or hold separate, before or after
the Closing, any assets, licenses, operations, rights, product lines,
businesses or interests therein of the Business or of any Target Entity (or
to consent to any sale,

 



-52-  divestiture, lease, license, transfer, disposition or other encumbering by
the Seller Entities of any of assets of the Business or to any agreement by
any of the Seller Entities to take any of the foregoing actions) or to agree
to make any changes or restriction on, or other impairment of Purchasers
ability to own or operate, any such assets, licenses, operations, rights,
product lines, businesses or interests therein or Purchasers ability to
otherwise exercise full ownership rights with respect to ownership interests
in the Business or of Purchaser; _provided_ , _however_ , that Purchaser shall
not be required to take any of the actions under this  _Section_ __ _
5.1(c)_ or any other provision of _Section_ __ _ 5.1_ that would reasonably
be expected to be, either individually or in the aggregate, materially
detrimental to Purchaser or the Business;  _provided_ , _further_ , that
Purchaser shall not be required to sell, divest, lease, license, transfer,
dispose of or otherwise encumber or hold separate any assets, licenses,
operations, rights, product lines, businesses or interests therein of
Purchaser or its Affiliates (excluding the Target Entities and the Business).

(d) Purchaser agrees to provide such assurances as to financial
capability, resources and creditworthiness as may be reasonably requested by
any Governmental Entity whose Approval is sought in connection with the
Transaction and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Whether or not the Transaction is consummated, Purchaser shall be responsible
for all fees and payments (including filing fees and legal and professional
fees) to any Governmental Entity in order to obtain any Approvals pursuant to
this  _Section_ __ _ 5.1_, other than the fees of and payments to Sellers
legal and professional advisors.

 

(e) Any provision in this Agreement notwithstanding, none of Seller, the
other Seller Entities or any of their respective Affiliates (including, prior
to the Closing, the Target Entities) shall under any circumstance be required
to pay or commit to pay any amount or incur any obligation in favor of or
offer or grant any accommodation (financial or otherwise, regardless of any
provision to the contrary in the underlying Contract, including any
requirements for the securing or posting of any bonds, letters of credit or
similar instruments, or the furnishing of any guarantees) to any Person to
obtain any Approval, other than customary filing fees in respect of obtaining
any required Regulatory Approval. None of Seller, the other Seller Entities
nor any of their respective Affiliates (including, prior to the Closing, the
Target Entities) shall have any Liability whatsoever to Purchaser arising out
of or relating to the failure to obtain any Approvals that may be required in
connection with the Transaction and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or because of the termination of any Contract as a result
thereof. Purchaser acknowledges that no representation, warranty or covenant
of Seller contained herein shall be breached or deemed breached solely as a
result of (i) the failure to obtain any Approval, (ii) any such termination
of a Contract, or (iii) any Proceeding commenced or threatened by or on behalf
of any Person arising out of or relating to the failure to obtain any such
Approval or any such termination.

 

Section 5.2 _Covenants Relating to Conduct of Business_. (a) Except as set
forth in  _Section_ __ _ 5.2_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedules or as

Business in all material respects in the ordinary course consistent with past

_Section_ __ _ 5.2(a)_ unless such action would constitute a breach of such
other provision.

_Confidentiality Agreement_ "), the terms of which are incorporated herein by
reference in their entirety and shall survive the Closing; _provided_ , that
actions taken by the Parties hereunder to the extent necessary in order to

shall not be deemed to be in violation of this _Section_ __ _ 5.3_ or the

of the Purchased Assets, ten (10) years after the Closing), unless the
Purchaser has otherwise consented, Seller shall, and shall cause its
controlled Affiliates to, retain in confidence, and not use, directly or

Person; _provided_ , that the foregoing restrictions shall not apply to any
information (i) which is or becomes generally available to the public other
than as a result of disclosure in violation of this _Section_ __ _ 5.3(b)_,
(ii) is required to be disclosed by applicable Law or to a Governmental
Entity or otherwise in connection with compliance or regulatory activity, in
which case, if legally permitted, Seller shall use reasonable best efforts to
provide Purchaser with prompt notice of such required disclosure so
that Purchaser may seek, at Purchasers sole expense, to obtain a protective
order, injunctive relief or other reasonable assurance that such disclosure

relationships (whether as a customer, supplier or otherwise) with the same
Persons, and engage in commercial relationships with such Persons and
with Purchaser and the other Purchaser Entities, and may employ, or continue
to employ, individuals who previously worked in or with the Business and
possess knowledge and Know-How and Trade Secrets used in, relating to, or
arising from the Business and (y) subject to _Section_ __ _ 5.13_, nothing in
this _Section_ __ _ 5.3(b)_ shall prohibit or restrict the maintenance or
expansion of any such relationships or employment of any such individuals. In
addition, the foregoing shall not prohibit Seller or its Affiliates from
disclosing or using such confidential information for the purpose of complying
with the terms of any of the Transaction Documents or any Contract that has
not been assigned or transferred to Purchaser. Furthermore, the provisions of
this _Section_ __ _ 5.3(b)_ will not prohibit any retention of copies of
records or any disclosure in connection with the preparation and filing of
financial statements with a Governmental Entity (including the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission) or Tax Returns of Seller or its Affiliates or in
connection with the enforcement of any right or remedy relating to this
Agreement, the other Transaction Documents or the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby.

Section 5.4 _Access to Information_. (a) Seller shall afford to Purchaser
reasonable access, upon reasonable notice during normal business hours,
consistent with applicable Law and in accordance with the reasonable
procedures established by Seller, during the period prior to the Closing, to
the properties, books, Contracts, records and personnel of Seller and its
Subsidiaries to the extent related to the Business, the Purchased Assets and
the Target Entities; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) neither Seller nor any
of its Affiliates shall be required to violate any obligation of
confidentiality to which it or any of its Affiliates may be subject in
discharging their obligations pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 5.4(a)_ (
_provided_ that, if and to the extent practicable, Seller shall use reasonable
best efforts to otherwise make appropriate alternative disclosure arrangements
in a manner that would not reasonably be expected to violate such obligation
of

 



-57-  confidentiality); (ii) Seller shall make available, or cause its
Subsidiaries to make available, Business Service Provider personnel files only
after the Closing Date and, with respect to any Business Service Providers,
if and when Purchaser provides Seller with notice that the applicable Business

of those files ( _provided_ that Seller shall not make, or cause to be made,
available medical records, workers compensation records or the results of any
drug testing; and that Purchaser shall indemnify and hold Seller and its
Affiliates (including the other Seller Entities) and their
respective Affiliates harmless from any Liabilities arising out of or
relating to the transfer of such personnel files); and (iii) prior to the
Closing Date, Purchaser shall not conduct any Phase II Environmental Site
Assessment or conduct any invasive testing or any sampling of soil, sediment,

other property of Seller, the other Seller Entities, the Target Entities or
any of their respective Affiliates.

(b) Purchaser agrees that any investigation undertaken pursuant to the
access granted under _Section_ __ _ 5.4(a)_ shall be conducted in such a
manner as not to unreasonably interfere with the operation of the Business,
and, except as contemplated by this Agreement, none of Purchaser or any of
its Affiliates or Representatives shall communicate with any of the employees
of the Business (or the Seller or its Affiliates) without the prior written
consent of Seller, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates shall be required to
provide access to or disclose information where, upon the advice of counsel,
such access or disclosure would jeopardize attorney-client privilege or
contravene any Law ( _provided_ that, if and to the extent practicable, Seller
shall use reasonable best efforts to otherwise make appropriate alternative
disclosure arrangements in a manner that would not reasonably be expected to
violate such attorney-client privilege or contravene any Law).

(c) Without limiting any provision of _Article VI_ , at and after the
Closing, each Party shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, afford the other
Party, its Affiliates and their respective Representatives, during normal
business hours, upon reasonable notice, access to the properties, books,
Contracts, records and employees of the Business and the Target Entities to
the extent that such access may be reasonably requested by such Party,
including in connection with financial statements, Taxes, reporting
obligations and compliance with applicable Laws; _provided_ , _however_ , that
nothing in this Agreement shall limit any Partys or its Affiliates rights of
discovery.

 

(d) Each Party agrees to hold all the books and records of the Business
existing on the Closing Date in such Partys possession and not to destroy or
dispose of any thereof for a period of eight (8) years from the Closing Date
or such longer time as may be required by Law.

 

(e) Nothing in _Section_ __ _ 2.4_ or _Section_ __ _ 2.5_ is intended to
limit or expand any of the rights or obligations provided in this _Section_
__ _ 5.4_.

 

Section 5.5 _Publicity_. The initial separate press releases of Seller and
Purchaser with respect to the Transaction shall be agreed upon by Seller and
Purchaser. Other than such press releases, no Party nor any Affiliate or
Representative of such Party shall issue or cause the publication of any press
release or public announcement in respect of this Agreement, the

 



-58-  Transaction or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement without
the prior written consent of the other Party (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), except as may be required by
Law or stock exchange rules; _provided_ , _however_ , that no consent of the
other Party will be required for any disclosure contained in, or substantially
similar to, the initial press release, or contained in this Agreement, which
may be filed by any Party in connection with any filing with a Governmental
Entity.

 

Section 5.6 _Intercompany Accounts and Intercompany Arrangements_. Prior
to the Closing, all intercompany balances and accounts (other than (x) trade
payables or receivables arising in the ordinary course of business and
included in the calculation of Closing Working Capital on the Post-Closing
Statement (as adjusted pursuant to _Section 2.9(d)_ ) and (y) intercompany
balances and accounts set forth in _Section_ __ _ 5.6_ of the Seller
Disclosure Schedules) between the Seller Entities and any of their Affiliates
(other than the Target Entities), on the one hand, and the Target Entities,
on the other hand, shall be settled or, to the extent permitted by Law,
eliminated in such a manner as none of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates
(including, after the Closing, the Target Entities) has any Liability
or obligation with respect thereto (including any Tax Liability arising from
the settlement or elimination thereof). Intercompany balances and accounts
solely among any of the Target Entities (or otherwise included in the
Business) shall not be affected by this provision. Prior to the Closing,
except for the Transaction Documents to be entered into in connection with

applicable group health Benefit Plan and for any other out-of-pocket expenses
that count against any maximum out-of-pocket expense provision of the
applicable group health Benefit Plan or Purchasers or such Affiliates group
health plans. Neither Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates shall provide a
direct or indirect incentive to any Transferred U.S. Business Employee or his

reimbursement account plan) of Seller or its Affiliates (collectively, the "
_Seller FSA Plan_ ") of the Transferred U.S. Business Employees who are
participants in the Seller FSA Plan shall be transferred to one or more
comparable plans of Purchaser (collectively, the " _Purchaser FSA Plan_ ");
(ii) the elections, contribution levels and coverage levels of such
Transferred U.S. Business Employees shall apply under the Purchaser FSA Plan
in the same manner as under the Seller FSA Plan; and (iii) such Transferred
U.S. Business Employees shall be reimbursed from the Purchaser FSA Plan for
claims incurred at any time during the plan year of the Seller FSA Plan in
which the applicable Employment Transfer Date occurs that are submitted to the
Purchaser FSA Plan from and after the Employment Transfer Date on the same

Closing with Seller or any of its Affiliates, in all such cases to the same
extent such service is recognized by Seller and its Affiliates immediately
prior to the Closing; _provided_ that such service shall not result in (A)
eligibility for participation in any frozen defined benefit plans that
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates already maintains prior to the Closing for
the benefit of its own employees, (B) benefits accruals under the
Henkel 401(k) and Defined Contribution Plan which are grandfathered based on

(i) Without limiting _Section 5.7(b)(ii)_ , Purchaser and its Affiliates
shall assume, and Purchaser shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to,

applicable Laws) (collectively, " _Termination Liabilities_ ") that become due
and payable at or following the Closing to: (A) any Target Entity Employee

for the avoidance of doubt, due to Purchasers failure to comply with any
applicable Transfer Regulations, obligations or standards arising under any
applicable Law, any Transferred Benefit Plan and/or Collective Bargaining
Agreement, in each case governing the terms and conditions of employment
thereof, or (B) any Asset Employee who does not receive a "Qualifying Offer"
(as defined below) of employment from Purchaser or its Affiliates and does not
become a Transferred Business Employee. For purposes of this Section 5.7(d), a
"Qualifying Offer" shall mean (A) with respect to any U.S. Business Employee,
a Qualifying U.S. Offer, and (B) with respect to each International Business
Employee that is an Asset Employee (" _International Asset Employee_ ") a
"Qualifying O.U.S. Offer", which is defined as an offer of employment that
either (I) complies with any applicable Transfer Regulations, any Transferred
Benefit Plan and/or Collective Bargaining Agreement, in each case governing
the terms and conditions of employment thereof, or (II) if the provisions of
clause (I) are not applicable, then otherwise the Qualifying O.U.S. Offer
shall be based on the same standards as those of the Qualifying U.S. Offer,
but as in effect for each such applicable International Asset Employee.

(ii) Seller shall retain all Termination Liabilities for
Carveout Employees, Functional Transfer Employees (as provided in _Section_
__ _ 5.7(n)_), In-Bound Employees and any Asset Employee who received a

such that such Transferred Business Employee would be entitled to severance
benefits pursuant to the applicable policy, program or arrangement set forth
on  _Section_ __ _ 5.7(b)(ii)(iii)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedules,
Purchaser shall provide such Transferred Business Employee with severance
benefits (assuming such Transferred Business Employee complies with the terms
and conditions of such applicable policy, program or arrangement) equal in
value to the severance benefits determined in accordance with such applicable
policy, program or arrangement, taking into account such Transferred Business
Employees service with Seller and its Affiliates prior to the applicable
Employment Transfer Date and with Purchaser and its Affiliates on and after
the applicable Employment Transfer Date.

 

(e) _Accrued Vacation, Sick Leave and Personal Time_. If required by
applicable Law, upon termination of employment with Seller or its Affiliates
as contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 5.7_, Seller or its applicable
Affiliate shall pay to the applicable Business Employees any accrued but
unused vacation, gratuity payments, person hours or days earned and sick or
other paid time off of the Business Employees accrued by or otherwise required
to make available to such Business Employees (" _Accrued PTO_ ") and such
amounts shall be treated as 

 



-62-  Retained Liabilities; _provided_ , _however_ , Purchaser shall promptly
(and, in any event, within ten (10) Business Days following the later of the
Employment Transfer Date and the date of the applicable payment) reimburse
Seller for any payments made by Seller or its Affiliates to any Transferred
Business Employees in respect of Accrued PTO that become due as a result of
the transfer of employment contemplated by this  _Section_ __ _ 5.7_. To the
extent that payment of Accrued PTO is not required by applicable Law upon
termination of employment with the Seller or its Affiliates, Purchaser will
recognize and assume all Liabilities with respect to Accrued PTO for all
applicable Transferred Business Employees (including any Liabilities to such
Transferred Business Employees for payments in respect of Accrued PTO that
arise as a result of the transfer of employment contemplated by this 
_Section_ __ _ 5.7_) (and such amounts will be Assumed Liabilities).
Purchaser shall allow Transferred Business Employees to use the vacation, sick
leave and personal time recognized or established in accordance with
the immediately preceding sentence in accordance with the terms of
Purchasers and its applicable Affiliates programs in effect immediately
prior to the applicable Employment Transfer Date (in addition to, and not in
lieu of, any vacation accrued under the applicable vacation plans or policies
of Purchaser or its Affiliates on or following the applicable Employment
Transfer Date).

 

(f) _Inactive Employees_. Except as otherwise required by applicable Law
or any Collective Bargaining Agreement, if any Inactive Employee is, within
twelve (12) months following the Closing Date, able to return to work,
Purchaser shall offer employment to such employee on terms consistent with
those applicable to similarly situated Transferred Business Employees under
this _Section_ __ _ 5.7_; provided that, for any Inactive Employee who is on
leave for a disability, such Inactive Employee must be deemed fit to return to
duty as certified by a physician. For the avoidance of doubt, any Inactive
Employee whose terms and conditions of employment are governed by a Collective
Bargaining Agreement which provides that such employee would, or who under
applicable Law would, be entitled to return to work at a date later
that twelve months following the Closing Date, shall be offered employment as
described in this Section 5.7(f) above at such time (if any) that such
Collective Bargaining Agreement or Law requires.

(i) _U.K. DB Plan_. With respect to the U.K. DB Plan, Seller shall, and
shall cause the U.K. Pension Entities, to, use reasonable best efforts to

occur of (A) ninety (90) days after the Closing and (B) receipt on or after
the Closing by a U.K. Pension Entity of a written demand for payment of the
Section 75 Debt arising as a result of the transactions contemplated under
this Agreement, then promptly following the earlier to occur of such events,
Seller shall transfer to Purchaser a lump sum amount equal to the Section 75
Debt, in satisfaction of Sellers obligations with respect thereto as an
Excluded UK DB Plan Liability. In connection with the foregoing: in the event
that such Section 75 Debt amount is being paid in the circumstance identified
in clause (A) above, such amount shall be based on the best estimate of such a
debt that would be certified by the scheme actuary to the U.K. DB
Plan (determined by the third party actuary mutually acceptable to Seller and
Purchaser). However, if the actual amount of any Section 75 Debt (as certified
by the scheme actuary to the U.K. DB Plan) payable by a U.K. Pension Entity is
higher than the sum which the Seller has transferred to the Purchaser, the
Seller will promptly pay the amount of any shortfall to the Purchaser, such
that the Purchaser will receive the full amount from the Seller of 

 



-63-  any Section 75 Debt payable by a U.K Pension Entity. If the amount
transferred by the Seller to the Purchaser is higher than the amount of the
Section 75 Debt owed by a U.K. Pension Entity, the Purchaser shall return any
excess amount (with any interest that has accrued) to the Seller promptly upon
receiving confirmation from the U.K. DB Plan scheme actuary as to the amount
of the Section 75 Debt. If such Section 75 Debt amount is being paid in the
circumstance identified in clause (B) above, such amount shall be based on
such a debt as certified by the scheme actuary to the U.K. DB Plan. If, after
payment of such an amount to Purchaser, an FAA (or similar form of
apportionment entered into in respect of any U.K. Pension Entity such that the
relevant U.K. Pension Entity has no actual or potential liability in respect
of the U.K. DB Plan (an "Apportionment")), Purchaser shall return such amount
(with any interest that has accrued) to Seller promptly upon being notified in
writing that an Apportionment has occurred.

 

(ii) _U.S. DB Plan_. Prior to the Closing, Seller shall, or shall cause
its Affiliates to, spin-off and transfer to another Seller Benefit Plan in

certain employees of Seller or its Affiliates (that is not a Target Entity)
under the U.S. DB Plan (a list of which is set forth on _Section 5.7(g)(ii)_
of the Seller Disclosure Schedules), with the amounts thereof as determined
reasonably and in good faith based on mutual agreement of each of the
parties third party actuarial firms.

(iii) _Darex GmbH DB Plan_. Prior to the Closing, Seller shall, or shall
cause its Affiliates to, spin-off all Excluded German Pension Liabilities to
another entity of Seller or its Affiliates that is not a Target Entity

provisions of Section 2.6(g), effective on and after the Closing Date,
Purchaser shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, assume that certain
Transferred Benefit Plan that is the Darex GmbH DB Plan, solely with respect
to the Liabilities associated with respect to the applicable Transferred
Business Employees participation therein.

Date, the Liability in respect of bonus awards allocable to Transferred
Business Employees in respect of the fiscal year in which the applicable
Employment Transfer Date occurs under any Benefit Plan that is an annual bonus
plan shall be assumed by Purchaser based on the accrual for such Transferred
Business Employees as shown on the books and records of Seller Entities as of
immediately prior to the applicable Employment Transfer Date. Following the
applicable Employment Transfer Date, Purchaser shall cause the Transferred
Business Employees to participate in short-term annual incentive compensation
plans of Purchaser and its Affiliates for the remainder of the fiscal year in
which the Employment Transfer Date occurs that provide short-term annual
incentive compensation opportunities that are in compliance with _Section_ __
_ 5.7(b)_, and following the end of such fiscal year, shall pay each such
Transferred Business Employee an annual bonus in respect of such fiscal year
that is no less than the accrual for such Transferred Business Employee
assumed by Purchaser pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence.

 



-64- (j) _Equity Awards_. Seller agrees to treat all unvested
equity compensation awards held by Transferred Business Employees in
accordance with the applicable Benefit Plan(s) and no equity awards shall be
assumed by Purchaser. Immediately following the applicable Employment Transfer
Date, Purchaser shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, provide a cash
retention award to each Transferred Business Employee who held Seller equity
compensation awards that were forfeited pursuant to the terms of the
applicable Benefit Plans in an amount equal to the fair market value of the
portion of such Seller equity compensation awards so forfeited. Such cash
retention award shall vest on the same terms and subject to the same
conditions as applied to the forfeited Seller equity compensation award
immediately prior to the applicable Employment Transfer Date.

(k) _T_ _arget Entity Employees_. For the Continuation Period, Purchaser
shall cause the Target Entities to continue to employ each Transferred

benefit plans during the Continuation Period.

 

(l) _Carveout_ _Employees_.

 

(i) Seller and its Affiliates shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
transfer the employment of the Carveout Employees to Seller or one of its
Affiliates prior to the Closing. To the extent that it is not legally possible
for the employment of any Carveout Employee to be so transferred prior to the
Closing after using such efforts, the employing Target Entity shall continue
to employ such Carveout Employee pursuant to the terms of the Transition
Services Agreement until it is possible to legally transfer such Carveout
Employees to Seller or an Affiliate of Seller, but in no event later than
six (6) months following the termination of the Transition Services Agreement
in accordance with its terms.

 

(ii) All transfers of employment under this Section 5.7(l) shall be made in
accordance with applicable Law and the applicable Transfer Regulations, any
Benefit Plan and/or Collective Bargaining Agreement governing the terms and
conditions of employment thereof. Purchaser and Seller shall cooperate with
respect to all such transfers of employment so as to minimize any Liabilities
to either Party.

(iii) Seller shall assume and be solely responsible for, and
shall indemnify and hold harmless Purchaser and its Affiliates from and
against, all obligations, Liabilities, costs and commitments in respect of any
Liabilities related to the Carveout Employees, whether or not such Liabilities
arise prior to, upon or following the Closing, including any Liabilities

Functional Transfer Employee, except for the Tolling Employees, and (i) the
expiration of any Tolling Agreement with respect to any applicable Tolling
Employees, then Seller shall reimburse Purchaser for all Termination
Liabilities incurred in connection with such termination.

 

(o) _R_ _etention_. In addition to any cash retention awards that shall

Business Employees set forth in Section 5.2(b)(i)(B) of the Seller Disclosure
Schedules, which such schedule shall be kept confidential by Seller and
Purchaser. Purchaser shall assume and retain all liabilities with respect to
any such retention plan.

any applicable Law, or (ii) impairs the validity of any of the GCP Name and
GCP Marks or the quality of reputation or enforceability of any of the GCP
Name and GCP Marks; _provided_ , _however_ , that any use by Purchaser and its
Affiliates consistent with the past practice of Seller and its Affiliates
shall be deemed to satisfy this requirement. The GCP Name and GCP Marks and
all associated goodwill will remain the sole property of Seller.

 

Section 5.10 _Insurance_. (a) Subject to _Section_ __ _ 5.10(b)_ and, to
the extent applicable, _Section_ __ _ 5.10(c)_, from and after the Closing
Date, the Business, the Purchased Entities, the Purchased Assets, the Assumed
Liabilities, and the operations and assets and Liabilities in respect thereof,
shall cease to be insured by Sellers or its Affiliates insurance policies
or by any of their self-insured programs, and neither Purchaser nor its
Affiliates (including the Business and the Purchased Entities) shall have any
access, right, title or interest to or in any such insurance policies
(including to all claims and rights to make claims and all rights to proceeds)
to cover the Business, the Purchased Entities, the Purchased Assets, the
Assumed Liabilities, or the operations or assets or Liabilities in respect
thereof. Prior to, on or after the Closing, Seller or its Affiliates may amend
any insurance policies in the manner it deems appropriate to give effect to
this _Section_ __ _ 5.10(a)_ (but subject to _Section_ __ _ 5.10(b)_ and,
to the extent applicable, _Section_ __ _ 5.10(c)_). From and after the
Closing, Purchaser shall be responsible for securing all insurance it
considers appropriate for the Business, the Purchased Entities, the Purchased
Assets, the Assumed Liabilities, and the operations and assets and Liabilities
in respect thereof. Subject to _Section_ __ _ 5.10(b)_ and, to the extent
applicable,  _Section_ __ _ 5.10(c)_, Purchaser further covenants and

 



-68-  agrees not to seek to assert or to exercise any rights or claims of, or in

existed prior to the Closing that are covered by Workers Compensation Policies
(" _Pre-Closing WC Claims_"), Seller hereby authorizes Purchaser, to the
extent permitted by such Workers Compensation Policies, to report Pre-Closing
WC Claims directly to the provider of such Workers Compensation Policies and
shall use reasonable best efforts, to the extent permitted by such
Workers Compensation Policies, to assist Purchasers efforts to obtain the
benefit of such insurance coverage; _provided_ that Purchaser shall keep

its Affiliates after the Closing, including any deductibles or self-insured
retentions associated with any claims under the Workers Compensation
Policies. Following the Closing, Seller shall not, and shall cause its
Affiliates to not, release, commute, buy-back or otherwise eliminate insurance
coverage under any of the Workers Compensation Policies with respect to acts,
omissions, events or circumstances relating to Business Employees that
occurred or existed prior to the Closing; _provided_ that nothing in this
sentence or anything else in this Agreement to the contrary shall require
Seller or its Affiliates to extend or purchase any insurance policy.

(c) Prior to the Closing, each of Purchaser and Seller shall use
reasonable best efforts to work in good faith to (i) obtain insurance coverage
by Purchaser or its Affiliates with respect to the Business and the Assumed
Liabilities (to the extent generally insurable), at Purchasers sole cost and
expense, or (ii) obtain a "tail" to any existing liability insurance policy
with respect to the Business and the Purchased Assets (excluding the Retailed
Seller Business), at Purchasers sole cost and expense and for which
Purchaser would be solely responsible, including for payment of any retention,
deductible and premium, and which would allow Purchaser to make claims
directly with the insurer. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything herein
to the contrary, Seller shall have no obligation to obtain any insurance
policy, including any tail to any existing liability insurance policy, if such
policy, or Purchasers or any of its Affiliates access thereto, would have
an adverse effect on Seller or any of its Affiliates that is not otherwise
reimbursed pursuant to this _Section 5.10(c)_ , including any of their
existing insurance policies. Purchaser or its Affiliates shall exclusively
bear and shall promptly repay or reimburse Seller or its Affiliates for the
amount of any and all Liabilities to the extent incurred by Seller or its
Affiliates after the Closing in connection with any such policies, including

any member of Senior Management of the Business immediately prior to the
Closing), without the prior written consent of Purchaser, with respect to
each Business Employee who is employed by Purchaser or Purchasers
Subsidiaries as of immediately following the Closing (for the purposes of this
_Section_ __ _ 5.13(a)_, each a " _Covered Person_ "), Seller agrees that
none of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries will employ or solicit for
employment any Covered Person; _provided_ that Seller and its Affiliates shall
not be restricted from (i) employing or soliciting for employment any Covered
Person who has ceased to be employed or engaged by Purchaser or its
Subsidiaries for a period of at least six (6) months or (ii) making general
solicitations for employment not specifically directed at Covered Persons.
The Parties agree that if Seller requests that Purchaser waive the
restrictions set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 5.13(a)_ with respect to a
Covered Person, Purchaser shall consider such request in good faith.

 



-70- (b) For a period of five (5) years from the Closing Date (the "

or similar arrangement, license, contract manufacturing arrangement or any
other form of business association, engage in, carry on in any manner, or have
an interest in any Person engaged in any business activities that are included
within the definition, or otherwise competitive with, the Business;
_provided_ , _however_ , that nothing herein shall preclude Seller from:

 

(i) acquiring (or entering into an agreement to acquire) and, after such
acquisition, owning an interest in any Person (or its successor) that is
engaged in a business activity that would otherwise violate this _Section_ __
_ 5.13(b)_ (a " _Competing Business_ ") if such Competing Business generated
less than (A) ten percent (10%) of such Persons consolidated annual revenues
and (B) less than $10,000,000 in annual revenues, in each case, in the last
completed fiscal year of such Person;

 

(ii) owning five percent (5%) or less of the outstanding securities of any
Person engaged in the Business and which securities are listed on a

Business, if such joint venture, partnership or other strategic business
relationship does not engage in the Competing Business.

 

(c) Seller acknowledges that each of the restrictions entered into by it
under this  _Section_ __ _ 5.13_ is an entirely independent restriction and
is no greater than is reasonably necessary to protect the interests of
Purchaser and its Affiliates. If any restriction under this  _Section_ __ _
5.13_ shall be held void or unenforceable for any reason whatsoever but would
be valid if deleted in part or reduced in its scope or application, then that
restriction shall apply with such modifications as may be necessary to make
it valid, effective and enforceable.

found to have been retained by Seller or any other Seller Entity in error,
either directly or indirectly, Seller shall transfer, or shall cause the other
Seller Entities to transfer, at no cost, such right, property or asset (and
any related Liability) as soon as practicable to Purchaser or an Affiliate
(including a Target Entity) indicated by Purchaser.

(a) After the date of this Agreement and prior to the Closing, the Parties
shall use reasonable best efforts to determine and negotiate in good faith

Transition Services Agreement or any other agreements and arrangements as
Purchaser and Seller may agree on in good faith, until such time as Purchaser
or its applicable Affiliate is able to obtain any necessary permits, licenses
or similar approvals for it to operate such Business; _provided_ that
Purchaser and its Affiliates shall use their respective reasonable best
efforts to obtain all such necessary permits, licenses or similar approvals
for them to operate such Business as promptly as practicable.

(c) Seller and Purchaser shall cooperate in good faith and use their
reasonable best efforts to prepare their respective information technology
systems for and assist with the transition of information related to the
Business to Purchasers information technology systems so that such
information may be reasonably usable under Purchasers information technology
systems following the Closing, taking into account the Transaction Documents
and all of the assets and services to be provided, acquired, leased or
licensed under the Transaction Documents. For the avoidance of doubt, Seller
shall be responsible for the costs it and its Affiliates incur in connection
with preparing and/or separating their information technology systems in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

Section 5.16 _Pre-Closing Restructuring Plan_. Seller shall use
its reasonable best efforts to complete the Pre-Closing Restructuring Plan
prior to the Closing or, if contemplated by the Pre-Closing Restructuring Plan
or if Seller otherwise reasonably deems necessary or appropriate, as soon as

activities completed following the Closing shall not materially interfere with
Purchasers and its Affiliates conduct of the Business (other than as
contemplated by the Real Estate Steps Plan, in which case the Parties shall
use reasonable best efforts to mitigate the disruption to the Business to the
extent reasonably practicable). Purchaser and Seller shall reasonably
cooperate in the implementation of the Pre-Closing Restructuring, including in
making the Tax elections contemplated thereby.

(a) If any Taxing Authority asserts a Tax Claim, then the Party first
receiving notice of such Tax Claim promptly shall provide written notice

Purchasers own cost and expense and attend any meetings or conferences with
the relevant Taxing Authority.

 

(c) In the case of a Tax Claim of or with respect to any of the Target
Entities, the Purchased Assets, the Assumed Liabilities or the Business for

Return exclusively of Seller and any of its Subsidiaries (other than the
Target Entities); (2) Tax Proceeding with respect to any Combined Tax Return;
or (3) Specified Tax Proceeding; and (ii) Purchaser shall have the exclusive
right to control in all respects, and neither Seller nor any of its
Affiliates shall be entitled to participate in, any Tax Proceeding with
respect to (X) any Tax Return exclusively of Purchaser and any of its
Subsidiaries (other than the Target Entities) or (Y) any Straddle Period
Combined Tax Return.

(e) Seller shall, promptly upon receipt, provide to Purchaser all
information Seller or any of its Affiliates receive that relate to any
Specified Tax Proceeding insofar as such information pertains to any Target
Entity. If requested by Seller, Purchaser shall provide Seller with such
limited powers of attorney as are reasonably requested of Seller by TSA
Counterparty pursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreement, _provided_ that such
powers of attorney shall not permit Seller, its Affiliates or TSA Counterparty
(including their respective representatives) to take any action on behalf of

relate, or (y) eight (8) years following the due date (without extension) for
such Tax Returns. Thereafter, the Party holding such Tax Returns or other
documents may dispose of them unless the other Party provides reasonable

documents in which case the Party holding such Tax Returns shall provide the
other Party reasonable opportunity to take possession of such Tax Returns and
other documents at such other Partys own expense.

on the other hand, are parties, and neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates
nor any of the Target Entities shall have any rights or
obligations thereunder after the Closing.

by applicable Law, Seller, Purchaser, the Purchased Entities and their

-78-  Purchaser shall make, or shall cause its applicable Affiliate (including the
Target Entity) to make, such 338 Elections as Seller shall reasonably request
not more than thirty (30) days following the delivery of such notice. For the
avoidance of doubt, neither Seller nor its Affiliates shall be entitled
indemnification pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 6.2_ or _Article IX_ for any
additional Taxes of Seller and its Affiliates resulting from a Section 338
Election whether made pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 6.10_ or _Section_ __ _

commercially reasonable efforts to avail themselves of any available
exemptions from any such Transfer Taxes and Creditable Transaction VAT and to
cooperate with the other Parties in providing any information and
documentation that may be necessary to obtain such exemptions. Neither Seller

with the transfer of the Business and the Purchased Assets to Purchaser or the
applicable Purchaser Designee under this Agreement to be subject to VAT. For

before the due date for filing the relevant Tax Return (taking into account

such Third Party Claim, to assume the defense and control of such Third Party
Claim (at the expense of such Indemnifying Party); _provided_ that the
Indemnifying Party shall allow the Indemnified Party a reasonable opportunity
to participate in the defense of such Third Party Claim with its own counsel
and at its own expense; _provided_ , _further_ , that the Indemnifying Party
shall not be permitted to assume the defense of any Third Party Claim if the
Third Party Claim seeks any relief against any Indemnified Party that does
not involve any monetary damages or any other payments. If the Indemnifying
Party does not assume, or is not permitted to assume pursuant to the
immediately prior sentence, the defense and control of any Third Party Claim
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 9.4(b)_, the Indemnified Party shall be
entitled to assume and control such defense, but the Indemnifying Party may
nonetheless participate in the defense of such Third Party Claim with its own
counsel and at its own expense. Purchaser or Seller, as the case may be,
shall, and shall cause each of its Affiliates and Representatives to,
reasonably cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in the defense of any Third
Party Claim, including by furnishing books and records, personnel and
witnesses, as appropriate for any defense of such Third Party Claim. If the
Indemnifying Party has assumed the defense and control of a Third Party Claim,
it shall be authorized to consent to a settlement or compromise of, or the
entry of any judgment arising from, any Third Party Claim, in its sole
discretion and without the consent of any Indemnified Party; _provided_ that
(i) the Indemnifying Party shall obtain the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Party (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) if
such settlement or judgment involves any injunctive relief binding on any of
the Indemnified Parties or any finding or admission of any violation of Law
or admission of any wrongdoing by any Indemnified Party, and (ii) the
Indemnifying Party shall (A) pay or cause to be paid all amounts in such
settlement or judgment (other than to the extent that such liabilities
would constitute Covered Losses to which the De Minimis Amount or the
Deductible would be applicable in accordance with the applicable provisions of
_Section_ __ _ 9.2_ or _Section_ __ _ 9.3_, as applicable) and (B) obtain,
as a condition of any settlement or other resolution, a complete and

 



-86-  unconditional release of the Indemnified Parties affected by such Third
Party Claim. No Indemnified Party will consent to the entry of any judgment or
enter into any settlement or compromise with respect to a Third Party Claim
without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party (not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); _provided_ that,
notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnified Party shall have the right
to pay or settle any such claim if it irrevocably waives in a writing
delivered to the Indemnifying Party any right to indemnity therefor under this
Agreement.

 

Section 9.5 _Exclusive Remedy_. Purchaser and Seller acknowledge and agree
that, except (a) as otherwise provided in _Article VI_ , (b) as provided in
_Section_ __ _ 10.6_ or (c) except as expressly provided in any Post-Closing
Agreement, following the Closing, the indemnification provisions of 
_Section_ __ _ 9.2_ and _Section_ __ _ 9.3_ shall be the sole and exclusive
remedies of Seller and Purchaser, respectively, and their respective
Affiliates, for any Covered Losses (including any Covered Losses from claims
for breach of contract, warranty, tortious conduct (including negligence) or
otherwise and whether predicated on common law, statute, strict liability, or
otherwise) that each Party may at any time suffer or incur, or become subject
to, as a result of or in connection with this Agreement, the Transaction or
the other transaction contemplated by this Agreement, including any breach of
any representation or warranty in this Agreement by any Party, or any failure
by any Party to perform or comply with any covenant or agreement that, by its
terms, was to have been performed, or complied with, under this Agreement and
the other Transaction Documents.

 

Section 9.6 _Additional Indemnification Provisions_.

 

(a) With respect to each indemnification obligation contained in this
Agreement, all Covered Losses shall be net of any third-party insurance or
indemnity, contribution or similar proceeds that have been actually recovered
by the Indemnified Party in connection with the facts giving rise to the right
of indemnification (it being agreed that if third-party insurance or
indemnification, contribution or similar proceeds in respect of such facts are
recovered by the Indemnified Party subsequent to the Indemnifying Partys
making of an indemnification payment in satisfaction of its applicable
indemnification obligation, such proceeds, after deducting the amount of any
Covered Losses suffered by the Indemnifying Party that were not satisfied by
the applicable indemnification payment, shall be promptly remitted to the
Indemnifying Party to the extent of the indemnification payment made), and
the Indemnified Party shall use, and cause its Affiliates to use, reasonable
best efforts to seek full recovery under all insurance and indemnity,
contribution or similar provisions covering such Loss to the same extent as
it would if such Loss were not subject to indemnification hereunder. Upon
making any payment to the Indemnified Party for any indemnification claim
pursuant to this _Article IX_ , the Indemnifying Party shall be subrogated, to
the extent of such payment, to any rights which the Indemnified Party may
have against any third parties with respect to the subject matter underlying
such indemnification claim, and the Indemnified Party shall assign any such
rights to the Indemnifying Party.

(b) In determining the amount of Covered Losses suffered or incurred by
Purchaser or Seller in connection with a breach of a representation or
warranty in this Agreement(but not whether a breach of inaccuracy of any
representation or warranty has occurred), such determination shall be made
without regard to any qualification or exception contained in such
representation or warrant relating to "material", "materiality", or "Business

 



-87-  Material Adverse Effect" (other than references to "material" or
"materiality" (x) solely with respect to the standard that must be met to
create an obligation to include items in a list set forth in the Seller
Disclosure Schedules or (y) contained within the definition of "Business
Material Adverse Effect" or the definition of "Permitted Lien"). This
_Section_ __ _ 9.6(b)_ shall not apply to any of the representations and
warranties in _Section_ __ _ 3.6(b)_, _Section_ __ _ 3.7_ and/or _Section
3.8(b)_.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Seller shall have no
liability or obligation with respect to any Covered Loss to the extent that
such Covered Loss in any way arises from or relates to any investigation,
cleanup, remediation, corrective action restoration, treatment, monitoring or
sampling or testing of soil, subsurface strata, underground storage tanks,
groundwater, surface water or sediments or any other similar action taken by
or on behalf of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates following the Closing, in
each case that goes beyond that which is required by applicable requirements
of Environmental Laws or Specified Business Contracts in effect at Closing.

Section 9.7 _Limitation on Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement (including this _Article IX_ ), neither
Party shall be liable to the other Party or its Affiliates, whether in
contract, tort (including negligence and strict liability) or otherwise, at
law or in equity, and "Covered Losses" shall not include any amounts for any
(a) consequential, special, incidental or indirect damages or (b) punitive or
exemplary damages; _provided_ that (i) the limitation in the foregoing clause
(a) shall not apply to the extent such amounts are the reasonably foreseeable
result of the event that gave rise thereto and (ii) the limitations in the
foregoing clauses (a) and (b) shall not limit recovery (if any) to the extent
any such damages are paid to any third party (which is not a Seller
Indemnified Party or a Purchaser Indemnified Party, as applicable) as part of
a Third Party Claim against an Indemnified Party that is indemnifiable
hereunder. Any Covered Losses for indemnification hereunder shall be
determined without duplication of recovery by reason of state of facts giving
rise to such Covered Loss constituting a breach of more than one
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, "Covered Losses" shall not be calculated based on
multiples of earnings or other metric approaches.

 

Section 9.8 _Tax Benefits Offset_. To the extent that the Indemnified
Party recognizes a Tax benefit or Tax cost as a result of any Covered Loss or
the receipt of any indemnity payment hereunder (in the same or the immediately
following taxable year that the Covered Loss is incurred or the relevant
indemnity payment is received), the amount of the Covered Loss for which
indemnification is provided shall be (i) increased by the amount of such Tax
cost and (ii) decreased by the amount of such Tax benefit. To the extent that
the claim with respect to which an indemnity obligation arises has not given
rise to an actual net Tax benefit in cash in the year in which the indemnity
payment is to be made, but gives rise to an actual net Tax benefit in cash
with respect to the Indemnified Party (which Tax benefit would not have arisen
but for such claim) in the taxable year of or immediately following the
incurrence of the Covered Loss, the Indemnified Party shall pay to the
Indemnifying Party the amount of such Tax benefit (reduced by any Tax costs
and reasonable expenses incurred in obtaining such Tax benefit or recovery).
For this purpose, the Indemnified Party shall be deemed to recognize a net Tax
benefit or net Tax cost, respectively, with respect to a taxable year if, and
to the extent that, the Indemnified Partys cumulative liability for Taxes
through the end of such taxable year, calculated by excluding any Tax Items
attributable to the Covered Losses or the receipt of the indemnity payment
hereunder, is greater or less than the Indemnified Partys actual cumulative
liability for Taxes through the

 



-88-  end of such taxable year, calculated by taking into account any Tax Items
attributable to the Covered Losses or the receipt of the indemnity payment (to
the extent permitted by applicable Tax Law and treating such Tax Items as the
last Tax Items claimed for any taxable year).

 

Section 9.9 _Mitigation_. Nothing herein is intended to limit or restrict
any duties of any Party to mitigate damages as may exist under applicable
Law.

GENERAL PROVISIONS

 

Section 10.1 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement and the other Transaction

any manner by any representations, warranties or covenants relating to
such subject matter except as specifically set forth herein and therein.

Section 10.2 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights

other hand, may waive compliance by the other with any term or provision of
this Agreement that the other Party was or is obligated to comply with or
perform. Such waiver or failure to insist on strict compliance with such term
or provision shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to,
any subsequent or other failure of compliance.

9.2_ and  _Section_ __ _ 9.3_, which are intended to benefit, and to be

-90- Section 10.6 _Specific Performance_. The Parties agree that irreparable
damage, for which monetary damages (even if available) would not be an
adequate remedy, would occur in the event that the Parties do not perform any
provision of this Agreement in accordance with its specified terms or
otherwise breach such provisions. Accordingly, the Parties acknowledge and
agree that the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction, specific
performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement
and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, in addition to
any other remedy to which they are entitled in Law or in equity. Each of the
Parties agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific
performance and other equitable relief on the basis that any other party has
an adequate remedy at Law or that any award of specific performance is not an
appropriate remedy for any reason at Law or in equity. Any Party seeking an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and
to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall not
be required to provide any bond or other security in connection with such
order or injunction.

 

Section 10.7 _Governing Law and Jurisdiction_. This Agreement is for the
benefit of the Parties, and shall be governed by and construed in accordance
with the laws of the State of Delaware applicable to agreements made and to be
performed entirely within the State of Delaware, without regard to the
conflict of law provisions thereof that would result in the application of
the laws of any other jurisdiction. Each Party hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally consents to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the
Delaware Court of Chancery in and for New Castle County, or in the event (but
only in the event) that such Delaware Court of Chancery does not have subject
matter jurisdiction over such matter, the United States District Court for the
District of Delaware (as applicable, the "Chosen Court"), for any actions,
suits or proceedings arising out of or relating to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby (and each Party agrees not to commence any
action, suit or proceeding relating thereto except in such courts, and further
agrees that service of any process, summons, notice or document by registered
mail to such Partys address set forth above shall be effective service of
process for any action, suit or proceeding brought against it in any such
court). Each Party hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives any
objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any
action, suit or proceeding arising out of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby in the Chosen Court, and hereby further irrevocably and
unconditionally waives and agrees not to plead or claim in any such court that
any such action, suit or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought
in an inconvenient forum.

 

Section 10.8 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT WAIVES
TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM BROUGHT BY ANY OF
THEM AGAINST THE OTHER ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH THIS
AGREEMENT, OR ANY OTHER AGREEMENTS EXECUTED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE
ADMINISTRATION THEREOF OR THE TRANSACTION OR ANY OF THE OTHER TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREIN OR THEREIN. NO PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT SHALL SEEK A JURY
TRIAL IN ANY LAWSUIT, PROCEEDING, COUNTERCLAIM OR ANY OTHER LITIGATION
PROCEDURE BASED UPON, OR ARISING OUT OF, THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY
RELATED INSTRUMENTS. NO PARTY WILL SEEK TO CONSOLIDATE ANY SUCH ACTION IN
WHICH A JURY TRIAL HAS BEEN WAIVED WITH ANY OTHER ACTION IN WHICH A JURY TRIAL
CANNOT BE OR HAS NOT BEEN WAIVED. EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT CERTIFIES THAT
IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT OR INSTRUMENT BY, AMONG
OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL

 



-91-  WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS SET FORTH ABOVE IN THIS _SECTION 10.8_. NO PARTY
HAS IN ANY WAY AGREED WITH OR REPRESENTED TO ANY OTHER PARTY THAT THE
PROVISIONS OF THIS _SECTION 10.8_ WILL NOT BE FULLY ENFORCED IN ALL
INSTANCES.

Section 10.9 _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant
or restriction of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction
or other authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the
terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall remain
in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or
invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions
contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any
Party. Upon such a determination, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith
to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as
closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the
Transaction and the other transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as
originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

Section 10.10 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two (2)
or more counterparts, all of which shall be considered an original, with the
same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same
instrument, and shall become effective when one (1) or more such counterparts
have been signed by each Party and delivered (by e-mail or otherwise) to the
other party. Signatures to this Agreement transmitted by electronic mail in
"portable document format" (". _pdf_ ") from, or by any other electronic
means intended to preserve the original graphic and pictorial appearance of a
document, will have the same effect as physical delivery of the paper document
bearing the original signatures. This Agreement has been executed in the
English language. If this Agreement is translated into another language, the
English language text shall in any event prevail.

 

Section 10.11 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided herein, whether or
not the Closing takes place, and except as set forth otherwise in this
Agreement, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement,
the Transaction and the other transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid
by the party incurring such expense.

 

Section 10.12 _Interpretation; Absence of Presumption_. It is understood
and agreed that the specification of any dollar amount in the representations
and warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement or the inclusion of
any specific item in the Seller Disclosure Schedules or Purchaser Disclosure
Schedules is not intended to imply that such amounts or higher or lower
amounts, or the items so included or other items, are or are not material, and
no Party shall use the fact of the setting of such amounts or the fact of the
inclusion of any such item in the Seller Disclosure Schedules or
Purchaser Disclosure Schedules in any dispute or controversy between the
Parties as to whether any obligation, item or matter not described in this
Agreement or included in the Seller Disclosure Schedules or Purchaser
Disclosure Schedules is or is not material for purposes of this Agreement.
Nothing herein (including the Seller Disclosure Schedules or the Purchaser
Disclosure Schedules) shall be deemed an admission by either Party or any of
its Affiliates, in any Proceeding or Action, that such Party or any such
Affiliate, or any third party, is or is not in breach or violation of, or in
default in, the performance or observance of any term or provisions of any
Contract. For the purposes of this Agreement, (a) words in the singular shall
be held to include the plural and vice versa, and words of one gender shall be
held to include the other gender as the context requires; (b) references to
the

 



-92-  terms Article, Section, paragraph, Exhibit and Schedule are references to
the Articles, Sections, paragraphs, Exhibits and Schedules to this Agreement
unless otherwise specified; (c) the terms "hereof," "herein," "hereby,"
"hereto," and derivative or similar words refer to this entire Agreement,
including the Schedules and Exhibits hereto; (d) references to "Dollars"
or "$" shall mean U.S. dollars; (e) the word "including" and words of similar
import when used in this Agreement and the Transaction Documents shall mean
"including without limitation," unless otherwise specified; (f) the word "or"
shall not be exclusive; (g) references to "written" or "in writing" include in
electronic form; (h) provisions shall apply, when appropriate, to successive
events and transactions; (i) the headings contained in this Agreement and the
other Transaction Documents are for reference purposes only and shall not
affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement and the
other Transaction Documents; (j) Seller and Purchaser have each participated
in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents and if an ambiguity or question of interpretation should arise, this
Agreement and the other Transaction Documents shall be construed as if
drafted jointly by the Parties or thereto, as applicable, and no presumption
or burden of proof shall arise favoring or burdening any Party by virtue of
the authorship of any of the provisions in this Agreement or the other
Transaction Documents; (k) a reference to any Person includes such Persons
successors and permitted assigns; (l) any reference to "days" means calendar
days unless Business Days are expressly specified; and (m) when calculating
the period of time before which, within which or following which any act is to
be done or step taken pursuant to this Agreement, the date that is the
reference date in calculating such period shall be excluded and if the last
day of such period is not a Business Day, the period shall end on the next
succeeding Business Day.

[Remainder of page intentionally left blank]

 



-93- IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Seller and Purchaser have duly executed this Agreement as
of the date first written above.
