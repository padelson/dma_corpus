18 2.3 _Calculation and Payment of Adjustment Amount_.

 

(a) _Adjustment Amount_. The " _Adjustment Amount_" equals the difference
between the Net Company Value and the Estimated Net Company Value, if any,
and may be a positive or a negative number.

(b) _Closing Date Pro Forma Balance Sheet and Adjustment Amount_. As promptly
as practicable after the Closing Date, and in any event not later than sixty
(60) days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall prepare and deliver to Seller:
(i) a balance sheet of the Company as of the Closing Date Effective Time (the
" _Closing Date Pro Forma Balance Sheet_ "), prepared in accordance with GAAP
applied on the same basis as the Financial Statements were prepared, setting
forth the Indebtedness and Transaction Expenses, if any, not paid pursuant to
the Closing Funds Flow Statement, the Cash as of the Closing Date Effective
Time (which, solely for this purpose, shall not include the European
Subsidiary Purchase Price, the amount payable to the Company under _Section
2.2(d)(ii)(D)_ or any other amounts paid by Buyer or UK Buyer to the Company
at the Closing pursuant to _Section 2.2_) and the Working Capital Revolver
Balance as of the Closing Date Effective Time; and (ii) a statement (the "
_Adjustment Statement_") showing in reasonable detail its calculation of the
Net Company Value and any Adjustment Amount. For the avoidance of doubt, the
determination of the Adjustment Amount shall not include any changes to the
amount of any Income Tax Payable or Income Tax Receivable included in the
calculation of the Participation Plan Amount pursuant to _Section 2.2(a)_ or
the Purchase Price pursuant to  _Section 2.2(b)_. Buyer, without charge to
Seller, upon reasonable prior notice and subject to the terms of this _Section
2.3(b)_, shall give Seller and his agents or representatives reasonable access
to Buyers and the Companys and each Acquired Companys books and records as
are reasonably necessary for the sole purpose of reviewing and verifying the
calculations contained in the Closing Date Pro Forma Balance Sheet and the
Adjustment Statement. Buyer shall be entitled to have a representative of
Buyer present at all times during such review.

(c) _Dispute Resolution_. The Adjustment Statement shall become final and
binding on Seller and Buyer as the Net Company Value and the Adjustment Amount
on the thirtieth (30th) day following the date the Adjustment Statement is
received by Seller (the " _Dispute Deadline Date_"), unless prior to the
Dispute Deadline Date, Seller delivers Notice to Buyer of Sellers
disagreement (" _Notice of Disagreement_"). The Notice of Disagreement shall
set forth all of Sellers disputed amounts (" _Disputed Amounts_ ") together
with the proposed changes thereto, including an explanation in reasonable
detail of the basis on which Seller proposes such changes. If Seller has
delivered a timely Notice of Disagreement, then Seller and Buyer shall use
their good faith efforts to reach written agreement on the Disputed Amounts to
determine the Net Company Value and the Adjustment Amount. If all of
the Disputed Amounts in the Notice of Disagreement have not been resolved by
Seller and Buyer by the thirtieth (30th) day following Buyers receipt of the
Notice of Disagreement, if any, then amounts that are still disputed (and only
such amounts) shall be submitted to binding arbitration by the Independent
Arbiter. The Independent Arbiters determination with respect to each Disputed
Amount shall be provided by written decision delivered to each of Seller and
Buyer within sixty (60) days after

 



19  the date of the submission of the dispute to such Independent Arbiter, be
made in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and shall in no event be
more favorable to Buyer than reflected on the Adjustment Statement or more
favorable to Seller than shown in the remaining disputed proposed changes
delivered by Seller under the Notice of Disagreement. The Parties hereto agree
that all adjustments shall be made without regard to materiality. The fees
and expenses of the Independent Arbiter shall be allocated by the Independent
Arbiter between Seller, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand, based
on the percentage determined by dividing the Disputed Amount awarded
to Buyer, on the one hand, or Seller, on the other, by the total Disputed
Amounts and on which a determination is made by the Independent Arbiter. Each
party shall bear its own expenses in connection therewith, including its
attorneys and accountants fees (it being understood that Seller may apply
the Adjustment Defense Fund toward any such payments). The determination of
the Disputed Amounts by such arbitration shall be, absent manifest error,
final and binding upon Seller and Buyer as to such Disputed Amounts.

(d) _Final Determination of Net Company Value_. The Net Company Value and the
Adjustment Amount shall be deemed to be finally determined in the amount set
forth in the Adjustment Statement on the Dispute Deadline Date unless a Notice
of Disagreement is given in accordance with _Section 2.3(c)_ with respect to
the calculation thereof. If a Notice of Disagreement is given, the Net
Company Value and the Adjustment Amount shall be deemed finally determined on
the date that the Independent Arbiter gives notice to Buyer and Seller of its
determination with respect to all disputed items regarding the calculation
thereof or, if earlier, the date on which Seller and Buyer agree in writing on
the amount thereof, in which case the Net Company Value and the Adjustment
Amount shall be calculated in accordance with such determination or
agreement, as the case may be.

(e) _Payment of Adjustment Amount_. If the Adjustment Amount, as finally
determined, is positive (i.e., the Net Company Value is greater than the
Estimated Net Company Value), then Buyer shall pay (or shall cause the Company
to pay) fifty percent (50%) of the Adjustment Amount to Seller, and Buyer
shall pay fifty percent (50%) of the Adjustment Amount to the Company, and
promptly thereafter (but in no event more than five (5) Business Days
thereafter), the Company shall pay (and Buyer shall cause the Company to pay)
such amount to the Applicable Plan Participants according to their respective
Applicable Plan Participant Pro Rata Shares. If the Adjustment Amount, as
finally determined, is negative (i.e., the Net Company Value is less than the
Estimated Net Company Value), then Buyer and Seller shall direct the Escrow
Agent to pay the Adjustment Amount to Buyer solely from the Aggregate Escrow
Fund (with such amount to be allocated fifty percent (50%) from the
Participant Escrow Fund and fifty percent (50%) from the Seller Escrow Fund).
Any payment shall be made within five (5) Business Days of the date the
Adjustment Amount is deemed to be finally determined under _Section 2.3(d)_.

 

2.4 _Defense Funds_.

(a)  _Adjustment Defense Fund_. The Adjustment Defense Fund, comprised of the
Seller Adjustment Defense Fund Portion and the Participation Adjustment
Defense Fund Portion paid pursuant to _Sections 2.2(d)(ii)(D)_ and
_2.2(d)(ii)(E)_ above, shall be held by and available to Seller to pay all
costs, expenses and fees (including, without limitation, attorneys

 



20  fees, accountants fees and costs of the Independent Arbiter) incurred or to
be incurred in connection with this _Article 2_. At such time (or from time to
time) that Seller determines to release all or any portion of the Adjustment
Defense Fund not necessary to pay or reimburse Seller for any such amounts (as
determined by Seller in his sole discretion), fifty percent (50%) of such
amount shall be retained by Seller and fifty percent (50%) of such amount
shall be paid by Seller to the Company, and promptly thereafter (but in no
event more than five (5) Business Days thereafter), the Company shall pay (and
Buyer shall cause the Company to pay) such amount to the Applicable Plan
Participants in accordance with their respective Applicable Plan Participant
Pro Rata Shares.

(b) _Participation Liability Defense Fund_. The Participation Liability
Defense Fund shall be held by and available to the Participant Representative
to pay all costs, expenses and fees (including, without limitation, attorneys
fees and accountants fees) incurred or to be incurred by the Participant
Representative in such capacity in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated herein (except as provided above), as determined
necessary by the Participant Representative in his sole discretion
(including, without limitation, in connection with any dispute or claim
related to indemnification claims or otherwise). At such time (or from time to
time) that the Participant Representative determines to release all or
any portion of the Participation Liability Defense Fund not necessary to pay
or reimburse the Participant Representative for any such amounts (as
determined by the Participant Representative in his sole discretion), such
amount shall be paid by the Participant Representative to the Company, and
promptly thereafter (but in no event more than five (5) Business Days
thereafter), the Company shall pay (and Buyer shall cause the Company to pay)
such amount to the Applicable Plan Participants in accordance with their
respective Applicable Plan Participant Pro Rata Shares.

2.5 _Applicable Plan Participants_. All amounts paid by the Company to the
Escrow Agent with respect to the Participant Escrow Amount pursuant to
_Sections 2.2(d)(ii)(D)_ and _2.2(e)_ , and the amount paid to Seller as the
Participation Adjustment Defense Fund Portion or Participation Liability
Defense Fund pursuant to _Section 2.2(d)(ii)(D)_, as applicable, shall be
deducted from amounts otherwise payable hereunder to the Applicable Plan
Participants, according to their respective Applicable Plan Participant Pro
Rata Shares, and no such amounts shall be deducted or paid to the Escrow
Agent or Seller, as applicable, from any amounts payable hereunder to the Plan
Participants who are not Applicable Plan Participants.

 

2.6 _Payments_. Each payment described in this _Article 2_ (as well as any
payment resulting from any release of the Participant Escrow Fund pursuant to
_Section 13.6_ or any release of the Adjustment Defense Fund or Participation
Liability Defense Fund to the Applicable Plan Participants pursuant to
_Section 2.4_) shall be paid in immediately available funds by confirmed
wire transfer to the applicable bank account designated for such payee on the
Closing Funds Flow Statement (except with respect to payments by the Company
to Plan Participants who are employees of an Acquired Company, which shall be
made through such Acquired Companys payroll system). All payments to the Plan
Participants shall be made in accordance with the percentages set forth on
_Schedule 5.27_ and otherwise in accordance with the Participation Plan.
With respect to any Plan Participant who is not, or is no longer, employed at
the time any payment due to such Person is required to be made hereunder,
Buyer shall cause the Company to use Reasonable Efforts to locate such Plan
Participant and make such payment as contemplated in this Agreement. Buyer or
any of the Acquired Companies shall each be entitled to deduct and

 



21  withhold from any payment described in this _Article 2_ (as well as any
payment resulting from any release of the Participant Escrow Fund pursuant to
_Section 13.6_ or any release of the Adjustment Defense Fund or
Participation Liability Defense Fund to the Applicable Plan Participants
pursuant to _Section 2.4_) any Taxes that Buyer or any of the Acquired
Companies are required to deduct and withhold under any applicable Tax law
and remit such Taxes to the required Tax Authority on a timely basis. To the
extent such amounts are so deducted or withheld, such amounts shall be treated
for all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to such
payee, including the Seller and each Plan Participant, in respect of which
Buyer or any of the Acquired Companies, as the case may be, made such
withholding. The Parties agree that payment of the amounts due and owing to
the Plan Participants at Closing shall be treated as occurring, for federal
income Tax purposes, as of the day after the Closing Date, and each payment
shall be deductible by the Acquired Companies for income Tax purposes in the
first tax year ending after the date on which such payment is made.

2.7 _Seller as Representative_. Each Key Participant agrees that Buyer may
rely on and accept the acts, disclosures and communications of Seller with
respect to matters arising under _Sections 2.2(c)_ , _2.3_ and _2.4(a)_ (the "
_Article 2 Provisions_ "), as though made separately by each Key Participant
and may rely on notices provided to Seller as a notice provided to each Key
Participant. In addition, each Key Participant agrees to hold Buyer and its
Affiliates harmless and not to make a claim against Buyer or any of its
Affiliates with respect to or in connection with Buyers reliance on Seller
pursuant to this _Section 2.7_. The Key Participants irrevocably constitute
and appoint Seller as the true and lawful agent and attorney-in-fact of the
Key Participants with full powers of substitution to act in the name, place
and stead of the Key Participants with respect to the Article 2 Provisions,
and to do or refrain from doing all such further acts and things, and to
execute all such documents, as Seller shall deem necessary or appropriate
in connection therewith. Such appointment shall be deemed coupled with an
interest and shall be irrevocable, and any third party may conclusively and
absolutely rely, without inquiry, upon any action of Seller as the action of
each Key Participant in all matters referred to in the Article 2 Provisions.
Notices or communications to or from Seller for purposes of the Article 2
Provisions shall constitute notice to or from each Key Participant. Seller
shall not be liable to the Key Participants for any act done or omitted
permitted hereunder while acting in good faith and without gross negligence,
and any act done or omitted pursuant to the advice of counsel shall be
conclusive evidence of satisfaction of such standard of care. The
Key Participants shall individually and ratably (in accordance with their Key
Participant Pro Rata Shares) indemnify Seller and hold him harmless against
any loss, liability or expense incurred without gross negligence or bad faith
on the part of Seller and arising out of or in connection with the acceptance
or administration of his duties hereunder. A decision, act, consent or
instruction of Seller under the Article 2 Provisions shall constitute a
decision of all Key Participants and shall be final, binding and conclusive
upon each Key Participant. The Company and Buyer each may rely upon any
decision, act, consent or instruction of Seller in connection with the Article
2 Provisions, the Adjustment Defense Fund, as applicable, as being the
decision, act, consent or instruction of each and every Key Participant.

paid in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice).

Buyer or its representatives; and

 

(iii) the Company shall cause officers of the Company to furnish Buyer and its
authorized representatives with such financial and operating data and other

the Company and Seller may supplement or amend and deliver updates to the

warranties qualified by such Disclosure Schedules not untrue.
The representations and warranties contained in _Article 5_ shall be
construed, for purposes of _Section 10.1_, to be based on the Disclosure
Schedules as so updated; provided that Buyer shall have the right to terminate
this Agreement as a result of any such update to the Disclosure Schedules to
the extent provided in _Section 11.1(d)_. For the avoidance of doubt, Buyer
shall not be permitted to terminate this Agreement and Seller, the Key

directly or indirectly, through any officer, director, manager, representative
or agent of any of them or otherwise, initiate, solicit, entertain, accept or
enter into negotiations or discussions of any type, directly or indirectly, or
enter into a confidentiality agreement, letter of intent, purchase agreement,
merger agreement or other similar agreement with any Person other than Buyer
or UK Buyer with respect to a sale of all or any substantial portion of the
assets of the Acquired Companies, or a merger, consolidation, business
combination, sale of all or any substantial portion of the Shares, or the
liquidation or similar extraordinary transaction with respect to the Acquired
Companies. In addition, each of Buyer, Seller and the Company (on behalf of
itself and the Acquired Companies) agree during the Exclusivity Period to
cease any direct or indirect efforts to acquire any interest in any company
providing eDiscovery services or solutions (other than, in the case of Buyer,
the Acquired Companies).

8.7 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) For a period commencing upon the Closing Date and continuing for a
reasonable period of time thereafter, Buyer shall use Reasonable Efforts to
provide or cause the

 



56  Company to provide as of the Closing Date base salary or base wages, as
applicable, employee benefits and annual bonus opportunities (the "
_Continuing Benefits_ ") that are, in the aggregate, at least substantially
comparable to the Acquired Employees compensation and benefits as of the
Closing Date, other than benefits under the Participation Plan; provided that
such obligation shall not apply to any Acquired Employees who voluntarily
transfer to another position of employment with Buyer or an Affiliate after
the Closing Date or who voluntarily elect a reduced work schedule if, as a
result of such change in status, the Acquired Employees base salary will be
modified or the Acquired Employee does not meet the eligibility requirements
under which such Continuing Benefits are provided. Buyer shall use Reasonable
Efforts to cause all service with an Acquired Company or any ERISA Affiliate
of the Company prior to the Closing Date by any Acquired Employee to be
treated as if it were service with the Buyer or any of the Buyers Affiliates
for purposes of determining severance benefits (which severance benefits
(whether provided by an Acquired Company, Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer)
shall be substantially comparable to those currently provided by the
applicable Acquired Company to such Acquired Employees, which are set forth in
_Schedule 8.7(a)_ ) and for purposes of eligibility and vesting (and accrual
of benefits with respect to vacation and sick time, but not benefits accrual
with respect to any qualified Benefit Plan sponsored by the Buyer or its
Affiliates) to the same extent such service was recognized under a similar
Company Benefit Plan or any ERISA Affiliate of the Company as of the Closing
Date. Buyer shall take all commercially reasonable steps to recognize for
purposes of any health and welfare plans provided by Buyer, its Affiliates, or
the Company to Acquired Employees following the Closing Date any copayments
and deductibles paid by any Acquired Employee or dependent of such Acquired
Employee under any Company Benefit Plan of the Acquired Companies with respect
to health care expenses incurred prior to the Closing Date, and shall not
exclude any preexisting conditions of any such Acquired Employee or dependents
that were not excluded under the Company Benefit Plans immediately prior to
the Closing Date.

 

(b) Buyer shall cause the Company to (i) satisfy all obligations consistent
with each Acquired Companys existing policies to reemploy or reinstate any
individual who is on a leave of absence, paid or unpaid (including but not
limited to a disability leave, a leave due to an injury or illness subject to
workers compensation, military leave or a leave under the Family and Medical
Leave Act) or is otherwise absent from active employment for any other reason
on the Closing Date and whose most recent employment prior to the Closing Date
was as an employee of an Acquired Company; and (ii) continue the payments to
any such individual who is receiving short term disability pay on the day
before the Closing Date under any Company Benefit Plan of an Acquired Company
in accordance with the applicable Acquired Companys short term disability
plan or policy until the date that such payments would otherwise terminate
under said short term disability plan or policy.

(c) The Company shall be solely and exclusively responsible and liable for
providing continuation coverage mandated by COBRA under a group health care
plan for any current or former employee of an Acquired Company or an ERISA
Affiliate of the Company, or any qualified beneficiary thereof, within the
meaning of Code Section 4980B(g)(1), who is, at any time, (i) entitled to such
continuation coverage as a result of a qualifying event (as defined in Section
4980B of the Code) that occurred before, occurs in connection with, or occurs
following the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; or (ii) receiving
continuation coverage under a health care plan sponsored by an Acquired
Company.

 



57 (d) No provision in this _Section 8.7_ is intended nor shall be construed to,
except as otherwise required by Law, (i) create any third-party beneficiary
rights in any person or organization, including employees or former employees
of an Acquired Company, representatives of such employees or former employees,
or trustees, administrators, participants, or beneficiaries of Company
Benefit Plans with respect to any compensation or benefits that may be
provided, directly or indirectly, under any employee benefit plan, program, or
arrangement, including the Company Benefit Plans or any Benefit Plan
sponsored by Buyer or its Affiliates, (ii) be deemed to amend, modify, or
establish any Benefit Plan that is currently or may in the future be
sponsored, maintained, or contributed to by the Buyer or its Affiliates,
(iii) prevent Buyer from modifying, amending or terminating any Benefit Plans,
or (iv) create a right in any Person to employment with Buyer or any Acquired
Company, it being understood that the employment of each Acquired Employee
shall be "at will" employment.

8.8 _Officer and Director Indemnification and Exculpation_.

 

(a) For a period of six (6) years from and after the Closing Date, Buyer shall
and shall cause the Company (or its successor or successors, as the case may
be), jointly and severally, to indemnify, defend and hold harmless to the
fullest extent permitted under applicable Law each present and former officer
or director (in each case, other than Seller) of each Acquired Company (but
solely in such capacities), determined as of the Closing Date (the " _Covered
Indemnitees_"), against any costs and expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages (including, but
not limited to, punitive, aggravated or exemplary) or liabilities
(collectively, " _Covered Costs_") incurred in connection with any claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative (other than in connection with any claims for
indemnification hereunder) (" _Covered Claims_") arising out of or pertaining
to matters existing or occurring prior to or at the Closing Date, whether
asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Closing Date, and Buyer shall,
and shall cause its Affiliates to, advance expenses relating thereto as
incurred to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law.

 

(b) Seller shall cause the Company to purchase a tail policy with respect to
the Companys existing directors and officers insurance policies, effective
for a period of six (6) years from and after the Closing Date, with coverage
in amount and scope at least as comprehensive as the Companys existing
directors and officers insurance policies.

 

(c) Buyer (or at Buyers election, the Company) shall be entitled to assume
and control the defense of any Covered Claim with counsel reasonably
acceptable to the Covered Indemnitee (subject to any required consent and/or
reservation of rights of an insurer under a policy referred to in _Section
8.8(b)_); _provided_ that if: (i) Buyer (or at Buyers election, the Company)
has not assumed the defense of a Covered Claim within sixty (60) days
following receipt of notice thereof; (ii) Buyer, the Company or an Affiliate
of Buyer is also a party to the Covered Claim and the Covered Indemnitee
determines in good faith after consultation with legal counsel that joint
representation would be inappropriate due to a conflict of interest; or (iii)
the indemnifying party fails to provide reasonable assurance to the
Covered Indemnitee of its financial capacity to defend such Covered Claim and
provide indemnification with respect to such Covered Claim in accordance with
this _Section 8.8(c)_, the Covered Indemnitee may assume and control such
Covered Claim. The Covered Indemnitee involved in any such Covered Claim

 



58  shall be, subject to the clearance of any conflicts, permitted to retain and
employ such separate legal counsel as he or it elects, provided that such
Covered Indemnitee shall bear the reasonable cost (subject to applicable
advance or reimbursement as provided above) of such counsel with respect to
Covered Claims the defense of which has been assumed by Buyer (or at Buyers
election, the Company) as set forth above; _provided_ that if Buyer has not
so elected to assume and control such defense, Buyer shall bear such
reasonable cost. If Buyer has assumed the Covered Claim, the Covered
Indemnitee shall have the right to participate in defense of Covered Claims at
his or her sole cost and expense.

(d) This _Section 8.8_ is intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by, the Covered Indemnitees, their heirs and personal
representatives, and shall be binding on Buyer and its successors and assigns,
jointly and severally. If Buyer or the Company proposes to consolidate with or
merge into any other corporation or entity and would not be the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger, then, prior
to consummating such transaction, provisions reasonably satisfactory to Seller
and Buyer may be made so that the successors and assigns of Buyer or the
Company, as the case may be, shall assume in connection with such transaction
all of the obligations set forth in this _Section 8.8_. If Buyer or the
Company proposes to transfer all or substantially all of its properties and
assets or outstanding voting securities to any individual, corporation or
other entity, then both (i) Buyer and the Company, as the transferor, jointly
and severally shall remain primarily liable for such Partys obligations under
this  _Section 8.8_; and (ii) prior to consummating such transaction,
provisions reasonably satisfactory to Seller and Buyer shall be made so that
the transferee or transferees of Buyer or the Companys properties and assets
or outstanding voting securities, as the case may be, shall also assume in
connection with such transaction liability for all of the obligations of the
transferor set forth in this _Section 8.8_.

 

8.9 _Release of Guaranties_. With respect to each guaranty, letter of credit,
indemnity, performance or surety bond or similar credit support arrangement
issued by or for the account of Seller or any Seller Affiliates in relation to
the business of any Acquired Company (or otherwise related to any Acquired
Company) shown on _Schedule 8.9_ (collectively, the " _Support
Obligations_"), Buyer shall make Reasonable Efforts to (a) obtain, prior to
the Closing, substitute credit support arrangements in replacement for the
Support Obligations, and (b) cause Seller and the Seller Affiliates, and,
where applicable, their sureties or letter of credit issuers, to be fully and
unconditionally released from their respective obligations under the Support
Obligations, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Seller.

8.10 _Dividends_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, except for
the matters described in  _Section 8.11_, no Acquired Company shall (and
Seller and the Company will not permit any Acquired Company to), at any time
at or prior to the Closing, pay as dividends, distributions or otherwise any
Cash held by any Acquired Company to Seller, or any Key Participant (except
for such Key Participants ordinary compensation, benefits and reimbursement
of expenses, in each case, paid in the ordinary course of business consistent
with past practice); provided that the European Subsidiary Purchase Price
shall be included in the calculation of the Purchase Price paid at the Closing
as set forth in _Article 2_.

 



59 8.11 _Excluded Assets_.

 

(a) The transactions contemplated by this Agreement exclude, and prior to the
Closing Date, the applicable Acquired Company will transfer to Seller or any
designated Seller Affiliate (as directed by Seller), the assets listed or
described on _Schedule 8.11(a)_ (the " _Excluded Assets_").

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary provided elsewhere in this
Agreement, none of the Companys representations and warranties shall apply
to any of the Excluded Assets.

(c) Buyer acknowledges that the Acquired Companies and Seller, between the
Effective Date and the Closing Date, may be taking various actions required
to transfer and assign the Excluded Assets from the applicable Acquired
Company to Seller or a Seller Affiliate. After the Closing and upon reasonable
request from time to time from Seller or any Seller Affiliates, and at no
cost to Buyer or any Acquired Company, Buyer shall (and shall cause the
Company to) use Reasonable Efforts to cooperate with and reasonably assist
Seller or any Seller Affiliates in effecting all required assignments,
conveyances and other agreements required to transfer and assign the Excluded
Assets to Seller or any designated Seller Affiliate

 

(d) The Company or Seller shall, prior to any transfer of the Excluded Assets
to Seller or any Seller Affiliate, use Reasonable Efforts to destroy or
render unreadable and unrecoverable (or cause to be returned, destroyed or
rendered unreadable and unrecoverable), all originals and copies (including
backup and archived copies) of all (i) customer information belonging to
the Acquired Companies, (ii) confidential information with respect to the
employees of the Acquired Companies, (iii) financial information with respect
to the Acquired Companies and (iv) Company Owned IP, in each case as contained
in any such Excluded Assets. Any destruction of such materials shall employ a
secure wipe process to irretrievably remove such materials from storage.

 

8.12 _Stockholder Consent to Parachute Payments_. As promptly as practicable
after the execution of this Agreement, the Company shall submit to Seller (in
a manner reasonably satisfactory to Buyer), for approval by Seller (who shall
certify that he holds the number of shares of Company capital stock required
by the terms of Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code), a written consent in
favor of a single proposal to render the parachute payment provisions of
Section 280G inapplicable to any and all Section 280G Payments. Any such
approval shall be sought by the Company in a manner which satisfies all
applicable requirements of Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and the Treasury
Regulations thereunder, including Q-7 of Section 1.280G-1 of such Treasury
Regulations. The Company agrees that, in the absence of such approval, no
Section 280G Payments shall be made. The form and substance of all approval
documents contemplated by this _Section 8.12_, shall be subject to the prior
review and reasonable approval of Buyer.

 

8.13 _Financial Statements_. Seller agrees to reasonably cooperate with the
Certified Public Accountants to timely provide an audited consolidated
balance sheet, statement of income, statement of stockholders equity and
statement of cash flows for the Acquired Companies (as applicable) (i) as of

Audited Financials_ ") and (ii) as of the end of, and for the period beginning
January 1, 2015 and ending on the Closing Date (the " _Audited Stub
Financials_ "), in each case,

 



60  to be delivered simultaneously to Seller and Buyer no later than ninety (90)
days following the Closing Date. Seller, Buyer and the Company agree to enter
into an engagement letter with the Certified Public Accountants prior to the
Closing Date with respect to the preparation and delivery of the Audited Stub
Financials, which engagement shall be conditioned on the occurrence of the
Closing. Buyer shall pay (or shall reimburse Seller or the Company, as
applicable, for) all fees, expenses and costs of the Certified Public
Accountants incurred in the preparation and delivery of the Audited Stub
Financials.

 

8.14 ___Non-Competition; Non-Solicitation; Non-Disparagement_ __.

 

(a) Seller agrees that during the period beginning on the Closing Date and
ending on the fifth (5th) anniversary of the Closing Date (the " _Restricted
Period_ "), Seller will not, and will not permit his Affiliates to, directly
or indirectly:

 

(i) engage, directly or indirectly, in any business anywhere that develops,
produces, licenses, provides or supplies products or services of the kind
developed, produced, licensed, provided or supplied by any of the Acquired

financial or other assistance to, or participate in the ownership, management
or control of, any business engaged in the Restricted Business;

 

 _provided_ , _however_ , that, the foregoing shall not prohibit Seller from
owning as a passive investment two percent (2%) or less of the equity of any
publicly traded entity, as long as Seller has no other connection or
relationship with such entity.

(b) As a separate and independent covenant, Seller agrees that during the
Restricted Period, Seller will not, and will not permit his Affiliates to,
directly or indirectly:

 

(i) interfere with, attempt to interfere with, hire or attempt to hire, any

duration employees), consultants, managers or independent contractors of
Buyer, the Company or their respective Affiliates or induce or attempt to
induce any of them to leave the employ of Buyer, the Company or
their respective Affiliates, or violate the terms of their contracts, or any
employment or consultancy arrangements, with Buyer, the Company or their
respective Affiliates; provided that generalized advertisement of employment
opportunities including in trade or industry publications (if not focused
specifically on or directed in any way to any such individual) and soliciting
(or hiring) any individual whose employment was terminated by Buyer, the
Company or their respective Affiliates (as applicable) shall not be deemed to
cause a breach of this _Section 8.14(b)(i)_;

(ii) call upon, solicit, induce, advise or otherwise do, or attempt to do,
business with any customer or referral source of any Acquired Company or the
Restricted Business with whom Seller or any Acquired Company had any business

Restricted Business; or

(iii) induce any customer or referral source of any Acquired Company or
the Restricted Business to cease or reduce doing business with the Buyer, the
Company, their respective Affiliates or the Restricted Business.

 



61 (c) _Mutual Nondisparagement_.

of Buyer, Parent, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates regarding
Buyer, Parent, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates, in each

(i) made in connection with seeking to enforce any right under this Agreement
or defend against any claim made pursuant to this Agreement, (ii) made during
the course of any Proceeding in which Buyer, Parent, the Company or any of
their respective Affiliates is a party, (iii) with respect to any of Sellers

Governmental Entity as required by applicable Law.

(ii) As a separate and independent covenant, Buyer agrees that, during the
Restricted Period, Buyer will not, and will not permit its Affiliates

partner or potential business partner of Seller or his Affiliates regarding
Seller or his Affiliates, in each case, that are or would be reasonably
perceived to be disparaging or derogatory statements. The foregoing will not
apply to any statement or remark (i) made in connection with seeking to
enforce any right under this Agreement or defend against any claim made
pursuant to this Agreement, (ii) made during the course of any Proceeding

8.15 _Buyer Guaranty_. Parent does hereby fully, absolutely, unconditionally
and irrevocably guaranty the timely performance by (a) Buyer and UK Buyer of
all their respective obligations hereunder (including the timely payment when
due and owing of the payment

 



62  obligations of Buyer and UK Buyer) and under each Ancillary Agreement to
which Buyer or UK Buyer is party and (b) the Acquired Companies of all their
respective obligations hereunder, but only to the extent arising on or after
the Closing (including the timely payment when due and owing of the payment
obligations of the Company hereunder arising on or after the Closing) and
subject to the limitations on the obligations of Buyer, UK Buyer and each
Acquired Company set forth in _Article 13_ (collectively, the " _Buyer
Obligations_ ").

(a) The obligations of Parent in this _Section 8.15_ are primary and not as
surety only, and this guarantee constitutes a guarantee of payment when due
and owing, and not merely of collection. Parent expressly waives any legal
obligations, duty or necessity for Seller to proceed first against Buyer or
UK Buyer, as applicable, or to exhaust any remedy Seller may have against
Buyer or UK Buyer, as applicable. The obligations of Parent hereunder shall
remain in full force and effect until all Buyer Obligations have been
performed in full, without regard to, and shall not be released, discharged or
in any way affected to the extent permitted by applicable Law (whether or not
Parent shall have any knowledge or notice thereof) by: (i) any waiver,
consent, change, extension, or indulgence in respect of any Buyer Obligation;
(ii) any bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, arrangement, readjustment,
composition, liquidation, dissolution or similar proceeding with respect to
Buyer, UK Buyer or Parent; (iii) any assignment or other transfer of this
Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement by Buyer or UK Buyer; (iv) any lien,
charge, restriction or Encumbrance affecting Buyer or UK Buyer; (v) any sale
or other disposition of all or any part of the capital stock or assets of
Buyer or UK Buyer; or (vi) any payment by Buyer or UK Buyer which is recovered
by Buyers or UK Buyers, as applicable, trustee in bankruptcy.
Parent unconditionally waives, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
notice of any of the matters referred to in this _Section 8.15_, all notices
which may be required by statute, rule of law or otherwise to preserve any
rights against Parent hereunder, including, without limitation, any demand,
proof or notice of nonpayment of any sums payable to satisfy any Buyer
Obligation, any right to the enforcement, assertion or exercise of any right,
remedy, power or privilege under or in respect of any of the Buyer
Obligations, any requirement of diligence and any requirement to mitigate the
damages resulting from a breach of or default under this Agreement or the
Ancillary Agreements by Buyer or UK Buyer. All of the Buyer Obligations shall
conclusively be deemed to have been created, contracted or incurred in
reliance upon this guaranty and all dealings between the Parties shall
likewise be conclusively presumed to have been had or consummated in reliance
upon this guaranty.

(b) Parent agrees that Seller may at any time and from time to time, either
before or after the due date therefor, without notice to or further consent
of Parent, extend the time of payment or renew any of the Buyer Obligations,
and may also make any agreement with Buyer or UK Buyer, as applicable, for the
extension, renewal, payment, compromise, discharge or release thereof, in
whole or in part, or for any modification or waiver of the terms thereof or of
any agreement between Seller and Buyer or UK Buyer, as applicable, or any such
other Person, without in any way impairing or affecting the provisions of
this  _Section 8.15_.

(c) Parent agrees to pay on demand all reasonable fees and out-of-pocket
expenses (including the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel to Seller)
incurred in the enforcement of this _Section 8.15_ against Parent.

 



63 (d) This _Section 8.15_ shall remain in full force and effect and be binding
upon Parent and its successors and assigns until payment in full of all of
the Buyer Obligations. If any of the present or future Buyer Obligations are
guaranteed by any Persons in addition to Parent, the death, release or
discharge, in whole or in part, or the bankruptcy, liquidation or dissolution
of one or more of them shall not discharge or affect the liabilities of Parent
under this _Section 8.15_.

 

(e) No failure to exercise and no delay in exercising, on the part of Seller,
any right, remedy, power or privilege provided for in this  _Section 8.15_
shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise by
Seller of any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder preclude any other
or future exercise of any such right, remedy, power or privilege. Each and
every right, remedy, power and privilege granted to Seller under this _Section
8.15_ or allowed to it by applicable Law shall be cumulative and not
exhaustive of any other, and may be exercised by Seller from time to time.

 

8.16 _Efforts to Close_. Between the Effective Date and the Closing, except as
otherwise provided herein, (a) the Company shall use Reasonable Efforts to
cause the conditions in _Article 10_ to be satisfied; and (b) Buyer and UK
Buyer shall use Reasonable Efforts to cause the conditions in _Article 9_ to
be satisfied.

 

8.17 _Mutual Release_.

 

(a) _Seller Release_. Seller hereby agrees that, effective as of the Closing
Date:

 

(i) Seller hereby releases and forever discharges each Acquired Company, and
each of their respective individual, joint or mutual, past, present and

secondary, direct or indirect, and whether or not accrued) arising
contemporaneously with the Closing or before the Closing Date or on account of
or arising out of any matter, cause or event occurring contemporaneously with
the Closing or before the Closing Date, including any rights to
indemnification or reimbursement from any Acquired Company, whether pursuant
to their respective certificates of incorporation or by-laws (or comparable
documents), contract or otherwise and whether or not relating to claims
pending on, or asserted after, the Closing Date (in each case other than any
claims, demands, Proceedings, causes of action, judgments, writs or orders
arising under this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement, and other than any
claims, demands, Proceedings, causes of action, judgments, writs or orders
the release of which would jeopardize or adversely affect the insurance policy
purchased under _Section 8.8(b)_) (collectively, the " _Seller
Released Claims_ ").

 



64 (ii) Seller shall not directly or indirectly, assert any Seller Released
Claim, or commence, institute or voluntarily aid in any way, or directly or
indirectly cause to be commenced or instituted, any proceeding against any
Company Releasee based upon or otherwise arising out of any Seller Released
Claim.

releases and forever discharges Seller from any and all claims, demands,
Proceedings, causes of action, judgments, writs or orders that any Company
Releasor has as of the Closing Date Effective Time, has ever had or may
thereafter have against Seller, and from any and all obligations, contracts,
debts, liabilities and obligations that Seller has as of the Closing
Date, has ever had or may thereafter have in favor of any Company Releasor,
in each case of any nature (whether absolute or contingent, asserted or
unasserted, known or unknown, primary or secondary, direct or indirect, and
whether or not accrued) arising contemporaneously with the Closing or before
the Closing Date or on account of or arising out of any matter, cause or event
occurring contemporaneously with the Closing or before the Closing Date (in
each case other than any claims, demands, Proceedings, causes of action,
judgments, writs or orders arising under this Agreement or any Ancillary
Agreement) (collectively, the " _Company Released Claims_ ").

 

(ii) The Company shall not, and shall cause each other Company Releasor not
to, directly or indirectly, assert any Company Released Claim, or commence,
institute or voluntarily aid in any way, or directly or indirectly cause to be
commenced or instituted, any proceeding against Seller based upon or otherwise
arising out of any Company Released Claim.

contemplated hereby may be abandoned, at any time before the Closing as

non-appealable order of a court of competent jurisdiction restrains, enjoins
or otherwise prohibits or makes illegal the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement;

(b) by Seller or the Company, by written notice to Buyer, if Buyer has: (i)
breached its obligation to make the payments described in _Article 2_ or
_Section 3.3_; or (ii) breached, or UK Buyer has breached, in any material
respect any other representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or obligation
in this Agreement which would cause any of the conditions set forth in
_Article 9_ not to be satisfied, and such breach, in the case of this _clause
(ii)_ , if capable of being cured, has not been cured within 30 days
following receipt of written notification thereof; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that if, at the end of such 30 day period, Buyer or UK Buyer, as applicable,
is endeavoring in good faith, and proceeding diligently, to cure such breach,
Buyer or UK Buyer, as applicable, shall have an additional 20 days in which to
effect such cure; _provided_ that neither Seller nor the Company may terminate

is in material breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements contained herein;

 

(c) by Buyer, by written notice to Seller and the Company, if Seller or the

will be of no further force or effect; _provided_ , _however_ , that _Sections
8.1(b)_, _8.3_ and _11.2_ , and _Article 14_ will survive the termination of
this Agreement and will remain in full force and effect; and (ii) such

terminating Partys reasonable fees and expenses incurred in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or (2) shall result from a
material and willful breach by any Party to this Agreement (it being
understood that the failure to cure a breach shall not, by itself, be a
material and willful breach of this Agreement), then such Party shall be fully
liable for any and all damages sustained or incurred by the other Party.

Seller shall return or destroy, in accordance with the terms of the Non-

ARTICLE 12

 

 _TAX MATTERS_

12.1  _Liability for Taxes_.

(a) (i) Except as set forth in _Section 12.1(a)(ii)_, from and after the
Closing, Seller shall be liable for fifty percent (50%) and the Key
Participants shall be liable for fifty percent (50%) (severally and not
jointly and severally in accordance with their Key Participant Pro Rata
Shares), of any and all Losses incurred in connection with or arising from
Taxes, including any federal, state, local, foreign or other Taxes, imposed on
any Acquired Company, or for which any Acquired Company may otherwise be
liable, for any taxable year or period that ends on or before the Closing
Date and, with respect to any Straddle Tax Period, the portion of such
Straddle Tax Period ending on and including the Closing Date; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that neither Seller nor the Key Participants shall be liable
for (1) any income Tax liability to the extent such income Tax liability has
been included in the computation of any Income Tax Payable or Income Tax
Receivable for purposes of calculating the Participation Plan Amount and the
Purchase Price, (2) any sales Tax liability to the extent that such sales Tax
liability amount is set forth on the Closing Date Pro Forma Balance Sheet as
finally determined

 



69  pursuant to _Section 2.3_, or (3) any liability for any income Taxes
arising with respect to the sale of the European Subsidiary Shares. For the
avoidance of doubt, Taxes imposed on any Acquired Company as a result of, or
that are related to, the transfer or sale of any (A) Excluded Asset pursuant
to _Section 8.11_ or (B) European Subsidiary Shares pursuant to this
Agreement, shall be allocated to a taxable year or period that ends on or
before the Closing Date and to the extent available, net operating losses,
deductions, credits or other items of loss of the Acquired Companies may be
used to offset the Taxes arising with respect to the transfer or sale of the
Excluded Assets or the European Subsidiary Shares.

(ii) From and after the Closing, the Key Participants (in accordance with
their Key Participant Pro Rata Shares), severally but not jointly and
severally, shall be liable for any and all Losses incurred in connection with
or arising from any withholding Tax or similar amount owed with respect to
any payment under the Participation Plan (whether pursuant to _Section 2.4_,
_Section 13.6_ or otherwise) to any Plan Participant that is not being
treated as a current employee, for employment Tax purposes, of an Acquired
Company as of the date of any such payment.

(b) For purposes of paragraph _(a)_ of this _Section 12.1_, whenever it is
necessary to determine the liability for Taxes of any Acquired Company for any
taxable year or period beginning on or before and ending after the Closing
Date (a " _Straddle Tax Period_ "), the determination of the Taxes of the
Acquired Company for the portion of the Straddle Tax Period ending on and
including the Closing Date shall be determined by assuming that the Straddle
Tax Period consisted of two taxable years or periods, one which ended at the
close of the Closing Date and the other which began at the beginning of the
day following the Closing Date and items of income, gain, deduction, loss or
credit of the Acquired Company for the Straddle Tax Period shall be allocated
between such two taxable years or periods on a "closing of the books basis"
by assuming that the books of the Acquired Company were closed at the close of
the Closing Date, provided, however, that exemptions, allowances, deductions
or Taxes that are calculated on an annual basis, such as property Taxes and
depreciation deductions, shall be apportioned between such two taxable years
or periods on a daily basis. For purposes of paragraph _(a)_ of this _Section
12.1_, whenever it is necessary to determine the liability for Taxes of a
United States shareholder (within the meaning of Section 951(b) of the Code)
of a controlled foreign corporation (within the meaning of Section 957 of the
Code) attributable to amounts included in the income of such United States
shareholder under Section 951 of the Code for the taxable year or period of
such controlled foreign corporation that begins on or before and ends after
the Closing Date, the determination of liability for any such Taxes shall be
made by assuming that the taxable year or period of the controlled foreign
corporation consisted of two taxable years or periods, one which ended at the
close of the Closing Date and the other of which began at the beginning of
the day following the Closing Date and relevant items of income, gain,
deduction, loss or credit of the controlled foreign corporation shall be
allocated between such two taxable years or periods on a "closing of the
books basis" by assuming that the books of the controlled foreign corporation
were closed at the close of the Closing Date; provided, however, that Subpart
F income (within the meaning of Section 952 of the Code) of the controlled
foreign corporation shall be determined without regard to Section 952(c) of
the Code.

 



70 12.2 _Tax Returns; Filing Responsibility_.

 

(a) Buyer shall prepare and file or cause to be prepared and filed all Tax
Returns for any Acquired Company that relate to a taxable period that ends
after the Closing Date, including all Tax Returns that relate to a Straddle
Tax Period. All such Tax Returns shall be prepared, and all elections with
respect to such Tax Returns shall be made, in accordance with applicable Law
and in a manner consistent with the prior practice of such Acquired Company
to the extent in compliance with applicable Law. With respect to any Tax
Return to be filed by Buyer pursuant to this paragraph _(a)_ that relates to
any Straddle Tax Period, not less than 30 days prior to the due date for such
Tax Return, taking into account extensions (or, if such due date is within 30
days following the Closing Date, as promptly as practicable following the
Closing Date), Buyer shall (i) provide Seller with a draft copy of such Tax
Return, and (ii) permit Seller to review and comment on each such Tax Return
prior to filing such Tax Return, and (iii) make such revisions to each such
Tax Return as are reasonably requested by Seller.

(b) Seller shall prepare and file or cause to be prepared and filed all Tax
Returns for any Acquired Company that relate solely to taxable periods ending
on or before the Closing Date. All Tax Returns that Seller is required to file
or cause to be filed in accordance with this paragraph _(b)_ shall be
prepared and filed in accordance with applicable Law and in a manner
consistent with past practice of such Acquired Company to the extent in
compliance with applicable Law and, on such Tax Returns, no position shall be
taken, election made or method adopted that is inconsistent with
positions taken, elections made or methods used in preparing and filing
similar Tax Returns in prior periods (including positions, elections or
methods that would have the effect of deferring income to periods ending after
the Closing Date or accelerating deductions to periods ending on or before
the Closing Date). Not less than 30 days prior to the due date for any Tax
Return prepared by Seller pursuant to this paragraph _(b)_ , taking into
account extensions (or, if such due date is within 30 days following the
Closing Date, as promptly as practicable following the Closing Date), Seller
shall (i) provide Buyer with a draft copy of such Tax Return; (ii) permit
Buyer to review and comment on each such Tax Return prior to filing such Tax
Return; (iii) make such revisions to each such Tax Return as are reasonably
requested by Buyer; and (iv) not file any such Tax Return without the written
consent of Buyer, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed
or conditioned. Seller shall pay or cause to be paid fifty percent (50%) of
all Taxes with respect to such Tax Returns, and the Key Participants (in
accordance with their Key Participant Pro Rata Shares), severally but not
jointly, shall pay, or cause to be paid, fifty percent (50%) of all Taxes
with respect to such Tax Returns; _provided_ , _however_ , that neither Seller
nor the Key Participants shall be liable for (i) any income Tax liability to
the extent such income Tax liability has been included in the computation of
any Income Tax Payable or Income Tax Receivable, or (ii) any sales Tax
liability to the extent that such sales Tax liability amount is set forth on
the Closing Date Pro Forma Balance Sheet as finally determined pursuant to
_Section 2.3_.

(c) Seller shall reimburse Buyer for fifty percent (50%), and the
Key Participants (in accordance with their Key Participant Pro Rata Shares),
severally and not jointly, shall reimburse Buyer for fifty percent (50%) of
any Taxes for which Seller and/or the Key Participants are liable pursuant
to  _Section 12.1(a)(i)_, but which are remitted in respect of any Tax
Return to be filed by Buyer pursuant to paragraph (a) of this _Section 12.2_
upon the written request of Buyer setting forth in detail the computation of
the amount owed by Seller and the Key Participants. Each such reimbursement
shall be made at least 10 days prior to the due date for paying such Taxes.

 



71 12.3 _Amended Return_. Except as required by applicable Law, Buyer shall not
amend the Tax Returns of any Acquired Company that relate to any Tax period
or portion thereof ending on or before the Closing Date in a manner that would
increase Seller or any Key Participants Tax liability without the prior
written consent of Seller and/or Participant Representative, as applicable,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

12.4  _Assistance and Cooperation_. After the Closing Date, each of Seller
and Buyer shall (and shall cause their respective Affiliates to):

 

(a) timely sign and deliver such certificates or forms as may be necessary or
appropriate to establish an exemption from (or otherwise reduce), or file Tax
Returns or other reports with respect to, Transfer Taxes;

(b) assist the other party in preparing any Tax Returns which such other
party is responsible for preparing and filing in accordance with _Section
12.2(a)_, and in connection therewith, provide the other party with any
necessary powers of attorney;

 

(c) cooperate fully in preparing for and defending any audits of, or disputes
with taxing authorities regarding, any Tax Returns of any Acquired Company;

(d) retain all books and records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to any
Acquired Company, as applicable, relating to any taxable period beginning
before the Closing Date until the expiration of the statute of limitations
(and any extensions thereof) of the respective taxable periods, and to abide
by all record retention agreements entered into with any Taxing Authority;

(e) make available to the other and to any Taxing Authority as reasonably
requested all information, records and documents relating to Taxes of any
Acquired Company;

(f) furnish the other with copies of all correspondence received from any
Taxing Authority in connection with any Tax audit or information request with
respect to any Taxes or Tax Returns of any Acquired Company; provided, that
Buyer shall only be obligated to furnish copies of such correspondence to
Seller to the extent such audit or information request relates to Taxes for
which Seller may be liable under the terms of this Agreement; and

(g) Notwithstanding any other provision in this _Section 12.4_ and except as
otherwise required by Law, the Buyer shall not and shall cause each Buyer
Affiliate not to, without the prior written consent of the Seller and the
Participant Representative (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), submit any written correspondence or send any other document other
than Tax Returns to a Taxing Authority where any Buyer Affiliate is aware or
could reasonably be expected to be aware that submitting such written
correspondence or sending such document other than Tax Returns will or is
likely to materially increase Sellers or any Key Participants liability for
income or sales Tax pursuant to _Article 12_ , without first affording Seller
and the Participant Representative a reasonable opportunity to comment thereon
and without taking account of any comments received so far as it is reasonable
to do so.

 



72 12.5 _Tax Contests_. Any pending or threatened Tax audits or assessments
relating to any Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be treated as a Third-Party
Claim in accordance with _Section 13.7_.

12.6 _Transfer Taxes_. All Transfer Taxes applicable to the transfer of the
Shares shall be borne twenty-five percent (25%) by Seller, twenty-five percent
(25%) by the Key Participants (in accordance with their Key Participant Pro
Rata Shares), severally but not jointly, and fifty percent (50%) by Buyer.
Each party shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to avail itself of
any available exemptions from any such Taxes or fees, and to cooperate with
the other parties in providing any information and documentation that may be
necessary to obtain such exemptions.

12.7 _Tax Sharing Arrangements and Powers of Attorney_. Any Tax Sharing
Arrangement between any Acquired Company, on the one hand, and any Person, on
the other hand, shall be terminated as to the applicable Acquired Company on
or prior to the Closing, and after the Closing no Acquired Company shall have
any liability thereunder. Any powers of attorney granted by any Acquired
Company prior to the Closing relating to Taxes shall be terminated on or prior
to the Closing and be of no effect following the Closing.

 

12.8 _Tax Refunds_. Neither Seller nor any Key Participant shall be entitled
to any Tax refund received by Buyer or any Acquired Company that is
attributable to any carryback of any taxable loss, including any net operating
loss within the meaning of Code Section 172, for federal, state, local or
foreign Tax purposes, to any Pre-Closing Tax Period.

 

12.9 _Allocations_. Each of the Parties shall be bound by the purchase price
allocations set forth in _Sections 2.1_ and _2.2_  with respect to the Shares
and the European Subsidiary Shares for purposes of determining any Taxes, and
shall prepare and file all Tax Returns to be filed with any Taxing Authority,
make any election in any Tax Return, comport itself in any proceeding before
any Taxing Authority (except as otherwise required by such Taxing Authority)
and act otherwise in a manner consistent with such allocations.

(Tax Matters) and _5.15_ (Benefit Plans), which shall survive the Closing for
the full period of all applicable statutes of limitations (giving effect to
any waiver, mitigation or extension thereof) plus sixty (60) days. For the
avoidance of doubt, the covenants contained in _Article 12_ shall survive the
Closing for the full period of all applicable statutes of limitations (giving
effect to any waiver, mitigation or extension thereof) plus sixty (60) days.

13.3 _Additional Limitations on Liability_.

 

(a) Any Indemnified Party that becomes aware of a Loss for which it seeks
indemnification under this _Article 13_ shall use Reasonable Efforts to
mitigate the Loss including taking any actions reasonably requested by the
Indemnifying Party. Any out-of-pocket costs incurred by an Indemnified Party
in connection with such requested actions, and (to the extent such Losses
are otherwise recoverable hereunder) any other out-of-pocket costs reasonably
incurred by an Indemnified Party in connection with such mitigation, shall
constitute additional Losses subject to indemnification (and the Indemnifying
Party shall reimburse the Indemnified Party promptly with respect thereto or,
to the extent reasonably practicable, directly fund any such out-of-pocket
costs incurred).

 

(b) No Party shall have any liability for any Loss which would not have arisen
but for any alteration or repeal or enactment of any Law after the Closing
Date.

(c) The Losses suffered by any Indemnified Party shall be calculated after
giving effect to any amounts actually received from Third Parties, including
insurance proceeds, in each case net of the reasonable out-of-pocket costs and
expenses associated with such recoveries (it being understood and agreed that
the Indemnified Parties shall use Reasonable Efforts to seek insurance
recoveries in respect of Losses to be indemnified hereunder). If any insurance
proceeds or other recoveries from Third Parties are actually realized (in each
case calculated net of the reasonable out-of-pocket costs and
expenses associated with such recoveries) by an Indemnified Party subsequent
to the receipt by such Indemnified Party of an indemnification payment
hereunder in respect of the claims to which such insurance proceedings 

 



77  or Third Party recoveries relate, the Indemnified Party shall hold such
amounts in trust and appropriate refunds shall be made promptly to the
Indemnifying Party regarding the amount of such indemnification payment.

(d) Buyer and Seller agree to report each indemnification payment made in
respect of a Loss as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for federal income
Tax purposes unless the Indemnified Party determines in good faith that such
reporting position is incorrect.

 

(e) No Indemnified Party shall be entitled to recover under this _Article 13_
or otherwise with respect to, and the term "Losses" shall not include, (i)
consequential or special damages, including those that consist of lost profits
or (ii) punitive or exemplary damages; _provided_ that the foregoing shall not
limit the right of any Indemnified Party to indemnification in accordance
with this Agreement with respect to any component of any claim, settlement,
award or judgment against such party by any Third Party.

 

(f) Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the contrary, the above
limitations in _Sections 13.3(a)_ , _(b)_ ,  _(c)_ and _(e)_ shall not
apply to any Loss indemnified pursuant to _Section 13.1(b)(iii)_ or _Section
13.1(c)(iii)_.

 

13.4 _Accounts Receivable_. If a Buyer Indemnified Party recovers any Losses
from Seller or any Key Participant in connection with a claim arising out of
a breach of _Section 5.14_ related to the collectability of any accounts
receivable, and thereafter (but before the end of the two year anniversary of
the Closing Date) any Buyer Indemnified Party collects any such accounts
receivable for which the underlying claim was made, the Buyer Indemnified
Party shall hold such amounts in trust and appropriate refunds shall be
promptly made to Seller and the Key Participants (as applicable) up to the
amount of the Losses recovered in connection with such claim.

13.5 _Exclusive Remedy_. After the Closing, the indemnification provisions set
forth in this _Article 13_ are and shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of
each Party (including the Seller Indemnified Parties, the Participant
Indemnified Parties, the Buyer Indemnified Parties and the Company) with
respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated herein;
_provided_ , _however_ , this sentence shall not be deemed (a) a waiver by any
Party of its right to seek specific performance or injunctive relief in
accordance with _Section 14.5_ in the case of another Partys failure to
comply with the covenants made by such other Party to be performed after the
Closing or (b) to limit any Partys rights (i) arising from and specific to
any of the Ancillary Agreements, (ii) to assert claims against Parent under
_Section 8.15_, or (iii) to assert a claim of fraud against any other Party
unless such claim is based upon any representations or warranties the reliance
upon which Buyer has disclaimed pursuant to _Section 6.10_.

13.6 _Escrow Release_. Buyer, Seller and Participant Representative each agree
to take promptly all action required under this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement, including, if and as applicable, the execution and delivery of
instructions to the Escrow Agent directing the release of funds held by the
Escrow Agent, to cause the Escrow Agent to release the amounts of the Seller
Escrow Fund and the Participant Escrow Fund, as applicable, in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement. Any amounts to be paid
to the Applicable Plan Participants shall be paid by the Escrow Agent to the
Company, and within five (5)

 



78  Business Days thereafter, the Company shall pay (and Buyer shall cause the
Company to pay) such remainder to the Applicable Plan Participants according
to their respective Applicable Plan Participant Pro Rata Shares, in
accordance with _Section 2.4_.

13.7 _Procedure with Respect to Third-Party Claims_.

 

(a) If any Indemnified Party becomes subject to a pending or threatened claim
of a Third Party and such Indemnified Party (the " _Claiming Party_")
believes it has a claim against any other Party (the " _Responding Party_")
as a result, then the Claiming Party shall promptly notify the Responding
Party in writing of the basis for such claim setting forth the nature of the
claim in reasonable detail. The failure of the Claiming Party to so notify the
Responding Party shall not relieve the Responding Party of liability hereunder
except to the extent that the defense of such claim is prejudiced by the
failure to give such notice.

(b) If any proceeding is brought by a Third Party against a Claiming Party
and the Claiming Party gives notice to the Responding Party pursuant to this
_Section 13.7_, the Responding Party shall be entitled to participate in such
proceeding and, to the extent that it wishes, to assume the defense of such
proceeding (and the Responding Partys assumption of such defense shall
conclusively establish for purposes hereof that such Third Party claim is
within the scope of and subject to indemnification hereunder), if (i)
the Responding Party provides written notice to the Claiming Party that the
Responding Party intends to undertake such defense; (ii) the Responding Party
conducts the defense of the Third Party claim actively and diligently with
counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Claiming Party; and (iii) in the case
where the Responding Party is a party to the proceeding, the Responding Party
or the Claiming Party has not determined in good faith and upon the advice of
outside counsel that joint representation would be inappropriate because of a
conflict in interest; provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing or anything
else to the contrary contained herein, if the Responding Party is Seller and
the Key Participants in respect of a matter subject to indemnification
pursuant to _Section 13.1(b)_, the rights of the Responding Party under this
Section 13.7 shall be exercised by Seller and the Participant Representative
jointly and Buyer may rely on and accept the acts, disclosures and
communications of either Seller or the Participant Representative taken or
made pursuant to this _Article 13_ with respect to a Third Party claim as
though made separately by Seller and each Key Participant and may rely
on notices provided to Seller and the Participant Representative as a notice
provided to Seller and each Key Participant. In addition, each of Seller, the
Participant Representative and each Key Participant agrees to hold Buyer and
its Affiliates harmless and not to make a claim against Buyer or any of its
Affiliates with respect to or in connection with Buyers reliance on either
Seller or the Participant Representative pursuant to this _Section 13.7(b)_.
The Claiming Party, in its sole discretion, shall have the right to engage
separate counsel (who may be selected by the Claiming Party in its sole
discretion, subject to the clearance of any conflicts) in any such action and
to participate in the defense thereof, and the fees and expenses of such
counsel shall be paid by such Claiming Party. The Claiming Party and the
Responding Party shall reasonably cooperate with each other and their
respective counsel in the defense or compromise of such claim. If
the Responding Party assumes the defense of a proceeding, no compromise or
settlement of such claims may be effected by the Responding Party without the
Claiming Partys consent unless (x) there is no finding or admission of any
violation of Law or any violation of the rights of any Person, (y) the sole
relief provided is monetary damages that are paid in full by the Responding

 



79  Party and (z) such compromise or settlement completely, finally and
unconditionally releases the Claiming Party in connection with such claim;
_provided_ , _however_ , that if such proceeding or Third Party claim relates
to Taxes that could affect the Tax liability, Tax reporting position, or any
other Tax obligation of Buyer, any Acquired Company or any other Buyer Group
Person for any Tax period ending after the Closing, then in no event shall
Seller, Participant Representative nor any Affiliate of any such party be
entitled to settle, either administratively, after the commencement of
litigation or otherwise, such claim for Taxes without the prior written
consent of Buyer.

(c) Notwithstanding _Section 13.7(b)_, if: (i) notice is given by the
Claiming Party to the Responding Party of the commencement of any legal
proceeding by a Third Party and no Responding Party gives notice, within 30
days after the Claiming Partys notice is received, to the Claiming Party of
its election to assume the defense of such legal proceeding; (ii) any of the
conditions set forth in clauses (i) through (iii) of _Section 13.7(b)_ are or
become unsatisfied; or (iii) a legal proceeding by a Third Party seeks
specific performance that will adversely affect the Claiming Party or
involves criminal allegations, then the Claiming Party shall (upon notice to
the Responding Party) have the right to undertake the defense, compromise or
settlement of such claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Responding Party
shall reimburse the Claiming Party for the costs of defending, compromising or
settling such Third Party claim (including reasonable attorneys fees and
expenses) and shall remain otherwise responsible for any liability
with respect to amounts arising from or related to such Third Party claim, to
the extent it is ultimately determined that such Responding Party is liable
with respect to such Third Party claim for a breach under this Agreement and
subject to the limitations of liability otherwise set forth herein. The
Responding Party may elect to participate in such legal proceedings,
negotiations or defense at any time at its own expense.

14.2 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, together with the Disclosure
Schedules and the Ancillary Agreements, constitutes the entire agreement
among the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all
prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the Parties
with respect to the subject matter hereof. There are no restrictions,
promises, representations, warranties, covenants or undertakings among the
Parties, other than those expressly set forth or referred to herein or
therein.

 



81 14.3 _Binding Effect; Assignment; No Third Party Benefit_. This Agreement
shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties and their
successors and permitted assigns. Neither this Agreement nor any of the
rights, interests, or obligations hereunder may be assigned by any Party
without the prior written consent of the other Parties hereto; _provided_
that each of Buyer and UK Buyer may assign any of its respective rights
hereunder, without the prior written consent of any other Party, (a) to any of
its Affiliates and (b) by way of security and such secured party may assign
such rights by way of exercise of remedies; _provided_ , _however_ , that no
assignment shall limit or affect the assignors obligations hereunder. Except
as otherwise provided herein (including  _Sections 8.8_, _8.17_ and _13.1_
), nothing in this Agreement is intended to or shall confer upon any Person
other than the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns,
any rights, benefits, or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason
of this Agreement.

14.4 _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction of
this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other
Governmental Entity to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the
terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall remain
in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or
invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions
contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any
Party. Upon such a determination, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith
to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as
closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions
contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest
extent possible.

14.5 _Specific Performance and Other Remedies_. Each Party hereby acknowledges
that the rights of each other Party to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby are special, unique and of extraordinary character and
that, if any Party violates or fails or refuses to perform any covenant or
agreement made by him or it herein, the non-breaching Parties may be without
an adequate remedy at law. If any Party violates or fails or refuses to
perform any covenant or agreement made by such Party herein, the non-
breaching Parties may, subject to the terms hereof and in addition to any
remedy at law for damages or other relief, institute and prosecute an action
in any court of competent jurisdiction to enforce specific performance of
such covenant or agreement or seek any other equitable relief. The Parties
hereby agree not to raise any objections to the availability of the equitable
remedy of specific performance to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened
breaches of this Agreement by the other Parties and to specifically enforce
the terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened
breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and obligations of
such other Party.

14.6 _Amendment_. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in
writing signed by Buyer, the Company, Seller and the Participant
Representative.

14.7 _Waiver_. Any term or condition of this Agreement may be waived at any
time by the Party that is entitled to the benefit thereof, but no such waiver
shall be effective unless set forth in a written instrument duly executed by
or on behalf of the Party waiving such term or condition. No waiver by any
Party of any term or condition of this Agreement, in any one or

 



82  more instances, shall be deemed to be or construed as a waiver of the same
or any other term or condition of this Agreement on any future occasion. All
remedies, either under this Agreement or by Law or otherwise afforded, will
be cumulative and not alternative.

14.8 _Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction; WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_.

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by and construed and enforced in
accordance with the internal Laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to
its conflict of laws rules or principles.

(b) The Parties hereby irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of
any state or federal court sitting in or for Kansas City, Missouri with
respect to any dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any of
the transactions contemplated hereby, and each Party irrevocably agrees that
all claims in respect of such dispute or proceeding shall be heard and
determined exclusively in such courts. The Parties hereby irrevocably waive,
to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection which they may now or
hereafter have to the venue of any dispute arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby brought in such court
or any defense of inconvenient forum for the maintenance of such dispute. Each
Party agrees that a judgment in any such dispute may be enforced in other
jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law.

(C) THE PARTIES HEREBY KNOWINGLY, VOLUNTARILY, IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVE, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY
RIGHT THAT THEY MAY HAVE TO TRIAL BY JURY OF ANY CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION, OR
IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY BASED UPON OR ARISING OUT OF
THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR
ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH
OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE
FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO
HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT AND THE ANCILLARY AGREEMENTS,
AS APPLICABLE, BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS
IN THIS  _SECTION 14.8(c)_.

14.9 _Further Assurances_. From time to time following the Closing, at the
request of any Party and without further consideration, the other Parties
shall execute and deliver to such requesting Party such instruments and
documents and take such other action (but without incurring any material
financial obligation) as such requesting Party may reasonably request to
consummate more fully and effectively the transactions contemplated hereby.

14.10 _Disclosure Schedules_. The Company has set forth information on the
Disclosure Schedules in a section that corresponds to the section of this
Agreement to which it relates. A matter set forth in one section of the
Disclosure Schedules need not be set forth in any other section of the
Disclosure Schedules so long as its relevance to such other section of the
Disclosure Schedules or section of this Agreement is reasonably apparent on
its face. The Parties acknowledge and agree that (a) the Disclosure
Schedules may include certain items and

 



83  information solely for informational purposes for the convenience of Buyer,
and (b) the disclosure by the Company of any matter in the Disclosure
Schedules shall not be deemed to constitute an acknowledgment by the Company
or Seller that the matter is required to be disclosed by the terms of this
Agreement or that the matter is material.

 

14.11 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed by the Parties in any
number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of
which shall constitute one and the same agreement. Counterpart signature pages
to this Agreement transmitted by facsimile transmission, by electronic mail in
portable document format (" _.pdf_ ") form, or by any other electronic means
intended to preserve the original graphic and pictorial appearance of a
document, will have the same effect as physical delivery of the paper document
bearing an original signature.

 

14.12 _Privilege and Related Matters_. Recognizing that Bryan Cave LLP has
acted as legal counsel to the Company and Seller prior to the Effective Date
and that Bryan Cave LLP intends to act as legal counsel to Seller after the
Closing, each of Buyer and the Company hereby waives, on its own behalf and
agrees to cause its Affiliates to waive, any conflicts that may arise
in connection with Bryan Cave LLP representing Seller, any Seller Affiliates,
the Plan Participants or the Participant Representative after the Closing
concerning the transactions contemplated herein in a manner adverse to Buyer
or its Affiliates, even though Bryan Cave LLP may have represented the
Company in a matter substantially related to a dispute between such parties,
or may be handling ongoing matters for the Company unrelated to the
transactions contemplated herein. In addition, all communications involving
attorney-client confidences between Seller, the Company and their respective
Affiliates, on the one hand, and Bryan Cave LLP, on the other hand, relating
to the negotiation, documentation and consummation of the
transactions contemplated herein (the " _Communications_ ") shall be deemed
to be attorney-client confidences that, following the Closing, belong solely
to Seller (and not Buyer or any Acquired Company). Accordingly, neither Buyer
nor the Company, nor any of their Affiliates, shall have access from and
after the Closing to any Communications or to the files of Bryan Cave LLP
relating to the negotiation, documentation and consummation of the
transactions contemplated herein. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, from and after the Closing, (a) Seller shall be the sole holder of
the attorney-client privilege with respect to the transactions contemplated
herein, and none of the Company or its Affiliates shall be a holder thereof,
(b) to the extent that files of Bryan Cave LLP constitute property of its
client for purposes of the transactions contemplated herein, only Seller shall
hold such property rights, and (c) Bryan Cave LLP shall have no
duty whatsoever to reveal or disclose any Communications or such files to the
Company or any of its Affiliates by reason of any attorney-client relationship
between Bryan Cave LLP and the Company or otherwise. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained in this Agreement, prior to the Closing, Seller
shall be permitted to remove from each Acquired Companys premises or servers
any email, document or other record containing Communications. From and after
the Closing, upon the reasonable request of Seller, Buyer shall cause the
Company to provide to Seller any Communications, specifically identified by
Seller, that was inadvertently not so removed prior to the Closing.

 

14.13 _Attorney Fees_. A Party in breach hereof shall, on demand, indemnify
and hold harmless the other Parties for and against all reasonable out-of-
pocket expenses, including legal fees, incurred by such other Parties by
reason of the enforcement and protection of its rights under this Agreement.
The payment of such expenses is in addition to any other relief to which such
other Parties may be entitled hereunder or otherwise.

 



84 14.14 _Participant Representative_. Each Key Participant agrees that Seller
and Buyer may rely on and accept the acts, disclosures and communications of
the Participant Representative with respect to this Agreement (other than with
respect to the Article 2 Provisions), including with respect to matters
arising under _Article 12_ or matters subject to indemnification pursuant to
_Section 13.1(b)_, as though made separately by each Key Participant and may
rely on notices provided to the Participant Representative as a notice
provided to each Key Participant. In addition, each Key Participant agrees to
hold Seller, Buyer and their respective Affiliates harmless and not to make a
claim against any of the foregoing with respect to or in connection with
Buyers or Sellers reliance, as applicable, on the Participant
Representative pursuant to this _Section 14.14_. Except with respect to _the_
Article 2 Provisions, the Key Participants irrevocably constitute and appoint
the Participant Representative as the true and lawful agent and attorney-in-
fact of the Key Participants with full powers of substitution to act in the
name, place and stead of the Key Participants with respect to performance on
behalf of the Key Participants under the terms and provisions of this
Agreement in connection with the transactions contemplated hereunder, and to
do or refrain from doing all such further acts and things, and to execute all
such documents, as the Participant Representative shall deem necessary or
appropriate in connection with any transaction contemplated hereunder,
including the power to:

(a) Except as provided above, act exclusively for the Key Participants with
respect to all matters referred to in this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement,
including the right to compromise or settle indemnification claims on behalf
of the Key Participants;

 

(b) Comply with orders of courts and awards of arbitrators with respect to any
claims against the Participation Plan or the Key Participants in connection
with this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement;

(c) Authorize payments to any third parties out of the Participant Escrow
Fund or the Participation Liability Defense Fund;

(d) Amend or waive any provision of this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement in
any manner that does not differentiate among the Key Participants;

(e) Employ, obtain and rely upon the advice of legal counsel, accountants
and other professional advisors as the Participant Representative, in his
sole discretion, deems necessary or advisable in the performance of the duties
of the Participant Representative;

 

(f) Incur any expenses, liquidate and withhold assets received on behalf of
the Key Participants prior to their payment to the Key Participants to the
extent of any amount that the Participant Representative deems necessary for
payment of or as a reserve against expenses, and pay such expenses or deposit
the same in an interest-bearing bank account established for such
purpose, which will be available to the Participant Representative solely to
cover expenses of the Participant Representative incurred in connection with
his duties under this Agreement (including in connection with any dispute or
claim with respect to the transactions contemplated herein, and indemnities
to which it is entitled as the Participant Representative);

 



85 (g) Receive and object to all notices, communications and deliveries under
this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement on behalf of the Key Participants; and

(h) Do or refrain from doing any further act or deed on behalf of the
Key Participants that the Participant Representative deems necessary or
appropriate, in the sole discretion of the Participant Representative,
relating to the subject matter hereof as fully and completely as the Key
Participants could do if personally present and acting and as though any
reference to such Key Participants herein was a reference to the Participant
Representative.

The appointment of the Participant Representative shall be deemed coupled
with an interest and shall be irrevocable, and any third party may
conclusively and absolutely rely, without inquiry, upon any action of the
Participant Representative as the action of each Key Participant in all
matters referred to herein (except with respect to the Article 2 Provisions).
In the event the Participant Representative resigns or ceases to function in
such capacity for any reason whatsoever, then the successor Participant
Representative shall be the Key Participant that the Key Participants appoint
by majority vote. No bond shall be required of the Participant Representative,
and the Participant Representative shall receive no compensation for his
services. Notices or communications to or from the Participant Representative
shall constitute notice to or from each Key Participant. The Participant
Representative shall not be liable to the Key Participants for any act done or
omitted hereunder as Participant Representative while acting in good faith
and without gross negligence, and any act done or omitted pursuant to the
advice of counsel shall be conclusive evidence of satisfaction of such
standard of care. The Key Participants shall individually and ratably (in
accordance with their Key Participant Pro Rata Shares) indemnify the
Participant Representative and hold him harmless against any loss, liability
or expense incurred without gross negligence or bad faith on the part of the
Participant Representative and arising out of or in connection with the
acceptance or administration of his duties hereunder. A decision, act, consent
or instruction of the Participant Representative shall constitute a decision
of all Key Participants and shall be final, binding and conclusive upon each
Key Participant (except with respect to the Article 2 Provisions). The
Company, Buyer and Seller each may rely upon any decision, act, consent or
instruction of the Participant Representative in connection with this
Agreement, the Participant Escrow Fund or the Participation Liability Defense
Fund, as applicable, as being the decision, act, consent or instruction of
each and every Key Participant.
